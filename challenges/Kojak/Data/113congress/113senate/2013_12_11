Is that \nvalid?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the bill by \ntitle for the second time.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1797) to provide for the extension of certain \n     unemployment benefits, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object to any further proceedings with \nrespect to this bill at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The bill will be placed on the calendar under rule XIV.\n\n\n                             Senate Agenda\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I congratulate the budget negotiators on \nreaching an agreement last night to roll back the painful and arbitrary \ncuts of sequestration and prevent another dangerous government shutdown \nin the new year. Their bargain also protects Medicare and Social \nSecurity benefits and reduces the deficit. That is a good package.\n  I commend Budget Chairman Murray and her House Republican counterpart \nCongressman Paul Ryan for their diligence and cooperative spirit which \nmade this agreement possible.\n  The process that led to this accord was long and very difficult. The \nRepublican government shutdown--the first in 17 years--took a toll on \nour economy, on American families, and on our reputation around the \nworld. It was also costly for the Federal Government in many different \nways.\n  So when Congress reached a temporary settlement that ended the \nshortsighted shutdown, Democrats were committed to ending the terrible \ncycle of lurching from crisis to crisis. But understand this: When this \nmeasure went to the House of Representatives--it passed here to keep \nopen the government, after 16 days; to stop the government from \ndefaulting on its debt for the first time in history--about 75 percent \nof the Republicans in the House voted to keep the government closed and \nto default on the debt. Think about that. So this agreement is really a \nbreath of fresh air--as we have been committed to setting sound fiscal \npolicy through the regular order of the budget process and not through \nhostage taking or crisis making.\n  In this new agreement neither side got everything it wanted, but that \nis how it used to work around here. That is how it worked. Each side \nwould move forward on what they wanted, and they would recognize--\nsometimes it was soon; sometimes it was not so soon--that the only way \nto work something out was to work together. That is what happened here.\n  So this is, I repeat, a breath of fresh air for the country. But I \nalso hope it is a view of the future. I hope it is a view of the \nfuture. For example, I believe, as many Democrats do, that an extension \nof emergency unemployment insurance should be included in this package. \nI am very disappointed that the bills posted by the House last night do \nnot include that. About 20,000 Nevadans who have been unemployed for \nmore than 6 months--and more than a million people nationwide--will \nlose their earned unemployment benefits at the end of this year unless \nCongress acts.\n\n  I will stand for those Americans who want to get back to work as soon \nas possible but face a market where there is only one job opening for \nevery three unemployed workers. That is why we are going to push here, \nafter the first of the year, for an extension of unemployment insurance \nwhen the Senate convenes after the New Year, as I will also work very \nhard to raise the minimum wage.\n  It was stunning, Mr. President, the reports all over the national \nmedia today--radio, television, all the print media--that the vast \nmajority of Americans believe the minimum wage should be raised to $10 \nan hour. The American people believe that if someone works for 40 \nhours, they should not be on the rating as being poor. They should be \nable to support themselves and their family. But that is not the way it \nis now. We need to raise the minimum wage, and there will be a \nsustained effort to do that when we come back.\n  Democrats, led by Senator Murray, stood for our party's priorities--\nprotecting the middle class and growing the economy--but we were also \nready and willing to compromise with our Republican counterparts. I \nadmire Senator Murray for having proceeded forward along this line.\n  But while both sides made concessions and sacrifices, I repeat, that \nis the nature of negotiation and the point of a conference committee: \nto work together to work out our differences. So to their credit, \nmembers of the conference committee considered every option, no matter \nhow painful to their own political party. They rejected many. They \nrejected most. They were able to come together on enough revenue and \nenough cuts to come up with this pact that they have.\n  Under the leadership of Chairman Murray, the committee crafted a 2-\nyear bargain that charts a course for economic growth, maintains fiscal \nresponsibility, and, perhaps most importantly, averts another \nmanufactured crisis that would undercut the economic progress we have \nmade these last 4 years.\n  So I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle and both sides of the Capitol to pass this agreement.\n  Last night, we also filed--I should not say ``we''--last night, the \nHouse filed a bill to ensure physicians are fairly compensated so \nMedicare patients can continue to see their doctors. It would be a \nshame if Medicare patients did not have the ability to have a doctor. \nBut unless we did this agreement--short term as it is--physicians would \nreceive a 27-percent cut in pay. So again in the new year we are going \nto work very hard to get rid of this so-called doc fix once and for \nall. We need to fix it once and for all.\n  Unfortunately, instead of beginning work on either of these things I \nhave talked about, the two agreements--that is, the fix for doctors for \nMedicare patients, the budget; and the Defense bill, which I have not \ntalked about, which also was posted last night in the House--\nRepublicans are not facing reality. They are not. You are seeing, the \nAmerican people are seeing before their eyes the face of obstruction. \nThat is what is going on right now. We are eating up days of time--\nwasting hours, weeks, and days.\n  We could be voting on all this stuff now, all these nominations that \nare appearing before this body now, and move on to the substantive \nissues. This is why the rules were changed, Mr. President. You can see \nit right now. We are wasting hour after hour doing nothing.\n  The filibuster rule was established to get legislation passed. As it \nrelates to nominations, the same thing applied: to get nominations \nprocessed. Our predecessors in the Senate set some rules saying that if \ncloture is invoked, the parties are entitled to some time to make their \ncase before final passage or final vote on the nomination.\n  So now we have a number of nominations we are processing. To show how \nshallow the Republicans' obstructionism is, they have no objections to\n\n[[Page S8609]]\n\nany of these nominations. Nobody comes and gives these fire-and-\nbrimstone speeches about how bad these people are. Why? Because they \nare not. They have just been stalling and stalling. I repeat, this is \nthe face of obstruction which we have been facing for 5 years during \nthe Obama administration. Is it any wonder that the rule was changed \nthat relates to nominations? We were spending all of our time trying to \nget the President to have a team rather than doing work on substantive \nlegislation.\n  So we will see how late we have to work tonight. Whatever it is, we \nare going to do it. We are going to finish these nominations this week. \nIf it goes into Friday, if it goes into Saturday, that is what we are \ngoing to do. We have to get this done.\n  Christmas is approaching, and I understand that. We all understand \nthat. But this session of Congress does not end at Christmastime. We \nhave work to do. We have to pass this budget. We have to do something \nfor those Medicare patients. We have to do something for the military \nof this country with this Defense agreement that has been reached \nbetween the leaders of those two important committees--Armed Services \nand their counterpart in the House, whatever it is called.\n  So why waste this time? There is no reason to do this. Republicans \nare stalling. For what? To stop these nominations from going forward? \nThey are going to go forward with a simple majority vote. I understand \none of them may not go forward because some Democrats do not like the \nnominee, but that is the way it should be.\n  So we could confirm Nina Pillard right now. No one is saying a single \nword contrary to her being the quality candidate that we have said she \nis. She is nominated to sit on the District of Columbia Appeals Court, \nI repeat, some say the most important court in America; most say second \nonly to the Supreme Court.\n  But instead, Republicans are insisting that we vote on her nomination \nmany hours from now, after they have frittered away 30 hours of the \nSenate's time. There are no objections to her qualifications. The \noutcome of her vote is a foregone conclusion. So when people around \nhere complain that they are not home with their families at \nChristmastime, here is the reason: Republicans' obstruction.\n  It is hard to imagine a more pointless exercise than spending hour \nafter hour waiting for a vote on an outcome we already know. \nRepublicans insist on wasting time simply for the sake of wasting time. \nIs it any wonder, I repeat, that the rule was changed? Here is why. It \nis no wonder Americans overwhelmingly support the changes made to the \nrules last month in order to make the Senate work again.\n  The Republican's partisan sideshow is another example of the kind of \nblatant obstruction that has ground the Senate to a halt. The work of \nthe Senate has come to a standstill over the last 5 years. Members \nshould be aware if Republicans stop squandering the Senate's precious \ntime, rollcall votes are possible at any time this afternoon or this \nevening. It does not have to be like this.\n  With just a little bit of cooperation, we could hold votes in a \ntimely manner so we can move on with the business before us. \nUnfortunately, we can not schedule votes without cooperation; that is \npart of the Senate rules. Cooperation is in short supply at the moment.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the \nfollowing nomination which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Cornelia T. L. Pillard, of the \nDistrict of Columbia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                      Senate Rules and Health Care\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I just listened to the majority leader \ncomplaining about what we are doing this week. He is the one in charge \nof the schedule. He has spent a week here on nonessential nominations, \nnone of which are emergencies, all of which could be handled later. It \nwas his choice to spend the week on nominations that are not \nemergencies as opposed to doing things like passing a DOD authorization \nbill or things like taking up a budget resolution or things like doing \na farm bill. So the majority leader has a choice as to what we are \ngoing to spend time on. He has chosen to spend this week on 10 \nnominations.\n  Yesterday I talked about the left's ``ends justify the means'' quest \nfor power and the lengths to which they are willing to go to satisfy \nit. The Obama administration and its allies have done just about \neverything to get what they want one way or the other, even \nfundamentally altering the contours of our democracy when they could \nnot get their way by playing by the rules.\n  We saw the culmination of that with the majority leader's power grab \nin the Senate last month. The real world consequences of that power \ngrab are most sharply illustrated by the very nominee before us, which \nI believe I heard the majority leader commenting on what a stellar \nnominee this person is.\n  Professor Pillard may be a fine person, but she is not someone who \nshould receive a lifetime position on the second highest court in the \nland. She will be confirmed, however, because of the Democratic \nmajority's power grab a couple of weeks ago. So let's take a look at \nher legal views. They certainly make one thing clear: The nominee \nbefore us is a liberal ideologue; in other words, just the kind of \nperson this administration is looking for to rubberstamp its most \nradical regulatory proposals on the DC Circuit.\n  Let's take the so-called Hosanna-Tabor case. Last year the Supreme \nCourt reinforced a core First Amendment principle when it ruled \nunanimously that churches, rather than the government, could select \ntheir own leaders.\n  Every single justice sided with the church's argument in that case. \nEvery single one. It makes sense. Freedom of religion is a bedrock \nfoundation of our democracy. I think every member of this body would \nsurely agree that the government does not have any business picking a \ngroup's religious leaders for them. But Professor Pillard seemed to \nhave a very different view. Prior to the Court's unanimous decision, \nshe said the notion that ``the Constitution requires deference to \nchurch decisions about who qualifies as a minister'' in the case before \nthe Court seemed ``like a real stretch.''\n  This is the nominee, after the power grab, the Senate is about to \nconfirm, who said that, ``It is a real stretch that a church would be \nable to pick its own leaders.'' This is an astonishing judgment from \nsomebody who is about to end up on what we believe is the second most \nimportant court in the land.\n  But she went on from that. The position of the church in the Hosanna-\nTabor case represented a ``substantial threat to the American rule of \nlaw.'' How do you like that, Mr. President? It is a substantial threat \nto the American rule of law that a church should be able to pick its \nown leaders. A substantial threat to the American rule of law.\n  This was a case decided the other way from Professor Pillard's \nposition, 9 to 0. Talk about radical. Talk about extreme. No wonder \nthey wanted a simple majority to be available to confirm a nominee like \nthis. I mean, even the Court's most liberal justices, as I mentioned, \ndisagreed with Professor Pillard on this one.\n  One of them characterized that kind of position as ``amazing.'' This \nis a member of the Supreme Court in the 9-to-0 decision, characterizing \nProfessor Pillard's view as ``amazing.'' In other words, Professor \nPillard must think that even the furthest left Supreme Court Justice is \nnot far enough left for her. So you get the drift of where she is.\n  We rightly expect justices on our nation's highest courts to evaluate \ncases\n\n[[Page S8610]]\n\nbefore them with a judge's even-handed mindset, not the absolutism of \nan ideologue. But just listen. Listen to the kinds of things Professor \nPillard has said.\n  She has expressed sympathy with the idea that the rights of our \nConstitution--the same Constitution she would be charged with \nupholding--have ``just about run out,'' and that this necessitates a \nshift toward international law--a shift toward international law. \nApparently, she feels the U.S. Constitution is no longer adequate, and \nwe need to rely on foreign law to determine what we do here in this \ncountry.\n  She has said that abortion, essentially without limits, is necessary \nto avoid ``conscription into maternity;'' That even commonsense laws \nmany American men and women support serve to ``enforce incubation.''\n  She has referred to the types of ultrasound images that are now \navailable to so many proud moms and dads to be as ``deceptive images.''\n  Ultrasound is a ``deceptive image,'' according to Professor Pillard, \nperpetrated by the ``anti-choice movement.'' In other words, she \nappears to think that proud moms and dads should not believe their own \neyes when they look at the images science has made increasingly \navailable to us over the past few years.\n\n  It is an understatement to say that these sorts of views are worrying \nfor someone the President wants on one of our Nation's top courts. In \nshort, Professor Pillard does not seem like a person with the mindset \nor the temperament of a judge. She seems like a person with the \nattitude and disposition of a leftwing academic, someone who seems to \ncome to conclusions based on how well they support her own theories.\n  Judges are charged with fairly evaluating the law that is actually \nbefore them, not the law as they wish it to be. So I will be voting \nagainst the Pillard nomination. It is important to keep this in mind as \nwell. Nearly every single Democratic Senator voted to enable the \nmajority leader's power grab last month. Those Senators are responsible \nfor its consequences. That includes the confirmation of Ms. Pillard, \nregardless of how they vote on her nomination.\n  So I would urge Democrats to rethink the kind of nominees brought to \nthe floor moving forward because now they are all yours. You are going \nto own every one of them. A simple majority. You own them. Extremist \nnominees like Professor Pillard are the reason the President and Senate \nDemocrats took the unprecedented step of going nuclear 2 weeks ago. \nThey unilaterally changed more than two centuries of history and \ntradition and violated their own prior statements and commitments so \nnominees like this could rubberstamp the President's most leftwing \nagenda items.\n  This is the playbook. Forget the rules. Forget checks and balances. \nCertainly forget the will of the American people. Do whatever it \ntakes--whatever it takes--to get the President's agenda through. The \nother side of this, of course, is that Democrats are determined to \nchange the subject from ObamaCare--anything to change the subject.\n  We now know that this President engaged in a serial deception in \norder to get his signature health care bill enacted into law. The White \nHouse debated whether to tell the truth or not on whether folks would \nbe able to keep the plans they have. They decided not to tell the \ntruth, a conscious decision to mislead the American people going back \nto 2009.\n  Their view was that the talking point was just too useful. They \nneeded it in order to get what they wanted. So I would probably be \nlooking to change the topic too if I were our friends on the other side \nof the aisle. Change the subject to Senate rules or nominees or \nanything else for that matter.\n  The last thing the majority wants to talk about is ObamaCare, because \nthey own it 100 percent. Not a single Republican in the House or Senate \nvoted for it. Every single Senate Democrat did. The problem is what \nSenate Democrats have done by going nuclear here in the Senate is \nreally no different from what they did on ObamaCare. Once again they \nsaid one thing and did another.\n  The majority leader said publicly and repeatedly he would not break \nthe rules, and then he did. He said he would not break the rules, and \nthen he did. As I said a couple of weeks back, he might as well have \nsaid: If you like your Senate rules, you can keep them.\n  Here we are today. Here we are today ready to watch Senate Democrats \nrubberstamp an extremely liberal nominee to a lifetime position on a \nvote threshold the majority leader, back when he was in the minority \nand supported minority rights in the Senate, said would be disastrous \nfor our democracy.\n  Anything it takes. Anything it takes to get this President's agenda \naround the checks that have been established to restrain power. \nAnything it takes to get around anybody who disagrees with them, \nwhether it is ObamaCare or the judges they expect to defend it. \nAnything it takes, they are willing to do.\n  Let me say again that nobody who supported this rules change can walk \naway from nominees like Professor Pillard or their rulings. They own \nthem.\n  Let's get back to ObamaCare for a few minutes because that is the \nissue the American people are most concerned about now. That is the \nissue the Democrats want to distract us from.\n  The American people should know what the liberal playbook is. The \nleft believes the President's agenda runs straight through the DC \nCircuit Court. That is why they pressured Democrats to change the rules \nof the Senate to pack this court with folks like Professor Pillard.\n  The goal here is actually twofold: First, grease the skids for an \nagenda that can't get through the Congress. Then build a firewall \naround it by packing this court with your ideological allies. That way \nDemocrats can keep telling folks what they think they want to hear \nabout ObamaCare and anything else, but they can also rest assured that \nnobody is going to tamper with it.\n  All of this is in the context in which the national debate over \nObamaCare and its failures should be viewed. None of it should distract \nus from what ObamaCare is doing to our health care system or to the \nmillions of ordinary Americans who have been suffering under its \neffects.\n  Over the past couple of months the American people have been witness \nto one of the most breathtaking indictments of big-government \nliberalism in memory. I am not only talking about the Web site--the \nsubject of late-night comedy--I am talking about the way in which \nObamaCare was forced on the public by an administration and a Democrat-\nled Congress that we now know is willing to do and say anything to pass \nthe law. They are willing to do or say anything.\n  In the Senate we had the ``Cornhusker kickback,'' we had the ``Gator \naid,'' we had the ``Louisiana Purchase,'' and they finally got up to \nthe 60 votes they needed. They had to get every single Democrat, and \nthey got them any way it took. This is coupled with the grossly \nmisleading statement: If you have your policy and you like it, you can \nkeep it. If you have your doctor and you like him or her, you can keep \nthem. The President and his Democratic allies were so determined to \nforce their vision of health care on the public that they assured them \nthey wouldn't lose the plans they had, that they would save money \ninstead of losing it, and that they would be able to keep using the \ndoctors and hospitals they were already using. The stories we are \nhearing now on a near-daily basis range from heartbreaking to comic.\n  Americans are very upset. Finally, the big-government crowd messed \nwith an issue that affects every single American. In my State they have \nshut down the coal industry. That has had a big impact by creating a \ndepression in Central Appalachia. One could argue they can go after the \ncoal industry because it is confined to certain areas of the country. \nBut on health care they are messing with everybody. The one issue every \nsingle American is affected by and cares about is their own health \ncare.\n  The attention-getting stunts the President has engaged in--we can \nhave those until we are blue in the face, but they don't change \nanything. All they do is remind folks of the way Democrats continue to \nset up one set of rules for themselves and another for everybody else. \nThere is one set of rules for us and another set for everybody else.\n\n[[Page S8611]]\n\nWhether it is ObamaCare or the IRS or the NLRB or pushing the button on \nthe nuclear option, it is all basically the same debate: We are going \nto do what we are going to do. We don't care what the rules are; we \nwill break the rules. We will do whatever it takes to get what we want. \nIt is a party that is clearly willing to do and say just about anything \nto get its way.\n  Millions of Americans are hurting because of a law Washington \nDemocrats forced upon them. What do they do about it? They cook up a \nfight over judges on a court that doesn't even have enough work to do. \nThis is a court that they were arguing a few years ago shouldn't have \nany additional members because they had a light workload, and now the \ncourt has an even lighter workload.\n  We know what this is about. As I indicated, I would want to be \ntalking about something else too if I had to defend dogs getting \ninsurance while millions of Americans lost theirs. It isn't going to \nwork. The parallels between the latest move and the original ObamaCare \npush are all too obvious to ignore.\n  The majority leader promised over and over that he wouldn't break the \nrules of the Senate in order to change them. On July 14 he went on \n``Meet the Press'' and said: ``We're not touching judges.'' This was on \nJuly 14 of this year. That echoed the promise he made in January of \nthis year. It sounds very similar to ``If you like your policy, you can \nkeep it.''\n  Then there are the double standards. When the Democrats were in the \nminority, they argued strenuously against changing the rules. And let's \nnot forget about the raw power at play. The American people decided not \nto give Democrats the House or to restore the filibuster-proof majority \nthey had in the Senate in the last two elections--an inconvenient truth \nfor our friends on the other side.\n  They don't own the place anymore. They did in the first 2 years, with \n60 votes in the Senate and a 40-seat majority in the House, but not \nanymore. The American people took a look at that first 2 years and \nissued a national restraining order in November of 2010. Our friends \ndon't want to be deterred by that. They are going to pursue their \nagenda through the courts and through the regulatory schemes the \nadministration propounds. They changed the rules of the game to get \ntheir way. It is pretty clear that if one can write the rules of the \ngame, they ought to be able to win.\n  Earlier this year the senior Senator from New York said Senate \nDemocrats intended to ``fill up the DC Circuit one way or another.'' It \ncouldn't be any more clear than that. We will do it one way or the \nother. We break the rules, change the rules, and do what we want to do. \nThe arrogance of power is on full display by an arrogant majority. It \nis on full display in the Senate.\n  Our colleagues evidently would rather live for the moment and try to \nestablish a storyline that Republicans--I just heard it here from the \nmajority leader--Republicans are intent on obstructing President \nObama's judicial nominees. It is a storyline that is patently \nridiculous. One can keep saying things over and over, but it doesn't \nmake it true. It doesn't make it true to keep saying the wrong thing \nover and over.\n  Here are the facts. Before this current Democratic gambit to ``fill \nup the DC Circuit one way or another,'' as the senior Senator from New \nYork said, the Senate had confirmed 215 judges and rejected 2--some \nprovocation for breaking your word and breaking the rules of the Senate \nin order to change the rules of the Senate. That is a confirmation rate \nof 99 percent. Republicans have been clearly willing to confirm the \nPresident's judicial nominees. And on the DC Circuit, we recently \nconfirmed one of the President's recent nominees by a vote of 97 to 0.\n  The Democratic strategy of distract, distract, distract is getting \nold. It is not working. The American people are not listening to this \nridiculous argument. They are worried about their health care and are \nangry at the people who caused them to lose their policies. In my State \n280,000 people have lost their policies, and on the exchange 26,000 \nhave been able to get private policies. The rest of them are all \nMedicaid recipients.\n  The Democratic playbook of broken promises, double standards and raw \npower--the same playbook that got us ObamaCare--has to end. With the \nhelp of the American people, we will end it in 1 year. Meanwhile, \nRepublicans are going to keep pushing to get back on the drawing board \non health care--to replace ObamaCare with real reforms that help rather \nthan punish the middle class.\n  At this point I am going to refer to some constituent letters I have \nreceived related to ObamaCare that the Senate would find noteworthy.\n  This is a letter from a constituent in Bowling Green:\n\n       I am a 35-year-old college graduate and represent many \n     hardworking middle-class Kentuckians who are being directly \n     impacted by . . . ObamaCare. I am a married father of 2 young \n     children. We are, by most accounts, an average American \n     family. Before [ObamaCare] was passed, my family was insured \n     through a health insurance policy purchased on the open \n     market. We shopped several different policies and chose the \n     one that was the best fit for our needs.\n       Recently, we received a notice from our insurer that our \n     plan didn't meet the requirements of the [new health care \n     law]. According to the letter, we were required by law to be \n     transitioned into a plan that did meet these new \n     requirements. Also included in the letter was our new \n     premium. That is what shocked us. According to the letter, \n     our premiums would be increasing by 124%, more than double \n     what we had budgeted for this expense.\n       According to a speech by the Vice President on September \n     27th [of this year], a family of four earning $50,000 a year \n     could get coverage for as little as $106 a month. Should I \n     have to pay 8 times that amount because my wife and I both \n     work hard to provide for our family and earn more than the \n     Vice President's limit of $50,000 a year? Why should the \n     price of a product be based on my ability to pay?\n\n  That is a very good question: ``Why should the price of a product be \nbased on my ability to pay?''\n  He continues:\n\n       Would that work at the gas station? Should the price of a \n     gallon of gas be decided by my income tax return? Or at the \n     grocery store? Should the price of a gallon of milk be \n     determined by my income tax return? Or in shopping for a \n     home loan? Should the interest rate on my mortgage be \n     higher if I earn more than $50,000 a year? This predatory \n     pricing structure runs contrary to the basic American \n     foundational principles of Free Enterprise and is illegal \n     in every other marketplace. It should be illegal in health \n     care too.\n\n  Larry Thompson from Lexington:\n\n       My health plan that I have had for 10 years just got \n     canceled, and the least expensive plan on the exchange is a \n     246 percent increase--that means hundreds of extra dollars \n     per month we don't have. Obama lied and made a promise he \n     couldn't keep when he said repeatedly if we wanted to keep \n     our current health care policy we could.\n\n  That is what Mr. Thompson from Lexington said. And he continues:\n\n       He has really affected our lives for the worse--much worse. \n     I'm so mad. We must stop insurance companies from canceling \n     policies--now.\n\n  And of course the reason they are having to cancel policies is \nbecause the law makes them.\n  Sherry Harris from Nicholasville in my State:\n\n       Did you know the Lake Cumberland Hospital in Somerset is \n     not on the Anthem network? Which means anybody in Pulaski and \n     surrounding counties that qualify for a subsidy and want to \n     use it will have to drive to London, Corbin or Lexington to \n     get care?\n\n  Harriet White from Rockfield, which is in Warren County, near Bolling \nGreen:\n\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I am deeply upset because of the \n     effect this health care act has had on our family's health \n     insurance. It has negatively impacted our finances and our \n     quality of care. The President promised that if you had \n     health care, you would not be impacted. The sad truth is \n     that, like my coworkers, my deductible has doubled, along \n     with my premiums. The only way to be able to adjust is for us \n     to either reduce or stop our 401(k) contributions. This is \n     hardly affordable health care. I don't understand why such a \n     blatant lie has been allowed to go this far. Do we not as \n     American citizens have the right to choose basic services? I \n     don't think the government should make choices for the people \n     that impact us in such a negative way. Thank you for your \n     time, and please keep fighting this gross abuse of power.\n\n  Aaron McLemore from Louisville:\n\n       Seeing as I'm a single male (31, policy being cancelled) \n     with no kids or dependents, and I'm paying for pediatric \n     dental care and maternity care, it doesn't make a whole lot \n     of sense to me.\n\n  This is a single male, age 31, having to pay for pediatric dental \ncare and maternity care, and he says it ``doesn't make a whole lot of \nsense to me.'' He makes more than $100,000 a year and doesn't qualify \nfor a subsidy on the\n\n[[Page S8612]]\n\nObama exchange. So the current policy of this 31-year-old is being \ncanceled. A new policy from the exchange will more than double his \nmonthly premium and nearly double his yearly out-of-pocket maximum. His \nhigher costs aren't subsidizing lower income policyholders whose \nsubsidies have already been paid by the government, but he is providing \na subsidy in another way: The new act requires him to buy a policy with \nfeatures he doesn't need.\n  What ObamaCare is doing is moving McLemore out of the individual \nmarket, where people are sorted by age and health history and scope of \ncoverage, to a market more like the traditional employer-based group \npolicy in which young and old workers get the same coverage and pay the \nsame premium.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Spears from Louisville:\n\n       I think you should know what is going on here in Kentucky \n     with Kynect--\n\n  That is the Kentucky Web site--\n\n       I had to sign my wife up since our governor canceled all of \n     the KyAccess policies effective January 1, 2014. I signed up \n     through the benefits firm, advising them that I wanted no \n     subsidies since we have always paid our way in 42 years of \n     marriage. He told me the full pay option of $517 per month \n     and advised no income verification was necessary since no \n     subsidies were involved. So I chose the Kentucky Co Op plan, \n     as I felt the monies would stay in Kentucky with this plan.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       And then I received four mailings from Kynect. One stating \n     she was declined coverage unless I sent income verifications; \n     also one stating I have to fill out a voter registration and \n     return as they have no information on my voting record.\n\n  So what does whether you are registered to vote have to do with \nsigning up for ObamaCare?\n  The letter continues:\n\n       I called Kynect today and advised them I am receiving no \n     subsidies and do not feel I should be required to send this \n     information to them. And if they wanted this information, I \n     file taxes every year and would be easily accessed. In \n     regards to voter registration, I advised this has nothing to \n     do with health registration, and I strongly objected to the \n     language linking the two in the letter. Any clear thinking \n     person would be upset at our State government trying to bring \n     voter registration into this mess, not to mention personal \n     information they should not need since no subsidies are \n     involved.\n\n  These stories go on and on.\n  Lana Lynch from Brandenburg:\n\n       My out-of-pocket expenses for my family of five went from \n     $1,500 a year to $7,000 a year. The best policy that is \n     available by my employer has a $7,000 out-of-pocket a year \n     [provision].\n\n  And she works for a very large health care provider.\n  Jeannine Gentry from Ekron:\n\n       We are covered under my husband's policy through his \n     employer. We have not found out exactly how much the premium \n     is going to rise but have been told to expect between 150 to \n     300 percent increase per paycheck. We do know for certain \n     that our deductible will rise from $5,000 annually to $8,500.\n\n  Ann Knauer from Sheperdsville:\n\n       I received my insurance papers from United Healthcare and \n     found that my premiums had risen from $214 to $480 a month. I \n     only get $1,181 in Social Security a month. That's after my \n     Medicare payment. So I went online to see if I could get my \n     husband signed up for this ACA insurance. I filled out the \n     information, but was told that what I stated for our income \n     was incorrect and that I needed to send in proof of my \n     income. Then they insisted we fill out this form about voter \n     registration. We are already registered to vote and felt this \n     was completely unnecessary. The form did have a spot that \n     stated that we were already registered, but I just don't \n     trust the Web site, so we declined. We got forms in the mail \n     anyway. I'm just going to stick with my old insurance and pay \n     the higher premiums because I know what it covers. I have \n     Medicare and United Healthcare. I have kept this insurance \n     because of my husband, who is also retired but not covered \n     under any other insurance. My insurance came from my job that \n     I had before I retired, as part of the retirement package.\n\n  Mike Conn from Prestonsburg. And I might say that Prestonsburg is in \neastern Kentucky, in the heart of Appalachia, which is also suffering a \ndepression as a result of this administration's war on coal. So this \nperson who corresponded with me is also living in the middle of a \ndepression-riddled part of my State also created by the Obama \nadministration.\n  Here is what he said:\n\n       A policy that has similar coverage to what we had would \n     cost us around $1,100 a month. This is a 100 percent increase \n     for me and my wife. I was informed by the individual that was \n     helping me find coverage that it was because we live in \n     eastern Kentucky.\n\n  Apparently their insurance company is not available there.\n  Finally, he says:\n\n       We will not pay that.\n\n  Giselle Martino from Prospect:\n\n       My premium health care, at premium cost to me, is being \n     canceled. I paid a very high premium to have a major medical \n     plan. I am now forced into the exchange for a lesser plan \n     with more exclusions and higher deductibles. I will most \n     likely never reach these deductibles. How does this help me? \n     I'm basically paying into the plan for the others. If I must \n     pay for my higher tier heart drugs anyway, why should I \n     bother with the health plan? What a disappointment this \n     administration has caused.\n\n  Cheryl Russell from Owensboro:\n\n       We got a letter from our insurance company saying our \n     current policy will not meet the Affordable Care Act, which \n     means it will go away. According to our insurance company, we \n     will have to take pediatric dental and vision insurance. We \n     don't have kids. They said it was because of ObamaCare. They \n     are allowing us to keep our plan until December 2014, for an \n     additional $38 more a month, so we can find another plan. \n     Another plan through this company that we had our whole life \n     will cost us at least $900 to $1,000 a month. It will cost us \n     over $150 more a month plus our deductible goes up to $5,700. \n     I sent you a message last week. I am sending this again. \n     Please keep taking a stand against ObamaCare. Our President \n     lied to us. Not only are we going to lose our insurance, but \n     when we go to a different policy we have to pay more. We will \n     never be able to retire. We are 58 and 56 years old. We will \n     have to work the rest of our lives just to pay for our own \n     insurance. The company we work for doesn't provide it. This \n     isn't fair and it isn't right. Thanks for taking a stand for \n     all those who are in Kentucky.\n\n  So, Mr. President, in wrapping up my remarks, here is the situation. \nOn Christmas Eve 2009, on a straight party-line vote--60 Democrats \nvoting for and 40 Republicans voting against--the administration jammed \nthrough a 2,700-page rewrite of 16 percent of our economy. The goal, \none could argue, was a noble goal--that of trying to reduce the number \nof uninsured in America from an estimated group of about 45 million \nAmericans.\n  The first problem with this particular solution is that CRS--the \nCongressional Research Service, which doesn't work for either \nRepublicans or Democrats--says when all is said and done we are still \ngoing to have 30 million uninsured. So what is the cost-benefit ratio \nof taking $1 trillion out of the providers of health care--roughly $750 \nbillion in reductions; cuts to hospitals, home health care, nursing \nhomes and the like, hospice; billions of dollars in taxes on medical \ndevices; taxes on health insurance premiums kicking in the first of a \nyear; a $1 trillion impact on the providers of health care--and over on \nthe consumer side I have just given a series of stories about how it \nimpacts the consumers of health care: higher premiums, higher \ndeductibles, lost jobs, a record number of part-time employees, and \nwreaking havoc on the American economy, the consumers of health care, \nand on the providers of health care--all to reduce the number of \nuninsured from 45 to 30 million.\n  This has to be the worst cost-benefit ratio in the history of \nAmerican government, all of this disruption--this catastrophic impact \non 16 percent of our economy--in order to make a marginal reduction in \nthe number of uninsured. This has to be the biggest mistake in modern \ntimes. In fact, I am hard-pressed to think of a single bigger mistake \nthe Federal Government has made, and it has made some whoppers over the \nyears. I am hard-pressed to think of a single example that comes \nanywhere close to this, a gargantuan, massive mistake, which has had a \nlot to do with the fact that we have had such a tepid recovery in our \ncountry after a deep recession.\n  The pattern since World War II has been that the deeper the \nrecession, the quicker the bounce-back--until this one: a deep \nrecession, a tepid recovery. The government itself is the reason for \nthat: massive overregulation, an army of regulators who will now have \ntheir work sped through the DC Circuit Court who believe if you are \nmaking a profit you are up to no good; you are obviously cheating your \ncustomers and mistreating your employees. They are here to help you. \nThis massive bureaucratic overreach has definitely slowed our recovery.\n  So I hope the American people will give us an opportunity in the not \ntoo distant future to pull this thing out root and branch and start \nover and do this right.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S8613]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                          A Nuclear-Armed Iran\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I wish to speak about an issue of \ngreat importance to the national security of the United States and to \nall of our allies--which is, preventing Iran from ever having a nuclear \nweapon. There is no doubt in my mind that we will in fact do that, but \ncertain things have to happen. The question is how, not whether, we \nprevent a nuclear-armed Iran.\n  For the first time in years, there is a real opportunity to take a \ngood step to verifiably eliminate Iran's nuclear weapons capability \nthrough tough negotiations rather than the alternative--which is, \ninevitably, acts of war.\n  The initial interim agreement between the P5+1 and Iran is an \nencouraging first step, and I urge my colleagues not to put it at risk. \nHow would they do that? By passing new sanctions right now. There is a \nlot of talk about that, and it is easy to look tough. I am kind of \namazed, to be honest with you, that, I don't think, anybody from our \nside has gotten up and made a speech about this subject on the Senate \nfloor. I meant to yesterday but I couldn't. I thank Senator Johnson, \nchairman of the banking committee, who has come to the rescue of all of \nus. He is not going to allow it to happen, and I totally congratulate \nhim for that act of quiet and strong courage.\n  Instead, we should simply state the obvious: If Iran reneges or plays \ngames, there is no question in anybody's mind in this Senate that we \nwill quickly pass new sanctions the very moment the need arises. To me, \nthis is a clear-cut case. Again, I frankly do not understand why more \nof us, at least on this side, have not gotten up to make this case. I \nthink I have some ideas, but I do wonder.\n  There is still a long way to go, no question. But this diplomatic \nopportunity is real. Why? Because Iran wants and needs to find a way \nout of the financial isolation that our crippling sanctions have \ninflicted on its government, its business, and its people. It is \ndevastating what our sanctions have done.\n  Iran's people elected a president who proposed a different path. \nAyatollah Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader, has given President Rouhani \nsome flexibility to try and find an agreement. That is unprecedented, \nand most people think it is for real. We shall see. They did in fact \nagree to the initial deal. So already, one step has been taken with a \ngood result. I don't think it is a coincidence.\n  The immense power of U.S.-led global financial sanctions, backed up \nby our allies, has created the opportunity to resolve this issue \ndiplomatically, with verifiable agreements and skeptical inspectors, \nrather than with bombs or boots on the ground.\n  I have spent much of my tenure on the Intelligence Committee, going \nback before 9/11, with the Director of National Intelligence, the CIA, \nthe NSA, the FBI, and the Treasury Department to build our tools to \nexploit and to freeze the international web of financial networks that \nenable terrorist and proliferation programs--particularly Iran's \nnuclear programs. I have staunchly supported the powerful multilateral \nsanctions regime that is currently suffocating the Iranian economy and \nforced the current Iranian regime to the negotiating table. They would \nnot have been there otherwise. The effect of inflation and devastation \nof economic production and all the rest is devastating.\n  This initial agreement is the first concrete result of those \nsanctions. It stops progress on Iran's nuclear program. It neutralizes \nIran's most dangerous stockpile of nuclear material--that is, 20 \npercent of enriched uranium--and it establishes strong monitoring \nmechanisms that enable inspectors to verify that Iran is in compliance \nwith its commitments.\n  The first step maintains the powerful sanctions regime that has \nforced Iran to the table. The agreement maintains that. The very small \namount of targeted and reversible financial relief that it provides--\nroughly $7 billion out of $100 billion in sanctions that the agreement \nleaves fully in place--only underscores the grip that we and our allies \nhave on Iran's financial position. The grip will not loosen during this \n6-month agreement as we try to go to a next step. We will continue to \ncontrol and limit Iran's access to money during the 6-month agreement. \nIf Iran in fact reneges on the terms of the interim deal, Iran will not \neven get all of the small relief that we have agreed to. They will, \nhowever, get more sanctions, and over the next 6 months, the small \namount of financial relief that Iran can gain in the deal will be \ndwarfed by the amount of their loss in oil revenue that our continuing \nsanctions will deny Iran. That was in place; that is in place. Iran \nwill be in worse shape financially 6 months from now than it is today. \nThat is a fact. The pressure does not relent. It just keeps going. So \nit is a good situation--tough, agreed to, and in place.\n  That is why Iran needs to complete a final comprehensive agreement to \neliminate its nuclear weapons capabilities. Does that guarantee it? No, \nit doesn't. But we are a step further than we were before because this \ninterim agreement does not give Iran what it needs to escape financial \nruin--which counts.\n\n  I appreciate the concerns of colleagues who want more now. But we \nmust give this opportunity a chance. However you see the first step, \nwhatever your view of it is, the fact is that today Iran is further \nfrom a nuclear weapon than it would have been without this deal that we \nhave just completed. We have accomplished this first step through \ndiplomatic strength, without a shot fired. I think we can agree that is \npretty good.\n  We all want to put pressure on Iran to comply with the commitments it \nhas made to the interim agreement--and we will--and to agree to a long-\nterm comprehensive deal--and we hope--that will prevent it from ever \ndeveloping a weapon. But we have taken the first step.\n  My colleagues, the pressure already exists for Iran to continue on \nthis diplomatic path. Again, if Iran reneges on the commitments it has \nmade in this agreement or balks at a final deal that verifiably ends \nits nuclear weapons capabilities, we will go right to, without doubt, \nthe Congress imposing new and ever more powerful sanctions on Iran. But \nwe don't have to do that now. In fact, it is a terrible mistake to do \nthat now.\n  Given the indisputable credibility of that threat, I urge my \ncolleagues to consider how unnecessary and how risky it would be to \npreemptively introduce new sanctions right now. New sanctions now could \nbe criticized as a violation of the interim agreement. It could be \nblown up that way. Such a move would separate us from our negotiating \npartners in the P5+1 and it could complicate the already difficult \nnegotiations of a final agreement which we all pray for.\n  I know some Senators doubt these risks. But I ask my colleagues this: \nIf there is any chance at all that new sanctions right now might \ndisrupt the agreement or jeopardize a future agreement, why on earth \nwould we risk that? Why would we risk that? We know where we stand. We \nknow where we are going. We can't be sure that we are going to get \nthere, but we know that we always have the power to increase sanctions \nif they try to avoid certain things. But they haven't. So why pile on \nnow and threaten to blow the whole thing up? Why would we risk an \nopportunity that may very well be the only chance we have to resolve \nthis enormous problem without the use of military force? I do not know \nof an alternative to that.\n  If we lose this diplomatic opportunity, then the use of force will be \nthe only option to stop Iran's path to a nuclear bomb. All of us have \nlived with war for the past 12 years. Intimately, painfully, \nhorrifically, we have all seen close up the incalculable financial and \nhuman cost that has come with these wars and the burden that the wars \nnow put on our troops, their families, our economy, and, therefore, our \npeople. This has only hardened my resolve to ensure that this immense \nsacrifice never happens unnecessarily--that we take great care to \nexhaust every possible avenue to diplomatic resolution.\n  Colleagues, we have now an opportunity to eliminate Iran's nuclear \nweapons capabilities. We can do it peacefully. Let's not put that at \nrisk.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n[[Page S8614]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, President Lincoln once said:\n\n       Character is like a tree and reputation like its shadow. \n     The shadow is what we think of it; the tree is the real \n     thing.\n\n  It is my distinct privilege to rise today to speak on two nominees \nthat are indeed the real thing--Justice Brian Morris and Judge Susan \nWatters. The Senate will soon take up both Justice Morris's and Judge \nWatters's nominations for United States District Judge for the District \nof Montana.\n  One of the most important responsibilities I have is providing advice \nand consent to the President on nominations to the Federal bench. I \napproach each vacancy with the same criteria--I want the best, \nregardless of whether they are Republican or Democrat, liberal or \nconservative. Justice Morris and Judge Watters are the best. Their \nquality of character and breadth of experience are remarkable.\n  Montana Supreme Court Justice Brian Morris is one of the brightest \nlegal minds to ever come out of Montana. Justice Morris was born and \nraised in Butte, MT, and graduated from Butte Central High School. He \nearned bachelors and masters degrees in economics from Stanford \nUniversity and received his law degree with distinction from Stanford \nUniversity Law School in 1992.\n  Justice Morris's experience after law school is as varied as it is \nnoteworthy. He clerked for Judge John Noonan, Jr., of the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals and Chief Justice William Rehnquist of the United \nStates Supreme Court. He spent time working abroad as a legal assistant \nat the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal in The Hague and as a legal officer at \nthe United Nations Compensation Commission in Geneva, Switzerland. He \nalso spent time in private practice, handling criminal and commercial \nlitigation with the Bozeman, MT, firm of Goetz, Madden, & Dunn.\n  Justice Morris also served for years as the State's Solicitor \nGeneral. He was elected to his current position on the Montana Supreme \nCourt in 2004, and has demonstrated integrity, fairness, a steady \ndisposition, and superb analytical skills on Montana's highest court. \nJustice Morris is known for his approachability, even-handedness, and \ndown-to-earth manner. After all, he is from Butte. He can often be \nfound reading to students at Smith Elementary School in Helena.\n  Justice Morris has commanded the respect of his colleagues at the \nhighest levels of the law. For more than 8 years, he has served the \npeople of Montana on the bench and in the community. His nomination is \nan extraordinary cap on an already remarkable career, and I have no \ndoubt that he will continue to serve at the highest level. I \ncongratulate Justice Morris, his wife Cherche, and their children Max, \nMekdi, Aiden, and William, on this achievement.\n  In 1916, Montanans elected Jeanette Rankin to be the first woman to \nserve in Congress 4 years before women had the right to vote. We are \nespecially proud of this fact. Judge Susan Watters, our second nominee, \nis another trailblazer we can be proud of. Not only is Judge Watters a \nrespected jurist and dedicated public servant, but once confirmed, she \nwill be the first woman to serve as a United States District Court \nJudge for the State of Montana.\n  Judge Watters was born and raised in Billings, MT, and graduated with \nhonors from Eastern Montana College. Judge Watters raised 2 young \ndaughters while attending the University of Montana Law School, \nreceiving her law degree in 1988. Since then, Judge Watters has \ncemented her reputation as a skilled trial lawyer and judge.\n  After law school, Judge Watters served as Deputy County Attorney for \nYellowstone County, handling civil and criminal cases. In 1995, Judge \nWatters entered private practice, taking hundreds of cases to final \njudgment in State and Federal court. In 1999, Governor Marc Racicot \nappointed her to sit as a State district court judge for Montana's 13th \njudicial district in Billings. Since her appointment, Judge Watters has \nbeen reelected 3 times, most recently with over 80 percent of the vote.\n  Judge Watters has tried hundreds of cases during her 14-plus years on \nthe bench. She has heard civil, criminal, probate, juvenile, and family \nlaw cases. Her trial court experience is remarkable.\n  She further served her community by establishing the Yellowstone \nCounty Family Drug Treatment Court in 2001, the first of its kind in \nMontana. Its overwhelming success has made it a national model.\n  Judge Watters is known for being fair, hard-working, possessing \nstrong analytical skills and an excellent judicial temperament. Her \nextensive trial experience as a practicing lawyer and trial judge will \nbe an invaluable addition to Montana's Federal bench.\n  Judge Watters embodies the qualities that service on the Federal \nbench requires. She has served the people of Yellowstone County for \nover a decade, and I am absolutely confident that she will bring the \nsame professionalism and dignity to the Federal bench. I want to \ncongratulate Judge Watters, her husband Ernie, and their daughters \nJessica and Maggie on this outstanding achievement.\n  Justice Morris and Judge Watters are supremely qualified. Their \nservice is sorely needed. We have two vacancies in our State. We have \nthree Federal district court judgeships. The vacancies that Judge \nWatters and Justice Morris will fill are both considered judicial \nemergencies. Chief Judge Dana Christensen, our lone active judge, \ntravels over 300 miles round trip to hear cases. In fact, I just spoke \nto him yesterday, telling him we would be filling these positions in \nMontana. He said, Max, I am getting in the car right now to drive. \nWhat's the distance? I won't say the distance. It is a 4-hour drive to \nGreat Falls, MT, from Missoula, so he could sit and hear some cases in \nGreat Falls. Judge Don Molloy travels over 340 miles one way. That is \ngreater than the distance between Washington, DC and Hartford, CT. He \ndoes that to hear cases. We need our replacements.\n  Justice Morris and Judge Watters embody the qualities Montanans \ndemand of their Federal judges--their intellect, their experience, and \nintegrity above reproach. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \ntheir nominations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I rise to address the nomination of \nCornelia Pillard for the DC Circuit. It appears to me the environment \nin which we are discussing these nominations is a good example of the \nnew rules of the Senate. We are already getting a taste of the new \nworld order around here. It did not take long. It has only been a few \nweeks but we are already experiencing life in the new Senate. Those in \nthe majority who wanted to change the rules are now certainly getting \ntheir wish.\n  It should have been obvious that the rule change would impact the \nSenate in many unforeseen ways. We in the minority have had to find \nother ways to make our voices heard. As we watch the majority use its \nnew power to move whomever it wants through this body, we should \nrealize that we have started down a course from which we will never \nreturn. Indeed, we should expect more changes in the future. The \nmajority changed the rules because it did not like how they were \noperating to frustrate their ambitions and agenda. If other things come \nabout that frustrate the majority, we may have new changes to get rid \nof those frustrations too. The invocation of the nuclear option has set \nus on an irreversible course.\n  A few weeks ago I came to this floor and quoted our former \nParliamentarian Bob Dove. He and Richard Arenberg, one-time aide to \nformer majority leader George Mitchell, wrote a book called ``Defending \nthe Filibuster.'' This is what they said, and it bears repeating:\n\n       If a 51-vote majority is empowered to rewrite the Senate's \n     rules, the day will come, as it did in the House of \n     Representatives, when a majority will construct rules that \n     give it near absolute control over amendments and debate. And \n     there is no going back from that. No majority in the House of \n     Representatives has or ever will voluntarily relinquish that \n     power in order to give the minority greater voice in crafting \n     legislation.\n\n  Unfortunately, the majority didn't seem to care about the concern \nthese wise men raised and went ahead with their rule change anyway. Now \nwe are feeling the effect.\n\n[[Page S8615]]\n\n  This power grab is having other consequences too. Today I attended a \nhearing in the rules committee as the ranking member, for nominees to \nan agency called the Election Assistance Commission. You probably never \nheard of it. Madam President, I doubt if you have ever heard of it. It \nis a small agency with 4 commissioners--2 Democrats and 2 Republicans. \nNominations to bipartisan commissions have traditionally been paired \nand moved jointly. This practice ensured each party has a voice in such \nbodies.\n  Before the rules were changed, the minority could be assured that \ntheir consent would be needed for appointments. That assurance is now \ngone. Will the majority just make its own appointments to commissions \nsuch as this now? I hope not. That is under discussion in the rules \ncommittee. But what motivation do they have to ever confirm any \nRepublican nominee, if they so choose to even consider minority views \nin this regard? We are going down a dangerous path, and no one knows \nwhere it will lead.\n  The same is true in regard to the atmosphere that we find with the \naffordable health care act. For some reason, the executive has decided \nto make any changes to the law without really considering coming back \nto the Senate or the House or the Congress to make these changes. So in \npart I come to the floor to speak about an issue that continues to keep \nme up every night--and every Kansan as well--that is the implementation \nof this affordable health care act, the health reform law.\n  This is, indeed, the President's legacy legislation. Based on what I \nam hearing from Kansans at home, I would think the President would want \nto be remembered for something else entirely. Unfortunately, since the \nimplementation of ObamaCare began, the stories and reports have only \nconfirmed the many warnings that I and my colleagues have made during \nthe debate for the last 3 years.\n  People cannot keep their coverage. Despite the many, even hundreds of \npromises made by this President and the supporters of this law, people \nare losing their coverage. Premiums are increasing, even though the \nPresident and supporters of this law said premiums would decrease by \n$2,500 for all Americans. Most of the stories I hear, and especially \nfrom Kansans, involve many hundreds of dollars in increases in monthly \npremiums.\n  Even more recently, folks are realizing that what they had to pay in \nout-of-pocket costs are going to skyrocket. Deductibles are higher and \nthe products, drugs, and services Kansans have to pay to reach their \ndeductible has virtually exploded. This doesn't even count the \nincreases to copays and other costs that patients are seeing, \nespecially with regard to prescription drugs.\n  This is being done in a way so that patients are getting the full \ninformation they need. So much for being the most transparent \ngovernment in history.\n  Along these lines I believe it is my responsibility to come to the \nfloor and remind Kansans about several other provisions of ObamaCare \nthat patients may not be aware will put the government between the \npatient and the doctor--their doctor. During the health care reform \ndebate, I spoke at length in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee and in the Finance Committee, and on the Senate floor about \nsomething called rationing, a subject that is very controversial. \nSpecifically, I want people to know about the four rationers--boards, \ncommissions, whatever you want to talk about--the four rationers \nincluded in ObamaCare.\n  First is the CMS Innovation Center, the Center for Medicaid Services \nInnovation Center, which was given an enormous budget to find a way to \nreform payments and delivery models. What this really means is CMS can \nnow use taxpayer dollars in ways to reduce patient access to care. It \ngives CMS new powers to cut payments to Medicare beneficiaries with a \ngoal to reduce program expenditures, but the reality being that they \nwill reduce patient access.\n  There are new authorities also granted to the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force. The USPSTF used to be a body that was scientific \nand academic, that reviewed treatment, testing, and preventive health \ndata and made recommendations for primary care practitioners and health \ncare systems.\n  I guess many would agree that is still what they do today. However, \nthe weight of their recommendations holds significantly more weight as \nof today, due to the Affordable Care Act or ObamaCare. Because of this \nlaw, the health care law, the USPSTF, can now decide what should and, \nmore importantly, should not be covered by health care plans. If the \nUSPSTF doesn't recommend it, then it will not be covered by your health \nplan and you will bear the cost of the procedure. We are already seeing \nthis with prostate exams, mammograms for breast cancer, which many \npeople say have saved their lives. You reach a certain age and they \nwill not do a PSA test. The same kind of criteria--with some degree--to \nmammograms.\n\n  Rationale No. 3, the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute or \nPCORI. This outfit was given millions and millions of dollars to do \ncomparative effectiveness research, also known as CER. I am not \nopposed--I don't know of any Member in this body who is opposed--to \nresearch, especially when it is used to inform the conversation between \na doctor and their patients.\n  But there is a reason this was formerly called cost-effective \nresearch. There is a very fine line between providing information to \ndoctors and patients to help them make the right decision that works \nthe best for them and then using that information to decide whether the \ncare or treatment is worth paying for. I have long been concerned that \nthis research will be abused to arbitrarily deny access to treatments \nor services in order to save the government money by Federal Government \ndecree.\n  Finally, there is my personal nemesis IPAB, which stands for the \nIndependent Payment Advisory Board, and is just now making news as \nvarious people within the media are finally recognizing IPAB. This is a \nboard made up of 15 unelected bureaucrats who will decide what gets to \nstay and what gets to go in Medicare coverage. They will decide what \ntreatments and services will be covered and which will not, all to \nallegedly save money with no accountability. There is no accountability \nwhatsoever.\n  When proposed--I remember it well both in the HELP Committee and the \nFinance Committee--supporters of the health care law told me we are too \nclose to our constituents. Really? We are too close to our \nconstituents. It makes it too difficult to make the hard decisions. \nLet's have somebody else do it. It will be more fair. We know them too \nmuch. We trust them too much.\n  I could not believe it. I believe I am elected to make the hard \ndecisions--I and others in this body--and take the hard votes. I \nbelieve that is the way Kansans and every other State constituency also \nwants it.\n  Even worse is the fine print of IPAB. Get this. If Kansans determine \nthey do not like the direction the IPAB is taking and call my office, \nand every other office in the Senate, to ask us to do something about \nit--to ask me to do something about it--we in Congress can overturn \ntheir decision, but it has to be by a certain margin. On the surface \nthis sounds OK until you realize the President will never support \nCongress overturning the recommendation of this Board, so he will veto \nit. Overriding a veto takes a two-thirds vote, which is 66 votes to \noverturn a decision by IPAB.\n  My colleagues have been changing the rules around here because they \nthink 60 votes is too high a threshold. What are the chances of \nreaching 66 if a decision is made by IPAB with regard to Medicare?\n  But wait. There is more. If the Secretary appoints a board unable to \nmake recommendations for cuts to Medicare, then she gets the authority \nto make the decision of what to cut. This President has already cut \none-half trillion dollars from Medicare to pay for ObamaCare, and he \ngave himself the ability to go after even more Medicare dollars and \nhave no accountability with IPAB. This is egregious, if not ridiculous, \nbut it is not new.\n  I have been talking about the four rationers for a long time and what \nit means to patients. I will have more to say about it when the \nopportunity presents itself.\n  What scares me, as I watch all the other warnings and broken promises\n\n[[Page S8616]]\n\ncome true, is what is going to happen to Kansans--and I know other \nSenators have this same fear--when the warnings about the four \nrationers do come true.\n  We need to protect the all-important relationship between the doctor \nand the patient, which I believe the four rationers put at risk. In \norder to do that, we need to repeal--and most important--and replace \nObamaCare with real reforms that work for Kansans.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  In this atmosphere of uncertainty and new Senate order, I would like \nto talk about another subject that is related, for the lack of any \nprogress we might have.\n  This is becoming an all too familiar situation for Kansas farmers and \nranchers and all of American agriculture. In some respects we are \ncloser to signing a farm bill into law than 1 year ago, but we still \nhave not yet completed this important task. As 1 of the 41 Members \nnamed at the conference committee in October, I was able to give a \nquick opening statement outlining my biggest priorities for the farm \nbill, including addressing regulations that protect crop insurance and \nreforming SNAP; i.e., food stamps.\n  Unfortunately, that was the one and only time the full conference \ncommittee has met to date. With time in short supply, the four \nprincipals of the agriculture committee both in the House and the \nSenate--the ranking member, the chairwoman, the chairman, and the \nranking member in the House--are trying to make the majority of \ndecisions as best they can among themselves and behind closed doors.\n  Sometimes you can get things done behind closed doors without 37 \npeople offering their opinion. I understand that. But with all due \nrespect to those Members, we have real policy differences that deserve \nto be debated publicly, particularly in the commodity and the nutrition \ntitles. The other 37 of us have been ready and willing to be put to \nwork. Yet the conference committee has only met once with no future \nmeeting scheduled.\n  I am very disappointed that an agreement on the farm bill may be \nclose and yet some of our ideas and suggestions and concerns will go \nunheard or unanswered, such as the new environment we live in, in the \nSenate.\n  As I said during the agriculture committee markup and our only \nconference meeting, I have real concerns with the direction of the farm \nprograms in this year's bill. We have what are called target prices--we \nmight as well just say subsidies or countercyclical payments or adverse \nmarket payments--which have proven to be trade and market distorting.\n  For some commodities these prices are set so high that they may cover \na producer's cost of production. That is right. We have a government \nsubsidy over the producer's cost of production. That will essentially \nguarantee that a farmer profits if yields are average or above average.\n  In this budget environment, and at a time when we are looking to make \nsmart cuts, I simply don't know how to justify this subsidy program \nthat can pay producers more than the cost of production and essentially \nbecomes nothing more than an income transfer program, not a risk \nmanagement tool.\n  After the committee markup, I had hopes we could improve the farm \nbill to more resemble the risk-oriented and the market-based approach \nthe Senate had previously taken, working with the distinguished \nchairwoman from Michigan and myself as ranking member.\n  Last year I worked with the Senate leadership from both parties to \nconsider the farm bill through, of all things, regular order. Everybody \nhad a chance to offer an amendment. The first amendment that was \noffered had nothing to do with the farm bill. That amendment was by \nSenator Paul. Regular order gave all Senators the chance to improve the \nbill or make their concerns known.\n  However, this year we considered a mere 15 amendments. The last time \naround it was 73 with 300 offered. Although 250 amendments were offered \nthis time, we only had 15 amendments. All amendments regarding the new \ntarget price program were blocked from consideration and votes on the \nSenate floor--all of them. Senator Thune had amendments, Senator \nGrassley had amendments, Senator Johanns had amendments, and I had \namendments. We all serve on the agriculture committee.\n  Of course, the real problem with farmers planting for a government \nprogram and not for the market is that these programs only serve to \nextend the period of low prices due to overproduction.\n  Besides high target prices for all commodities, the House wants to \nrecouple payments with current production for the first time since \n1996. The Chamber of Commerce has warned that if we go down this road, \nwe will quickly invite other Nations to initiate dispute settlements \nagainst the United States and do so with a good chance of success.\n  I also have longstanding WTO, World Trade Organization, concerns, and \nthe United States lost--and I mean really lost--in a case to Brazil in \npart because of the decoupled price program. We are still paying for \nthat.\n  I am hopeful we will come to some agreement that works without \nfurther setting us up for a further trade dispute not ruled in our \nfavor.\n  Another sticking point seems to be SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program. I think everybody is aware of that. It is important \nto note that at least 80 percent of the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture's budget goes to nutrition programs. SNAP was exempted from \nacross-the-board cuts known as sequestration.\n  The Senate bill only trims $4 billion out of a nearly $800 billion \nprogram in a 10-year budget. That is less than 1 percent of a \nreduction. It doesn't cut anybody's benefits. It looks at eligibility \nand other problems that are within SNAP.\n  We have the responsibility to do more to restore integrity to SNAP, \neliminate fraud and abuse, while providing benefits to those truly in \nneed.\n  I offered an amendment during the committee markup and on the floor \nthat would have saved an additional $31 billion for SNAP. I thought it \nwas a smart and responsible way which would not take away food from \nneedy families.\n  The House took a similar approach and also included work requirements \nfor food stamps and found a total of $39 billion in savings. That is \nabout a 5-percent reduction over 10 years.\n  It has also been mentioned that SNAP has already been cut by $11 \nbillion this year. However, the end of the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act of 2009 stimulus boost for food stamps was a temporary \nincrease in benefits to assist individuals and families hurt by the \nrecession. The end of this temporary increase is in no way related to \nthe farm bill, and the Congressional Budget Office agrees that no \nbudgetary savings are achieved. Reconciling the difference between $4 \nbillion and $40 billion in savings has proven very tough so far, if not \nimpossible. However, unlike the majority of the programs in the farm \nbill, if we don't have a bill signed into law, the Food Stamp Program \nor SNAP will go unchanged and there will be no savings or reform to the \nprogram.\n\n  Last week I spoke with the Kansas Farm Bureau--800 members of the \nfarm bureau and their families--and once again the No. 1 priority for \nvirtually every producer was crop insurance. Even after the devastating \ndrought over the last few years, crop insurance has proven to work. \nProducers from Kansas to Illinois and all over the country are still in \nbusiness helping our rural families and our communities.\n  In 2013, producers across the country insured a record number of \nacres, covering nearly 295 million acres and over $123 billion in \nliabilities. The takeaway message is clear: More farmers are purchasing \ncrop insurance policies to protect their crops than ever before. In \nboth versions of the farm bill, we are able to strengthen and preserve \ncrop insurance. We need to keep that commitment through the final \nlegislation.\n  The farm bill is the appropriate time and place to also address \nregulatory overreaches by the Environmental Protection Agency and the \nrest of the administration that impacts farmers and livestock \nproducers. In that respect, I appreciate the House addressing several \nburdensome regulations that I worked on in the Senate, including \npesticides, farm fuels, tank storage, the lesser prairie chicken--bless \ntheir heart--GIPSA, mandatory country-of-origin labeling, also called \nCOOL.\n  Overall, I am disappointed that it looks as though we will not finish \nthe\n\n[[Page S8617]]\n\nfarm bill before the end of this year, despite the need for certainty \nand predictability all throughout farm country, not to mention the \nDepartment of Agriculture. Our folks back home have to make business \ndecisions regardless of the status of negotiations.\n  Just one example. Kansas wheat growers have already planted their \n2014 wheat crop and have been required to certify their acres; they \njust don't know what programs will be available to them. While we all \nwant to provide long-term certainty to farmers, ranchers, their \nfamilies, and American consumers, we have already let one extension \nexpire in September, and the House may pursue extending the 2008 bill \nyet again. However, our Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, said \nyesterday that even if the House passes a short-term extension of the \nfarm bill, the Senate will not pass it.\n\n  A year ago in August I went to the floor, upset with the leader for \nfailing to consider a bill the House passed to reinstate the livestock \ndisaster programs from the 2008 farm bill in response to the \ndevastating drought in the Midwest. It went on for 3 years. At the \ntime, I called it shameful and an abdication of our duty to the \ncattlemen and women who feed the world and warned of the costs of \ninaction. We were able at that time to finalize a farm bill--still the \nsame farm bill a year later--and our livestock producers are continuing \nto work to rebuild their herds after multiple years of drought. Yet \nlivestock disaster programs remain on hold. Then the devastating \nblizzard hit the Dakotas and Nebraska this year, and those producers \nwere left with little Federal support--a problem we could have \naddressed a year ago.\n  All of us on the conference committee and every Member throughout \nCongress should be equally troubled if we leave this year without \naddressing the farm bill. I am committed to resolving these difficult \ndifferences in order to provide certainty and a forward-thinking farm \nbill that is responsible to Kansans and farmers and ranchers and \nconsumers as well as taxpayers.\n  We have to end this environment here where this so-called nuclear \noption has really gotten us into a hole that we keep digging, whether \nwe are trying to get a farm bill done, whether we are striving to \nimprove the affordable health care act or repeal it, or whether we have \na commission that nobody has heard of in the rules committee that is \nsitting doing something, but we know not really what or what to do with \nit.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, who I think would \nlike to be recognized at this time, so I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1610\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I see my good friend the Senator from \nNorth Dakota on the floor today, and I wish to yield to her to begin \nthis very important discussion on the importance of flood insurance \nrelief for the country. She has been an outstanding spokesperson and a \ntrue advocate to help us get this right, this Flood Insurance Program \nthat can help sustain the program itself for the benefit of the \ntaxpayers as well as for the people in North Dakota, Louisiana, \nPennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey who depend on it so much. So let \nme turn to our leader, Senator Heitkamp.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Madam President, we are here today to talk about \nsomething that is critically important to very many middle-class \nfamilies who enjoy home ownership across the country, and business \nownership, and it is the truly bipartisan Homeowner Flood Insurance \nAffordability Act, which seeks to address the recent flood insurance \nrate escalations across the country.\n  This bill is measured, it is reasonable, and it allows for FEMA to \ncomplete a study on flood insurance affordability and provides Congress \nwith assurance about FEMA's ability to accurately determine flood risk \nbefore implementing pieces of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform \nAct. I think it is true in many cases that the Congress has good \nintentions. They passed the Biggert-Waters provisions, they passed the \nact, but implementation has been a nightmare. I don't think we are \nexaggerating in saying it has been a nightmare for very many of our \ncommunity members, especially across the coastal areas. I think it is \nimportant that I speak as someone from a Plains State who has told \npeople repeatedly that flood insurance is a huge impediment to success \nand to home ownership in North Dakota, in very many of my communities.\n  I wish to mention some of the provisions of the bill. The bill would \ndelay a rate increase for the following properties: primary, non-\nrepetitive loss residences that were grandfathered; all properties sold \nafter July 6, 2012; and all property that purchased a new policy after \nthat date. It is important that the folks out there who have already \ngotten these tremendous flood insurance bills understand that our \neffort is to make this bill retroactive to October 1 of this year so \nthat those rate increases that were mandated by that date don't take \neffect.\n  The basement provision is something we have spent a lot of time \neducating other Members about. It is a provision that affects very many \ncommunities across the country, including 14 in North Dakota, where \nsome of our largest communities have flood-proof basements. They have \nlived by the rules and they have done all that they should do, so they \nhave been granted an exemption from flood insurance, taking a look at \nwhere the foundation is as opposed to where the basement floor is when \nthey determine vulnerability. That basement exemption is in danger of \nbeing repealed by FEMA, and we want to make sure that whatever we do \nrecognizes that when those homeowners have played by the rules, have \ndone what is right and flood-proofed their basements, it is recognized \nin a flood insurance program.\n  Generally speaking, I came to the Senate to fight for North Dakotans. \nI have to imagine most of the Senators are here because they want to \nfight for the people of their States. A major way to do that is to \nprotect American families and their homes and stop putting undue \npressure on them. It is a simple idea, but it is proving much harder to \nimplement than I would like.\n  Flooding is a reality far too often in North Dakota, and there are \nmany other communities across the country that see the same kind of \nplains flooding. Just in the past few years we have seen communities \nsuch as Fargo, Minot, Grafton, and others impacted by severe flooding \nthat has destroyed homes and businesses.\n  This fall flood insurance rates went up for millions of families. \nThis puts families at risk. So many of them have to struggle to pay for \nflood insurance or they have to walk away, literally walk away from \ntheir investment in their home.\n  Biggert-Waters is having an immediate impact on homeowners in my \nState. I will give one example. There is a woman I know from Grafton, \nND, named Alison Skari who, with her husband Kyle, purchased a home in \nthat small community about a year ago. At the time, the flood insurance \nrate was $901 for $100,000 worth of coverage. But when the policy \nrecently came up for renewal, their flood insurance skyrocketed to more \nthan $4,200 a year. Let me repeat those statistics. Their flood \ninsurance cost when they bought their home was at $901. Today their \nbill is $4,200--a 375-percent increase for the same amount of coverage. \nIn an email to me, Allison expressed a desire to raise her children in \nGrafton, but unfortunately they no longer can afford their home--not \nwith these new rates. She said had she and her husband known about \nthese rates when they bought their home, they would never have \npurchased their home.\n  This story reinforces that we need to take a new look. We need to \ntake a new look at this Flood Insurance Program. We need to take a new \nlook at affordability of home ownership.\n  Everybody knows that in the last--certainly since 2008 we have seen a \nslow recovery in home ownership. We have tried to make sure people can \nrealize the American dream, and a big part of that is, in fact, the \nowning of their own home. Yet here we are in the Congress making it \nvirtually impossible for middle-class families to buy and live in and \nenjoy their homes. That was never the intention of the Biggert-Waters \nprovision. The intention was to bring the Flood Insurance Program to a \nmore reasonable, market-based evaluation.\n\n[[Page S8618]]\n\nBut I don't think anyone in this body anticipated these dramatic and \nvery devastating increases.\n  I believe we absolutely need to do something to send a message that \nwe in this body are listening to the middle class. We are listening to \nthe middle class. When every person who runs for office--in their \ncampaign, I bet there isn't one person in this body who didn't say: I \nam there to help protect the middle class. This is our opportunity, in \na bipartisan way, to step up and protect the middle class and to tell \npeople that grasp of home ownership, that piece of the American dream \nis within their reach, and it is within their reach because we aren't \ndoing devastating things here in Washington, DC.\n  I thank my great friend from Louisiana. As a new Member, I preside \nfrequently on the floor of the Senate, and I think that if there has \nbeen a canary on this issue, that early bellwether whom we look to and \nwho said we are going to have problems, it was Senator Mary Landrieu, \nwho alerted this body from the very beginning, who knew these increases \nwere coming and so ably advanced her leadership on this issue. I \napplaud her for that. I applaud Senator Menendez and Senator Schumer \nand so many people on the other side who have worked with us to try to \ndevelop a bill that truly has bipartisan support. I urge this body to \nsend a very important holiday present, a Christmas present to the \nmiddle class of America by passing this reform bill, by delaying these \nincreases and making that dream of home ownership possible in the \nfuture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota \nfor her very kind and very generous comments. She underestimates her \nown tremendous leadership skills. Arriving here as a new Member, she \njumped right into this issue. She didn't need a lot of prep work. She \nunderstands her State. She understands basements, which we don't have \nin Louisiana because if we dig down even a few inches, we will hit \nwater. So I had to become very well educated by my good friends, the \nSenators from New York, New Jersey, and North Dakota, about true \nbasements. It just goes to show that when we work together, we can come \nup with good legislation that can really help our people, give them \nrelief, being in partnership with them, helping them to keep and \nstrengthen the equity in their homes and businesses as well as do right \nby the taxpayer. So I thank the Senator very much for her kind \ncomments.\n  I wish to through the Chair recognize the Senator from New York, who \nhas been an absolutely outstanding advocate for the people of the east \ncoast--particularly New York but the entire east coast in the aftermath \nof Sandy. It was so helpful to that region to bring them the relief \nthey needed, which has worked, and I understand it is still going on \nand we have to do more. But if we don't fix this flood insurance issue, \nwhich, in fact, was a manmade disaster, it is going to make the natural \ndisaster of Sandy that much worse.\n  I wish to ask Senator Schumer if he has any comments to add to what \nhas already been said.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, first, I wish to assure my colleagues \nthat they don't have to be wearing a blue jacket to be supportive of \nthis legislation, as the Senator from North Dakota, the Senator from \nLouisiana, and I happen to be wearing this afternoon.\n  Second, I thank my friend and colleague from Louisiana. What my \nfriend from North Dakota said is exactly right. She has been the Paul \nRevere of this issue, running up and down the aisles of the Senate, if \nyou will, letting people know--``flood insurance increases are coming; \nflood insurance increases are coming''--because she saw it in her home \nState. She has been a great leader, and I hope we will pass the measure \nshe has helped so importantly to craft when it is offered a little \nlater by my colleague from New Jersey.\n  I wish to say to her that she is exactly right about Sandy. We have \nfamilies who were devastated by Sandy. They struggled to rebuild their \nhomes. Then, all of a sudden, because of remapping and because of \nchanges in the flood insurance law, they are hit with a flood insurance \nbill of $800, $900, $1,000. Let's make no mistake about it. These are \nnot wealthy people. Lots of people in New York State who live along the \nwater in Long Island and Queens and Brooklyn and Staten Island are \nworking-class and middle-class people. Their homes are modest. Their \njobs are modest. They can't afford $9,000 a year. For those who were \ntold: Yours isn't going to rise, but when you sell your home it will, \nnow they can't sell their homes.\n  There are some things that make the rest of the Nation scratch their \nheads in wonderment, saying: What the heck is going on in Washington, \nDC? There are too many things, and one of them is flood insurance. How \ncan we demand that average, middle-class people pay up to, in some \ncases, $25,000 or $30,000 a year for a policy that is capped at \n$250,000? How can we have so many homeowners have to pay $5,000, \n$8,000, $10,000 when they can ill afford it? We cannot do that. That is \nwhy this legislation is so important. It is just wrong.\n  When we wrote the original Sandy bill, we put in an affordability \nprovision, and there was supposed to be a study about how people could \nafford the insurance before any increases were put into effect. That \ndid not happen.\n  I have to say, the people at FEMA are good people, but they do not \nunderstand affordability. They are not measuring affordability. They \nare not paying attention to affordability.\n  What is the job of Congress? One of our jobs--when an agency does not \ndo what it is supposed to do--is for us to correct it and oversee it, \nand that is what has happened with FEMA and flood insurance.\n  So we call for a delay until an affordability study is done, until we \ncan figure out a new way to avoid average folks, middle-class folks, \nfrom being forced to either not have flood insurance, abandon their \nhomes, or not sell their homes when they desperately need to do so.\n  FEMA is saying: If we do not charge these people, the program will \nnot be solvent. I will tell you something. If they continue to charge \nthese rates, no one is going to buy flood insurance. People will drop \nout of the flood insurance program, and it will be even less solvent. \nSo we have to come to a reasonable, thoughtful, and careful solution.\n  As the first two of us who have spoken have shown--and my colleagues \nfrom Louisiana, New Jersey, Florida, New Hampshire, who are all here to \ndiscuss this issue--this affects every part of the Nation. It does not \njust affect Florida, although they have hurricanes. It does not just \naffect Louisiana, although they have hurricanes and floods. It affects \nour great river basins--the Missouri and Mississippi River basins. It \naffects the west coast, where flash floods can be very, very dangerous. \nIt affects any place that is near water, which is most of America.\n  We have so many issues. The maps that are drawn are way off base. I \nhave areas in my State that are 5 miles from water and have never been \nflooded and are included in flood insurance. FEMA actually did not even \nmeasure the flood plains in Nassau County and imposed Suffolk County's \nflood plain. We had to force them to go back and start over.\n  There is so much wrong with the way the program is now existing that \nit must be put on hold so we can come up with something better than \nFEMA is doing.\n  So I hope my colleagues will support us. We have bipartisan support. \nThe Senator from Georgia has been a great advocate. Others have been \ngreat advocates on the other side of the aisle. If you say to yourself: \nI am going to object because this is not affecting my State, believe \nme, it will. As FEMA draws maps in State after State across the \ncountry, the very same thing that is now afflicting North Dakota, \nLouisiana, New York, Florida, and New Jersey will afflict your State. \nYou will be coming back to us 2 years from now saying: Hey, let's move \nthat legislation.\n  Let's avoid that problem. Let's do what we have to do. Put this on \nhold, go back to the drawing board, and create a FEMA program that both \nworks and is affordable. I believe we can, if this Senate and this \nHouse will give us the chance.\n\n[[Page S8619]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The senior Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, before the Senator from New York departs, \nI want to say this is a real-life example. In Pinellas County, FL, \nwhich is the county that houses Saint Petersburg and Clearwater, a \ncurrent flood insurance premium for a homeowner: $4,000. A new flood \ninsurance premium--10 times as much--$44,000.\n  Do you think that homeowner can afford that? Do you think that \nhomeowner can now sell their house since that is the flood insurance \npremium that is facing a potential buyer? And, of course, the real \nestate market dries up.\n  So it is a question of affordability, and I merely underscore what \nthe Senator has already said and what the great Senator from Louisiana \nis going to talk about; that is, that you have a pause, you get FEMA to \ndo an affordability study, and then you phase this in over time.\n  It just so happens that 40 percent of these policies are in my State \nof Florida. We have more coastline than any other State, save for \nAlaska, and they are not afflicted by the same things we are, and they \ndo not have a population of 20 million people. Lo and behold, our \npeople are hurting, and we have to give them relief.\n  So I beg anybody in the Senate: Please, when this unanimous consent \nrequest comes up, we have to have this relief for our homeowners and \nfor the real estate market.\n  The maps are a different question, and eventually we need to address \nthe issue of the maps because they are obviously drawing some areas \nthat are not flood prone. They are well above the flood stage, and \nsomehow these maps have gotten misaligned. We can address that. But \nright now we have to address the affordability question.\n  This is no fooling time, and I beg the Senate to let this legislation \ngo by unanimous consent. I am anxious to have my colleagues make their \nstatements.\n  Mr. President, I am chairing the Aging Committee hearing right now. I \nlook forward to the Senator from Massachusetts joining us after her \nstatement.\n  So with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, in deference to my colleague, who I \nunderstand may object--and although I have a statement--let me first \nprecede it by making this request. As in legislative session, I ask \nunanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the majority \nleader, after consultation with the Republican leader, the banking \ncommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 1610, the \nHomeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2013, and the Senate \nproceed to its consideration; that an amendment, which is at the desk, \nmaking technical changes to the bill, be agreed to; that no other \namendments be in order to the bill; that there be up to 2 hours of \ndebate equally divided between proponents and opponents of the bill; \nthat upon the use or yielding back of time, the bill be read a third \ntime and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill; finally, \nthe vote on passage be subject to a 60-affirmative-vote threshold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I object on behalf of the ranking member \nof the banking committee. This bill has not been through the committee \nprocess and would undo the important rate reforms to the National Flood \nInsurance Program that were put in place in the most recent flood \nreform bill to address the program's $25 billion debt to the taxpayer. \nWe must ensure that all Members have the opportunity to understand and \nweigh in on the changes being made by this action. This unanimous \nconsent request would bypass this important step in the legislative \nprocess, and I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I have to say, I am disappointed to hear \nan objection because this is a bipartisan effort that is being pursued \nin the Senate and the majority leader has been very gracious to offer \nus time to debate and vote on an important proposal. I am sure we will \nbe back here again to try to achieve that. This is not a Republican \nbill or a Democratic bill. It is not a Republican or Democratic \npriority. It is a commonsense measure that has broad bipartisan \nsupport--exactly the type of support and cooperation the American \npeople are yearning to see from their elected officials. More \nimportantly, this legislation is critical to the lives of hundreds of \nthousands homeowners, and we should not simply let Senate procedure get \nin the way of finding solutions.\n  Let me just briefly speak in support of S. 1610, which is the \nHomeowners Flood Insurance Affordability Act that we just asked consent \nto bring to the floor. It is a bipartisan, bicameral piece of \nlegislation that would help people afford flood insurance so they can \nstay in their homes and businesses can stay open--all the while \npreventing property values from plummeting.\n  At a time when there is far too little bipartisan cooperation, this \nbill stands as a notable exception. It currently is cosponsored by 23 \nof my colleagues, including 7 Republicans, representing States from all \ncorners of the country.\n  It is supported by the National Association of Realtors, the National \nAssociation of Homebuilders, the American Bankers Association, and the \nIndependent Community Bankers Association.\n  You have heard from several of my colleagues who have spoken to this \nissue--and there are others, such as Senator Warren and my fellow \ncolleague from New Jersey, Senator Booker, who I am proud to say has \nchosen this bill as the first piece of legislation to cosponsor in what \nI am sure will be a long and illustrious career in the Senate.\n  The reason for that broad support is because flood insurance is not \njust a coastal or Northeast issue, it is an issue that affects the \nentire country. Every State in the Nation has properties covered by the \nNational Flood Insurance Program, and every State in the Nation will \nsee premiums on some of these properties increase as a result of \nBiggert-Waters.\n  Some of these increases will be modest. Others are going to be \nprohibitively expensive and act as a de facto eviction notice for \nhomeowners who have lived in their homes and played by the rules their \nentire lives. We certainly know this because we are already hearing \nfrom our constituents, and many more of our colleagues are hearing the \nsame desperate cries from across the country, and many more will hear \nthem as flood insurance maps get outlined by FEMA under the \nlegislation, as renewals come up, and all of a sudden they are going to \nhear an outcry from their homeowners, who are going to say: This \nultimately creates a set of circumstances for me where I am going to \nlose my home.\n  The value of their homes will be dramatically reduced. Their ability \nto sell it will be dramatically altered, and they will, in essence, \nhave taken what they have worked a lifetime to achieve and have it \nbecome a human catastrophe--made by the Congress.\n  This is going to drive property values down. The housing market is \nstill struggling to recover, and we all know that declining property \nvalues have a domino effect, causing neighborhood properties to decline \nin value, which, in turn, hurts the broader economy.\n  We need to understand the impact that these dramatic changes in \nBiggert-Waters will have on the housing market before it is too late. \nWe need to understand the impact these rate reforms will have on \nprogram participation, which is already dismally low. In fact, recent \nreports suggest that only about 18 percent of properties in flood zones \nparticipate in the program. If rates are raised too high and too \nquickly, people will simply opt to drop their insurance, decreasing \nparticipation, and the risk pool in the National Flood Insurance \nProgram will ultimately feel the consequences.\n  One study has shown that for every 10-percent increase in premiums, \nprogram participation decreases by approximately 2.6 percent; and the \nsharper the increases, the higher the proportion of dropouts.\n  As with any flood insurance fund, the smaller the risk pool, the \ngreater the risk. So increasing rates could have the\n\n[[Page S8620]]\n\nunintended consequences of actually making the program less solvent.\n  Reduced program participation would also increase the amount \ntaxpayers are on the hook for in disaster assistance payments. Since \nFEMA grants, SBA loans, and other disaster assistance are reserved for \nunmet needs, more uninsured homeowners mean more disaster assistance \npayouts.\n  We should be incentivizing people to purchase insurance so they have \nskin in the game and they will be motivated to take proactive \nmitigation measures--not pricing them out of insurance so they are \nforced to rely on taxpayer-funded disaster assistance.\n  There is no question that we need to reform the National Flood \nInsurance Program in order to put it on a long-term path towards \nsolvency and sustainability. But, unfortunately, Biggert-Waters forces \nchanges that are far too large and far too fast. It requires FEMA to \nincrease rates dramatically, even before FEMA knows the scope of these \nchanges or how they will impact program participation.\n  Think about that for a second. We are making dramatic changes in \npolicy which could impact more than 5.5 million policyholders and have \nripple effects throughout the housing market in our entire economy \nbefore we even know the extent of these changes or their impact.\n  I have heard from countless New Jerseyans, many who have come to me \nin tears, who are facing this predicament. These are hardworking \nmiddle-class families who played by the rules, purchased flood \ninsurance responsibly, and are now being priced out of their home.\n  That is why we collectively introduced the Homeowners Flood Insurance \nAffordability Act that would impose a moratorium on the phaseout of \nsubsidies and grandfathers included in Biggert-Waters for most primary \nresidences until FEMA completes the study--that I offered as an \namendment that was included in the legislation--completes the \naffordability study that was mandated in the law and proposes a \nregulatory framework to address the issues found in the study.\n  So we are going ahead with all of these actions and all of these \nincreases without--without--knowing the consequences of that study.\n  It would also require FEMA to certify in writing that it has \nimplemented a flood mapping approach that utilizes sound scientific and \nengineering methodologies before certain rate reforms are implemented. \nWe saw this in New Jersey where, in fact, large swaths of communities \nwere put in what we call the V zone, which is the most consequential \nzone in the opening maps. But when we pressed FEMA and brought \ninformation to them, those universes were dramatically reduced.\n  The difference between being in that V zone and not can mean the \ndifference between being able to continue to own your home or not. So \nwe believe that this legislation is critical.\n  Why do we come and ask unanimous consent? Why do we ask unanimous \nconsent? Why did we ask unanimous consent? Why will we continue to ask \nunanimous consent? Because there is an urgency of ``now.'' If we do not \nact, and we go out of session and we come back next year, unless we get \nto this early on and make it retroactive, we are going to see the \nconsequences of this take place across the landscape of this country. \nThat is why we have Members from coast to coast; that is why we have \nMembers from the South; that is why we have Members from the Midwest \nwho all understand the consequences of not acting. That is why we have \ntaken the unusual step, on a bipartisan basis, to ask for that \nunanimous consent request.\n  For any property sales that occur during this period, the homebuyer \nwould continue to receive the same treatment as the previous owner of \nthe property unless they trigger another provision in Biggert-Waters \nnot covered by my bill.\n  For prospective homebuyers, the certainty that they will not see \ntheir rate dramatically increase simply because they purchased a home \nis critically important to maintaining property values.\n  Also, this new legislation would give FEMA more flexibility to \ncomplete the affordability study.\n  It would reimburse qualifying homeowners for successful appeals of \nerroneous flood map determinations.\n  It would give communities fair credit for locally funded flood \nprotection systems.\n  It would continue the fair treatment afforded to communities with \nfloodproof basement exemptions.\n  It would provide for a FEMA ombudsman to advocate for and provide \ninformation to policyholders.\n  Just as important as what this bill would do, it is also important to \nnote what this bill would not do.\n  This legislation would not stop the phase out of taxpayer funded \nsubsidies for vacation homes and properties that have been repetitively \nflooded. It would not encourage new construction in environmentally \nsensitive or flood-prone areas. And it would not stop most of the \nimportant reforms included in Biggert-Waters.\n  This legislation simply provides temporary relief to a targeted group \nof property owners who played by the rules and are now poised to see \ntheir most valuable asset become worthless, all through no fault of \ntheir own.\n  This bill does not include everything I wanted and I know there were \nmany other ideas that other cosponsors wanted to include. But in order \nto reach a true consensus, we limited the provisions in this bill to \nthose that had broad, bipartisan support. That is why we are here \ntoday--Democrats and Republicans--calling for debate and a vote on this \nvital piece of legislation.\n  I must say I am very disappointed to hear objection from the other \nside of the aisle.\n  My friend the majority leader has been very gracious to offer us time \nto debate and vote on this important proposal and we will be back here \nday after day to try to do that.\n  Because as I said before, this is not a Republican bill or a Democrat \nbill--it is not a Republican priority or a Democrat priority. It is a \ncommonsense measure that has broad bipartisan support, exactly the type \nof support and cooperation the American people are yearning to see from \ntheir elected officials.\n  More importantly, this legislation is critical to the lives of \nhundreds of thousands of homeowners. We should not let arguments about \nSenate procedure get in the way of finding solutions to their problems.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, there are several other Members. Senator \nMenendez is the leader of our efforts. He and Senator Isakson have \njoined and have put together an extraordinary coalition. I would like \nto read the names into the Record because it is a testimony. In a place \nthat cannot get three Members to agree on anything, we have over 20 \nMembers who agree to change the Biggert-Waters law. I want to read this \ninto the Record and then ask through the Chair for the Senator from \nMassachusetts--both Senators are here--the senior Senator to be \nrecognized for just a moment and then the junior Senator to speak on \nthis issue.\n  But Senator Menendez and Senator Isakson are our leads--again, New \nJersey and Georgia. They are two very different States but have very \nsimilar challenges. They have people--middle-class families, small \nbusiness owners--who have poured their life savings into homes and \nbusinesses, only to be destroyed by a piece of legislation that had \ngreat intentions but disastrous results. We do not have a lot of time \nto fix this. We need to do this before this body leaves, which is next \nweek.\n  Myself, Senator Cochran, Senator Merkley, Senator Vitter, Senator \nHoeven, Senator Scott from South Carolina, Senator Wicker, Senator \nHeitkamp from North Dakota, Senator Schumer, Senator Gillibrand, \nSenator Markey, Senator Warren, Senator Nelson from Florida, Senator \nBegich from Alaska, Senator Manchin from West Virginia.\n  There is no ocean anywhere near West Virginia, but they have many \nmiddle-class families who are getting caught up in a quagmire here. \nThis bill is the only bill that can release them and save taxpayers \nmoney. Senator Casey from Pennsylvania, Senator Klobuchar, Senator \nBooker, Senator Graham--who is also on the floor--and our newest \ncosponsor today, Senator Lisa Murkowski from Alaska.\n  This is a very unusual coalition. I have been here a long time now. I \nhave hardly seen a coalition this broad and diverse. So clearly we have \nsomething meaningful to say that needs change.\n\n[[Page S8621]]\n\nPlease let us not let procedures and pride, bad tempers, keep us from \ndoing what we know we need to do for our people.\n  I thank Senator Warren who has been a tremendous help to us in \nputting this bill together, and might I add that it costs nothing. \nThere is no score on this bill. So to anyone that could object because \nit costs the taxpayers: Nada. It does not cost anything. It is a zero \nscore. We have done it that way to be respectful of all of the \ndifferent opinions. But it will help to give us relief.\n  Through the Chair I would like to ask Senator Warren to add her \nterrific voice and perspective on how it is affecting Massachusetts, \none of our most important States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in urging \nsupport for S. 1610, the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of \n2013. This is a bipartisan bill that will help homeowners across our \ncountry who are getting hit with the newly revised flood maps and \nincreased flood insurance premiums.\n  I am very pleased to join colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \ncall for this commonsense delay which gives FEMA time to get this \nright. I thank Senator Menendez who has been a tremendous leader, \nSenator Isakson, Senator Landrieu, who has gotten in there and gotten \nus all mobilized, Senator Cochran, many others of the cosponsors of \nthis bill for their leadership and their commitment to work on this \nimportant issue.\n  I also thank my partner in all things, Senator Markey, for the work \nhe has done on this bill and for giving me the chance to speak first \nhere so we could get going. Families purchase flood insurance to \nprevent the loss of their homes. But now many families fear that the \nprice of flood insurance could be just as devastating as any storm. You \ncannot protect someone's home by pricing them out of it. Yet that is \nexactly what is taking place around the country. Congress changed the \nNational Flood Insurance Program to move toward a more market-based \nsystem that more accurately reflected the true cost and risks of flood \ndamage.\n  This is a well-intentioned bill, but, unfortunately, homeowners are \nbeing blindsided by high rate increases and new flood zone maps. Many \nfamilies are learning for the first time from news reports and letters \nthat their mortgage companies are sending that they must purchase flood \ninsurance. This is simply not an acceptable way of informing the public \nthat flood insurance bills are skyrocketing.\n  When FEMA released these flood maps this year and last, they knew \nthey were placing hundreds of thousands of homeowners into a flood zone \nfor the very first time. It is critical that these maps be spot on and \ncorrect. But many people do not trust many of the new changes, and \ntheir concerns are growing by the day. In fact, a recent independent \nreview conducted by coastal scientists at the behest of my colleague, \nCongressman Bill Keating, concluded that FEMA used outdated wave \nmethodology better suited for the Pacific coast when they drafted new \nflood maps for Massachusetts.\n  They believe this resulted in FEMA overpredicting the flooding that \ncould occur from once-in-a-century storms for much of our State. We \nneed to pass this bill to give the government the time it needs to make \nsure that the maps are accurate, reliable, and reflect the best \navailable scientific data.\n  We also need to make sure that hard-working families who play by the \nrules can afford these policies. The Homeowners Flood Insurance \nAffordability Act that I have proudly cosponsored will provide relief \nto homeowners who built to code and were later remapped into a higher \nrisk area.\n  Furthermore, this critical bill will delay rate increases until FEMA \ncompletes the affordability study that was mandated by the Biggert-\nWaters Flood Insurance Reform Act, and until subsequent affordability \nguidelines are enacted.\n  Homeowners are facing flood insurance premium increases that can cost \n$500, $1,000, even more per month. Most hard-working families and \nseniors do not have that kind of extra money on hand to spend on flood \ninsurance premiums they never knew they were going to need.\n  FEMA has a lot of work to do.\n  In the meantime, these families should not be hit with high costs \nwhen they challenge the flood map and win their appeal. Our bill will \nhelp address this injustice and will allow FEMA to utilize the National \nFlood Insurance Fund to reimburse people who successfully appeal a map \ndetermination. It also gives FEMA the added financial incentive to get \nthose maps right the first time.\n  I am pleased to join colleagues on both sides of the aisle in this \ncall for a commonsense delay which will give FEMA time to get this \nright. I urge my Senate colleagues to support this much needed relief \nfor homeowners. I thank Senator Markey for his leadership. I thank \nSenator Landrieu for her amazing leadership, and I thank all of my \ncolleagues who are ready to move on something that is common sense and \nvery much needed by families across this country.\n  I yield for my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Markey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. I thank the Senator for her leadership. She and I have \nmet with people all across the State of Massachusetts who are fearful \nof the impact that this can have upon their ability to live in their \nown homes, to sell their homes, to continue to operate their \nbusinesses, to sell their businesses.\n  This is a fundamental issue for our State. Senator Warren and I bring \nthis concern to the floor even as we know that it is a concern that is \nfelt all across the country. It is Louisiana. It is New Jersey. It is \nSouth Carolina. It is West Virginia. It is the coastlines of our \ncountry. Yes, it is.\n  The warmer the climate becomes, the warmer the oceans become; the \nwarmer the oceans, the higher the tides; the more devastating the \nstorms, the more changes that take place in terms of the impact on the \nhomes, the businesses, all along the coastline.\n  But climate change does not only affect the coastal areas. It is \naffecting our whole country--the whole planet. There is a huge change \nwhich is taking place. That is why we are out here. We are out here \nbecause of climate change. The storm that hit New Jersey, Hurricane \nSandy, was devastating. We saw the courage of the people of New Jersey \nand New York in responding to that storm. But just with a couple of \nchanges in the direction of that storm, it could have wiped out \neverywhere from Cape Cod up to Newburyport, Maine, and New Hampshire.\n  But for a small change in that storm, it could have been down in \nDelaware, Virginia, wiping out that coastline. But for the grace of God \ngo the States that we represent. The same thing is true all across the \ncountry.\n  We know that the pollution we pump into the sky heats the water and \nthe air. It gives storms more power. We know this scientifically. With \nmore powerful and more frequent storms, we realize that this tragedy is \nlapping right at the doors of every citizen. We have to do something to \nprevent it from becoming worse.\n  But at the same time, we also have to realize that these families are \ninnocent victims. They did not have anything to do with the policies \nthat did not deal with climate change for a generation, that ignored \nthe science. They are now dealing with the consequences of a failure to \ndeal with that issue. We cannot allow the failure to act to be borne by \nthose who are the least able to afford it.\n  That is what is happening. It is going to be innocent Americans who \nnow have to suffer because we did not have the political will to deal \nwith this issue of climate change.\n  I have heard, along with Senator Warren, from people all over my \nState. I have one business that relocated several years ago thinking \nthat was going to satisfy the need to protect against climate change, \nagainst the change in the flood plain. Now, under the new plan, they \nwill have to move the business again.\n  It is unsustainable long term for any businesses, any family to think \nabout living in these kinds of areas unless we begin to think through \nhow we are going to adjust to this law that is on the books which will \nhave an almost immediate impact upon families all over our country.\n\n[[Page S8622]]\n\n  We need to fix the flood insurance provisions that would have \ndevastating economic impacts on our coastal communities. That is why I \nam proud to support the legislation of the Senator from Louisiana, the \nSenator from Georgia, Senator Isakson, Senator Menendez, Senator \nMerkley, and everyone who has worked on this issue.\n  We have to ensure that we address the issue of affordability for \nthese homeowners, affordability for these businesses in terms of the \nincrease of the flood insurance rate caused by the new flood maps and \nensure that we put that before any crippling flood insurance rate \nincreases.\n  We have to deal with affordability first. If affordability is not \ngoing to be dealt with, then there is going to be a devastation that is \nfelt by millions of homeowners and businesses across this country.\n  Climate change is real. It is here. It is dangerous, but the fear of \nrising floodwaters should not be compounded by the fear of an \nunaffordable spike in insurance premiums for homeowners and businesses \nacross this country.\n  I thank my colleagues for all their work on this issue. It is an \nindispensable part of the business of this Congress this year to pass \nthis legislation. We must find a way to work together before we leave \nin order to pass this legislation.\n  I call upon all of my colleagues to work together with us. This is as \nbipartisan as it gets in the Senate. We have to find a way.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Louisiana for all of her great work.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I see the Senator from South Carolina on the floor to \nspeak, but I wish to give some concluding remarks in this very \nimportant hour about this very important issue. We are down to the \nwire, and we do not have any time left to provide relief to homeowners \nand business owners all over this country.\n  About 1 hour ago there was an objection registered from the \nRepublican ranking member of the banking committee. I have a great deal \nof respect for that particular Member. I hope he will consider the \ntragic ramifications of his objection for millions of homeowners and \nbusinesses around the country and work with us over the next few days \nto mitigate any of his objections so we can move this bill to the floor \nand provide 2 hours of debate. We will accept, those of us in our \ncoalition, a 60-vote threshold.\n  Let me remind colleagues that a hearing was held in the banking \ncommittee by Senator Merkley, who chairs the subcommittee. This bill \nhas been discussed for hours and hours in committee, in public. There \nare hundreds of stakeholder groups led by, I am very proud to say, GNO, \nInc., Greater New Orleans, Inc., a very broad coalition of business \nowners and parish residents. They reached out across the country, down \nthe coast, the gulf coast, to the east coast, to the west coast, North \nCarolina, to the good Senator on the floor from South Carolina, \nreaching out in areas in the Midwest and up in the Northwest.\n  The reason they did that is because there are new flood maps going \ninto effect in all of these places. I call attention to the diagram of \nflood maps in the United States. In purple, these were the flood maps \nthat were in effect as of July 2012. In the green, these are proposed \nflood maps that have been introduced. We can see how many green \ndesignations there are.\n  In the gold color, there are new flood maps possible. There is no \nState that is going to escape these new flood maps. As Senator \nElizabeth Warren said, they are inaccurate. They don't have the \ncapability, the finances, the resources to produce--or the technology, \nin some cases--accurate flood maps. There have been a record number of \nmistakes made that we have provided for from the public testimony.\n  In addition, I wish to show a map of where levees are. There are many \nlevees. I was surprised, myself, having become an expert on levees, I \nthought. No, I am not the expert I thought I was because I did not \nrealize how many levees there were in other States. I have been so \nfocused on mine that broke in 52 places and almost destroyed a great \ninternational American city, New Orleans. We are on the mouth of the \nMississippi River, and I am well aware of the levee system that was one \nof the great engineering feats ever in the world, on the planet. It \nkeeps the Mississippi River in its channel so we can have the great \ncommerce we have had that helped build this great Nation. I am well \naware of the great story about that.\n  I was not aware of the tremendous flooding risk in California, in \nArizona, in New Mexico, and in Montana, of all places. I knew about \nArkansas, Illinois, and St. Louis because of the Mississippi River up \nto Minneapolis.\n  Look at Pennsylvania. I was shocked to see so many flooding areas in \nthe State of Pennsylvania.\n  I wish to say it is not only a coastal issue, it is a national issue. \nWe are the national Congress. These rates are going up now and it needs \nto be fixed now.\n  I hope the Republican opposition will think clearly about their \nobjection, the ramifications it will have, and find a way to say yes--\nfind a way to say yes.\n  The bill that Senator Menendez and Senator Isakson are offering costs \nzero. It helps millions of people and ultimately will make the program \nfiscally sound.\n  As the Senator from New York said so eloquently and so accurately: If \nyou price people out of the program, there will be no one to support \nthe program. The program will default, taxpayers will still have to \npick up the debt associated with that program, and then we will also \nhave millions of people losing their homes and their businesses. It \nmakes no sense. It makes no financial sense.\n  I am not going to speak too much longer, but I do wish to state I am \nvery happy, as an American, there are many newspapers we can read. \nThere are many blogs, a lot of radio shows, and all sorts of different \nopinions. We have to read a lot, think a lot, and get different views \nto find the truth.\n  I am going to read the first paragraph of the Wall Street Journal \nbecause they need to listen to a couple of other bloggers or writers \nbecause they are way off base. The Wall Street Journal said last week: \n``Federal flood insurance is a classic example of powerful government \naiding the powerful, encouraging the affluent to build mansions near \nthe shore.''\n  That statement is so inaccurate it is laughable.\n  The people I represent in Louisiana--we hardly have a beach. I don't \nknow if anyone has visited Louisiana. We don't have beaches. We have \nmarshes. No one I know who lives in New Orleans or Baton Rouge is \nanywhere near a beach. I am going to read a letter from a very affluent \nand powerful person:\n\n       I am a 66-year-old woman and have lived in the same house \n     in Broadmoor since 1974.\n\n  I knew this neighborhood when the letter arrived at my desk because \nthat is the neighborhood where I grew up and still reside. There is not \na beach within miles of Broadmoor.\n  She continues:\n\n       I lived there with my family, raised a son who also lives \n     and owns a house in Broadmoor--\n\n  It is a very middle-class neighborhood that we come from.\n  Continuing:\n\n       --and plan to stay in my home for the remainder of my life. \n     I live on a very strict budget and have just this month \n     received my first Social Security payment. If something is \n     not done to change the law that will potentially raise my \n     flood insurance by the thousands, it will not be possible for \n     me to keep my home nor sell it.\n\n  I wish to have the Wall Street Journal editorial board hear this. \nThis is not a millionaire mansion on a beach. This is a 66-year-old \nwoman who just received her first Social Security check. If this law is \nnot changed by the 100 Members of this body in the next few days, she \ncan either stay in her house or sell her house.\n  Please do not lecture to us from some high place in some big \ncorporate office about Senators on the floor of the Senate trying to \nfight for powerful interests for people in mansions who live on fancy \nbeaches. That is not what this bill is about.\n  I have hundreds of pictures. If the Wall Street Journal or any \nnewspaper wants to editorialize about this, please check my Web site, \n``My Home Story.'' I have hundreds of pictures and other Senators have \nhundreds of pictures. I don't see a mansion.\n  All I see are cries of people who say: Wait a minute. My house has \nnever\n\n[[Page S8623]]\n\nflooded. I live in a simple neighborhood. I am a simple person. I am an \nAmerican who works hard, and you are running me out of my home.\n  The bill that passed, Biggert-Waters, was well intentioned but \ndrafted inappropriately and has some very pernicious guidelines or \nrules in it that can only be changed by Congress. Some people wish to \nthink that FEMA can wave a magic wand and make it work. FEMA cannot \nwave a magic wand. We have to do our job as Senators. I hope the Senate \nwill do its job.\n  We cannot agree on everything that needs to be fixed, I understand. \nThere are many arguments about other things that some people think need \nto be fixed and others don't. But I don't know of anyone nor have I \nheard anyone on the floor give us one good, solid reason that the \nMenendez bill shouldn't pass, such as: I don't like section 1, I don't \nlike section 2, I don't like section 10, maybe section 5--not one. It \nis all posturing.\n  Please let us get over the posturing and help people who live nowhere \nnear a beach, who are going to lose their homes and need us to act. I \nbelieve we can do it. As I said, we have great Republican leadership \nand great Democratic leadership.\n  In closing, the Senator on the floor has my great respect. Also, \nSenator Isakson, who is the lead Republican Senator, is known in this \nbody as an expert on real estate and finance. He is very clear in his \nappreciation and understanding that the real estate market is going to \nbe shaken to its core, as well as homebuilders and community bankers \nwho are holding mortgages on these 5 million properties.\n  We have come too far. We have come too far in restoring this housing \nmarket. This bill was well intentioned but poorly drafted, stuck into a \nconference committee report at the last minute, not with as much \noversight as we should have given. We can fix it. Let's do this.\n  I thank the Senator for being so generous. It is a very important \nissue. I am prepared to stay here for as long as it takes before \nChristmas--even, I hate to say, up to Christmas Eve, as I wish to get \nhome for a little bit of time, but this needs to be fixed before we \nleave for Christmas.\n  The House can come back in January, take up this bill, and we can \nsend it to the President's desk early in February, make it retroactive, \nand give people relief. This is not about helping out powerful \ninterests and millionaires on the beach. This is about helping many \nAmericans who have done nothing wrong and everything right. They have \nbeen in their homes since the 1960s, 1950s, in some cases from the \n1800s, and are going to be priced out of their home. Their equity will \nbe stolen from them by a poorly drafted piece of legislation.\n  We can do better and we should.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to address the nomination of \nCornelia Pillard for the DC Circuit.\n  My colleagues, I have enjoyed my time in the Senate very much, \nalthough we live in a very difficult time. Politically, there are a lot \nof influences on individual Senators and parties and the body as a \nwhole, so these are very difficult times. I can only imagine writing \nthe Constitution today. I always thought that would be a good \n``Saturday Night Live'' skit: Go back to Philadelphia hall and have all \nthe satellite trucks parked outside and the bloggers and talk radio, \nmoveon.org--fill in the blank--all putting pressure on our Founding \nFathers not to do this or that. We live in different times.\n  It is absolutely good that people have a voice and influence and \ncreate organizations to advocate their cause. There seems to be an \norganization for almost every aspect of the economy. So lobbying the \ngovernment, having a say about legislation, trying to push your \nrepresentatives to do something you think is good for the country is \nvery much a part of democracy, but eventually we have to govern.\n  Democracy is a journey, sort of like when you are on vacation or you \nare driving to a place with your kids and they always ask: Are we there \nyet? But democracy is not an end state, it is a process. Democracy is \nreally about protecting losers, not so much winners. Winners tend to do \nwell in any system. Democracy protects the loser by having a rule of \nlaw, a process that says: If you lose the election or you are in the \nminority in a body, there will be rules there to give you a voice.\n  One of the problems in the Mideast and throughout the world is that \npeople are afraid to lose. In the Mideast it is a winner-take-all \nenvironment. The reason there are so many militias is that people don't \ntrust the police or the government to be fair to their sect or their \ntribe, so they arm themselves, believing that if they don't take care \nof themselves, nobody else will. But that just leads to an endless \nstate of conflict.\n  So democracy is really a process, and it is designed to ensure that \nlosers in a democratic process will still have basic rights. You can \nlose the election and not get fired. It is illegal to fire somebody \nbecause they are in the opposite party, unless it is a political job \nwhere one expects that to happen. You don't lose your right to speak up \nbecause you lost the election.\n  When you find yourself in the minority in politics, it is important \nthat you have a say. It is also important that the majority has the \nability, having won the election, to do certain things--to run the \nplace, for lack of better words.\n  The Senate is an unusual body in traditional democracy. \nParliamentarian systems are different from what we have set up. You \nhave two houses in most places, such as the House of Lords. I don't \nknow what power it has, but it is not too great. The parliamentary \nsystem is where you have to form coalitions. At the end of the day it \nis a completely different setup than we have here, where the party in \ncharge, if they can form a big enough coalition, can basically just run \nthe place.\n  The House is a winner-take-all body. If you are in the majority in \nthe House, you can decide what bills to bring to the floor, what \namendments will be allowed on those bills, and how long to debate those \nbills. You have an almost absolute dictatorial ability to run the \nHouse. You determine everything. The minority has some say but not a \nwhole lot. The House is sort of gang warfare. I have been there and \nlove the institution. You will find that majorities will be fighting \namong themselves a lot in the House because that is where the action is \nin the House.\n  I have been in the House, and I have been in the Senate. I loved \nbeing in the House, and I understood the way the rules worked--that if \nyou were in the minority, what came to the floor was determined by the \nmajority, what amendments were in order was determined by the majority, \nand that is just the way it was.\n  When I was in the House, we would pass one measure after another that \nwould go to the Senate and never be heard from again, and that was \nfrustrating. But the older you get, you sort of realize maybe some of \nthe things you wanted were not in the best interest of the country as a \nwhole. And the fact that you knew that if it went to the Senate there \nwould be a filtering process, unlike in the House, became somewhat \nreassuring over time.\n  House majorities are more partisan, generally speaking. They are \ninfluenced by 2-year election cycles. It is a more passionate body \nbecause you are always up for election and the winner takes all. And \nwhen you win in the House, the people who got you there expect you to \ndo things consistent with your party's agenda. Nothing wrong with that.\n  In the Senate there has been a conscious effort to put some brakes on \nthat kind of governing. When you send a bill to the Senate, you still, \nto this day, have to get 60 votes to bring the legislation to the floor \nand to get cloture, and the minority has the ability to say not only \nwhether they want the bill to come to the floor, with a certain amount \nof amendments, but then they can negotiate with our friends in the \nmajority to get the amendments we want and to allow the legislation to \ncome forward. There are probably a lot of times when Republicans in the \nHouse voted understanding that this idea wouldn't make it through the \nSenate and that was probably OK.\n  Here is what I feel. A lot of my colleagues have talked about Ms. \nPillard, the nominee, being a radical judge and\n\n[[Page S8624]]\n\nbeing out of the mainstream. I don't want to get into that. All I can \nsay is that my view of a Presidential appointment is for the Senate to \nprovide advice and consent--constitutionally required--but to recognize \nthat the President won the election and the Senate has the advise and \nconsent powers, not the House.\n  I have found myself in all kinds of judge fights since I have been \nhere. I was a lawyer before I was a politician. I love the law. What I \nlove about the law is that, in theory, it is a place where the poorest \nguy, the most unpopular person can still get a fair shake. Of course, \nthat wouldn't happen in a political environment. It is a place where \nthe richest guy or gal in town doesn't have to pay because they can \nafford to, only because they have a legal responsibility to. I love the \nidea of an independent judiciary, a jury of one's peers, protecting \npeople's interests in a way politics never could.\n  I would argue that the strength of the rule of law in this country \nhas been our great saving grace. Elections happen all over the Mideast. \nSaddam Hussein got 90-some percent. We haven't been able to get there \nyet. I would argue that electing Saddam Hussein was a joke, that it is \nthe institutions of government that really do provide freedom for \npeople. An independent judiciary has been a Godsend to our country. It \nis not perfect by any means, but it was the courts that basically broke \nthe stronghold of segregation because politically it would have taken \nfar longer to get there.\n  At the end of the day, in Bush v. Gore, maybe one of Vice President \nGore's finest moments contributing to democracy was his acceptance of \nthe ruling of the court. He fought like crazy, he lost a national \nelection by a few hundred votes, all of his supporters are telling him \nthey did this here and they did that there, and the next thing you know \nthe Supreme Court rules 5 to 4, and he graciously accepted the \ndecision.\n\n  What has happened here is that the rules of the Senate have been \nchanged in a very dramatic way for the first time really in 200-some \nyears. Our colleagues on the other side decided that we would no longer \nrequire 60 votes to get a nomination to the floor or to approve a \njudge. Now it is majority rule--majority rule on judicial nominations, \nexcept Supreme Court and executive appointments.\n  A lot of average people might say: Well, they won the election; why \nisn't 51 enough? My response is this: I think we all understand the \nbenefits of being able to slow things down that come out of the House. \nAnd having to pick up some votes from the other side to get the 60 to \npass legislation has probably saved the country a lot of heartache in \nterms of emotional legislation coming through the House to the Senate \nthat would never make it into law. A lot of things I wanted have been \nkilled in the Senate, and a lot of things I hoped never would see the \nlight of day have died in the Senate. So it kind of works out.\n  When it comes to judges, I have tried very hard to make sure that \nRepublican and Democratic Presidents are treated fairly. I do not \nbelieve it is my job as a Senator from South Carolina to vote or block \nan appointment because I wouldn't have chosen that judge.\n  I remember during the Bush Presidency there was a wholesale \nfilibuster of Bush's judicial nominations, and we were thinking about \ndoing the nuclear option. But seven Democrats and seven Republicans \nsaid: Wait a minute. Unless there is an extraordinary circumstance, we \nshouldn't filibuster judges. An extraordinary circumstance really is \nabout qualifications or something unusual.\n  I can say to my Democratic colleagues that we have denied two \njudicial picks by not allowing cloture. If advise and consent means \nanything, it means that, on occasion, you can say no. So there have \nbeen only two.\n  As to the DC Circuit Court, this dispute about how many judges there \nshould be on the DC Circuit Court has been going on at least for a \ndecade--ever since I have been here. The Bush administration wanted to \nadd judges to the DC Circuit because that is the circuit all appeals go \nto when government regulation is challenged by somebody in the private \nsector, an individual or a business. If you want to sue about ObamaCare \nregulations or the detention policy or the NSA's programs, it goes to \nthe DC Circuit. So every President, quite frankly, would like to have \nan advantage there because it protects their administration's policies.\n  I guess what I would say is that changing the rules because we have \nsaid no to two picks--outside of the DC Circuit--was, quite frankly, \nirresponsible, and it is going to change the Senate forever.\n  As to the DC Circuit, no one can say this debate hasn't been going on \nbefore we all got here. Senator Grassley has been the most consistent \nguy in the world about the DC Circuit, even when Republicans were in \ncharge. There are more needs out there. These judges are fine people. \nThey could be put in the other spots where the need is greater.\n  But we are where we are. So our colleagues decided, after two--I \ndon't know how many have been approved, but two have been denied--\nenough is enough on the judge side, along with the attempt to grow the \ncourt in the DC Circuit.\n  We have had disputes about executive nominations. I remember \nAmbassador Bolton. And Mel Watt--really, honest to God, I like Mel. He \nis a great guy. I just don't think he is the right choice for Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac. And to my colleagues here, you are all wonderful \npeople, but there is not one person in the Senate whom I would pick for \nthat job because it has a very technical requirement to it.\n  So here we are.\n  Very quickly--and then I will turn it over to Senator Grassley--what \ndoes this matter in the long term? I think the first casualty of this \nrules change is going to be the judiciary itself, and here is what I \nmean by that. Now that we don't have to cross the aisle to pick up a \nfew votes to get to 60 when there is a disagreement--and these are very \nrare; we don't filibuster everybody; they are fairly rare--we are going \nto have more ideological-driven picks on judicial nominations because \nonce the filtering device of having to at least talk to the other side \nis removed, once that no longer exists, the pressure in the conference \nto pick the most ideologically pure, hardnosed, fire-breathing liberal \nor conservative is going to be immense.\n  So what my colleagues have done is they have changed the face of the \njudiciary probably forever. And shame on you. I think that is going to \nbe your legacy that will stand out long after all of us have gone \nbecause I don't see how you go back and put this genie in the bottle.\n  I think we are going to find that judicial selections in the future \nare going to be those whom the most rabid partisans are going to pick--\nthe most faithful to the cause, not the most faithful to the law.\n  I don't know what it is like on the Democratic side, but I can tell \nyou what it will be like on the Republican side.\n  There are a lot of people out there who have a list of judges they \nwant to see on the court--yesterday. Some of these people are going to \nbe tough for you to swallow, and I am sure you will do the same to us.\n  What you are doing is making the majority self-regulated. There is no \nlonger the excuse, for lack of a better word: I can't ``push'' this \nperson through because I have to get somebody in. Those who want to \nmake sure they are picking the best person who is not an ideologue, you \nare going to have a hard time of it.\n  I think the judiciary is the biggest casualty over time, only equal \nto the Senate itself. It will not be long--and I don't know how long it \nwill be--before the rules change for Supreme Court picks, because there \nwill be replacements of several members of the Supreme Court in the \nnext decade. That is just the way the life is. There will be opposition \nfrom the party out of power. There will be frustration. Somebody will \nbe blocked that makes the party in power mad and they are going to \nchange the rules. That is just going to happen. We are now about \noutcomes. We are not about process.\n  The Senate is slowly but surely becoming the House, where winner \ntakes all and ends justify the means: Anything you can do over there, \nwe will do over here. That is just the way it is going to be.\n  It will not be much longer until we have a Senate and a House and a \nWhite\n\n[[Page S8625]]\n\nHouse in one party--as happens every now and then--and there is going \nto be a centerpiece of legislation that has been the Holy Grail to that \nparty that is an absolute nightmare to the other side; it is going to \npass the House on a party-line vote, it is going to come to the Senate, \nand somebody is going to get frustrated and say: I have 51-plus votes. \nI may have 57 votes. I don't have 60. And they are going to change the \nrule on legislation because the pressure to do it, now that we have \ngone down this road, is going to be immense. I am by no means perfect. \nBut when this happened on our watch, I tried to find a way to avoid it. \nBut we are where we are.\n  Finally, about ObamaCare. Let me tell you from a Member of Congress \npoint of view something you should consider. All of us are Federal \nemployees and we get a subsidy for our health care premiums similar to \nevery other fellow employee. It is not a unique deal to Congress. If \nyou are a member of the Federal Government, you get up to 72 percent of \nyour premium subsidized. Other employers do that, but it is a darned \ngood deal that is available to all Federal employees.\n  Again, I compliment Senator Grassley. He said: If we are going to \nhave ObamaCare, we ought to be in it. We, the Congress, and our staffs. \nUnder the law that was passed--I think Senator Grassley was the \noriginator of this idea--Members of Congress and our staffs have to go \ninto the exchanges. But we have the ability to go into the District of \nColumbia exchange, and the law is written such--and every Member of \nCongress who takes this subsidy is entitled to do it. I don't blame \nthem one bit. You have to go into the exchange, and your premiums are \ngoing to go up, but the subsidy will continue.\n  Senator Vitter believes, and so do I, that because we are leaders we \nshould take the road less traveled and experience more pain than those \nwho follow. So I have been of the opinion that if you are going to \nchange this law, the Congress should not only go into the exchange, we \nshouldn't get a subsidy any longer. Why? Because most Americans are \ngoing to lose their employer-sponsored health care as it exists today--\nmaybe not in total but their premiums are going to go up dramatically \nbecause employers cannot afford to pay the increased premium under the \nold system. So they will either lose employer-sponsored health care and \nbecome an individual or they are going to have to pay more because \ntheir employer is in a bind and they can't afford the subsidies that \nonce existed--because premiums for employers, similar to individuals, \nare going to go through the roof.\n  I wish to give an example about what I have chosen to do. I have \nchosen not to go into the DC exchange but to enroll in South Carolina \nbecause that is where I live. Enrolling in the South Carolina exchange, \nI will not get a subsidy. That was my choice. I accept that choice. Why \nam I doing this? To try to lead by example what I think is coming to a \nlot of Americans in some form or another.\n  So here is what happens with me: Under the old system, I was paying \n$186 a month. If I went into the DC exchange, my premiums would go up \nbut not a huge amount. But now that I am enrolling as a 58-year-old \nshort White guy in South Carolina, my premiums are based on the county \nI live in and my age, with no subsidy, because I make too much money to \nget a subsidy. People at my income level don't deserve a subsidy \nbecause it would bankrupt the Nation more than we are already doing if \nwe did that.\n  Under ObamaCare in South Carolina, I chose the Bronze plan. Why? It \nis the cheapest one I could find. I am not independently wealthy. I \nmake a very good living as a Member of the Senate, almost $180,000, but \nat the end of the day here is what is coming my way:\n  My premium goes up to $572 a month from $186. That is $400 a month, \nalmost, a 200-percent increase.\n  Under my old health plan if I went to the doctor, I paid a $20 copay. \nUnder the new Bronze plan, I pay $50.\n  Under the old plan if I saw a specialist, it was $30. Under the new \nplan, it is $100.\n  My old deductible was $350 a year. My new deductible is $6,350--a \n$6,000 increase.\n  My old plan had a $5,000 out-of-pocket limit. The new one is $6,350.\n  You also get rated not just on your age but where you live. I am \npaying $70 a month more than a county that is 40 miles away.\n  The bottom line is that what I am experiencing a lot of other people \nare going to experience. I am paying a lot more for a lot less. How can \nthat be?\n  When you are told that you get more and you pay less and a politician \ntells you that, you ought to be very leery. That hasn't worked out in \nmy life: You are going to get a lot more, but you are going to pay \nless.\n  The reason these premiums are going up is that all the uninsured--and \nI want to provide coverage to the uninsured as much as anybody else--\nget insurance coverage with a subsidy. Who is paying those subsidies? \nThe rest of us.\n  So we are going to see next year employers having to back out of \nemployer-sponsored health care either in total or in part. What we are \ngoing to find throughout this country is that people who had employer-\nsponsored health care, just like the individual markets, their premiums \nare going to skyrocket--maybe not as much as mine, maybe not 200 \npercent. The deductibles are going to go up--maybe not as much as mine \nat $6,000, but everybody in the country doesn't make $176,000.\n  So every Member of Congress should look at what would your life be \nlike if you didn't have a Federal Government subsidy, if you didn't \nenroll in the DC exchange, if you went back home and had to pick a plan \nsimilar to everybody else in your State? You ought to sit down and look \nat what your individual life would be like. If you just look, you will \nbe shocked. I sure was.\n  This is not about me, even though I am giving you an example about \nmyself. It is about an idea called ObamaCare that is going to destroy \nhealth care as we know it in the name of saving it and making it \nbetter.\n  I think we all agree we need to reform health care. But I think most \nAmericans believe their old health care system was working pretty good \nfor them, but it could always be made better.\n  So I would ask every Member of Congress, whether you go into your \nState exchange, if one exists, or not, do the math. You are going to be \nshocked at how it would affect you. Let me tell you, it is going to \naffect people you represent in similar fashion.\n  So what do you do? Why don't we just try to sit down and start over \nand see if we can do better before it is too late?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                              Unemployment\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, there is a reason why the favorability \nrating of the Congress is somewhere, on a good day, around 10 percent. \nThe reason I think is pretty simple: The American people are hurting. \nThey look to their elected officials to try to do something to address \nthe problems they have and the crises facing our country. Time after \ntime, they see the Congress not only not responding to the needs they \nface but in many cases doing exactly the opposite. In poll after poll, \nthe American people tell us the most pressing issue they face deals \nwith the economy and high unemployment.\n  When we look in the newspapers, we are told the official unemployment \nrate is 7 percent. By the way, that is a rate which has in recent \nmonths gone down, and that is a good thing. But the truth is, if you \ninclude people who have given up looking for work and people who are \nworking part time when they want to work full time, real unemployment \nin this country is 13.2 percent. That is enormously high.\n  The unemployment rate for our young people is close to 20 percent, \nand there are parts of the country where it is higher than that. \nAfrican-American youth unemployment is close to 40 percent.\n  So what we are looking at all over this country are millions and \nmillions of people who want jobs, who want to work, and who can't find \nthose jobs. We are looking at a younger generation of workers who \ncannot get into the economy. If you are a young person and you leave \nhigh school, for example, and you can't get a job in your first year \nout there or your second year, if you think\n\n[[Page S8626]]\n\nthis does not have a cataclysmic impact on your confidence, on your \nself-esteem, you are very mistaken.\n  I fear very much and worry very much about the millions of young \npeople out there who are not in school, who are not working. \nTragically, many of those young people will end up on drugs. Some of \nthem are going to end up in jail. These are issues we have to consider.\n  What the American people tell us over and over is: Yes, the deficit \nis a serious problem. I believe it is. Everybody in the Congress \nbelieves it is. But what the American people also say is: High \nunemployment is an even more serious issue.\n  According to a March 2013 Gallup poll, 75 percent of the American \npeople, including 56 percent of Republicans, 74 percent of \nIndependents, and 93 percent of Democrats, support ``a Federal job \ncreation law that would spend government money for a program designed \nto create more than 1 million new jobs.''\n  What the American people are saying is, yes, we have made progress in \nthe last 4 years. We have cut the deficit in half. We have to do more. \nBut what the American people are saying loudly and clearly is that we \nneed to create jobs.\n  What they also understand, and poll after poll indicates this, is \nthat when we have an infrastructure that is crumbling--roads, bridges, \nwater systems, wastewater plants, our rail system--when we have an \ninfrastructure that is crumbling, we need to invest in rebuilding that \ninfrastructure. When we do that, we create significant numbers of jobs. \nThat is what the American people want us to do. When is the last time \nyou even heard that debate here on the floor of the Senate?\n  The unemployment crisis, the need to create jobs--that is what the \nAmerican people want us to do, and we are not even talking about that \nissue.\n  There is a second issue about which the American people are very \nclear. It is a funny thing--sometimes the media writes about how \npartisan the Congress is, how divisive the Congress is. Senator \nGrassley and I supposedly hate each other, we do not talk to each \nother, and all that nonsense. That is not the reality. The truth is \nthat among the American people, surprisingly enough, there is a lot of \nconsensus. I mentioned a moment ago that the American people very \nstrongly believe that we should invest in our infrastructure and create \njobs. Unfortunately, that is not what we are doing.\n  Here is another issue about which the American people are loud and \nclear. They understand that--tragically in today's economy--most of the \nnew jobs that are being created are not good-paying jobs. That is the \nsad reality. Most of the new jobs that are being created in today's \neconomy are low wage jobs and many of them are part-time jobs. If you \nare making $8 or $9 an hour and you are working 30 hours a week, you \nare going to have a very hard time supporting yourself, let alone a \nfamily.\n  What do the American people say? They say raise the minimum wage. \nRaise the minimum wage.\n  Let me quote from today's Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Americans strongly favor boosting the Federal minimum wage \n     to $10.10 an hour but oppose raising it above that, a Wall \n     Street Journal/NBC News poll finds. In the survey, 63 percent \n     supported a rise to $10.10 an hour from the current $7.25 \n     rate.\n\n  Sixty-three percent of the American people support that. Democrats \nstrongly support it, Independents support it, and many Republicans \nsupport it. One would think, therefore, when the vast majority of the \nAmerican people understand that $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage and \nthat we need to raise the minimum wage to at least $10.10 an hour, we \nwould be moving on it. Maybe we would get a UC on it, a unanimous \nconsent. Let's get it done. I fear very much that right here in the \nSenate we are going to have a very difficult time gaining 60 votes. I \nhope I am wrong, I sincerely do, but I am not aware at this point that \nthere are any Republicans prepared to support an increase of the \nminimum wage to $10 an hour. I believe in the Republican-controlled \nHouse it would be extremely difficult to get legislation widely \nsupported by the American people through that body.\n  But not only will my Republican colleagues not do what the American \npeople want in terms of raising the minimum wage, quite incredibly, I \nhave to tell you that many of my Republican colleagues do not believe \nin the concept of the minimum wage. Many of them believe we should \nabolish the concept of the minimum wage, so that if you are in a \nsituation in a high-unemployment area where workers are desperate for \nwork and an employer says: Here is $4 an hour; take it or leave it, \nthat is OK for some of my Republican colleagues.\n  Again, we are in a situation where the vast majority of the American \npeople want to do something about low wages. They want to raise the \nminimum wage, and we are going to have a very difficult time getting \nthat legislation through. I hope I am wrong, but I do know that unless \nthe American people stand up, get on the phone, start calling their \nSenators and Members of Congress, we probably will not succeed in doing \nwhat the American people want.\n  Interestingly enough, what the American people also understand is \nthat raising the minimum wage will help us with the Federal deficit in \na variety of ways. It may be a surprise to some Americans to know that \nthe largest welfare recipient in the United States of America happens, \ncoincidentally, to be the wealthiest family in America. The Walton \nfamily, which owns Walmart, is worth about $100 billion. They are the \nwealthiest family in America. They own more wealth as one family than \nthe bottom 40 percent of the American people--extraordinary wealth. One \nof the reasons they are so wealthy is the American taxpayer subsidizes \nWalmart because Walmart pays low wages, provides minimal benefits, and \nmany of their workers end up on Medicaid, they end up on food stamps, \nand they end up in government-subsidized housing. I am not quite sure \nwhy the middle-class working families of this country have to subsidize \nthe Walton family because they pay wages that are inadequate for their \nworkers to live a dignified life.\n  My hope is that when the American people are loud and clear about the \nneed to raise the minimum wage, their Congress will respond, but I have \nto tell you that I have my doubts.\n  What we also hear--and most recently from Pope Francis--is an \nunderstanding that there is something profoundly wrong about a nation \nand increasingly a world in which so few have so much and so many have \nso little. In the United States of America today we have more wealth \nand income inequality than at any time since the late 1920s, and we \nhave more wealth and income inequality than any other major country on \nEarth. Today the top 1 percent of our population owns 38 percent of the \nwealth of America, financial wealth of this country, and the bottom 60 \npercent owns 2.3 percent. The top 1 percent owns 38 percent of the \nwealth of America, and the bottom 60 percent owns 2.3 percent. Is that \nreally what America is supposed to be about? I think not. I think Pope \nFrancis recently talked about that issue. He talked about the moral \naspects of that issue. He is exactly right.\n  Those are some of the issues we have to talk about.\n  Another issue out there that I think we have to be very clear about--\nand again the American people are extraordinarily clear about this--the \nAmerican people understand that Social Security has been probably the \nmost successful Federal program in the modern history of this country. \nFor the last 70-plus years it has kept seniors out of poverty. In fact, \nbefore Social Security 50 percent of seniors in this country lived in \npoverty. Today that number, while too high, is about 9.5 percent. That \nis a significant improvement. And Social Security, despite what is \ngoing on in the economy--in good times and bad times--has never once \nfailed to pay all of the benefits owed to every eligible American.\n\n  Today Social Security has a $2.7 trillion surplus. It can pay every \nbenefit owed to every eligible American for the next 20 years. Do you \nknow what the American people say about Social Security? They say it \nloudly and clearly. Republicans say it, Independents say it, and \nDemocrats say it. Do not cut Social Security. Do not cut Social \nSecurity. Yet I have to tell you that virtually all Republicans think \nwe should cut Social Security. Some Democrats believe we should cut \nSocial Security. The President of the United States has talked about a \nchained CPI--a very bad idea--about cutting Social Security.\n\n[[Page S8627]]\n\n  Maybe we should listen to the American people and make it very clear: \nNo, we are not going to cut Social Security. In fact, we are going to \ntake a new look at Social Security and see how we can make it solvent \nnot just for 20 years but for 50 years and in addition to that increase \nbenefits. There are pretty easy ways to do that, including lifting the \ncap on taxable income that goes into the Social Security trust fund. As \nyou know, today, if somebody makes $100 million and somebody makes \n$113,000, they both contribute the same amount into the Social Security \ntrust fund. Lift that cap. You can start at $250,000, and you will \nsolve the Social Security solvency issue for the next 50 or 60 years. \nThat is exactly what we should do, and that is what the American people \nwant us to do.\n  In terms of Medicare, people say Medicare has financial problems, and \nit does. The issue--and interestingly enough, it gets back to what \nSenator Graham was talking about. He was talking about his health care \nplan in South Carolina. It sounds like a pretty bad plan to me, I agree \nwith him. What is the issue there? The issue we have to look at, which \nwe don't for obvious issues, is how does it happen that in the United \nStates of America--before the Affordable Care Act; things will change a \nlittle bit--before the Affordable Care Act, we have 48 million people \nwho are uninsured, we have tens of millions more people who have high \ndeductibles, like Senator Graham--a $6,000 deductible is \nincomprehensible--and high copayments. At the end of the day, 48 \nmillion people uninsured, high deductibles, high copayments, health \noutcomes that are not particularly good--better than some countries, \nworse than other countries--infant mortality worse, longevity worse, \nlife expectancy worse, yet we end up spending twice as much per person \non health care as any other nation. How does that happen? How do we \nspend so much and get so little value? Is that an issue we are prepared \nto discuss? I guess not because the private insure companies say: Don't \ntalk about that. We are making a whole lot of money out of the current \nhealth care system, including the Affordable Care Act. We make a lot of \nmoney, our CEOs do. Yes, we are spending 30 cents of every dollar on \nadministrative costs, on bureaucracy, on advertising. Don't touch that \nbecause that is the American health care system. I suggest we have to \ntake a hard look at what goes on in the rest of the world.\n  People have said we have the best health care system in the world. \nThat is not what the American people say. The polls I have seen show \nthat there is less satisfaction with our system than exists in other \ncountries around the world, for obvious reasons. We spend a lot. We get \nrelatively little.\n  Are we prepared as a Congress to stand up to the insurance companies? \nAre we prepared to stand up to the drug companies that charge us far \nhigher prices for prescription drugs than any other country on Earth? \nAre we prepared to stand up to the medical equipment suppliers?\n  I don't think so because that gets us into the issue of campaign \nfinance, where people get their money to run for office, because these \nguys contribute a whole lot of money.\n  Are we prepared to stand up to Wall Street? We have six financial \ninstitutions on Wall Street that have assets of over $9 trillion--\nequivalent to two-thirds of the GDP of the United States of America. \nThey write half of the mortgages in this country, two-thirds of the \ncredit cards. Do you think maybe it is time to break up these guys or \nare we going to march down the path of too big to fail and have to bail \nthem out again? Do you hear a whole lot of discussion about that, Mr. \nPresident? No, not too often.\n  Let me conclude. We had the president of the World Bank here \nyesterday talking about global warming. As I think most people know, \nthe entire--well, virtually the entire scientific community, people who \nstudy the issue of global warming, understands that the planet is \nwarming significantly, that it is already causing devastating problems, \nthat the issue is manmade, and that if we do not address this crisis by \ncutting greenhouse gas emissions and moving away from fossil fuels, the \nhabitability of this planet for our kids and our grandchildren will be \nvery much in question. That is what the scientific community says. Have \nyou heard any debate on this floor about how we are going to \naggressively transform our energy system? We do not do it.\n  Let me conclude by saying this. There is a reason the Congress has a \nfavorability rating of about 10 percent, and that is that the American \npeople are hurting and we are not responding to that pain. We are not \naddressing the many crises facing this country, and the American people \nare saying to Congress: What world do you live in? How about joining \nour world? How about changing your attention to our needs?\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are in postcloture debate on the \nnominee for the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia. I want to \nspeak on that nomination, but I am also going to take time to speak on \nissues dealing with the Defense Department, the farm bill, and the new \nnominee for the Department of Homeland Security.\n  I will take a few minutes to discuss the President's ongoing scheme \nto stack the DC Circuit with committed ideologues so that the \nPresident's regulatory agenda doesn't run into judicial roadblocks.\n  Yesterday, the Senate confirmed the first of three nominees to the DC \nCircuit that the court does not need. Let me emphasize that: Does not \nneed. Of course, the Senate denied its consent on these nominees just a \nfew short weeks ago.\n  Some may ask: What has changed during that time? The vote count \ncertainly has not changed. It is not as if Democrats persuaded some of \ntheir Republicans colleagues to change their minds.\n  That is what you would expect in a body that operates based upon \nrules that guarantee the minority a voice. That is what you would \nexpect in what is supposed to be the greatest deliberative body on \nEarth. That is what you would expect under normal circumstances, but as \nI explained in an earlier speech this week on another nominee for the \nsame court, these are not normal circumstances.\n  No, today's circumstances are different.\n  Today the President's legislative agenda cannot get traction in \nCongress. And, no, it is not because Republicans will not negotiate \nwith the President. It is because the President of the United States is \nout of step with the American people.\n  Today the President's signature health care law, which was passed \nwithout a single Republican vote, is becoming more and more unpopular \nwith each passing day. And no, it is not because the administration has \nnot done a good job of ``messaging'' ObamaCare. It is precisely because \nof that message.\n  Today, the President can't get climate change legislation passed by \nCongress, and, no, it is not simply because of Republican opposition. \nIt is because the President's agenda is too extreme even for some \nSenate Democrats.\n  The President and his agenda are out of step with the American \npeople, and as a result, he cannot get his agenda adopted in this \nCongress. But that doesn't seem to matter to the radical liberal \ninterest groups who support these policy initiatives. They want \nresults--no matter what.\n  These liberal interest groups are not satisfied with constitutional \nseparation of powers. They want the President and his allies in the \nSenate to do whatever it takes to get the same results they would get \nif there were 535 Members of Congress just as liberal as the President.\n  Those interest groups want the President to legislate by executive \norder and by administrative action. They want the President to suspend \nthe law when it suits his purposes, just as the English kings used to \ndo. In fact, the reason our Constitution requires--and let me emphasize \nrequires--the President to ``faithfully'' execute the law is because \nthe English kings would unilaterally--and selectively--suspend laws \npassed by the parliament. But none of this matters to the liberal \ninterest groups. They want results--no matter what.\n  In fact, the President has made such a practice of legislating by \nExecutive Order and administrative action, that he has created the \nexpectation among\n\n[[Page S8628]]\n\nhis most faithful supporters that there is nothing he cannot do \nunilaterally.\n  Just a week or two ago, the President was delivering a speech in \nCalifornia when one of his own supporters interrupted and heckled him \nfor not issuing an executive order to stop all deportations.\n  The heckler shouted:\n\n       Use your executive order to halt deportations of 11.5 \n     million undocumented immigrants in this country. You have the \n     power to stop deportations right now.\n\n  The President responded:\n\n       Actually, I don't. We are a nation of laws.\n\n  I must say, I understand the confusion. The most extreme elements of \nthe President's supporters have witnessed him pick and choose which \nlaws he will faithfully execute and which he will suspend, or as the \nPresident likes to say, ``waive.'' So, it is no wonder that those \nsupporters would say: Just issue an executive order. We want results.\n  It is just like King George III.\n  It is no wonder that those supporters would say: We don't care that \nthere isn't support in the Congress to pass legislation imposing cap-\nand-trade fee increases. We want results\n  Just like King George III.\n  It is no wonder that those supporters would say: We don't care if \nDemocrats block judges to the DC Circuit based on the standards the \nRepublicans are applying today. That was then, this is now. We want \nresults.\n  Just like King George III.\n  It is no wonder that those supporters would say: We don't care about \ntwo centuries of Senate history and tradition that has been passed down \nfaithfully from one majority leader to the next. We want results.\n  Just like King George III.\n  Climate change regulations are too important. Salvaging ObamaCare is \ntoo important.\n  So as we all know, the majority buckled to the pressure from these \nextreme liberal interest groups and broke the rules of the Senate to \nchange the rules. They tossed aside two centuries of Senate history and \ntradition. This history and tradition--until 2 weeks ago--had been \ncarefully guarded and preserved by each succeeding majority leader.\n  Those leaders remembered the history of King George III.\n  They did all of this just so they could install the President's hand-\npicked judges, so they could hear challenges to his signature health \ncare law and to the rest of his regulatory agenda, such as climate \nchange regulation.\n  But when a President selects a nominee for the specific purpose of \nrubberstamping his agenda--an agenda that has proven too extreme for \neven Members of his own party--he needs a judge who can be counted upon \nto follow through.\n  Given that it is inappropriate to ask prospective nominees how they \nwould rule on particular cases, how would this White House make certain \nthat their nominees would follow through and rubberstamp the \nPresident's agenda?\n  Based upon Professor Pillard's record--and that is the nominee we \nwill be voting on tomorrow--apparently the White House looked out over \nacademia and selected the most liberal nominee they could find.\n  Because Professor Pillard fits that bill to a T.\n  I have heard my colleagues come to the floor and argue that these \nnominees to the DC Circuit are mainstream. Professor Pillard may be a \nfine person, but make no mistake about it, she is not mainstream. She \nis the furthest thing from it.\n  I am sure that the White House is confident she can be counted upon \nto rubberstamp its agenda, but don't confuse her views with the \nmainstream of American legal tradition. I have a sampling of things she \nhas written and said. I will read some of what she has written, and I \nthen ask you to determine if she is mainstream.\n  She has written this about abortion:\n\n       Casting reproductive rights in terms of equality holds \n     promise to recenter the debate towards the real stakes for \n     women (and men) of unwanted pregnancy and away from the \n     deceptive images of fetus-as-autonomous-being that the anti-\n     choice movement has popularized.\n\n  Think of ``deceptive images of fetus-as-autonomous-being.'' Is that \nmainstream?\n  She argued this about motherhood:\n\n       Reproductive rights, including the rights to contraception \n     and abortion, play a central role in freeing women from \n     historically routine conscription into maternity.\n\n  Now, think about that: ``historically routine constriction into \nmaternity.'' Is that mainstream?\n  She has also argued this about motherhood:\n\n       Antiabortion laws and other restraints on reproductive \n     freedom not only enforce women's incubation of unwanted \n     pregnancies, but also prescribe a ``vision of the woman's \n     role'' as mother and caretaker of children in a way that is \n     at odds with equal protection.\n\n  Is that in the mainstream?\n  What about her views on religious freedom? This really ought to shock \nyou. She argued that the Supreme Court case of Hosanna-Tabor \nEvangelical Lutheran Church, which challenged the so-called \n``ministerial exception'' to employment discrimination represented a \n``substantial threat to the American rule of law.''\n  The Supreme Court rejected her view 9 to 0. Nine to zero. And the \nCourt held that ``it is impermissible for the government to contradict \na church's determination of who can act as its ministers.''\n  Do my colleagues honestly believe that it is within the mainstream to \nargue that churches shouldn't be allowed to choose their own ministers? \nI don't think so.\n  I asked Professor Pillard about Hosanna-Tabor and religious freedom \nat her hearing. She testified this way:\n\n       And I have to admit, Senator Grassley . . . I really called \n     it wrong on that case. I did not predict that the Court would \n     rule as it did.\n\n  In other words, she tried to dodge the question by leaving the \ncommittee members with the impression that she had merely taken a stab \nat predicting the case's outcome and that she had gotten it wrong.\n  Of course, I wasn't troubled that Professor Pillard had wrongly \npredicted the outcome. I was troubled because she actually argued that \na ruling in favor of the church would represent a ``substantial threat \nto the American rule of law.''\n  I don't believe that there is a single Member of this body on either \nside of the aisle who would subscribe to that argument anymore than the \nnine justices of the Supreme Court did. If I am wrong about that, then \nI would like to hear the Senator explain how it is mainstream to argue \nthat granting our churches the latitude to choose their own ministers \nrepresents a ``substantial threat to the American rule of law.''\n  These are the so-called ``mainstream views'' the President wants to \ninstall on a court that will hear challenges to his most important \npriorities. Is it any wonder that the President apparently has high \nconfidence will Professor Pillard rubberstamp his agenda?\n  Before I close, let me make one final point.\n  Given the circumstances surrounding how these nominees were selected \nand nominated;\n  Given all three were nominated simultaneously for the purpose of \nchanging judicial outcomes and rubberstamping the President's agenda;\n  Given they were nominated and rammed through the process, without \nregard to the fact that there is not even enough work for them to do;\n  Given the President was originally denied consent under the Rules of \nthe Senate;\n  Given that the President and certain far-left liberal interest groups \nsuccessfully persuaded the majority of the Senate to cast aside two \ncenturies of Senate history and tradition in order to get them \nconfirmed;\n  And given the extremely liberal record I discussed;\n  If you were a litigant challenging the President, or one of his \nadministrative actions and you drew a panel comprised of Professor \nPillard, Millett, and Judge Wilkins, can you honestly say that you \nwould be confident you would get a fair shake?\n\n  Of course not.\n  And that, my colleagues, is a sad commentary on the damage the \nPresident and the Senate majority have inflicted not only on the Senate \nbut also on our judiciary and fundamental notions of the rule of law.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Pillard nomination.\n\n\n                 How the Audit Process was Compromised\n\n  For several years, I have been trying to get the Defense Department \ninspector general to do its job, and I have had\n\n[[Page S8629]]\n\nseveral investigations, a lot of them implemented because of \ninformation that comes to me from whistleblowers. I will speak to that \npoint now and talk about two important audits bungled by the Department \nof Defense inspector general's office.\n  There is something very important I need to say right upfront. A \nbrandnew inspector general, Mr. Jon Rymer, is now in place. The events \nI am about to describe happened a few years ago, but none reflect on \nhis leadership which I hope will bring about a big change in the \ninspector general's office at the Department of Defense.\n  When faced with a frontal assault on its audit authority by the \ntarget of one of its audits, senior IG officials got a bad case of weak \nknees and caved under pressure. They trashed high-quality audit work \nthat was critical of a certified public accounting firm and its \nopinions. In doing this, they covered up reportable deficiencies, they \nallowed the audit target to run roughshod over sacred oversight \nprerogatives, without uttering one word of protest or asking one single \nquestion.\n  I am talking about audits of the financial statements produced by the \nDepartment's Central Accounting Office. This is what I refer to as \nDFAS, which stands for Defense Finance and Accounting Services. The \naudits were conducted by a CPA firm, but supposedly under the watchful \neye of the inspector general, or IG, but not really under his eye.\n  The story of the two bungled audits is told in an oversight report \nwhich I have now posted on my Web site.\n  While I received the first anonymous email on this matter in April of \n2012, my audit oversight work actually began more than 5 years ago. It \nwas triggered by a steady stream of tips from whistleblowers \ncomplaining about the quality of these audits. These reports then \ngrabbed my attention.\n  My colleagues may wonder why the Senator from Iowa is down in the \nweeds in such arcane issues. The reason is simple. It is the importance \nof audits.\n  Audits are probably the primary oversight tool for rooting out fraud \nand waste in the government. To protect the taxpayers, Congress needs \nto ensure that government audits are as good as they can be. They must \nproduce tangible results. They must be able to detect theft, waste, \nmismanagement, and then recommend corrective action.\n  With mounting pressure for serious belt-tightening under \nsequestration, audits have taken on an even greater importance. Audits \nshould help senior management separate the wheat from the chaff and \napply mandated cuts where they belong. Sequestration cuts should be \nguided by hard-hitting, rock-solid audits. Unfortunately, rock-solid \naudits produced by the inspector general's office are hard to come by, \nand that is the problem.\n  After evaluating hundreds of audits, I issued three oversight reports \nin the years 2010 and 2012. With a few notable exceptions, I found that \nthe inspector general's Audits were weak, ineffective, and wasteful--\nwasteful when we consider that we spend $100 million a year to produce \nthem. Poor leadership is part of the problem, but there is still \nanother driver; that is, the Department's broken accounting system. It \nallows fraud and waste to go undetected and unchecked. That is bad \nenough, but the lack of credible financial information makes it very \ndifficult to produce hard-hitting audits. Auditors are forced to do \naudit trail reconstruction work to connect the dots on the money trails \nand, of course, that is very labor intensive, very time-consuming work.\n  Although the Department continues to spend billions to fix the busted \naccounting system, I am sorry to say it is still not working right. The \nDepartment cannot pass the Chief Financial Officers Act audit test. It \nis unable to accurately report on how the taxpayers' money is spent as \nit is required to do each year under that law. By comparison, every \nother Federal agency has passed that test. Why not the Department of \nDefense?\n  So long as the accounting system is dysfunctional, audits will remain \nweak and ineffective and the probability of rooting out much fraud and \nwaste during sequestration is low--and then still continuing to waste \n$100 million that we spend on the inspector general's office.\n  While I am talking about the need for better audits, I would like to \noffer a word of encouragement to the Special Inspector General for \nAfghanistan Reconstruction, John Sopko. He is the head of SIGAR, which \nis the name for the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan, or \nSIGAR, for short. SIGAR is cranking out aggressive, hard-hitting \naudits, and I commend SIGAR for doing that--setting a good example. The \naudits I am about to discuss, by contrast, deserve darts, not laurels.\n\n  I first came to the floor to speak on this subject on November 14, \n2012. At that point, I completed a preliminary review of seven red \nflags or potential problem areas that popped up on my radar screen. \nSince then, I have double-checked the facts. I have confirmed my \npreliminary observations. I did this by examining the official audit \nrecords known as work papers. So I will not walk the same ground again \ntonight. Instead, I will briefly summarize what I did, how I did it, \nwhat I found, why it is important, and offer some fixes for \nconsideration.\n  To conduct this investigation, I had to examine literally thousands \nof documents. I could not have done it without the help and guidance of \nCPA-qualified government auditors. Evidence uncovered in the work \npapers were validated with interviews and written inquiries with \nknowledgeable officials. Together, these tell the story of what \nhappened and of course it is not a pretty picture.\n  True, my report is nothing more than a snapshot in time, but if this \nsnapshot accurately reflects the work being produced by the IG audit \noffice, then we have big problems.\n  In a nutshell, this is what I found out: A CPA firm, Urbach Kahn & \nWerlin, which goes by UKW, had awarded an unblemished string of seven \nclean opinions on the central accounting agency's financial statements. \nThen the IG stepped in and took a 2-year snapshot for fiscal years 2008 \nand 2009. It was supposed to report on whether those statements and \nopinions met prescribed audit standards, but due to a series of ethical \nblunders, that job was never finished.\n  A third review was planned for 2010, but after the 2008-2009 fiasco, \nit was canceled, allowing DFAS--the Defense, Finance, and Accounting \nService--it allowed DFAS to rack up another string of clean opinions \nthrough last year. All together, this work probably costs the taxpayers \nin excess of $20 million.\n  The work performed by DFAS in 2008 and 2009 was substandard. The \noutside audit firm rubberstamped DFAS's flawed practices using \ndefective audit methods.\n  For its part, the inspector general was prepared to call foul on the \nCPA firm for substandard work but got sidetracked and then steamrolled \nby DFAS. The contract gave the IG preeminent oversight authority to \naccept or reject the firm's opinions. The whole purpose of the contract \nwas to position the auditors to make that determination. If the firm's \nopinions met prescribed standards, they would be endorsed. If not, the \nIG would issue a nonendorsement report.\n  On both the fiscal year 2008 and 2009 audits, the record clearly \nindicates the IG's audit team determined that the firm's opinions did \nnot meet prescribed standards. They did not merit endorsement. Though I \ncannot cite work papers to prove it, whistleblowers alleged that top \nmanagement ordered them to endorse the 2008 opinion with this caveat: \nIf known deficiencies were not corrected in the 2009 opinion, a \nnonendorsement was guaranteed. When the very same deficiencies popped \nup again--in other words, in 2009 as they did in 2008--the auditors \nprepared a hard-hitting nonendorsement report as promised. It was even \nsigned. The transmittal letter was ready to go out the door.\n  The nonendorsement decision had been communicated to DFAS via email \nin unmistakable terms. In line with that decision and contract \nrequirements, the IG took steps to cut off payment to the CPA firm \nbased on advice of the inspector general's legal counsel.\n  The next step was to issue the nonendorsement report. But this is \nwhere the inspector general chickened out. In a power vacuum, DFAS \nmoved swiftly to block the report with a blatant end-run maneuver to \nbypass independent oversight. So DFAS literally neutered independent \noversight by the inspector general with two bold moves: On the\n\n[[Page S8630]]\n\nsame day the IG's office notified DFAS in writing that a nonendorsement \nreport would be forthcoming, DFAS unilaterally and proudly declared \nthat it had earned a clean opinion and ordered that all disputed \ninvoices be paid. This was an act of out-and-out defiance.\n  Next, it kicked the IG off the contract. Yes, my colleagues heard me \nright. The agency being audited literally kicked the inspector \ngeneral--the oversight agency--clean off the oversight contract. In \nmaking this end-run maneuver, DFAS broke every rule in the audit book.\n  What happened was a frontal assault on the inspector general's \noversight authority. The frontal assault was mounted by the agency \nbeing subjected to the audit and by an agency whose financial reports \nwere found to be grossly deficient. In the face of such outright \ndefiance, I would like to think that any inspector general would have \nstood up to the offending agency and held its ground and protected and \ndefended its oversight prerogatives. That is the law--but not the \nDepartment of Defense inspector general.\n  Instead, the IG's knees buckled under pressure. The IG retreated \nbefore the onslaught. The IG caved and trashed the report. The IG \nrolled over and played possum, giving DFAS the green light to proceed \nfull speed ahead.\n  The IG accepted these blatant transgressions without expressing one \nword of criticism, without expressing one concern, without raising one \nsingle question.\n  Other than a lone hotline complaint that disappeared down a black \nhole, no protest was ever lodged, no corrective action was ever \nproposed, and obviously no corrective action ever taken.\n  The inspector general's silence appeared to signal total acquiescence \nto a series of actions that undermine the integrity of the audit \nprocess, which is the basis for ferreting out waste, fraud and \nmismanagement and illegal activity.\n  For a Senator who watches the watchdogs, what I see is a disgrace to \nthe entire inspector general community. The IG allowed DFAS to run \nroughshod over the contract, the IG Act, audit standards, and \nindependent oversight. The audit firm probably got paid for the work \nthat was never performed--payments that were alleged to be improper.\n  Instead of exposing poor practices and improper actions by both the \naccounting agency and the CPA firm, the Office of Inspector General \nallowed sacred principles to be trampled. It just kept quiet. It turned \na blind eye to what was going on. It hunkered down. It tried to cover \nits tracks.\n  Two misguided acts set the stage for the collapse of oversight of \nthese audits.\n  The problem began with the contract. At the insistence of the \nDepartment's chief financial officer and accounting agency, the IG \nagreed to a contractual arrangement that put DFAS--the target of the \naudit--in the driver's seat. This contract allegedly violated the IG \nAct and standing audit policy, according to the assistant IG who spoke \nout at that particular time.\n  To address this issue, a fragile waiver arrangement was crafted. It \nwas supposed to address the legal issues and protect the Office of \nInspector General's interests under the DFAS contract. All the parties \ninvolved agreed to abide by this questionable setup.\n  But being nothing more than an informal trust, it came unglued under \nthe pressure and controversy generated by the nonendorsement decision.\n  Even the Office of Inspector General legal counsel voiced grave \nconcerns about the fragile waiver arrangement. In his opinion, the \nterms of the contract ``transferred''--those words come from the Office \nof Legal Counsel--``transferred'' the Office of Inspector General \noversight function to DFAS, the very component whose financial data was \nbeing subjected to the oversight. In his words--meaning the Office of \nLegal Counsel's words--the contract terms will leave the Office of \nInspector General ``open to criticism on the Hill. . . . In two years \nsome Senator will yell at us [about this]. If I had known about the \narrangement,'' he said, ``I would have advised against it.''\n  Counsel's concerns were well-founded, and similar to a modern day \nNostradamus, this prediction has come to pass.\n  The second problem was a failure of leadership at the top. When the \ninspector general's auditors reached the conclusion that the CPA firm's \nopinions did not measure up to prescribed standards, the current deputy \nIG for audit drove the final nail into that coffin.\n  The official audit records make it crystal clear. The deputy IG gave \nthe fateful order: ``There will be no written report.'' This was a \nlethal blow. This is how the report got bottled up. True, it \ndisappeared from public view. It got buried, and DFAS was promised it \nwould never see the light of day; that is, until one of my \ninvestigators came along and dug it out of a pile of work papers. \nHere--for the benefit of my colleagues--here it is in my hand. I hold \nit up. It did not get buried like they thought it would get buried.\n  Once the deputy IG had smothered the report, DFAS knew it had the \ngreen light to bypass oversight with impunity.\n  All of this bungling could have harmful consequences.\n  First, compelling audit evidence, which undermined the credibility of \nthe financial statements prepared by the Department's flagship \naccounting agency, was shielded from public exposure. The suppression \nof that evidence has helped to immortalize the myth of DFAS's clean \nopinions. It is so bad now that the myth is an inside joke. It is \nlaughable, according to a former accountant. Here is what he said on \nthe record to McClatchy News on November 22, 2013:\n\n       When I was there, DFAS would brag about getting a clean \n     opinion. We accountants would just laugh out loud. Their \n     systems were so screwed up.\n\n  If the output of the Defense Department's flagship accounting agency, \nwhich disburses over $600 billion a year is, indeed, laughable, then \nPentagon money managers have another big problem. As that famous \nwhistleblower Ernie Fitzgerald liked to say: ``It's time to lock the \ndoors and call the law.''\n  Since the myth involves the reliability of data reported by the \nDepartment's central accounting agency, it has the potential of putting \nthe Secretary of Defense's audit readiness initiative in jeopardy. \nDFAS's apparent inability to accurately report on its own internal \nhousekeeping accounts for $1.5 billion--it is $1.5 billion that they \nhave--casts doubt on its ability to accurately report on the hundreds \nof billions DOD spends each year. If the Department's central \naccounting agency cannot earn a clean opinion, then who in the \nDepartment can?\n  Second, the integrity and independence of the inspector general's \naudit process may have been compromised. If the independence of the \naudit process was, in fact, compromised, as my report suggests, then \nthe Department's primary tool for rooting out waste and fraud could be \ndisabled--at least it was in these cases.\n  If that did indeed happen, then it probably happened with the \nknowledge and silent acquiesce of senior officials in the IG's office, \nthe institution that exists to root out fraud, waste, and abuse.\n  In simple terms, the watchdog appointed to expose waste--not only \nexpose but stop fraud and waste--may have been doing some of it himself \nor herself. If true, it clearly demonstrates a lack of commitment on \nthe part of senior management to exercise due diligence in performing \nits core mission.\n  Almost all of the key players allegedly responsible for the bungled \naudits still occupy top posts in the IG's audit office today. Surely, \nthese officials did not act alone. This was a concerted effort. \nAccording to recent news reports, other higher-ups were allegedly \ninvolved. Senior IG officials must bear primary responsibility for this \nunacceptable and inexplicable failure of oversight. They could have, in \nfact, stopped it.\n  To address and resolve these issues, I made four recommendations in a \nletter recently sent to Secretary Hagel and the new Inspector General \nRymer.\n  First, the Department of Defense CFO should pull the DFAS financial \nstatements for the fiscal years 2008 and 2009 and remove those audit \nopinions from official records.\n  Second, the OIG needs to undertake an independent audit of DFAS's \nfinancial statements for fiscal year 2012 and determine whether those \nstatements and the CPA firm's opinion meet prescribed audit standards. \nThe fiscal year\n\n[[Page S8631]]\n\n2012 beginning account balances must also be verified. In response to \nmy oversight, the inspector general has initiated what he called a \npostaudit review of DFAS's fiscal year 2012 financial statements. This \nis, in fact, a good move. But to ensure that it is done right this \ntime, I asked the U.S. GAO to watchdog the inspector general's work. I \nwant independent verification because last time there was none. This \nprocess will be completed next year.\n  Third, the inspector general should address and resolve any \nallegations of misconduct involving DFAS officials and make appropriate \nrecommendations for corrective action.\n  Fourth, I am referring unresolved concerns regarding the conduct of \nIG officials to the Integrity Committee of the Council of the \nInspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency for further review as \nprovided under the IG Reform Act of 2008.\n  What happened here is almost beyond comprehension.\n  All of it happened under the IG's watchful eye. All of it probably \nhappened with top-level knowledge. Most of it probably happened with \ntop-level approval. Some of it was probably allowed to happen through \ntacit approval or silent acquiescence. All of it was bad for the \nintegrity and independence of the audit process and the accuracy of \nfinancial information in the government's largest agency.\n  As I said a moment ago, the Department has a new IG, Jon Rymer. I \nhope he is a genuine junkyard dog who likes aggressive, hard-hitting \naudits. I hope Mr. Rymer will take a long, hard look at what happened \nand work with Secretary Hagel and others to find a good way to right \nthe wrongs and get audits back on track. I know he can do it, and I \nstand ready to help him in any way I can. I want Mr. Rymer to know my \ndoor is open to him.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to talk about the farm bill, specifically about \nreforming payment limits for farm programs, something this Senate \nagreed to in a bipartisan way.\n  Beyond saving money, these reforms help ensure farm payments go to \nthose for whom they were originally intended, small- and medium-size \nfarms. In addition, the reforms include closing off loopholes so \nnonfarmers cannot game the system.\n  Supporters of the farm bill need to take a hard look at what \nchallenges were presented last year to getting a bill done. We need to \nforge ahead knowing some tough decisions need to be made.\n  There are more reforms we need to make in programs such as food \nstamps, and they are reforms that can cut down on waste, fraud, and \nabuse in the program but also safeguard assistance to the people who \nactually need it.\n  While I support closing loopholes in the food stamp program, I \nbelieve the farm bill should also close loopholes for farm programs \nthat are so absurd they are just so obvious.\n  As we move forward on finalizing a new farm bill, I wish to state \nclearly that sections 1603 and 1604 relating to the farm payments--\nwhich are in both the House farm bill and the Senate farm bill--should \nstay in that bill. There should be a ``do not stamp'' on those \nprovisions under negotiation now between the House and Senate. Most \nimportant, for House conferees, they should remember that these \nprovisions were put on the floor of the House of Representatives in an \namendment sponsored by Congressman Fortenberry of Nebraska, with an \noverwhelming vote in the House of Representatives. So this is a case of \nwhere the majorities of both bodies support these provisions. Yet they \nare under attack by House conferees.\n  These farm payment reforms strike a needed balance of recognizing the \nneed for a farm safety net, while making sure we have a defensible and \nresponsible safety net. In case there is any doubt, we do need a farm \nprogram safety net. For those who argue we do not need a safety net for \nfarmers, I argue they do not understand the dangers to a Nation which \ndoes not produce its own food.\n  For all the advances in modern agriculture, farmers are still subject \nto conditions out of their control. While farmers need a safety net, \nthere does come a point where a farmer gets big enough that he can \nweather tough times without as much assistance from the government. \nSomehow, though, over the years, there has developed this perverse \nscenario where big farmers are receiving the largest share of the farm \nprogram payments.\n  We now have the largest 10 percent of the farmers receiving 70 \npercent of those farm payments coming out of the Federal Treasury. \nThere is nothing wrong with farmers growing an operation bigger. But \nthe taxpayers should not be subsidizing large farming operations to \ngrow even larger, making it very difficult for young farmers to buy \nland or to rent land to get into the operation.\n  By having reasonable caps on the amount of farm program payments any \none farmer can receive, it helps ensure the program meets the intent of \nassisting small- and medium-sized farmers through tough times.\n  My payment reforms essentially say that we will help farmers up to \n250,000 per year, but then the government training wheels come off. \nThose new caps will also help encourage the next generation of rural \nAmericans to take up farming. I am approached time and again about how \nto help young people get into farming.\n  When large farmers are able to use farm program payments to drive up \nthe cost of land and rental rates, our farm programs end up hurting \nthose they are intended to help. It is simply good policy to have a \nhard cap on the amount a farmer or farm entity can receive in farm \nprogram payments.\n  While both bodies of Congress have decided to cap farm payments, crop \ninsurance is still available to large operations, no limits on \nindemnity. Section 1603 and 1604 which I authored and which Congressman \nFortenberry authored, in our current farm bill, set the overall payment \ncaps at $250,000 for a married couple.\n  In my home State of Iowa, many people say that is still too high. On \nthe other hand, other farmers in other parts of the country say it is \nway too low. But I recognize agriculture can look different around the \ncountry. So this is a compromise. Just as important, however, to \nsetting a hard cap on payments is closing loopholes that have allowed \nnonfarmers to game the farm program. The House and Senate farm bills \nalso end the ability of nonfarmers to abuse what is known as the \nactively engaged test. In essence, the law says one has to be actively \nengaged in farming to qualify for farm payments.\n  Is that not common sense? However, this has been exploited by people \nwho have virtually nothing to do with farming or with a farming \noperation and yet receive payments from the farm program. Not citing \nmyself, but the Government Accountability Office issued a report I \nreleased in October outlining how the current actively engaged \nregulations are so broad that they essentially are unenforceable. Those \ncomments came from the USDA employees who administer the program.\n  The report illustrated that one farming entity had 22 total members \nof which 16 were deemed contributing ``active personal management \nonly'' to the farm. What does ``active personal management only'' mean? \nThat means they are becoming eligible for farm programs because of one \nof the eight overly broad and unenforceable eligibility requirements \nthat currently exist. More simply put, they likely are not doing any \nlabor and are nothing more than a participant on paper to allow the \nentity to get more government payment.\n  Our Nation has over a $17 trillion debt. We cannot afford to simply \nlook the other way and let the people abuse the farm safety net. I \nmentioned earlier how we need to assess some of the challenging areas \nof farm policy as we look to pass a 5-year farm bill. Some tough \ndecisions need to be made.\n  However, my reforms to payment limits do not pose a tough decision. \nThey are common sense. They are necessary reforms that are included in \nboth the House and Senate versions of the farm bill. I wish to take \nthis opportunity to thank Senator Stabenow, the chairman of our Senate \ncommittee, for fighting for these Senate provisions. You see, these \nprovisions were part of the Senate bill, representing a majority of the \nSenate.\n  More important, these same provisions were added on the House floor \nby Congressman Fortenberry of Nebraska by an overwhelming majority. So \nSenator Stabenow has the high\n\n[[Page S8632]]\n\nmoral ground in conference with the House conferees in fighting for \npayment limitation. She represents a majority of the Senate; whereas, \nthe House conferees, in opposing her, represent a minority of the House \nof Representatives.\n\n\n                       Homeland Security Nominee\n\n  The last issue I am going to speak about, then I will yield the \nfloor, deals with the some correspondence I am trying to have with the \nnominee to be Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  On July 12, Secretary Napolitano announced she would be leaving the \nDepartment of Homeland Security after 4 years heading up one of the \nlargest departments of the Federal Government. On October 17, the Obama \nadministration announced it had finally found a replacement. The \nCommittee on Homeland Security moved quickly on Jeh Johnson's \nnomination, approving him by voice vote on November 20.\n  On November 15, before the committee approved him, I sent a letter to \nMr. Johnson, along with several colleagues on the Judiciary Committee. \nWe on the Judiciary Committee asked for his views on a number of \nimportant matters, including our Nation's immigration policies and the \nfair treatment of whistleblowers.\n  We asked if he would cooperate with us on oversight matters and work \nwith us to improve immigration policies going forward. Because the \nJudiciary Committee has primary responsibility on immigration matters, \nit is necessary for us to know any nominee's position on almost any \nissue. It has been nearly 1 month, and there has been no response to \nour letter and no indication that he might respond.\n  In fact, I would be surprised that any nominee would respond to \nCongress any more given the majority only needs a simple majority to \nvote for confirmation. Thanks to a rule change done unilaterally by the \nmajority, there will no longer be a proper vetting of executive branch \nnominees. The rule change essentially takes away the Senate's \nconstitutional role of advice and consent, thereby allowing nominees to \nignore Congress on issues of extreme importance such as immigration.\n  But I am still going to pursue these questions, even though we do not \nhave the leverage we used to have when a 60-vote majority was \nnecessary, because Congress has a responsibility to know how laws are \ngoing to be enforced by the President's a appointees. President Obama \npromised this would be the most transparent administration in history. \nYet getting answers from this President or his administration on \nlegitimate Congressional oversight has been like pulling teeth.\n  They have stonewalled Congress at every turn. Over the last 5 years, \nthe administration has gone around Congress and pushed the envelope \nwith their authority. He has ignored his constitutional duties to \nfaithfully execute the laws by picking and choosing which laws he wants \nto enforce. Congressional oversight, an important responsibility that \nholds the government accountable for its people has been nearly \nimpossible.\n  In other words, the checks and balances of government do not work the \nway the Constitution writers intended. Now it is going to get worse. \nThere will be more blatant disrespect for checks and balances than we \nhave ever seen. So I would like to take time to read some of the \nquestions--just some of the questions--that we asked Mr. Johnson. I \nthink these would be reasonable questions that any Secretary ought to \ntell us what he is going to do if he gets sworn into that office. I \nthink they underscore how important it is that we have answers before \nwe move forward on the nomination.\n  First and foremost, we asked Mr. Johnson about his commitment to \nuphold the laws on the books. We asked if he would continue the lawless \npolicies created by the former Secretary and her deputy. We asked about \nwhat he would do to improve the morale of immigration officials and \nagents who are concerned about their nonenforcement protocols. We want \nto know how he would strengthen cooperation between Federal and local \nlaw enforcement entities.\n  Secondly, we asked Mr. Johnson what he would do to improve border \nsecurity. We want to know what specific measures he will implement to \nensure that the Department will comply with the Secure Fence Act of \n2006. In 2010, Secretary Napolitano suspended our Nation's only \ncomprehensive border security measurements, known as the operational \ncontrol metric.\n  More than 3 years have passed and the Department of Homeland Security \nhas failed to replace that metric. Will Mr. Johnson then hold the \nDepartment accountable by regularly releasing a comprehensive border \nsecurity metric? Will he commit to achieving operational control of the \nborders as required by our law? We do not know that. We would expect \nhim to answer that he is going to enforce the laws. But will he? Will \nhe answer?\n  Individuals who overstay their visas account for about 40 percent of \nthe undocumented population of this country. This presents a national \nsecurity risk. Without a biometric exit system, this country will have \nno clue who remains on our soil undocumented. Will Mr. Johnson make it \na priority to finally implement the entry-exit system Congress mandated \nin 1996, still not being enforced?\n  Third, we asked about the culture of the U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Service. In January 2012, a Department of Homeland Security \ninspector general released a report criticizing the USCIS for \npressuring its employees to rubberstamp applications for immigration \nbenefits.\n  In that report, nearly 25 percent of the USCIS officers surveyed said \nsupervisors had pressured them to improve applications that should have \nbeen denied. We want to know if he will take measures to better screen \napplicants and do away with the get-to-yes philosophy. That get-to-yes \nphilosophy is a gigantic risk to our national security.\n  Just look at the EB-5 Program which allows foreign nationals to \nobtain green cards if they invest in the United States. We asked \nwhether he would make it a priority to improve that program. We asked \nMr. Johnson about his position on immigration reform, especially since \nthe bill passed the Senate, and the House could act, sending a bill to \nthe President.\n  We asked if people who are in the country illegally, in removal \nproceedings or subject to an order of removal, should be eligible for \nimmigration benefits, including legal status. We asked whether illegal \nimmigrants convicted of a felony or convicted of multiple misdemeanors \nshould be eligible for benefits, including legal status.\n  We want to know if gang members, drunk drivers, domestic abusers, and \nother criminals should be allowed to stay in the country. It is \nimportant for us to know from Mr. Johnson because the Senate bill \nprovides a way for those law breakers to gain citizenship. Mr. Johnson \nmay be responsible for implementing that.\n  Finally, we asked Mr. Johnson to comment on issues generally \nimpacting the Department. We asked if he would pledge to cooperate with \ncongressional oversight efforts and be responsive to all congressional \nrequests for information and do it in a timely manner. We asked that \nbecause we have received very little cooperation in the last 5 years \nfrom that Department. We asked if he believed whistleblowers who know \nof problems with matters of national security should be prevented from \nbringing that information to Congress. We asked if he would commit to \nensuring that every whistleblower is treated fairly and that those who \nretaliate against whistleblowers would be held accountable.\n  No matter what department one manages, the answers to these questions \nare very important and should be simple to answer. We need a Secretary \nwho is well versed on these issues. We need a Secretary who will \nimplement policies that truly protect the homeland. We need cooperation \nand transparency. We need answers. In other words, what is wrong to \nexpect answers to these questions I just related before we give advice \nand consent to this nomination?\n  Majority Leader Reid has indicated through his cloture motion on Mr. \nJohnson that answers to these critically important issues are not \nwarranted.\n  Senators cannot consent to just anyone to head this department. We \nshould not fail in our constitutional responsibility of advise and \nconsent.\n  This body should not move forward with this nomination, and I \nencourage my colleagues to consider these issues when the cloture vote \nripens.\n\n[[Page S8633]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that at 9 a.m., Thursday, December \n12, all postcloture time on the Pillard nomination be considered \nexpired and the Senate proceed to vote on confirmation of the Pillard \nnomination; that upon disposition of the Pillard nomination, the \nmandatory quorum required under rule XXII be waived with respect to the \ncloture motion on the Feldblum nomination and the Senate proceed to \nvote on the motion to invoke cloture on the Feldblum nomination; that \nif cloture is invoked on the Feldblum nomination, all postcloture time \nbe yielded back and the Senate proceed to vote on confirmation of the \nFeldblum nomination; finally, that the motions to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table and the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I object, and I wish to state the reason I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator be allowed to \nspeak for whatever time he feels appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The reason I object for the minority to moving these \nvotes is we should follow what regular order we have left on \nnominations, especially after the way the majority changed the rules on \nnominations 2 weeks ago.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. My friend, the senior distinguished Senator from Iowa, that \nis what we are talking about here, the face of obstruction--not him, \nbut the Republican caucus, stalling for no reason other than to stall \nfor time.\n  No wonder the rules were changed. No wonder the American people look \nat the Senate as a dysfunctional body. A couple of weeks ago we voted \nto make it a functional body so that nominations can be confirmed for \nany President. The President deserves to have his team.\n  We have been wasting days, weeks, and months on nominations. We have \nscores of people and positions that need to be filled. We are only \ndealing with a handful. People understand the rules. We have changed \nthe rules the last couple of Congresses--very little--but we have \nchanged them.\n  If we have a Supreme Court Justice or a Cabinet officer or someone of \nthat level, they get 30 hours of time following the cloture vote. What \nare they supposed to do during that 30 hours? Come and explain their \nposition why they oppose a person.\n  For virtually every one of these nominations there hasn't been a \nsingle, single complaint about any of them. This culminated by virtue \nof the Republicans in the Senate making a decision that people who \nserve in the prestigious DC Circuit Court of Appeals were not entitled \nto have a full court. There are eight there now, and they said that is \nenough. That is, some say, the most important court in America; some \nsay more important than the Supreme Court.\n  The Republicans arbitrarily have said we are not going to fill those \nspots, not only because of qualifications, not because of their \neducation, their experience or their integrity, only because they don't \nwant them filled. That is a new low.\n  I am disappointed to have to inform the Presiding Officer and all \nSenators tonight that because Republicans are wasting time, all of this \nstaff, police officers--and some of them are getting paid over time--\nwill have to work. Why? Because the Republicans are wanting to waste \nmore of this body's time and this country's time. No wonder the \nAmerican people feel about the Senate as they do. For 5 years the \nobstruction that has taken place is unprecedented.\n  We are going to continue to work tonight and remain in session as \nlong as we need to. Republicans are forcing us to waste this week on \nnominees they know will be confirmed. Every one of them will be \nconfirmed.\n  There are no objections to the qualifications of these nominees, with \none exception, and there are only little squeaks here and there about \nwhat could be wrong. But the outcome of each vote we will take over the \nnext 4 days is a foregone conclusion. Yet the Republicans insist on \nwasting time simply for the sake of wasting time. There is no reason \nthese votes couldn't take place right now or in the morning, and we \ncould move to some important items.\n  I have Senators come to me all the time--the chairman of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee was here a few minutes ago, the \ndistinguished junior Senator from Vermont. He has some important work \nhe wants to move on this floor. They have passed some things in the \nHouse--and that doesn't happen very often, but they passed it. They \nsent it over, and it deals with veterans.\n  He wants to bring that to the floor, have a debate, and offer an \namendment. We can't do that because we are wasting time in the Senate \non this senselessness.\n  The junior Senator from the State of Delaware has spent weeks and \nweeks on manufacturing, which has shown some promise in America the \nlast few years. Jobs are being created. Working on a bipartisan basis \nwith other Senators, they have legislation they want to bring to the \nfloor to talk about ways of improving manufacturing, capabilities, and \ncapacity in the United States.\n  We can't do that. We are here postcloture looking at each other and \ndoing basically nothing, as we have done for vast amounts of time \nbecause of Republican obstructionism.\n\n  I had a meeting with the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee and the junior Senator from the State of Rhode Island a few \nminutes ago. In the world today we have something called climate \nchange. It is here. Climate is changing all over the world. We have \nglobal warming.\n  Are we doing anything legislatively to address that? No, nothing. She \nhas a portfolio of legislation that she would like to take care of.\n  There is going to be zero done because we are sitting under these \nlights complaining about the Republicans wasting time. We could finish \nthese votes now, but we are going to work into the weekend.\n  We had a break for Thanksgiving. It was very pleasant for me to be \nhome for 2 weeks. Unfortunately, I had a death in the family that put a \nreal cloud over things, and that is an understatement.\n  Christmas is coming. Everyone should know that we are going to work \nuntil we finish the items we have before us this week. I am going to \nfile on a number of other nominees as soon as I get a chance, and we \nare going to finish those. If we have to work the weekend before \nChristmas, we are going to do that. If we have to work the Monday \nbefore Christmas, we are going to do that. If we have to work through \nChristmas, we are going to do that. I know the game they are playing. \nThey have done it before. A lot of nominations they will ask to be sent \nback to the administration, and they will have to start all over again. \nWe are not going to start all over again.\n  We need a director of the Internal Revenue Service. I think that is a \nvery good idea. We need to fill Chairman Bernanke's spot as chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve. That would be very important for us to do with all \nthe problems we have financially.\n  We are going to do that before we leave. If it means we have to work \nthrough Christmas, we will work through Christmas.\n  Even if we are spending a lot of time--as we have done over the last \n5 years because of their obstructionism--looking at the lights, and \nthat is about all we have to look at because we are not looking at \nsubstantive legislation as we should be, the only impediment to holding \nvotes without delay in reasonable hours is blatant, partisan Republican \nobstructionism.\n  It is pointless spending an entire week wasting time and waiting for \na\n\n[[Page S8634]]\n\nvote. This is a foregone conclusion that is going to happen to every \none of these votes. This is exactly the kind of blatant obstructionism \nand delay that has ground the Senate to a halt and prevented Congress \nfrom doing the work of the people over the last 5 years.\n  I remind Members that without cooperation there will be rollcall \nvotes, perhaps after midnight tonight, and as early as 5:30 in the \nmorning. With only a little cooperation, Senators can stop wasting time \nand resources.\n  The only way the Senate can stop wasting time is if we get some \nreasonableness and clarity from the Republicans. If there were ever an \nexample why the rules had to be changed and how we tried during two \nsuccessive Congresses to be reasonable--remember the exercise? Judges \nwould only be opposed under extraordinary circumstances. There isn't a \nsingle judge that the President of the United States has nominated who \nhas problems that are extraordinary. I think what is going on is a \nshame.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. I came to speak to a bipartisan bill which I hope to take \na few minutes to talk about, but first I wish to comment on what is \nhappening or not happening on the floor and the comments of the \nmajority leader.\n  I have been a Senator for only 3 years, as the Presiding Officer well \nknows. We were sworn in as a group of those elected to the class of \n2010. I just came from an inspiring event where the Vice President, who \npreviously held this seat on behalf of Delaware, gave an award to the \nformer majority leader, a real patriot, a veteran, former Senator Bob \nDole. They talked about how compromise, principled compromise, made it \npossible for Senator McGovern and Senator Dole, folks from opposite \nends of the political spectrum, to work together in the interests of \nhungry children in the United States.\n  Frankly, what I have seen in the 3 years that I have been in the \nSenate, the 3 years that we have served together on the Judiciary \nCommittee, has been a slow walk.\n  There are minority rights in this body, but there are also minority \nresponsibilities. There are majority rights but also majority \nresponsibilities.\n  I wish to add to the comments of the majority leader that the \nnominees to serve on the DC Circuit, the nominees to many district \ncourt seats, whose confirmations I have either presided over or \nattended, were not objected to on substantive grounds. I have trouble \nwith the idea that the three empty seats on the DC Circuit do not need \nto be filled.\n  I have listened at great length to the arguments about caseload and \nabout workload. As the chair of the courts subcommittee of the \nJudiciary Committee, I presided over the presentation of the Judicial \nConference's report on where we need additional judgeships and where we \ndon't.\n  I will note briefly and in passing that Judge Tymkovich, who \npresented this report, did not suggest there was some need to reduce \nthe DC Circuit by eliminating these currently vacant spots.\n  We could go through this chapter and verse. This has been debated to \ndeath on this floor. In my view, we have three excellent, qualified \ncandidates. I regret that we have spent so much time burning the clock \nand that we have had to make changes that ultimately will make it \npossible for qualified nominees to be confirmed. It is, to me, a \nsubject of some deep concern that we cannot work better together, \nRepublicans and Democrats, to move work forward.\n\n  If I might, I would like to move for a moment to an example of \nexactly the sort of bipartisan bill that we should be able to move to \nhere, that if there weren't this endless obstruction, if we weren't \nrunning out the clock on nothing, we might be able to get done \ntogether. This is an example of the sort of reaching across the aisle \nthat used to dominate this body when giants such as Dole and McGovern \nserved here but is no longer the case. They are no longer the daily \ndiet of this body. We are no longer reaching across the aisle and \nfinding ways to make our country more competitive, create more \nmanufacturing jobs in partnership with the private sector, and \nresponsibly reduce our deficit.\n  I was encouraged as a member of the budget conference committee that \nwe seemed to be moving toward enacting a significant--small in scale \nbut significant in its precedence--deal for the Budget Committee that \ncould allow us to go back to regular order for appropriations. But \nhere, as we waste hour after hour running out the clock to confirm \nnominees, I wonder. I wonder whether we are going to be able to take \nup, consider, and pass substantive legislation.\n\n\n                      Children's Advocacy Centers\n\n  If I might, I would like to take a few minutes to talk about why I \ninitially came to the floor today; that is, to talk about the power of \nchildren's advocacy centers. Children's advocacy centers exist across \nthe country today in large part because this Congress, on a bipartisan \nbasis, passed back in 1990 the Victims of Child Abuse Act--a bill that \nfor the first time authorized funding for an important nationwide \nnetwork of what are called children's advocacy centers. These centers \nhelp deliver justice, they help heal victims of violence and abuse, and \nwe must act to continue empowering their service to our Nation.\n  Today is a time when we could work together to reauthorize that \ninitial landmark bill from 1990 and rededicate ourselves on a \nbipartisan basis to something that is one of our most sacred \nobligations: protecting our children, protecting the victims of child \nabuse and delivering justice for them. That is what this bipartisan \nbill does that was introduced earlier today along with my colleagues, \nSenators Blunt and Sessions and Hirono--a great example of being able \nto work together across the aisle.\n  As parents, as neighbors, as leaders of our Nation, we have no more \nsacred obligation than protecting our children. In most of our cases, \nwe dedicate everything we have as parents to ensuring our children's \nsafety, to providing for their future, and that is what this bill is \nall about--that responsibility.\n  Tragically, too often, despite our best efforts, too many of our \nchildren fall victim to abuse. We cannot guarantee their safety, but \nwhat we can do is ensure that when children in this country are harmed, \nwe can deliver justice without further harming them. Thankfully, \nchildren's advocacy centers, for which this bill reauthorizes funding, \nare critical and effective resources in our communities that help us \nperform this awesome and terrible responsibility. Through this bill, we \ncan continue to prevent future tragedies and deliver justice in ways \nthat are effective and less costly than communities can deliver alone.\n  This bill helps prevent child abuse proactively. Just last year its \nprograms trained more than 500,000 Americans, mostly in school \nsettings, in how to spot and prevent child sexual abuse.\n  Secondly, and in my view most importantly, this bill delivers \njustice. Children's advocacy centers increase prosecution of the \nmonsters who perpetrate child abuse. One study showed a 94-percent \nconviction rate for center cases that carried forward to trial.\n  Third, and in many ways equally as important, this bill helps to \nheal. Child victims of abuse who receive services at a child advocacy \ncenter are four times more likely to receive the medical exams and \nmental health treatment they desperately need compared to children who \nare served by non-center supported communities. No parent ever wants to \ngo to one of these places or have to bring their child to one of these \nplaces, but those parents who have under these tragic circumstances, \nnearly 100 percent of them say they would recommend seeking this help \nto other parents.\n  How do these advocacy centers achieve all these different results of \nprevention, of justice, and of healing? Well, they are unique because \nthey bring together under one roof everybody who needs to be present to \nhelp deal with the tragedy of child abuse: law enforcement, \nprosecutors, mental health and child service professionals--all focused \non what is in the best interest of the child.\n  Through a trained forensic interviewer, they interview the child to \nfind out exactly what happened. They ask difficult, detailed questions, \nand they structure the conversation in a trained and nonleading way so \nthe testimony can be used later in court, preventing what otherwise is \nretraumatization, making it possible for child victims to testify in a \nway that will lead to justice but without forcing those children\n\n[[Page S8635]]\n\nto take the stand and to repeat over and over what they testified to \nonce at a center.\n  Prosecutors take the information obtained in the interview all the \nway through the court system, while doctors and other child service \nprofessionals ensure the child is getting the help he or she badly \nneeds to begin the process of healing.\n  One place, one interview, with all the resources a victim would need \nto move forward to secure justice and to heal.\n  In my home State of Delaware, we have three children's advocacy \ncenters, one in each of our counties. In the last year, I visited the \ncenters in Wilmington and in Dover and saw firsthand the extraordinary \nwork the professionals there do. These are places haunted by the \ntragedies that are described and recorded there, but the staff are \nwelcoming, nurturing professionals, and the law enforcement and mental \nhealth and child service professionals who are there are deeply \ndedicated to making sure that they achieve justice and that they \npromote healing.\n  It was striking on my tours, my visits, to see how strategically and \nthoughtfully each of these centers has been put together, how they have \nworked through every possible detail to enable obtaining the testimony \nneeded to secure justice while enabling healing of child victims. This \nis critical in order to avoid retraumatization--a threat that is real \nfor victims and for their long-term healing process. The centers in \nWilmington and Dover and Georgetown in my home State show over and over \nhow these centers create the sort of nurturing but effective space to \nensure that we both meet the needs of victims and secure justice.\n  As I am sure the Chair knows, in my home State of Delaware just a few \nyears ago we saw exactly the kind of evil we most dread in this world \nwhen a pediatrician, a man named Earl Bradley whom many Delawareans \ntrusted with their children's health and safety, was found to have \nsexually assaulted more than 100 of our children. Delaware is a State \nof neighbors, and his horrific crimes against our children, our \nfamilies, and our communities affected all of us. Attorney general Beau \nBiden and his team effectively led the investigation and prosecution of \nthis monster. Thankfully, children's advocacy centers were able to play \na key role in ensuring that the interviews and the assistance provided \nto the victims and their families were effective and that ultimately \njustice was rendered.\n  Randy Williams, the executive director of Delaware's Children's \nAdvocacy Center in Dover, wrote to me:\n\n       Our multidisciplinary team worked tirelessly and seamlessly \n     in providing forensic interviews, assessments, medical \n     evaluations and mental health services for every child \n     referred to our centers.\n\n  Randy went on to say:\n\n       I feel confident that our team's outstanding collaborative \n     response was a direct result of the financial and technical \n     assistance and training resources made possible over many \n     years through the Federal Victims of Child Abuse Act.\n\n  In the end, Dr. Bradley was convicted on multiple counts. Over 100 \nvictims were involved. He is now serving 14 life sentences plus 164 \nyears in prison.\n  As a nation, we have no greater responsibility than to keep our \nchildren safe. As a father, there is nothing that keeps me up at night \nmore than concerns about the safety and security and health of my own \nchildren. We must do everything we can to prevent sexual abuse of those \nmost vulnerable and those most precious members of our society--our \nchildren. When that tragedy strikes, we need to be prepared with the \nbest services we have to foster healing and deliver justice.\n  This specific bill is about upholding our responsibility to our \nchildren, to our families, and to this Nation's future. It is at the \nvery core of why we serve and of what we believe. I am grateful that \nthis is a bipartisan bill, that this is a bill which can demonstrate \nthe best of what this Senate, this Congress, and this country is \ncapable of. It represents the best of our Federal commitment to \ntargeted, effective, and essential assistance to State and local law \nenforcement, to our communities, and to our children.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with us because in the end, no child \nshould fall prey to physical or sexual abuse. No mother or father \nshould have a haunting experience of finding that an adult they trusted \ntook advantage of that trust and horribly hurt their child. No country \nshould tolerate these crimes when there are things we can do now, \ntoday, on a bipartisan basis, to protect and to heal our children and \nto ensure that justice is secured.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I came to the floor to talk about several \nother things, but after hearing the majority leader and my colleague \nfrom Delaware, I think the revisionist history needs to stop.\n  This place ran from 1917 under a process where any one Senator could \nstop anything. That was changed by a two-thirds majority of those \npresent voting to a number less than that. The point I am getting to is \nthat we are in this process because the rules weren't good enough to \naccomplish what the majority wanted to accomplish and the majority \nleader wanted to accomplish. Majority Leader Byrd didn't have any \ntrouble when he had the same vote number. Majority Leader Daschle \ndidn't have any trouble. Neither did Frist or Dole. None of them had \nany trouble. As a matter of fact, what we have seen and what has \nhappened is a lack of effective leadership in building bipartisanship.\n  The Senate wasn't designed to be the House, as my colleagues have \nrecently made it. The Senate was designed to absolutely protect \nminority rights. And what happened the week before we went on \nThanksgiving break actually hurt the majority more than it hurt the \nminority because now the majority has lost the ability to hold their \nown administration accountable.\n  The majority leader used the words ``reasonableness'' and \n``clarity.'' Reasonableness is compromise. Reasonableness is allowing \namendments on major bills. Clarity is the ability of Senators to offer \ntheir viewpoint on $600 billion bills. Reasonableness would be to say \nthat every Member of this body ought to be able to contribute important \nideas to the Defense authorization bill or to the farm bill or to any \nother major piece of legislation.\n  So we have gone down this road. It can be stopped. All this can be \nstopped, but it cannot be stopped without the recognition of the damage \ndone to this body by a very frivolous act.\n  The revisionist history I am talking about is with the DC court. \nThere is no difference in what the President is doing on the DC court \nthan what Roosevelt decided to do or attempted to do. Everybody knows \nthe workload there is enormously small compared to all the rest of the \ncourts. Everybody knows there are also judicial vacancies that are much \nmore important than those.\n  So what is the reason for this? It is so we can continue to have \nexecutive orders and bureaucratic rules and regs come through that are \ngoing to get challenged because they are not within the consent and the \nvision of the laws that are passed, and, in fact, they can be enforced \nby a stacked court. My colleagues can't claim anything other than that. \nWe know that is what is going on, and they know that is what is going \non. That is going to be there forever. That is a legacy of the Obama \nadministration, and it is a planned legacy.\n  So it is not about what is claimed to be Republican obstructionism. \nIt is about changing the very nature of our country. It is about \nchanging the rule of law. It is about whether the President will be an \nemperor or be the President. And my worry is that we are moving fast \nand quickly toward an executive branch that has decided and has stated \nvery proudly: If the Congress won't do it, we are going to do it \nanyway. Where does that fit in with the rule of law? And we have heard \nthat three times from this President. In fact, they are doing it--\nignoring law.\n  So now the very court where those laws will get challenged is going \nto be stacked with his nominees, and we refuse to admit this very same \npoint was made by senior members of the Judiciary Committee when the \nRepublicans were in charge. No one can deny that history. It is out \nthere. Senator Schumer did it, as well as others, knowing that court \nshould not be filled.\n\n[[Page S8636]]\n\n  Now, we know it is going to get filled. We understand what is \nhappening. What is at risk is the future of our country and whether we \nwill really have balance between the powers of the judiciary, the \nexecutive, and the legislative branches in this country. What we are \nseeing is a reshaping of that. It is a dangerous trend. It was \nsomething our Founders worried about, and we have seen executive orders \nand executive privilege taken to new heights that have never been seen \nin this country before by this administration.\n\n  So let's be clear what we are talking about. This isn't about \nobstructionism. This is about you limited our rights. You also very \nwell limited your own rights in the ability to extract information.\n  We just heard Senator Grassley spend 1 hour on the floor talking \nabout the lack of response from this administration. There is no tool \nfor you to get answers anymore, there is no tool for any of us to get \nanswers anymore, because we can no longer hold any nominations because \nthey will go through. So there is no power. We have given up the one \nsignificant power to hold the executive branch accountable.\n  Not only that, but we have diminished the minority rights that are \npart of what the Founders created to force compromise--to force us to \ncompromise, to bring us together. There is not ill will. There are \ndamaged hearts in this institution today.\n  We understand the strong beliefs on the other side, but we don't \nunderstand the lack of moral fiber that is associated with avoiding and \nviolating what has always been the tradition of the Senate--which is, \nyou change rules with two-thirds votes of those duly elected and \npresent. Rule XXII still stands. It just has a precedent in front of \nit.\n  So for the first time in our history in this body, one group--because \nthey couldn't achieve compromise and wouldn't compromise--has forced a \nchanging of the rules, not through two-thirds of duly elected and sworn \nmembers but by fiat and by simple majority. What is next? We are going \nto make it the House. That is what is next. That is coming. I know that \nis coming.\n  So consequently what is going to happen in our country is we are not \ngoing to have significant deliberation. We are going to have laws \nchanged at public whim, rather than the long-term thinking and an \nembracing of what the Constitution says.\n  The whole purpose for this body is to be a counter to the House in \nterms of response to political and public demand; to give reasoned \nthought and forced compromise, so that what comes out of here is a \nblend of what both the public wants, but also what the public might \nhave lost sight of in terms of a short-term view versus a long-term \nview. You are putting that at risk. It is coming at risk. The very the \nsoul of the country can unwind right here in the Senate.\n  So what remaining powers do we have as minority Members--and you may \nget to find that out someday--is to use the rules that are there to our \nbenefit.\n  In the past, nominations were agreed upon between the majority leader \nand the minority leader, and they were ferreted out and moved. We have \nhad 21 nominations come through the homeland security committee. I \nvoted positively for 19 of them, against one, and voted present on one \ntoday. I would say that is about 90 percent that I am in agreement of \nmoving the nominations.\n  We actually force compromise on our committee. We actually work to \ncompromise on our committee. But that is because of the leadership of \nSenator Carper to create an atmosphere where you can have compromise \nand you can have back and forth. We don't have that leadership in the \nSenate as a whole. The Senate has never seen these problems. But it is \nnot about the rules. It is about the leadership and who is running the \nplace.\n  Most of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle haven't been \nhere for a long time. They have never seen it in the majority work. \nSeventy-seven times the majority leader over the last 7 years has \nfilled the tree and barred amendments. That is more than all the rest \ncombined in the entire history of the Senate. Is that about us or is \nthat about him not wanting to allow the place to work? He is a good \nman. But the problem is that leadership matters, and this place is not \nfunctioning.\n  I will make one other statement I think needs to be made. I believe \nthat climate does change. I believe that climate is changing all the \ntime. Global warming has been disputed now. It is undeniable; it is not \nglobal warming. We are now into a global cooling period, and that is \nOK. You can have cooling. But the fact is the science is still nebulous \non all the claims being made. I have said before on this floor, I am \nnot a climate change denier. But I am a global warming denier, because \nthe facts don't back it up.\n  We heard what the majority leader had to say about the importance of \ngetting things through on climate change. There may be important things \nwe need to do, but we ought to be doing them together rather than in \nopposition. If that were the attitude, that we would work together, if \nwe would have an open amendment process--a truly open amendment process \nwhere the majority leader isn't picking our amendments and deciding \nwhat we can offer--pretty soon you are going tell us what we can say on \nthe floor. You are going to determine what I can say on the floor. This \nis the first step in this process. That is the ultimate conclusion to \nthis process that you have started.\n  So it is about leadership, and it is either there or it isn't. Right \nnow, it is not there.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, and I would like to use his comments maybe as a \nspringboard for some thoughts I have, not only on this nomination but \non the terrible mess we find ourselves in today here in the Senate.\n  I am a fairly new Member of the Senate. I came here just 5 years ago. \nI thought a lot about reelection, and I announced some months ago that \nI would not seek a second term in the Senate. So you might say I don't \nreally have a fighter in this ring. I am here for a limited period of \ntime. I have already decided that. My interest is seeing the Senate \noperate in a way which will be in the best interests of our country, \nthat will fulfill the vision that our Founders had of a country where \nthere would be freedom and where the minority would be able to voice \ntheir view as well as the majority.\n  The process by which the House of Representatives and the Senate were \nput together was a very thoughtful process. Our Founders looked at our \ncountry and its future, and they decided there needed to be a body \nwhere the population would be represented based upon numbers, based \nupon the population, and that became the House of Representatives.\n  For a State like Nebraska, 200-some years later that doesn't work \nvery well. It is pretty obvious that our three House Members can be \nconsistently, routinely outvoted by a whole bunch of other States: \nCalifornia, New York, Pennsylvania, Florida, Texas. I could go on and \non. We have three Members in the House. It is obvious that we are going \nto be on the losing end.\n  The other piece of that is it is a majority-based body. So if you are \nin the majority, with the Rules Committee, you pretty well set the \nrules. It just works that as long as the majority can keep their \nmembers together, they are going to win. That is just the way it works. \nAbout the only way you can change that is to change the majority.\n  When our Founders looked at that, they said: We have to have a \ndifferent approach in the Senate. That led to the great compromise.\n  What we ended up with is just a remarkable system. If you think about \nit, Nebraska in the Senate is as powerful as California. Nebraska is as \npowerful as Pennsylvania because we each get two Members. We are \nequally represented.\n  They also recognize that the pendulum would swing. Sometimes one \nparty would be in control, and sometimes another party would be in \ncontrol. Originally, when the Senate was set up, any one Member of the \nbody could come to the Senate floor and object or just debate something \nto death. That pretty well was how it operated, and it operated for \ndecades and decades that way.\n  Then came World War I and Senators began to recognize that funding \nthe\n\n[[Page S8637]]\n\nwar was going to be a very serious problem. There was a tremendous \namount of affinity between Senators and people back in the country \nwhere their ancestors came from--Germany--and they had to find a way to \nend debate. So they finally, after discussing this and debating it, \ndecided the best way of doing that was to put something in place where \nyou could literally take a vote. I think back then, if my memory serves \nme correctly, if two-thirds of the Senators voted, they could end \ndebate.\n  That was quite a change for the Senate. The whole idea that a single \nSenator wasn't going to be able to literally force issues in the Senate \nwas a very difficult issue. But that change was made, and it operated \nthat way for many decades following. Then in the 1970s, the decision \nwas made that it would take 60 votes to end debate. It would pull the \nnumber down to 60. But it was always recognized that the rules could \nonly be changed by a two-thirds majority; that is, until just a few \nweeks ago. Then, something happened here in the Senate that literally \nshakes the foundation of this country and it shakes the foundation of \nthis body.\n  I guess if you are in the majority at the moment, you are probably \nsaying: Geez, Mike. It seems to work out pretty well. Well, it won't \nwork out very well for the history of this body, for this institution, \nfor its Members, and, most importantly, for the citizens of the United \nStates, because it was the method chosen to change the rules that is \nthe frightening piece.\n  Think about this. We came down here a few weeks ago. A ruling was \nmade by the Chair, and the majority leader said: I will appeal that \nruling.\n  Now, we all know, if we have read the Senate rules--and I hope to \ngoodness we have all read the Senate rules--that by appealing the \nruling of the Chair, you can overrule the Chair by a majority vote.\n  Let me repeat that. We bypassed the rule that says it takes two-\nthirds to change the rules of the Senate, and the majority said: We \nwill appeal the ruling; and if we get a majority, we will overturn the \nruling. That is what happened, and that is where we find ourselves \ntonight.\n  This isn't inconsequential, and we are not trying to be arbitrary and \ncapricious, but we are trying to make the point that this is a huge \nissue for the future of our country. Let me point out what this now \nmeans for the Senate. What this means is that if the majority leader, \nwhoever that is, Republican or Democrat, does not like the way things \nare going, they can appeal the ruling of the Chair and overturn that \nruling by a majority vote because now the precedent is set. It is in \nour history. It is in our rules.\n\n  Some look at this and say: You need not panic; this only applies to \ncircuit court nominees, district court nominees, and executive \nappointments.\n  Let's think about that for a second. Let's say we have a Supreme \nCourt of the United States where there are four members who are pretty \nconsistent in ruling one way--some might call it the liberal way--and \nwe have four members who are pretty consistent in ruling another way--\nsome might call it the conservative way--and there is one member of the \nSupreme Court who kind of moves back and forth between the four over \nhere and the four over here, between the four liberal members and the \nfour conservative members, whatever you want to call it. That is a \npretty unpredictable vote.\n  Let's say something happens. Maybe there is a health issue. Maybe \nthere is a decision by that member there in the middle to retire. I \ndon't know. It could be a whole host of things. That is the human \ncondition. Things happen to us. Let's say we are in the last 18 months \nof an administration. The President is due to go out. The campaign has \nalready started. People are showing up in Iowa, New Hampshire, South \nCarolina, and everywhere else. They are raising money. They have \nPresidential races they are organizing, and they are doing all the \nthings they need to do. You have Republicans thinking: By golly, it is \nour time. We either keep the White House or win the White House. You \nhave Democrats thinking the same. And you have a President who all of a \nsudden has a Supreme Court appointment smack dab in the middle of four \nmembers on one side and four members on the other side.\n  Let's say the majority has the ability to put somebody of their own \nilk into that position--whether it is Republican or Democrat or liberal \nor conservative. They look at this and they say: You know, we could \nlose the White House or we might not get the White House. These are \nappointments for life. It is not as if we are appointing somebody for 4 \nyears; these are appointments for life. We have kind of come to the \nconclusion, as we talked about it on our side of the aisle, that, by \ngolly, it is in the best interests of this country if we can make this \nappointment. You know what. We do not have 60 votes to get it done. We \nhave counted the votes. It looks as though this is going to come out of \nthe Judiciary Committee on a straight party-line vote. What are we \ngoing to do now?\n  I know what will happen. You know what will happen. Every Member of \nthe Senate knows what will happen. I don't care if you are a Republican \nor a Democrat or a conservative or a liberal or a Socialist or whatever \nyou want to call yourself, we know what will happen. There will be a \nruling by the Chair. There will be an appeal by the majority leader. \nAnd all of a sudden we will have a rule where you can confirm a Supreme \nCourt nomination--a nomination to a job for life--based upon a majority \nvote. Does anybody think for a minute that is not going to happen? Does \nanybody think for a minute that the circumstances surrounding that will \nnot occur?\n  I guess if you are on the Republican side of the aisle and it is a \nvery strong conservative who is going to the Supreme Court, maybe you \nlook at that and say: Thank goodness. We saved the country.\n  Maybe if you are a Democrat and it is a good strong liberal who is \ngoing onto the Supreme Court, you say: Thank goodness. We saved the \ncountry, and it was worth it.\n  But you see, here is the dilemma in which we find ourselves. The \ndilemma in which we find ourselves is that the majority of this body \nhas now set the precedent and you cannot pull it back. There is not any \nway now that you can unwind the clock and turn back the clock.\n  Let me offer another thought. Let's say we are a few years down the \nroad and you have a piece of legislation and your side of the aisle has \ndecided that piece of legislation is absolutely critical for the future \nof this country. Maybe it is cap-and-trade, maybe it is another health \ncare bill--whatever. All of a sudden somebody says: We have to get this \ndone. We are in the last 12 months of this administration. We are \nlooking at the numbers. We are not going to win the White House again, \nthe way it is looking. The precedent is there: Appeal the ruling of the \nchair.\n  The point I am making is this. It is not that the rules were changed. \nThe rules have been changed in the Senate a number of times by the way \nthe Senate rules contemplate--with a supermajority voting to change \nthose rules. Now we have torn that up because now we have established a \nprecedent.\n  I am in the process of reading Senator Byrd's history of the Senate--\na remarkable man. I got to know him a little bit. He was still here \nwhen I came to the Senate, before he passed. He happened to be on the \nother side of the aisle, but I came to respect him so much. He would \nnever have stood for this. He never would have tolerated that this \ninstitution would be so mistreated by anybody, Republican or Democrat. \nBoy, in his heyday he would have been at his seat screaming at the top \nof his lungs about what we were doing to the Senate with this vote, \nwhat the majority was going to do to the future of this great body.\n\n  In his history of the Senate, he talks about how important it is that \nthere is this body where a minority view of the world can be \nrepresented.\n  If I were the majority leader, I guess I would like this to run \nefficiently and well-oiled and smoothly. I was a Governor. I was a \nmayor. The days when I got my way were much better than days when I did \nnot get my way. I did not like being frustrated by the legislature. I \ndidn't like the city council telling me I couldn't get my way. I could \nnot understand, some days, why they could not figure out that I was \nright.\n  One day I was sitting down with a State senator. He had been there a \nlot of years. I was complaining about the way the legislature was \ntreating me. I couldn't understand why the legislature couldn't follow \neverything the\n\n[[Page S8638]]\n\nGovernor wanted done. He listened very patiently and he looked at me \nand he said: You know, Mike, nobody elected you king.\n  I think that is what Bob Byrd would have said--nobody elected any of \nus king. You see, our Founders set up this system with the whole idea \nthat we would not have kings anymore, that there would be checks and \nbalances, and that we would be forced to deal with each other, \nsometimes more artfully than at other times but that we would be forced \nto deal with each other.\n  The majority leader came down here and he said: I don't understand \nthis, and he talks about this process. This process got started because \nhe filed cloture on 10 nominations. Why are we not working on this? If \nyou look at the history of the Senate over the last years--I have been \nhere; I watched it; I turn on my TV in the office to see what is going \non on the Senate floor. Do you know what I see? Exactly what you see, \nwhat all of us see. We sit hour after hour, in cloture or in quorum \ncall hour after hour when amendments are pending.\n  I thought--I had this mistaken impression--that every Senator could \nfile an amendment; that if I had a better idea on something, I could \nfile an amendment and I would get a hearing on the amendment. I would \nbe able to come down here and try to argue to my colleagues: Pass my \namendment. We have not seen that kind of process for years under this \nmajority.\n  I didn't think it was possible to mishandle the Senate when I came \nhere. I looked at the books of rules and interpretations and volumes, \nchapter after chapter written about the rules of the Senate, and I said \nto myself: There is no way you could mismanage this body because these \nrules are as intricate as they could be. Boy, was I proven wrong. You \ncan mismanage this body. We have seen it. And that is where we find \nourselves today.\n  At the end of the day, why did it happen? Why did it happen? Why are \nwe putting ourselves in this position? A former U.S. Senator from \nNebraska who had been here--I think he was here three terms. He had a \nwonderful saying. When his party was not in power, he would say at \nspeeches: Ladies and gentlemen, let me remind you, the worm will turn. \nIt was his way of saying: You know what. I have been in the majority \nand I have been in the minority, and it will change because the people \nwill send a message into this Chamber, just as they did on the health \ncare bill. They will send a message that this is not the kind of \ncountry they want.\n  We somehow have to figure out how to put this back in the box. This \nnuclear option needs to be sealed up, hidden away, and never used \nagain--I don't care if the Republicans are in the majority or the \nDemocrats are in the majority. This basically means, today, that all of \nthose rules, all of those chapters written about those rules have no \nmeaning whatsoever because there are no rules. If I do not like what is \ngoing on here and I am in the majority, all I have to do is appeal the \nruling of the Chair and get my team to stand together and we have \nchanged the way the Senate operates. It is as simple as that.\n  I think at times in our history we would like to think that we are \nthe smartest people in the world, that we thought of something no other \nperson has thought of in the history of this country. Not true. If you \nread what Senator Byrd wrote about the history of the Senate, many \ntimes U.S. Senators, dissatisfied, losing personally because of a \nruling of the Chair, had an opportunity to appeal that ruling and win \nand realized that was the wrong course of action because they would set \na precedent that you could change the rules by breaking the rules. That \nis exactly what happened a couple of weeks ago. It is not the fact that \nthe rule has changed, although I disagree with where we ended up, it is \nthe method by which the majority--Democrats--changed those \nrules, because that method is now precedent and it is now available to \nRepublicans and Democrats and it is wide open. I guarantee that in our \nlifetime we will see a Supreme Court nominee put on the Supreme Court \nby this method. I guarantee that we will see--whether it is in our \nlifetime or at some point after--that there will be a situation where \nlegislation is now done by a majority.\n\n  What does that mean for the country? I will give a good example. The \ngreat compromise protected States such as Nevada, Nebraska, and Iowa. \nWe all get two Senators. We all get to come to the floor and fight for \nwhat we believe in.\n  I imagine that every Senator would say something to the effect of: I \ncome from a beautiful State, the State of Nebraska. We are conservative \npeople by nature. I don't think you live in Nebraska unless you have a \npioneer spirit and you are conservative by nature. That is who we are. \nWe essentially believe that less government is a good idea.\n  When I was Governor, people didn't want me running their schools. \nThey had a school board. They felt they could make thoughtful and \nintelligent decisions about running their schools. I thought they could \ntoo. That is the nature of who we are.\n  Do you realize that on executive appointments--district court and \ncircuit court judges--we basically get dealt out of this. Let's say I \nhave a problem with a nominee, and I want to put a hold on that nominee \nuntil they come to my office and deal with me. Everybody on both sides \nof the aisle gets the opportunity to use that. Well, guess what. That \nwas voted away a few weeks ago.\n  Why would a Republican administration deal with anyone in today's \nmajority? Why would they care? It doesn't make any difference.\n  I went through that process. I was a member of the President's \nCabinet. I hope I would have the decency that if anybody asked me a \nquestion, I would answer the question or try to solve their problem or \ntry to work with them. Quite honestly, why do they need to? How can \nthat issue be forced now? They don't need your vote. They can get \nthrough the process if their party is the majority of the Senate. This \nbody was never intended to operate that way.\n  I want to spend a few minutes of my time talking about what I really \nthink this is about, and this makes it an even more tragic story. The \nmajority leader was here a few minutes ago and said: Well, if you are \ngoing to be like this, then we will work on Christmas. We will work the \nweekend before; we will work the day before.\n  I was sitting there thinking: What is new about that? What's even \nthreatening about that? I mean, that is the way business is done.\n  We sit through hours and hours of quorum calls and then all of a \nsudden they file cloture on 10 nominees 2 weeks before the break? It is \nkind of obvious to me what is going on here. Is it obvious to anyone \nelse what is going on here? They are trying to force the issue.\n  Why didn't we start working on this weeks ago? Why don't you run the \nSenate 24/7 so we can move amendments and give us the opportunity to \nvote on amendments? Why sit hour after hour in a quorum call?\n  I think what this is really all about is this: We had reached an \nagreement. Remember that evening when we all walked down the hall--\nRepublicans, Democrats, and Independents--and went into the Old Senate \nChamber and shut the doors. There was no media or staff. It was just us \ntalking about the Senate.\n  I am not going to share a lot about what was talked about in there, \nbut I thought it was a pretty good meeting. We have done that a couple \nof times. We did that on the START treaty, and we did it that evening a \nfew months ago.\n  It wasn't very pleasant, but over the next day or so we shook hands \nand said to each other: OK, we get it. We don't want to get in the \nbusiness of breaking the rules to change the rules. We understand the \nprecedent that is setting. Once you put that on the books, like I said, \nyou can't unwind the clock.\n  So, OK, this is what we are going to do--and I must admit I didn't \nlike it very much. I thought we were giving up too much. Having said \nthat, the alternative was not very attractive. We shook hands, like \ngentlemen do, and we called a truce and those were the rules we would \noperate under.\n  Everybody said: We dodged a bullet on that one, and the Senate will \ncontinue to function like it has functioned the last 225 years. It will \nfunction as a place where the minority, whoever that might be at any \ngiven time, has a\n\n[[Page S8639]]\n\nvoice. It is the only body in the world that operates like that.\n  As I said, I must admit I had qualms about it. I talked to some of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle about my qualms, and at the end \nof the day I reached the conclusion that it was better than the nuclear \noption.\n  So why did this come up again? If we had reached a deal--if we shook \nhands like gentlemen and women do, why did this come up again? I \nthought this was behind us. I thought we would make our way through \nnominations and work long hours. Most of these are very \nnoncontroversial, and I thought we had reached an agreement.\n  We had reached an agreement. We all knew we had reached an agreement. \nSo why did Democrats feel that all of a sudden we needed to revisit \nthis?\n  The argument I want to make tonight is this--and I am going to draw \non a little bit of history. When I first came here, I sat in a chair \nover there. I will never forget it. It was Christmas Eve day when we \nwere brought in here to vote on a piece of legislation. Christmas Eve \nvotes are pretty unusual around here. We all sat at our desks. We don't \nusually enforce that rule, but we all sat at our desks.\n  For people like me, I left this Chamber very, very sad and \ndiscouraged. On a pure party-line vote, a monumental piece of \nlegislation that practically no one had read and was poorly \nunderstood--in fact, the Speaker said: We have to pass this to \nunderstand what is in it. No truer words were ever spoken. It passed. \nNot a single Republican in the House or the Senate voted yes on that \nlegislation.\n  When I came here, I kind of had the idea that there would be give and \ntake, that I would get my idea, you would get your idea, and at the end \nof the day the Senate was a body that would force compromise or the \nbill wouldn't pass.\n  Something unusual happened. The President was a Democrat, the Senate \nhad 60 Democrats, so debate could end, and the majority of the House \nwas overwhelmingly Democrat. It became very clear to me that my view of \nthe world didn't matter, and it wasn't going to matter because as long \nas they could sweeten this thing up and do deals, and whatever else, my \nState was impacted by it. We all remember the Cornhusker Kickback. But \nat the end of the day it passed.\n  I could never figure out how that bill would work. It just didn't \nmake any sense to me. I had been a Governor. I had seen how failed \nMedicaid was--40 percent of the doctors would not take Medicaid. I \ncould not imagine how adding millions to that system was going to help \npoor people. To me it looked like it was going to hurt them. It was \nkind of like giving them the bus ticket and then saying: We are only \nrunning one bus in Washington, DC, these days. It is probably not going \nto be very successful.\n  I looked at what was happening in the rest of the bill, and it just \ndidn't make any sense to me. I think I know why we revisited this rule. \nWhen the rollout occurred right about that time, all heck broke loose. \nThe American people finally realized how bad this bill was. In fact, \nthere is one State out there, the State of Oregon, that didn't sign \nanybody up because their system melted down.\n  The exchange was a mess. People found out that all of these \npromises--remember this one: If you like your plan, you can keep it, \nperiod. If you like your plan, you can keep it, period.\n  Not only was that used on the campaign trail--you know, we all get \nout on the campaign trail and hyperventilate here and there. That \nphrase was used by somebody in real authority: The President of the \nUnited States of America. He went to the American people and said: If \nyou like your plan, you can keep it.\n  I said how could that possibly work. The whole idea is you have to \nforce people off their plan and onto a different plan. If you like your \nplan, you get to keep it?\n  In 2010, the administration's own rule on this subject showed that as \nmany as 80 percent of small business plans and 69 percent of all \nbusiness plans would lose their grandfathered status.\n  A very thoughtful Senator, a guy by the name of Mike Enzi, put in a \nresolution of disapproval which would have canceled that regulation. \nBack then he was able to get it to a vote. You would think that if you \nwant to support the President of your party and his pledge to the \nAmerican people--if you like your plan, you get to keep it, period--you \nwould vote with your President. You would think that would be 100 to 0.\n  I don't know how Republicans could be against that. I don't know how \nDemocrats could be against that. After all, that is what this person in \nauthority promised the American people: If you like your plan, you get \nto keep it, period. He said it over and over. It was like a broken \nrecord.\n  You know how that vote went here? Let me remind everybody. It failed \non party-line votes. Democrats voted no on the resolution: If you like \nyour plan, you get to keep it. My goodness. Is that an embarrassment or \nwhat?\n  What was the message that day? Were they trying to say: No, if you \nlike your plan, you don't get to keep it? The President isn't being \ntruthful with you. Was that the message that day? What was going on? I \nmean, I was stunned by that vote.\n  How could you be against the President's own promise? That was back \nin 2010. That information was available to the President and his people \nback in 2010. Yet they kept saying it: If you like your plan, you get \nto keep your plan.\n  One other estimate by the Congressional Budget Office, which I think \ngenerally we all respect--they do good work for us. They do our \nscoring. They said that up to 20 million employees could lose their \nemployer-sponsored insurance. Wait a second. That information was \navailable too. So how has this promise worked out?\n\n  This fall, more than 4.7 million cancellation letters went out in 32 \ndifferent States. I have read the articles. I imagine everybody in the \nChamber has read the articles. They say 4.7 million people got \ncancellation letters in 32 different States. The cancellation letter \nbasically said: Well, sorry. This big law got passed on a party-line \nvote, and you don't get to keep your plan, just as was predicted by the \nCBO and the administration's own people. This should not be stunning to \nanybody in this body, but it was stunning to the American people.\n  The President said: Oh my goodness. I think this is a problem. So he \nsaid to insurance companies: You have to fix this. You have to get \npeople their plan. If they like their plan, they get to keep their \nplan. And it didn't matter whether it was Democrats or Republicans in \ngiven States, they said: Mr. President, you can't unwind that clock.\n  What I would say to that is, wait a second here. I don't like this \nlaw, but it passed. I was sitting there the day it passed. It passed on \na completely party-line vote. And people literally were caught in a \nsituation--millions of them--where they realized they wouldn't get to \nkeep their plan. So could the President solve that problem? No. It \nwasn't a policy fix; it was a political fix. That is what he was doing. \nHe was literally trying to solve a political problem for the majority \nthat passed the darn bill. I mean, it is unbelievable.\n  Many weighed in. The American Academy of Actuaries said this:\n\n       Changing the ACA provisions could alter the dynamics of the \n     insurance market, creating two parallel markets operating \n     under different rules, thereby threatening the viability of \n     insurance markets operating under the new rules.\n\n  Now, I am as competitive as anybody. I have run a lot of elections. I \nunderstand the importance of being in the majority in this body. I \nespecially understand that after what the majority did over the last \nfew weeks. We went 225 years as a country, and it was only in the last \ncouple of weeks that the majority said: Look, we are tired of dealing \nwith you, minority. We are going to get our own way.\n  It reminded me of the day ObamaCare was passed. It was identical. It \nwas like: Johanns, get lost. We don't care what you think about this. \nWe have 60 votes. Sit down and shut up.\n  Is that the way the Senate is supposed to operate? I don't think so. \nI don't think that is what was envisioned when this body was put \ntogether, and it has been forever changed. It happened because \nObamaCare is out of control. It is not the Web site. The Web site was a \nmess. It just proved to us that the White House couldn't manage this. \nThat is what it proved to us. But we can fix a Web site. They can get \nsmart people who go in and figure it out.\n\n[[Page S8640]]\n\nThat wouldn't be me, but there are many people in the United States who \ncould be brought to bear to solve this problem of dealing with the Web \nsite. It is not the Web site, although it is a huge embarrassment. It \nwas a huge embarrassment for the White House. It was a huge \nembarrassment for the President of the United States. It was a huge \nembarrassment for Kathleen Sebelius. It was a huge embarrassment for \nthe Democrats who voted for this. But at the end of the day it can be \nfixed, and I would guess they would fix it. I kept saying to people \nback home that I think they will get it fixed. How tough is that? How \ntough would it be to do it the right way the first time? But they \ndidn't. It just proves they are not very competitive.\n  What is happening here is the wheels are coming off this policy \nbecause the policy never made any sense. When the President made this \nannouncement: Insurance companies, you fix it, America's health \ninsurance plans said that premiums have already been set for the next \nyear based on the assumption of when consumers will transition into the \nnew marketplace. Who decided when they would transition into the new \nmarketplace? The insurance companies didn't. The majority did. The \nWhite House did. Health and Human Services did.\n  They go on in their statement:\n\n       If now fewer younger and healthier people choose to \n     purchase coverage in the exchange, premiums will increase and \n     there will be fewer choices for consumers.\n\n  Well, let me say something that is obvious to everybody in this \nChamber. Your premiums are going up. Why? Young people are so turned \noff. Young people are so turned off by what is happening. I had a young \nperson show up at a town hall. This was a year and a half ago. They \nsaid: Here is kind of the deal. It is just my wife and I. We don't have \nchildren. We are both working. We are trying to get ahead. We don't \nmake a lot of money, and we decided the best plan for us was kind of a \ncatastrophic plan. We will deal with our day-to-day health care needs, \nwhich, incidentally, aren't much because we are young and fortunately \nwe are healthy. We have a high deductible.\n  I was listening to that, and I said: God bless you. This is America. \nThey can make that choice. That was the best choice for them. They \nthought about it and decided the money they were making might be better \nallocated someplace else. What a great country that people can decide \nthat.\n  Well, what happened with this health care bill? That decision was \ntaken away from that young couple. They were ordered by the Federal \nGovernment, under penalty, to buy a given plan. Now, I have not caught \nup with that young couple, but I bet they are mad as wet hens. I will \nbet they have looked at what has happened to them and they are saying: \nWhy?\n  We all know the little secret here: Young people are paying more for \ncoverage that they don't need to finance me in my sixties. Does that \nmake any sense?\n  I could go on and on about what is happening here with this health \ncare bill, but it is not sheer coincidence that Senators in the Senate \nreached an agreement months ago on the rules. We shook hands on it. We \nput that behind us. Right about the time ObamaCare rolled out, all of a \nsudden that agreement wasn't valid anymore, and we got set up on a \nmanufactured crisis to force a vote, and the method chosen to change \nthe rules forever changes how the Senate operates.\n  In our history, many Senators had the opportunity to change these \nrules and thought better of it because they so respected and admired \nthis institution, that they believed there was a place for a minority \nwhether that Senator was in the minority or the majority at the time. \nThat is what happened.\n  I will take another step. All of us know what this is really about. \nThis is about control of this body. All of a sudden, because of \nObamaCare and the truth coming out about what a terrible piece of \npolicy this is, it became evident that Members over here were in deep \ntrouble and were going to lose their elections if their elections were \nheld now, and the majority had to change the conversation. So the \nagreement we reached after that night we spent in the Old Senate \nChamber hashing through this, debating and discussing it, basically got \ntorn up and tossed out the window, and the majority forever changed how \nthis body will operate and what this body is going to be about in the \nfuture.\n  So what I say to my colleagues tonight is this: I am not planning on \nbeing here much longer. I have made that decision. One could say I \ndon't have a boxer in the ring. A year from now, I will be doing \nsomething else. Some will be here, some won't be here. But at the end \nof the day, what I will remember about this time in the Senate is that \na precedent was set that is vastly different from the way this Senate \noperated for 225 years. A precedent was set that allows the majority to \ntake control of executive branch appointments, district court \nappointments, circuit court appointments. It is a precedent that would \nallow a majority to take control of a Supreme Court appointment. It is \na precedent that will allow a majority, when it chooses to--not if; I \nbelieve it is a question of when--to take control of the policymaking.\n  So it is true when we say that if they were attempting to change the \nconversation, I say to the majority Members of the U.S. Senate, away \nfrom ObamaCare to this, all they have done is reminded the American \npeople that what they are really doing is abusing this institution in a \nway that, quite honestly, is going to be very hard to turn around.\n  My thought is this: I feel very strongly that we can reverse what has \noccurred here, but we can't do it as a minority. We need the majority \nto back off. We need the majority to recognize that this body has \nexisted through difficult times, it has existed through wars, it has \nexisted through attacks on our country, and we have found a way to \noperate. We need the majority to recognize that we reached an agreement \nmany months ago after an evening spent together in the Old Senate \nChamber where we debated these things and, like gentlemen and \ngentlewomen, we shook hands and put this behind us for this session.\n  We can do the work of the Senate. We can do the work for the American \npeople. I have no doubt about that whatsoever.\n\n  I am very concerned, though, that we have put the Senate in a \nposition where it is a very vulnerable body now. Any majority can now \nuse this precedent to turn this into something that is entirely \ndifferent than what anybody who founded this country believed it should \nbe. When the majority decided that it would bypass the requirement that \nrules would be changed by a two-thirds vote and do it by appealing the \nruling of the Chair, they put the Senate in a position where there are \nno rules. There are no rules. All you need is 51 Members--50 if you \nhave the Vice President in the Chair--who decide to stick together and \nmake that Supreme Court appointment. They can get it done. All you need \nis 50 Members, if you have the Vice President in the Chair, who decide \nthey stick together, and they would do a legislative process by a \nmajority vote.\n  Many, many times the nuclear option was discussed, it was debated, \nand Senators much wiser than I looked at the history of this great \ncountry and its future and decided it was a step that should never be \ntaken--that was until a couple of weeks ago, all driven by the fact \nthat this piece of legislation called ObamaCare has turned out to be \nsuch a train wreck and that there was a need to change the discussion \nand change the topic and try to draw the people's attention away from \nthat legislation, and that is how this rule got adopted. It is a sad \ntime in our Nation's history. It is a sad time in terms of what is \ngoing on.\n  What I would offer is my hope is that wise people will realize the \nproblems they have created for this country in the future, realize that \nthe precedent they have set forever changes the way we operate and back \naway from what occurred.\n  Let's start doing the work of the Senate. If that means we work \nthrough Christmas, good. I am here. If that means we work on weekends, \nif that means we work around the clock, fine with me. I am good. I will \ndo it. I will be happy to do it. But to try to streamline this process \nin a way that silences the minority is not right, and it is not what \nthis country should be about.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S8641]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nConnecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after I \nfinish speaking, Senator Blumenthal be allowed to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Sandy Hook\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, this Saturday we are going to mark the 1-\nyear anniversary of the shooting in Sandy Hook, CT, in which 20 little \n6- and 7-year-old boys and girls lost their lives, as well as 6 adults \nwho worked in that school who were charged with protecting them.\n  Senator Blumenthal and I have come down to the floor today to offer \nsome thoughts as we reflect on the 365 days that have passed since the \nmost horrific mass shooting that most of us have ever seen in our \nlifetimes.\n  I think back a lot on that day--being in the Sandy Hook firehouse as \nthe parents realized that their sons and daughters were not coming back \nfrom that school. One of the things I remember about that day is \ngetting an awful lot of phone calls from my colleagues from all around \nthe country, Senators and Congressmen who represented places such as \nColumbine and Aurora and Virginia Tech and Tucson. They all called \nbecause they had been through this before and they just wanted to offer \ntheir condolences and a little bit of advice on how a community can try \nto get through these awful, tragic, shattering incidents.\n  I sort of thought that day how awful it was that there were that many \ncolleagues, that many representatives from across the country who could \ncall and give me advice. What a tragedy it is that we are amassing this \nbank of expertise across the Nation on how to respond to mass \nshootings. It speaks to how far and wide the carnage and the \ndevastation are from these mass shootings that are occurring now it \nseems almost on a weekly or monthly basis somewhere around the country. \nIt is not getting better; it is getting worse.\n  In 1949 a guy by the name of Howard Unruh went through the streets of \nhis town of East Camden, NJ, firing shots indiscriminately such that he \nkilled 13 people. It was the Nation's first mass shooting. Now we have, \nunfortunately, had a lot of mass shootings since that first one in \n1949.\n  But here is what is stunning: Of all of the mass shootings that have \ntaken place since 1949, half of them took place from 1949 to 2007 and \nthe other half have taken place in the last 6 years. Something has gone \nwrong. Something has changed. The problem is that it is not this place. \nWe are approaching the 1-year mark of the school shooting in Sandy \nHook, and it will be a week of mourning, but here in the Senate it \nshould also be a week of embarrassment. It should be a week of shame \nthat after 1 year passing since 20 little boys and girls were gunned \ndown in a 5-minute hail of furious bullets, the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives have done nothing to try to prevent these kinds of mass \natrocities in the future.\n  I come down here today not just to challenge this place to act but to \ntell you a little bit about what I have learned in the last year. I \nhave learned a lot, but I want to distill it down to two pretty simple \nthings I have learned.\n  I did not work on the issue of gun violence when I was a Member of \nthe House of Representatives, in part because my corner of Connecticut \ndid not have tremendously high levels of gun deaths. Now it is central \nto my mission as a Senator.\n  What I have learned over the last year is that despite all the \nrhetoric we hear from the gun lobby, when you change gun laws to keep \nguns out of the hands of criminals and to take dangerous military-style \nweapons and ammunition off of the streets, guess what happens. \nCommunities become safer. The data tells us this.\n  Since 1998 the National Instant Criminal Background Check System has \nblocked more than 2 million gun sales to prohibited purchasers. That is \nup to 2 million criminals--people with criminal histories who should \nnot have bought a gun--who were prohibited from buying a gun. The \nbackground check system works but for the fact that only about 60 \npercent of gun purchases actually go through the system because more \nand more guns are being bought in online sales, more and more guns are \nbeing bought online, and more and more guns are being bought at gun \nshows.\n  We know background checks work because we have stopped 2 million \npeople who would be prohibited from owning guns because they have a \nhistory of domestic abuse or serious felonies or mental illness. Two \nmillion times we have stopped those people from getting guns.\n  Second, we can compare what happens in States with near universal \nbackground check systems versus States that have looser laws. I will \ngive you one statistic, for instance. In States that require a \nbackground check for every handgun sale, there is a 38-percent \nreduction in the number of women who are shot to death by intimate \npartners. Deaths from domestic violence are almost 40-percent less in \nStates that have near universal background checks.\n  The same data exists for assault weapons as well. In 1994 we passed \nthe assault weapons ban. Over the next 9 years crimes committed with \nassault weapons declined by two-thirds.\n  There are legitimate arguments that there are other factors that \ncontributed to that decline, but certainly a portion of that decline is \nconnected to the restriction on assault weapons. Thirty-seven percent \nof police departments reported a noticeable increase in criminals' use \nof assault weapons since the 1994 Federal ban expired.\n  When it comes to these high-capacity magazine clips, we do not need \nthe data that is out there because common sense tells us that if \nsomebody decides to do mass damage with a high-powered weapon, they are \ngoing to do less damage if they only have 10 bullets in a clip rather \nthan 30. Adam Lanza in Sandy Hook Elementary School got off 154 bullets \nand killed 20 children and 6 adults in less than 5 minutes. In Tucson, \na 74-year-old retired Army colonel and a 61-year-old woman were able to \nsubdue the shooter when he went to change cartridges. In Aurora, the \nrampage essentially stopped when James Holmes went to switch \ncartridges. When you have to reload multiple times, there are multiple \nopportunities for these mass shootings to stop. We should do things to \nmake sure the shootings never begin in the first place, but the carnage \nis much worse when these madmen are walking into shopping plazas, movie \ntheaters, and schools with 30-round clips and 100-round drums.\n  But here is the second thing I have learned. I learned this as well \nover the last year. I have learned about the amazing ability of good to \ntriumph over evil even when this place does not act to change the laws. \nI have learned that despite the evil of those 5 minutes in Sandy Hook, \nthe community of Newtown has amazingly found a way over and over to \nbring so much beauty and goodness to essentially cover up and drown out \nthat horror. I have seen these kids' memories become the inspiration \nfor literally thousands of acts of generosity and kindness.\n  Daniel Barden was a genetically compassionate little kid. He was that \nkid who always sat with the kid in school who did not have anybody \nsitting next to them on the bus or in the classroom. When his parents \nwould take him to the supermarket, they would be all the way to their \ncar with their groceries, and they would look back and Daniel would \nstill be at the door holding open the grocery store door for people who \nwere leaving.\n  His parents started a Facebook page that challenges people to engage \nin little, small acts of kindness in Daniel's memory. It had about \n40,000 likes the last time I had checked, and the stories are endless--\na woman who bought coffee and doughnuts for a firehouse in New York \nState; a Missouri woman who helped restock a food pantry in Daniel's \nhonor; a woman in Illinois who paid for a stranger's meal and just \nwrote ``Love from Daniel Barden'' on the bill.\n  Jack Pinto was a very active 6-year-old boy. He enjoyed playing \nsports of all kinds. He was buried in his New York Giants jersey. His \nparents, Dean and Tricia Pinto, have raised money and put some of their \nown money in to pay for hundreds of children all around the country to \nhave access to the same kind of opportunity to play sports that Jack \nhad, despite the fact that their families might not have the resources \nthe Pintos do.\n\n[[Page S8642]]\n\n  Jessica Rekos loved animals. She loved whales and horses most, so her \nparents started a foundation, the Jessica Rekos Foundation, and they \nhave provided yearlong scholarships for horseback riding lessons for \nstudents who would not otherwise have the resources to be able to have \nthe opportunity to enjoy horses in the same way Jessica did.\n  This week an effort is under way in Newtown and across the Nation to \ninspire people to every day do a different act of kindness as a way to \npay tribute to the 1-year anniversary. These charities that have sprung \nup in the wake of Newtown are doing amazing work to change people's \nlives--just the small acts of kindness that maybe we all do in trying \nto pay tribute to the memory of those kids and those adults. That makes \na difference.\n  Charitable acts and changes in behavior--they are necessary although \ninsufficient responses to the scourge of gun violence that plagues our \nNation.\n  This place has to change the laws. Do something because you do not \nwant to be next. You do not want to be sitting on a train station \nplatform, as I was on December 14, when you get a call that 10 or 20 or \n30 or 40 kids or adults have been gunned down in your State. You \ncertainly do not want to get that call when you had a chance, but you \ndid not take it, to do something to prevent it.\n  I got calls that day from my colleagues all across the country \nbecause there are not many corners of the Nation that have not been \ntouched by gun violence. Some 11,000 people have been killed by guns \nsince December 14 of last year. When one person is killed, \npsychologists tell us there are 10 other people who sustain life-\naltering trauma as a result of that shooting. So just imagine when 26 \nkids and adults die in a small community.\n  So I wish to leave you not with my words but with the words of a \nmother from Sandy Hook who represents the scope of the trauma that has \nbeen the reality for Sandy Hook for the last 365 days. Sandy Hook is \nrecovering but very slowly. The charities and the acts of kindness, \nthey make a difference, but there is a lot of head shaking in that \ncommunity as to why this place has not risen to the occasion, shown the \nsame type of courage those families have and done something to change \nthe reality of everyday and exceptional mass violence across this \ncountry.\n  Here is what this mother writes. These are her words in an open \nletter:\n\n       In addition to the tragic loss of her playmates, friends, \n     and teachers, my first grader suffers from PTSD. She was in \n     the first room by the entrance to the school. Her teacher was \n     able to gather the children into the tiny bathroom inside the \n     classroom. There she stood, with 14 of her classmates and her \n     teacher, all of them crying. You see, she heard what was \n     happening on the other side of the wall. She heard \n     everything. She was sure that she was going to die that day \n     and did not want to die before Christmas. Imagine what this \n     must have been like. She struggles nightly with nightmares, \n     difficulty falling asleep, and being afraid to go anywhere in \n     her own home. At school she becomes withdrawn, crying daily, \n     covering her ears when it gets too loud and waiting for this \n     to happen again. She is 6.\n       And we are furious. We are furious that 26 families must \n     suffer with grief so deep and so wide that it is \n     unimaginable. We are furious that the innocence and safety of \n     my children's lives have been taken. Furious that someone had \n     access to the type of weapon used in this massacre. Furious \n     that gun makers make ammunition with such high rounds and our \n     government does nothing to stop them. Furious that the ban on \n     assault weapons was carelessly left to expire. Furious that \n     lawmakers let the gun lobbyists have so much control. Furious \n     that somehow, someone's right to own a gun is more important \n     than my children's right to life. Furious that lawmakers are \n     too scared to take a stand.\n\n  She finishes by writing this:\n\n       I ask you to think about your choices. Look at the pictures \n     of the 26 innocent lives taken so needlessly and wastefully, \n     using a weapon that never should have been in the hands of \n     civilians. Really think. Changing the laws may \n     ``inconvenience'' some gun owners, but it may also save a \n     life, perhaps a life that is dear to me or you. Are you \n     really willing to risk it? There must not be another Sandy \n     Hook. You have a responsibility and an obligation to act now \n     and to change the laws.\n       I hope and pray that you do not fail.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, many words have been spoken since \nNewtown, including the very powerful words of my colleague just now. \nBut the plain, simple fact is no words can capture what I feel about \nthat day. No words ever will capture that day or the days and weeks and \nmonths afterwards, when we have grieved and healed and resolved that we \nwill do everything within our power to make sure that kind of massacre \nnever happens again.\n  But equally important is that the deaths by gunfire are reduced or \nprevented--those 26 senseless, unspeakable deaths of 20 beautiful \nchildren and 6 great educators but also the 194 children who have been \nkilled by gunfire since Newtown, and the 10,000 or more deaths caused \nby gunfire, person by person, a tragic river of senseless deaths that \nwe have the power to prevent, the power in this body and the power in \nthis Nation.\n  As much as we should be shamed and embarrassed by the failure to act, \nwe also must have hope and resolve that we will act. History is on our \nside. The example of courage and strength provided by those families \nought to give us the resolve and the determination to act; likewise, \nthe examples of courage and resolve by Father Bob Weiss, who had a \nservice in St. Rose of Lima on the evening of December 14, one of the \nmost moving public experiences I will ever have. As I said then, the \nworld is watching Newtown. The world has watched Newtown. It has \nwatched First Selectman Pat Llodra, who has led Newtown with her own \ncourage and strength and determination, including coming here as my \nguest on the night of the State of the Union to be an example for all \nof us about what a public official can do by her own example, leading \nby her own example.\n  We will mark, this Saturday morning, at St. Rose of Lima the 1-year \nanniversary at a service Senator Murphy and I will attend. I have worn \nsince virtually that day a bracelet. I wear it now. It says, ``We are \nNewtown. We choose love.'' If there is a message for all of us in this \nChamber, it is that we continue to choose love. We are all Newtown. Our \ntown is Newtown. All of our towns are Newtown. I see this bracelet \nliterally from the time I wake in the morning to when I go to bed. It \nwill always be an inspiration for me, inescapably our hearts and minds \ngo back to that moment when we first learned about this horrific, \nunspeakable tragedy.\n  Of course, I went to the Newtown firehouse that day. The sights and \nsounds of grief and pain are seared in my memory. They will be with me \nforever. So will be the story of the children whom we lost: Grace \nMcDonnell and Allison Wyatt, who loved to draw pictures for their \nfamilies and planned to be artists; Chase Kowalski, a Cub Scout who \nloved playing baseball with his father; Jessica Rekos, who wanted to \nresearch orca whales and become a cowgirl.\n  We will never forget the heroism and the bravery of the educators \nsuch as Vicki Soto and Anne Marie Murphy. Vicki Soto is in this \npicture. Her brother Carlos came to a service today here in Washington. \nHe has continued, and so have his sisters, to come to events that \nprovide impetus and movement and momentum to the effort to stop gun \nviolence.\n  Vicki Soto and Anne Marie Murphy literally shielded their students, \nsought to save them with their own bodies. Dawn Hochsprunk and Mary \nSherlach ran unhesitatingly toward the danger entering their school and \nperished doing so. There are heroes in this story. It is not only about \nbad people who used guns improperly and illegally; it is not only about \nevil; it is also about good. The good includes the first responders and \npolice who stopped the shooting when they came to the school and ran \ntoward danger and toward gunfire and thereby ended it, when the shooter \ntook his own life.\n  It is also about Ana Marquez-Greene, a beautiful girl who loved music \nand flowers, loved to wear flowers in her hair. She was described by \nBishop Leroy Bailey as a beautiful, adoring child. That picture evokes \nthe stories of all of those children: beautiful, adoring, a future and \na life ahead of them.\n  For all of those stories and the tears, and the teddy bears and \ntributes that were outside of the firehouse, Newtown has refused to be \ndefined simply by tragedy; refused to be locked in its past. It has \nmoved forward, because Newtown is not just a moment, it is a movement. \nIt is not just a moment in\n\n[[Page S8643]]\n\nhistory defined by tragedy, it is a movement to make the world better. \nIt is a movement to make America safer.\n  That is the movement we have articulated and sought to advance. Those \nfamilies, including Neil Heslin, who has come here numerous times for \nhis son Jesse, have been an example of courage. Indeed, they have been \nprofiles in courage. When Neil Heslin dropped Jesse off at school on \nthe morning of December 14, Jesse gave him a hug and said: ``It's going \nto be all right. Everything's going to be OK, Dad,'' because Jesse was \nthat kind of kid, Neil told the Senate Judiciary Committee in his \ntestimony. His pride in Jesse, as well as his grief, brought tears to \nall of our eyes.\n  Jesse was just that kind of kid. He never wanted to leave a baby \ncrying. He never wanted to leave anybody feeling hurt. Jesse and Neil \nused to talk about coming to Washington, about meeting with the \nPresident. Neil met with the President but Jesse was not there, at \nleast physically he was not there. He was with all of us as we worked \nwith Neil to make America safer and make sure Newtown is not a moment \nbut a movement toward a better, safer America.\n  I thank my colleagues for the outpouring of feeling and support on \nthe eve of that tragedy. It was a rare moment of bipartisan unison and \nfeeling as well as words. I wish to thank them as well for meeting with \nmany of those families because they demonstrated a graciousness and \ngenerosity regardless of their views on any of the issues relating to \ngun violence and any of the bills on the floor. That graciousness and \ngenerosity I hope will prevail on this issue and again move us forward.\n  The acts of kindness and generosity that followed have been inspiring \nas well.\n  College students and firefighters have come together to build \nplaygrounds in honor of the Sandy Hook victims. Bill Lavin of New \nJersey, on behalf of the New Jersey firefighter system, has done \nyeoman's work. There are now new playgrounds in their memory in \nNorwalk, New London, Fairfield, Ansonia, Westport, and Stratford.\n  I have visited many of them. They are distinct, reflecting the \ncharacter of those children such as Ana Marquez-Greene.\n  The Newtown High School football team took time away from celebrating \na perfect winning season to devote their efforts to the children and \neducators we have lost.\n  The Sandy Hook Run for the Families not only raised more than \n$450,000 for the Sandy Hook Support Fund, but it also broke the world \nrecord for attendance. In millions of actions, large or small, in \nConnecticut, all around the country, the people of Newtown, the State \nof Connecticut, and the country showed what compassion, giving, and \nkindness truly means in action. They chose to honor them by action.\n  Often the compassion and kindness unleashed by the Newtown tragedy \ntook many other forms that were unheralded, unreported, and unspoken. \nThese were acts of kindness that were not in the newspapers or in the \npublic view but simply acts that meant something to the recipient and \nto the giver.\n  These fundraisers and vigils, emails and postcards, small and large \nsigns of recognition and love from our colleagues, from people across \nthe country, are a form of giving back. They give me hope that \neventually we will prevail in this effort to make a difference.\n  Scarlett Lewis, Jesse's mom, is also a hero. She heard about the Cruz \nfamily who had lost two of their children to a drunk driver. Scarlett \nresponded with that same resilience and strength by offering to give a \nfundraiser for the Cruz family.\n  When she was asked about her family and about what she had done, she \nexplained:\n\n       What brings meaning to the suffering is doing something for \n     someone else. . . . In doing something for them I'm also \n     helping my own healing.\n\n  Nearly 90 percent of Americans support commonsense measures such as \nbackground checks, a number that is virtually unchanged since the issue \nsoared to the forefront of our political discourse in the wake of Sandy \nHook. Even in gun-owning households the support is virtually identical, \n88 percent. That figure hasn't changed. A mountain of public support \nhas failed to produce measures, but our resolve is unchanged because \nthose memories of Sandy Hook, those examples of kindness and \ncompassion, will drive us forward, as will the more than 10,000 other \nvictims including at least 14 children under the age of 12 in 43 \ndifferent States.\n  Congress has shamefully and disgracefully failed to act, but that is \nnot the end of the story. There has been one vote, and we lost, but \nthat vote is not the end of this movement. Newtown is not a moment. It \nis a movement. Surrender is unacceptable; the status quo is \ninexcusable. The families and Newtown community have refused to \nsurrender to personal despair, and we cannot surrender to political \ndismay or difficulty.\n  I was moved the other day when I saw a clip of Ronald Reagan \nendorsing the Brady bill. Ronald Reagan, as President, was a victim of \ngun violence, as was Jim Brady, who was paralyzed by the same hail of \nbullets that struck the President of the United States when they were \nfired by a deranged person, John Hinckley.\n  Twelve years passed before the Brady bill was passed. It was 12 years \nof struggle, work, resolve, and courage by Sarah and Jim Brady, with \neventually an endorsement by Ronald Reagan.\n  The sadness and anger I feel today, prompted by the memory of that \ntragedy and this body's failure to respond, is mitigated by the \nknowledge that history is on our side, that America is better than the \noath we took in April. The people of Newtown have not failed. The \npeople of America have not failed, and this body has not yet failed.\n  We can and we will do better because Newtown and that vote will be \nwith us.\n  Newtown is more than a moment. It is a movement that eventually will \nprevail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.\n  Mr. BURR. I rise to address the nomination of Cornelia Pillard to the \nDC Circuit Court. This nomination is a good example of government \noverreach that has led to things such as the ObamaCare debacle.\n  Let me say to my colleagues who have been on the floor speaking about \nNewtown, I had an opportunity to spend an hour with parents of Newtown \nchildren. It is a compelling personal story that they shared.\n  No parent should have to watch a child die. No parent should have to \nlive and a child die. My heart still goes out to those who lost \nchildren at Newtown.\n  Today, with the Affordable Care Act fresh on my mind, I venture back \nto think about when I came to the floor in 2009 and said in front of my \ncolleagues of the Senate and the American people--I wish to spend the \nbalance of this second half of the hour rehashing some of the things I \ncame to the floor to talk about.\n  There were numerous opportunities before the legislation was passed. \nI remember it was very close to Christmas in December of 2009.\n  I said premiums will increase for younger and healthier individuals \nbecause of the new federally mandated rating rules. Over 40 percent of \nthe uninsured are ages 18 to 34, the same group that will be hit with \nthe highest increases if this bill passes.\n  What do we hear Americans are focused on today? Young people. Are \nthey going to join?\n  Today their insurance is three times lower than what it will be in \nJanuary of 2014. Why? Because of the Affordable Care Act.\n  No. 2, premiums will increase because of new federally mandated \ninsurance standards. Experts estimate many of the health plans \npurchased today by individuals and small businesses will not meet the \nminimum requirements mandated by this bill, which means that all \nAmericans will be forced to buy richer plans.\n  Let me remind those who are listening that this was in 2009 on the \nSenate floor. Listening to the comments of those today who say we never \nanticipated some of these things would happen--if they didn't \nanticipate, it is not because people weren't on the Senate floor. It \nwasn't because we made this up. It is because people who were experts, \nCMS actuaries, CBO administrators, were sharing with us what would \nhappen if this legislation became law.\n  Premiums will increase because of new federally mandated benefit \npackages. The bill empowers the Secretary\n\n[[Page S8644]]\n\nof Health and Human Services to decide which benefits are covered and \nwhich benefits are not.\n  What are Americans learning every single day? When they can get on \nthe exchange, they are finding that they are 65 years old and they have \nto have maternity coverage.\n  I turned 58 and my wife has pretty much informed me we are not going \nto have more children, but I can't buy coverage without maternity \ncoverage. Why? Because they want to charge me more to shift that cost.\n  We didn't have health care reform. We just changed where we are \nshifting the cost from. Now we are embedding the premium versus \ncharging more at the delivery point of health care and shifting it \nwithin the delivery system.\n  We are shifting it within the population by charging those of us who \nare a little bit older more--because we mandate that we have to have \nservices we are never going to use--and younger people who are healthy \nwho probably are never going to need to go to the doctor. I hope they \ndo because prevention is actually one of the most beneficial things we \ncan promote. Now we are going to charge them three times what they were \npaying, and we believe they will take it?\n  Premiums will increase because of the new excise tax on medical \ndevices. Innovation is what saves health care dollars. Yet in the \nAffordable Care Act, or what some call ObamaCare, we actually put new \ntaxes on medical devices.\n  Every time we have a stent that is inserted, every time a medical \ndevice is used on a person, their health care bill goes up because we \nhave now taxed the device they are using. If the device price goes up, \nand the reimbursement goes up, the premium goes up.\n  It is starting to make some sense. Again, this was in 2009 before we \npassed the bill. Premiums will increase because of a new excise tax on \nhealth plans.\n  We actually taxed the same health plans that are in the exchange that \nwe told everybody would save them money. Premiums will increase because \nof the new excise tax on prescription drugs. Wait a minute. I thought \nwe were bringing down the cost of health care.\n  In 2009, again, new taxes on devices, new taxes on health plans, new \ntaxes on prescription drugs, these were all things that we all knew. \nThe President knew it. My colleagues who voted for the plan knew it, \nbut everybody seems to have amnesia today: Oh, my gosh. How could the \ncosts go up? I never knew this was going to require people to buy a \nhealth insurance policy that had benefits they would never use.\n  Premiums will increase because of a new fee to sell plans in the \nmandated exchanges. This phenomenal exchange market that created \ncompetition, we now created a new fee on the part of insurers to enter \nthe exchange. Premiums will increase because of a new tax for \ncomparative effectiveness.\n  Comparative effectiveness means we are trying to bring new generics, \nwhether they are in pharmaceuticals or biologics to the marketplace. We \nhave decided to tax that process. Premiums will increase because the \nbill forces 15 million more Americans to enroll in Medicaid.\n  Why is that happening? It happens because doctors are paid so little \non Medicaid that they have to charge more for everybody else. We are \ncost shifting when we purchase the premium, and all of a sudden we are \nlearning we are cost shifting even when the service is delivered. \nReform? No.\n  In 2009, again I came to the floor and I talked about the Affordable \nCare Act, ObamaCare. Zero times did it mention provisions prohibiting \nthe rationing of health care--zero. Nine times it mentioned new taxes \ncreated in the bill. Thirteen pages are in the table of contents. The \nbill weighed 20.88 pounds and it took 36 pages for the CBO to estimate \nthe pricetag of ObamaCare; 70 government programs authorized by the \nbill, and 1,697 times in the Affordable Care Act the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services was given the authority to create, determine, \nand define things in the bill. This is a bureaucrat whom we allowed \n1,697 times to determine what Congress's intent was in the legislation \nthrough almost 3,000 pages; 3,609 times the word ``shall,'' not \n``may,'' was in the bill. It cost $6.8 million to taxpayers per word.\n  Let me remind you. This is what I came to the floor and talked about \nin 2009 before the Senate passed this legislation in the dark of night.\n  Twenty-four million people left without health care. This is the bill \nthat was supposed to insure everybody. Twenty-four million people \nwithout health insurance; a $1.2 billion cost to the taxpayer per page, \nand $5 billion to $10 billion of additional funding needed for the IRS' \nimplementation of the bill.\n  In other words, we are going to fund $5 billion to $10 billion for \nthe IRS to chase down people who owe a penalty because they made the \ndetermination they couldn't afford or they didn't need health care \ninsurance.\n  There are $8 billion in taxes levied on uninsured individuals. There \nis a way to make health care affordable--tax people who don't have it.\n  So $25 billion of additional Medicaid mandates placed on States; $28 \nbillion in new taxes on employers not providing the government-approved \nplans; $100 billion estimated annually of fraud in Medicare and \nMedicaid; $118 billion in cuts in Medicare Advantage--to seniors all \nacross this country who found this product to be the one that provided \nthe most security and benefits for them; $465 billion in cuts to \nMedicare--cuts to Medicare. This was the health care system that was at \nthat time projected to be insolvent by 2017.\n  There are $494 billion in revenues from new taxes, fees, levied on \nAmerican families and businesses; a $2.5 trillion cost for full \nimplementation of the legislation.\n  At that time we had a $12 trillion debt. Today, we have a $17 \ntrillion debt. Health care was supposed to be more affordable because \nwe reformed it. We didn't reform it. We took it over. The Federal \nGovernment took it over.\n  Let me go to another process I talked about in 2009. This is all \nmarked up. It has been in my desk drawer since then. It is a word \nsearch of the bill. There are 4,677 times where the legislation said \nshall, must or require; 899 times it said tax, fee or revenue; 470 \ntimes it said agency, department, commission, panel or bureau; 196 \ntimes it said regulate or regulation; 134 times it mentioned treatment; \n180 times it mentioned prevention; 40 times it mentioned choice; 25 \ntimes it mentioned innovation; and 13 times it mentioned competition.\n  If we listen to those who are out selling this awful plan today, what \nare the three words we hear? Choice, innovation, competition--those \nthings that are mentioned the least in the almost 3,000 pages of health \ncare legislation in 2009. This bill wasn't reform. This bill spent \ntrillions of dollars at a time of record deficits and debt. When fully \nimplemented, I said then, this bill is projected to cost $2.5 trillion \nover 10 years. CBO said at the time that this bill will increase \nFederal health costs, not lower it.\n  What have we heard from the President? It is going to lower health \ncosts. It is going to bring it down. It is going to be more affordable. \nMiddle class, this is the greatest deal for you.\n  The bill raised taxes by more than $500 billion at a time of record \nunemployment. The bill violated the President's own pledge to protect \nthe middle class. Who gets taxed in this bill? Again, this is from 2009 \non the Senate Floor, right here, before the vote. Uninsured Americans, \ninsured Americans, families with high-value insurance plans, high \nhealth costs, small business, individuals who need medicines or medical \ndevices, and employers that provide retiree drug coverage. Employers \nthat provide retiree drug coverage, we tax them.\n  The bill cut $466 billion in Medicare to fund new government \nprograms. Medicare faced at that time a $38 trillion underfunded \nliability and insolvency that was projected to occur in 2017. Instead \nof fixing those problems, this bill raided Medicare to start a new \ngovernment entitlement. The bill cut Medicare Advantage. It cut \nhospitals, it cut nursing homes, it cut home health, and it cut \nhospice.\n  Nobody in the administration can go out today and say: Oh my gosh, we \ndidn't know this was going to happen. We talked about it right here day \nafter day after day.\n  These are not things we made up. If we did, we would be prophets, \nbecause they are all coming true. Everything is aligning with what we \nsaid.\n  The bill would increase premiums, making care more expensive, not \nless. I mean let's get past what was the easy\n\n[[Page S8645]]\n\npart, and that was setting up the exchange, setting up the Web site. Or \nat least it should have been.\n  New taxes in this bill will get passed on to consumers, increasing \nyearly premiums--this is what I said then; listen to this--by $488 a \nyear, according to some estimates. The average premium would increase \nby $2,100 for a family policy in the individual market.\n  There are individuals who are seeing $488 a month in increase, and in \naddition to that a deductible they have never had applied to them \nbefore.\n  This bill imposed costly new burdens on struggling States. The bill \nthreatens health care choices millions now enjoy with a tangled web of \nnew rules, regulations, and government-run plans. The government will \nrequire you to purchase insurance or face a fine and will tell you what \nkind of insurance you have to have, even if you like what you currently \nhave.\n  I am not a prophet. I was going by what the experts said in reading \nthe bill. So for everybody who went out and said: If you like your \ninsurance, you can keep it; if you like your doctor, you can keep him; \nif you like your hospital, you can keep it--we were on the Senate Floor \nsaying: That is not what the bill says. It is not going to happen.\n  This bill cut $135 billion from hospitals, $120 billion from 11 \nmillion seniors on Medicare Advantage, nearly $15 billion from nursing \nhomes, nearly $40 billion from home health agencies, nearly $7 billion \nfrom hospice. Cutting Medicare to fund a new government program in my \nbook is not reform. It is ignorance.\n  The CMS Office of the Actuary--let me tell you, the Actuary is like \nthe gold standard. The CMS Actuary is like the guy who puts that stamp \nof approval on it, and there is nobody higher from the standpoint of \nwhat the actuary says. He says the bill increases national health \nexpenditures. National health expenditures under this bill would \nincrease by an estimate of a total of $234 billion, 0.7 percent, during \n2010 and 2019.\n  That is exactly the opposite of what everybody is out saying today. \nDespite promises that reform would reduce health care spending growth, \nthe bill actually bends the health care curve upward. According to the \nanalysis, the national health expenditure as a share of GDP is \nprojected to be 20.9 in 2019, compared to 20.8 percent under current \nlaw.\n  How could you go out and make a claim this was bending the cost curve \ndown? How could you promise the American people it was going to be \ncheaper?\n  The total number of persons with employer coverage in 2019, according \nto the CMS Actuary pre-2009, when the bill was passed, was projected to \nbe 5 million lower under the reform package than under current law. Let \nme say that again. The CMS Actuary told us in 2009, before we passed \nthis bill, that employer-based coverage would drop by 5 million \nindividual covered lives. I might say that some estimates are coming in \nat 100 million employees losing their health care under employer plans \nright now.\n  The new fees for drugs, devices, and insurance plans in the bill will \nincrease prices and health insurance premium costs for consumers, and \nthis will increase the national health expenditure by approximately $11 \nbillion per year.\n  The bill funds $930 billion in new Federal spending by relying on \nMedicare payment cuts which are unlikely to be sustainable or \npermanent. As a result, providers could find it difficult to remain \nprofitable; and absent legislative intervention, they might end their \nparticipation in the Medicare program, possibly jeopardizing the care \nto beneficiaries.\n  See, it wasn't Republicans who talked about rationing, it was the \nActuary at CMS in his analysis of the Affordable Care Act. He said: \nHere is what is going to happen. It is seniors who are going to get \nhosed on it because they are not going to have access to the doctors \nanymore.\n  The bill is especially likely to result in providers being unwilling \nto treat Medicare and Medicaid patients, meaning that a significant \nportion of the increased demand for Medicaid services would be \ndifficult to meet.\n  How could anybody listen or read what the CMS Actuary said and \nremotely go out and tell the American people: Geez, this is going to \nincrease coverage for everybody.\n  The CMS Actuary noted that the Medicare cuts in the bill could \njeopardize Medicare beneficiaries' access to care. He also found that \nroughly 20 percent--20 percent--of all Part A providers--hospitals, \nnursing homes, et cetera--would become unprofitable within the next 10 \nyears as a result of these cuts, meaning they are going to go out of \nbusiness.\n  You know, pretty soon it is not going to be the network the insurance \nprovider put together, it is going to be the fact the hospital went out \nof business because they couldn't withstand what this bill has done to \nthem.\n  The CMS Actuary found further that reductions in Medicare growth \nrates through the actions of the Independent Medicare Advisory Board--\nnow, that is going to sound a little odd to some because prior to the \nbill passing it was called the Independent Medicare Advisory Board, but \nit is now called the Independent Payment Advisory Board--IPAB--an \nentity that when set up and it is kicked in--16 members picked by the \nPresident--will determine reimbursements and scope of coverage. It is \nnot the Congress of the United States. If we don't legislatively do \nsomething with their recommendation, it becomes law. It goes into \neffect.\n  The bill would cut payments to Medicare Advantage plans by \napproximately $110 billion over 10 years resulting in less generous \nbenefit packages and decreasing enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans \nby about 33 percent. So 33 percent of seniors would lose their \nAdvantage plan. Again, this is 2009. This is not today.\n  The President, in 3,000 pages said it would reduce costs. The chief \nactuary says that is not the case.\n  Let me read a letter I got in the last couple of weeks from Lori \nPerez from Willow Springs, NC.\n\n       I am a divorced mom of three. I received insurance through \n     my employer. My rate has increased $100 a month. This is a \n     huge difference that will have to be budgeted by reducing \n     groceries and foregoing my son's braces I had planned for \n     2014. I looked into dropping my company provided insurance to \n     join an exchange but I do not qualify to receive a subsidy \n     because my insurance rate is less than 9\\1/2\\ percent of my \n     income. It is 9 percent. My yearly income qualifies. \n     Apparently, Obama thinks I can afford an additional $1,200 a \n     year. I am considering dropping my insurance, paying out of \n     pocket as needed for health care, and paying the fine at the \n     end of the year. It would be less expensive. This is \n     ridiculous. What can we do?\n\n  What do you say to Lori? Oops. That is the law. Here is somebody who \nwas 100 percent satisfied, an employer doing the right thing, and the \nFederal Government has now put her in a situation where she is \nconsidering just giving up her health care, doing away with it. Why? \nBecause she can't afford it. This is a woman with a job. She is \nthinking about giving up her groceries and delaying her son's braces. \nWhy? Because of ObamaCare.\n  Where are we today? Let me speed forward. I said we have the health \ncare exchange, the healthcare.gov Web site. There are companies every \nday that get Web sites set up. This one is complicated. They had 3 \nyears to do it. It still is not right today. But I am convinced they \nwill get it right.\n  For the first time the American people are getting on the Web site \nand they are able to look at the health care options they have. And \nwhat are they finding? They are finding that the premium costs for \nsomething equal to what they had are two times, three times more \nexpensive per month. They are finding this new thing they have never \nhad before called deductibles. And I am not talking about a $100 \ndeductible that you pay before you get participation in a doctor's \nvisit or an emergency room visit; I am talking about $1,000, $3,000, \n$5,000. I have heard from friends who have now signed up for plans and \nhave a $15,000 deductible.\n  I say to my colleagues--especially my colleague from Florida--it \nsounds like a health savings account, doesn't it? You have insurance, \nbut you are responsible for the first $15,000. The guy who shared that \nwith me, his premium is $1,444 a month with a $15,000 deductible. I \ndon't think he is going to drop it, but sticker shock is rampant.\n  Benefit package. How many people have come up to me and said: I am \nnot going to have any more children, but I have to have maternity \ncoverage. Something is wrong.\n\n[[Page S8646]]\n\n  They are right--something is wrong.\n  How many kids would like to have a scaled-down version that allows \nthem to have a set of benefits, and they are willing to roll the dice, \nand if something bad happens, they will pay out of pocket? No, they \ndon't get that option. The choice does not exist--unless it is a choice \nof the things created in the Affordable Care Act.\n  Networks. This is one the American people haven't gotten to yet, and \nI can't wait until it happens. I have gone through getting on the DC \nexchange and going through the process of trying to figure out whether \nmy doctor in North Carolina is available in this plan or that plan. \nWait until the American people go onto healthcare.gov and they start \npicking a plan and look to see: Is my primary doctor on there? Is my \nhospital on there? Is the specialist I see on there? Are the drugs that \nI take on this plan?\n  This is incredibly complicated. The American people were used to \ncalling their insurance broker and saying: Here is how much coverage I \nwant, here is how much I have to spend, and here is my health \ncondition. And they designed a program to meet their health condition, \ntheir income, and their age. Now we penalize you for your age--if you \nare old or young--and we force everybody to take the same benefit \npackage regardless of whether they can afford it, and we say: If you \ndon't get it, we are going to charge you this year a 1-percent penalty \non your income, and that goes up to 2\\1/2\\ percent at the end of the \ntransition period.\n  We are going to get past this period which I call the enrollment plan \nperiod. Next, we get to the part the President delayed. We never \nunderstood that something that was in statute, the executive branch \ncould just decide, no, it is not going to go into effect. But for large \nand small employers, they had a 1-year delay. All of a sudden, in 2015, \ntheir employees are going to be in the same marketplace that we are.\n  What makes that particularly difficult is we extended the enrollment \nperiod for individuals in healthcare.gov until March 31, 2014. They can \nstill enroll. Well, April 1, 2014, through April 27, 2014, insurers \nwill have to decide what their premium cost will be in 2015. So given \nthat they have no real experience on what the mix of ages and health \nconditions in their plan is, what are they going to do? They are going \nto err on the side of higher premiums; that is, higher than we will see \nin 2014, which a majority of the American people say are higher than \nthey can afford. Imagine what it is going to be like in 2015. And in \nthat group is the 80 percent of America, not the 5 to 10 percent who \nare provided for by employers today.\n  I see my colleague here, and I am infringing on his hour, but I do \nwant to stress one last thing. I mentioned only once the Independent \nPayment Advisory Board, IPAB. At the end of the day, mark my word, \neverything that I commented on I read from my 2009 notes--notes that I \ncame to the floor then and said: This bill shouldn't become law, and \nhere is why. I spent 5 minutes talking about that today.\n  But I am going to make this statement, and I will come back to the \nfloor 2 years from now when IPAB is up and running and the benefit \npackages have been cut down and the reimbursements have been cut to \ndoctors and hospitals, and I will point to the statement that I made \nhere that picking a 16-member advisory panel that has the authority and \nthe power to set the scope of coverage and, more importantly, the \nreimbursements will have a most devastating effect on health care in \nthis country.\n  It will ration health care because of the doctors who choose not to \nparticipate in plans that participate in the exchange. It will force \nhospitals out of accepting plans that participate in the exchange. And \nfor those of us forced by government to be in the exchange and to \nchoose, our choices will be gone. Our costs will go up. We will get \ncare--when we are queued in line or at the emergency room or from a \ndoctor we don't know or don't trust or from a hospital we have to drive \nto. It is not going to be reassuring to that mother who now has \nmaternity coverage but no obstetrician and no local hospital to deliver \na child because, you see, we didn't reform health care. We didn't do \nanything to liability. We just changed the pocket we pay out of. We \ntaxed everybody we could find to pay for it. And still--as I said in \n2009 and I believe will be true today--at the end of the process, there \nwill be 24 million people without health insurance. Why? Because of \nObamaCare. Because of the choice--or the lack of choice--we gave them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I intend to be here for the next little \nbit--under an hour--sharing this time on the floor with you to discuss \nsome of the issues before us, particularly the pending issue before us \nof nominations and the concern we have about that.\n  People back home and across the country may be watching the news \ntonight or perhaps over the last few weeks they have watched the news \nand wonder what this debate is about. I wish to use this opportunity \ntonight to address the nomination of Cornelia Pillard for the DC \nCircuit because it is a good example of the government overreach that \nhas impacted all sorts of issues in our lives. So on this nomination \nissue, let's lay the groundwork here so people back home understand \nwhat is happening.\n  Last week or the week before last the Senate majority, by a simple \nmajority vote, changed the practice of the Senate that has existed here \nsince the beginning of the Senate, and they did so in an effort to grab \nmore power for themselves and the President.\n  Basically, here is the precedent which has been set here and which is \nexemplified by the nomination before us. The precedent which has been \nestablished from now on is that any Presidential nominee, except for \nthe Supreme Court--at least for now--is only going to need a simple \nmajority vote to confirm them. There are problems with that because in \nthe Constitution it gives the Senate--wisely--the power to advise and \nconsent. The reason that was done, especially for judges, is that these \nare lifetime appointments. When someone is made a Federal judge, it is \nfor the rest of their lives--unless they are impeached, which is a rare \noccurrence, thankfully. So these are people who are going to serve on \nthe bench for the rest of their working lives, making decisions about \nthe application and interpretation of our Federal laws. That is why the \nSenate was given this extraordinary opportunity to vet these people and \nto look for a supermajority of votes in this Chamber before someone is \nput in a position such as that. The other positions, of course, are \nCabinet nominees, and so forth, and those are very important as well.\n  By breaking the rules to change the rules of the Senate--something \nthat, by the way, we were told at least on two occasions this year was \nnot going to happen but ultimately did--what we basically saw was the \nramming through--just as ObamaCare was, on a party-line vote--of the \nPresident's nominees, and tonight's nominee is an example of that. This \nis going to have enormous consequences on this institution for sure. \nYou are seeing it play out tonight.\n  I say to my colleagues in the majority party that the history of this \nbody is that power trades hands. I believe that as early as January \nnext year when a new Congress reconvenes, you won't be in the majority, \nyou will be in the minority. Soon thereafter, there may be a Republican \nPresident appointing judges and appointing Cabinet members and other \nappointees. Now, all of a sudden, a simple majority is going to be \nenough, and you have set that precedent.\n  Beyond the impact that is going to have on this institution, it is \ngoing to have an impact on this country. It is going to have the impact \nof putting these activist judges, such as the nominee before us \ntonight, on the bench. It is going to have an impact on a wide range of \nissues, from ObamaCare, to the sanctity of life, to the Second \nAmendment, just to name a few.\n  Why does the majority want to pack this particulate bench, this \nparticular DC Circuit Court of Appeals with a supermajority? Why? Well, \nit is because it is a court which is often called the second highest \ncourt in the country. It is a court which is key in reviewing all these \nregulations that are being imposed upon us. It is a court which is key \nin reviewing all these assertions of Executive power that this \nPresident and other Presidents have instituted.\n\n[[Page S8647]]\n\n  The current DC Circuit as currently made up has proven to be somewhat \nof an obstacle to the big-government agenda the White House and the \nmajority here in the Senate have been pursuing, and they don't like it. \nThat is, by the way, why the majority leader earlier this year said: We \nneed at least one more--meaning one more judge--and that will switch \nthat majority on that court. Well, with that vote, by changing the \nrules, that is what they are setting up for here.\n  Now they seek to expand it tonight or early tomorrow with a nominee \nwho, quite frankly, is completely out of the mainstream. For example, \non the question of abortion, do you know what Professor Pillard calls \npregnancy? ``Conscription into maternity.'' I don't know what that \nmeans, but I bet the vast majority of Americans would see that as \noutside the mainstream.\n  By the way, as you look at the majority pulling out all these stops \nto confirm controversial nominations, such as this one who is someone \ncompletely outside the mainstream, they do so despite the fact that \nthey have spent most of the last 10 years basically filibustering some \nof former President George W. Bush's best nominations to the judiciary, \nespecially to the DC Circuit. Let me give some examples.\n  Senate Democrats, over 2 years, refused to even give Peter Keisler a \nJudiciary Committee vote despite his extraordinary credentials and a \nrecord of public service. At the time, they argued among other things \nthat maybe the DC Circuit wasn't busy enough to warrant filling some of \nthese vacancies. He was just the most recent of several Republican \nnominees to the DC Circuit whom Senate Democrats blocked and \nfilibustered. There were others. For example, they successfully \nfilibustered Miguel Estrada, a Honduran-born legal superstar, a person \nwho some said may one day be the first American of Hispanic descent to \nserve as a Supreme Court Justice. Senate Democrats voted seven times to \nfilibuster this great American success story and this great judge. \nOther nominees to the DC Circuit, including then-California Supreme \nCourt justice Janice Rogers Brown and Brett Kavanaugh, also faced long \ndelays of failed cloture votes and filibuster attempts, as did, by the \nway, President Bush's nominees all across the country.\n  The numbers on this issue do not lie. Numbers are facts, and the \nnumbers don't lie about the double standard that has been applied here \ntoday. For example, tonight's vote on Judge Pillard will come after \njust 190 days after her nomination. For historical context, Senate \nDemocrats obstructed now-Chief Justice John Roberts' DC Circuit \nnomination by 729 days. Another impressive nominee whom I mentioned \nearlier, Mr. Cavanaugh, took 1,036 days. Miguel Estrada was obstructed \nfor 184 days. Janice Brown's nomination took 684 days. Tonight, 190 \ndays. And on that and similar cases, they have completely changed the \nrules of the Senate and how the Senate nominates people to lifetime \nappointments to the second highest court in the land.\n  But despite this record and despite the fact that the DC Circuit is \nstill known to be underworked today, the majority presses ahead on what \nwill be a midnight or 1 a.m. vote to install a controversial law \nprofessor on the Nation's second most important court.\n  So what has changed? What caused the same people who used to \nroutinely filibuster highly qualified judges to now come here and make \nthese changes?\n  What has changed is that now there is a Democrat in the White House. \nWhat has changed is they now want an ideologically compliant court. \nWhat they want is a liberal activist court, one that protects all the \nthings they have rammed through Congress over the years and imposed \nthrough regulations and pushed through Executive order.\n  Now we know why Senate Democrats were less interested in the workload \nof the DC Circuit or the objective qualifications of the nominees over \nthe past decade, why they were less concerned about that than they are \ntoday. It is because their dreams came true of having a Democrat in the \nWhite House and a majority in the Senate so their efforts to keep \nvacancies open, that is what has brought us here today, in order to \nfill them in order to radically change the Federal judiciary into their \nown image.\n  But I think what is important to understand is that this whole effort \nto start this debate about judges and all that is an effort to distract \nfrom another big government intrusion that everyone knows too well; \nthat is, ObamaCare. Interestingly enough, this Sunday I was at a \nwedding. I was approached by someone who had a story similar to what my \ncolleague from North Carolina just outlined. This is outside of \nObamaCare. This is someone who has employer-provided care, but that is \ngoing to be impacted by these changes that are happening in the law. \nShe had just gotten notice that her premiums had gone up, but here is \nwhat is worse. Her deductible had gone up to about $5,000 or $6,000. \nShe doesn't have $5,000 or $6,000. The way she quickly figured it out \nis she is going to have to spend $6,000 she doesn't even have before \nshe can even begin to use the health insurance plan that she can barely \nafford. She is basically uninsured.\n  I wish I could tell you that is a rare story and we are not getting a \nlot of input about that, but we are. This ObamaCare disaster is \nstarting to take its toll. I think it is unconscionable, by the way, \nthat the majority seeks to distract focus of this body on these \nimportant issues such as ObamaCare by pulling this stunt on the judges. \nBut what it doesn't stop is the wave of letters we are getting from \npeople all across the country. These letters are not talking points. \nThese are not complex policy analysis. These are not op-eds in \nnewspapers. These are the letters from real people who are being \nimpacted in real ways by this law.\n  I wish to share with you some of their stories. I am going to leave \ntheir last names out to protect their privacy, but I wish no share with \nyou some of these examples because these are very typical of the kinds \nof things we are hearing about all across the country.\n  Philip in Winter Springs. Philip is retired. He is living on a fixed \nincome with insurance from United Health Care that he has for himself \nand for his wife. His monthly premium increased from $530 to $867. That \nis over a 60-percent increase in his monthly premium and his $15 copay \nhas doubled now to $30.\n  How about Charles in Winter Garden? Charles had employer-provided \nhealth care which ObamaCare caused to spike in price nearly 80 percent \nmore for his plan and his deductible is $12,000. He cannot afford $156 \na week for health insurance if he wants to be able to provide for his \ntwo children and pay his bills.\n  Here is one from Janet in Titusville. Janet is a single mom who is \nlosing insurance for herself and her children in January. This is not \nJanet's first challenge with the economy, by the way. She has been \nunemployed for 3 years. She took an underemployed job to provide \ninsurance for her kids but only to lose it 1 year later. She just wants \ninsurance that doesn't cost nearly 10 percent of her income so she can \nprovide for her kids.\n  David in Lakewood Ranch has an insurance plan that will be canceled \nas of April 1, 2014. His current policy costs him about $291 a month \nwith a $6,000 deductible. The new policy his insurance company \nsuggested raises his monthly premium over 60 percent to $466 with a \n$12,000 deductible as well. David also looked at the silver plan for \nthe exchanges but the monthly costs would be $525, with a $7,500 \ndeductible. David's other problem is if he waits until his current plan \nis canceled on April 1, 2014, any other costs he has leading up to his \ndeductible did not count on the new policy so he will be spending even \nmore trying to reach a deductible that will increase along with his \nmuch higher monthly premiums. As he wrote to our office: I just want my \nold plan back.\n  Colleen in Winter Park is self-employed. She chose to have a plan \nthat costs her $60 a month because that is all she can afford. She says \nthat while she knows if she had to use her policy there would be \nhospital costs, she is more than willing to accept the risks.\n  Guess what. Her policy has been canceled. The new option is a $600-a-\nmonth plan and there is no way she can afford that plan. There is no \nway she can afford it.\n\n[[Page S8648]]\n\n  How about Sarah in Live Oak. Sarah had an individual policy for \nherself with a $2,000 deductible that ran $68 per month. Her plan has \nbeen canceled. Now she is looking at a $288-a-month plan with a $5,000 \ndeductible. She feels she has been lied to by the President and by \nCongress and who can blame her for feeling that way.\n  How about Warren in Sanford. Warren in Sanford had health insurance \nfor his family, four members of his family, with a monthly premium of \n$533 and a $10,000 deductible. While he would have preferred a lower \ndeductible because his family is healthy and he was willing to take \nthat risk, now that plan is gone. So Warren went on the exchanges to \nlook for a new policy. His new monthly price was $1,300, more than \ndouble his old plan, with a $13,000 deductible. As Warren noted: \n``Bottom line is I will be paying more and I will be getting less.'' He \nwill be forced to do things like skip vacations or miss out on his \nchildren's activities.\n  Then there is Joe in Melbourne Beach. Joe had a health care plan that \nwas canceled because of ObamaCare. He liked his plan. He told our \noffice that he ``took great care in selecting my plan that I felt was \nright for me and for my needs.'' Now he has to shop for a new plan and \nall he sees are more expensive options. He tried the ObamaCare Web \nsite, but it did not work for him, and on top of the Web site not \nworking he is nervous about security risks when it comes to submitting \nhis information to these Web sites.\n  There is Kenneth in Land O Lakes. He and his wife had a private \ninsurance plan for over 11 years, but they do not anymore. They \nreceived a letter in the mail canceling their plan, telling them that \n``due to the recent ACA legislation this policy is no longer \navailable.'' The new option that is available to him, by the way, is \nfrom an insurance company that had a premium that was double the price \nof his current plan: $2,400 more a year. He doesn't know how he is \ngoing to cover this additional expense.\n  I don't think anyone disputes that we have a health insurance problem \nin America. But this is a disaster. Of course they want to do this \njudge thing. Of course they want to trigger some sort of fight about \njudges, Republicans objecting to judges and nominees. If you supported \nthis, if you had voted for the law that does this to people, you don't \nwant to talk about this. If you are responsible for the passage of this \nlaw, if you have gone around the last 2 years bragging about this law, \nif you are the one who went around telling me if you have a policy you \nlike you can keep it, why would you ever want the world focused on \nthis?\n  The problem is people are going to be focused on this because this is \nno longer a theory. ObamaCare is no longer some theoretical thing that \nis going to happen at some point in the future to someone else. \nObamaCare is happening to real people right now. Right now, all over \nthis country, people are feeling these impacts. These are real people. \nThis is not some outside third-party group running a commercial. This \nis not someone here giving a speech about what they think is going to \nhappen. This is what is happening now and there are going to be more of \nthese and it is going to impact Republicans and Democrats and \nconservatives and liberals, red States and blue States. Everyone is \ngoing to be impacted by this. They already are being impacted by this. \nThis is going to have a dramatically negative impact on our economy, on \nour people, and our country as a whole.\n  That does not mean we do not have a health insurance issue that \nshould not be addressed. We could have addressed it and we still can \nby, for example, giving people more options in a truly vibrant, \nprivate, personal marketplace. Allow people to buy insurance from any \ncompany in America that will sell it to you. Allow people to buy it \nwith money that is not taxed, just like when your employer buys it for \nyou. Incentivize, encourage people, make it easier for people, make it \nmore rewarding and more flexible to put money in a health savings \naccount so you can have tax-free money you can use to pay your \ndeductible, to pay your copayments, to pay out of pocket, to pay for \nyour kid's braces. These are real options that are available to us, \nnone of which were pursued.\n  Instead, what was pursued is this big government solution, one-size-\nfits-all plan rammed down the throats of the American people just like \nthe judges, just like the nominee tonight. She is being rammed down our \nthroat. Because when what you stand for cannot withstand scrutiny, when \nyou have a judge such as the one before us tonight who is so outside \nthe mainstream, you don't want a process that examines their record and \nrequires consensus. You have to ram it through. When you have a law \nthat so fundamentally alters the makeup of American health care, you \ndon't want this thing being analyzed. You have to ram it through. They \ndid it on ObamaCare and they did it on judges.\n  There is a reason our Republic was set up this way. There is a reason \nthe system of checks and balances was set up this way. There is a \nreason the Senate was built this way, with people who serve 6-year \nterms, two per State. Because they wanted a Chamber that would slow \nthings down and look at them carefully and weigh them.\n  But you cannot do that when you are changing the rules to ram things \nthrough. What you are going to get are radical lifetime appointments to \nthe bench such as what we are on the verge of doing tonight in the \nSenate and what you get are these damaging changes to the law on health \ncare which leave people with fewer choices, with more expenses and, \nhere is the kicker, with less access to the quality health care that is \nsecond to none in the United States.\n  We have the best health care providers in the world. When rich and \npowerful people around this planet get sick, do you know where they \ncome? They come to the United States. They come to our centers of \nexcellence. Other places around the world have quality places similar \nto that too, but they are only available to people who have money to \npay out of pocket. Their government-run insurance plans don't allow you \nto do that. They socialize you. They force you to wait in line behind \nother people until your turn is up. The only people who can go to the \nfront and get the highest quality health care in many places on Earth \nare the richest people in the world who can afford to pay for that out \nof their pocket. This law brings us a little closer to that because \nmany of these quality providers, the Sloan-Ketterings, the Mayo \nClinics, the MD Andersons, these extraordinarily high-quality health \ncare centers, many of these are not on the health care plans at all. In \norder to fit under ObamaCare, you have to cut people out of the plan so \nwe get closer to the day when the only people who can afford to go to \nthese centers are people who can afford to pay for it out of their \npocket and everybody else, people on ObamaCare, they are just going to \nget whatever the plan covers. That is what you are stuck with. That is \nwhat we are headed toward.\n  We are going to deny the American people access to the highest \nquality health care system in the history of the world, not the best \nhealth insurance marketplace--there are reforms that need to happen \nthere--but qualitywise, second to none. We are going to deny people \naccess to that.\n  The other reason, by the way, this whole debate on judges is very bad \nfor the country is it distracts us from the fundamental issue of our \ntime, the central issue that faces our people and our country. It is \none that I wish we spent more time focused on around here. I think both \nparties are a little guilty of not focusing on it enough.\n  When I was a child, when I was younger, I had all kinds of ideas \nabout what I wanted to be when I grew up. I was blessed with parents \nwho taught me that every single one of these dreams are within my \nreach. From my earliest memories, my parents instilled in me the belief \nthat even though my family was not rich or powerful or connected, I \ncould grow up to be anything I set my mind to because I was in \nAmerica. Because I am an American. My parents knew America was special \nbecause they knew what life was like outside of it.\n\n  My parents were born into a society that most people are born into--\nwhere the success you have in life is predetermined by the family you \nwere born into. By the grace of God, my parents were able to come \nhere--the one place on Earth where that isn't true--and the promise of \nAmerica changed their lives.\n\n[[Page S8649]]\n\n  My parents never made it big. My mother worked as a cashier, a hotel \nmaid, and even a stock clerk at Kmart. My dad was a bartender who \nprimarily worked at banquets. Through hard work and determination, my \nparents made it to the middle class, and they gave us, their children, \nthe opportunity to do all the things they were never able to do--to be \nanything we wanted to be. As I said, they were never rich, but my \nparents achieved the American dream.\n  That phrase, the ``American dream,'' is a phrase we use all the time, \nbut it is a phrase that is often misunderstood. The American dream has \nnever been about becoming wealthy or famous. Instead, it is about \npeople, like me, who were born and raised here. It is about things I \nsometimes think we take for granted.\n  The American dream, what is it about? It is about a happy and stable \nhome life where you can live without fear for your safety or the safety \nof your family. It is about the freedom to worship any way you want. It \nis about having the chance to get a good education and find a job that \nrewards hard work with financial security. The American dream is about \nbeing able to send your kids to college and being able to retire \ncomfortably. It is about the opportunity to pursue happiness without \nbeing limited by your social status or your background. Perhaps most of \nall, the American dream is about being able to give your kids the \nchance and the opportunities you never had. This is the true American \ndream. It is not just a phrase. It is our identity as a nation. It is \nwhat it means to be an American.\n  We are still a country where the American dream is possible. We are \nstill a place where, if you work hard and are determined, you can earn \na better life. But we have to be honest. Over the last 10 years it has \ngotten harder to achieve this. It has gotten harder to find a good job \nand get ahead financially. It has gotten harder to save for retirement \nand send your kids to college. It has gotten harder to pay for health \ncare, childcare, and the monthly payments on your student loan.\n  For the last 5 years we have been told that a bigger government that \ndoes more and spends more is the answer to this problem. Do you know \nwhat that has left us instead? It has left us with about $17 trillion \nin debt and millions of Americans chronically out of work. The result \nis that despite all of this news we get from time to time about how the \neconomy is getting better or the stock market is climbing, for many \npeople across this country there is a sense that recovery is not \nreaching them. That is creating true uncertainty and even fear about \nthe future. There is the constant worry that you could lose everything \nyou worked so hard for. There are doubts about whether you will ever \nmake enough and have a few extra dollars after payday or be able to \nsave for the future. Even for those who are enjoying the life they \nalways wanted, you find a growing sense that their children may not get \nthat same chance.\n  It is not surprising that some are starting to wonder whether the \ntime has come for us to lower our expectations. Maybe the time has come \nto downgrade the American dream. This doesn't have to be the new \nnormal. We have a choice. If we go in a new direction that gives us a \ngovernment that creates less debt, an economy that creates more stable \nmiddle-class jobs, an education system that trains our people for the \njobs available now and in the future, strong families who teach the \nvalues of success, and a financially healthy Social Security and \nMedicare system for retirees--if we are responsible enough to \ncourageously and boldly fight to do these things, we can save the \nAmerican dream. We can restore it. Actually, we can expand it to reach \nmore people than it has ever reached before.\n  Our first priority here should not be ramming through rules changes \nto get liberal judges appointed. Our first priority should be more \nstable middle-class jobs. That should be our first priority. Stable \nmiddle-class jobs are the cornerstone of the American dream.\n  Let me break it to everybody here in Washington: Politicians don't \ncreate jobs. Politicians don't create these stable middle-class jobs. \nThese stable middle-class jobs are created by everyday people when they \nstart a business or grow an existing one. That, my friends, is the \nreason the American free enterprise system is the single greatest \nengine of prosperity the world has ever known. The key to our success \nas a country has always been a thriving free enterprise system, not a \nthriving bigger government.\n  What we need from our government are policies that foster a free \nenterprise system, that provide opportunities for everyone who is \nwilling to work hard, and a government that stops spending money it \ndoesn't have. We have to bring our $17 trillion debt under control.\n  We need to address our broken Tax Code. We need one that creates more \ntaxpayers, not more taxes. The current one we have is a major obstacle \nto the American dream. Why? Because our current Tax Code is expensive \nand complicated. Our current Tax Code is rigged. It is rigged to help \nthose who are politically connected. It is rigged to help them at the \nexpense of everybody else.\n  We need to reform the runaway regulations we have. They are \ndestroying job creation. By the way, they too favor the well connected. \nThey too favor the people who can afford to hire lobbyists to help \nwrite these rules and lawyers to help write the loopholes.\n  We need government policies that remove unreasonable restrictions on \nenergy exploration here in this country so we can be freed from our \ndependence on foreign oil and create more jobs in the energy sector but \nalso in manufacturing.\n  As I mentioned earlier, we need to get the cost of health care under \ncontrol but not through the big-government solutions, such as \nObamaCare, that were rammed down the throat of the American people but \nby encouraging the development of an individual health insurance market \nthat gives people more choices, not more mandates.\n\n  The middle-class jobs of today and in the future will require more \neducation and skills than ever before. That is why one of the most \nimportant investments of our time and our resources that we can make--\ninstead of wasting time on all of these distractions on changing the \nSenate rules to force through radical judges like the one being \nproposed here tonight--is in a quality and affordable education system \nthat gives our people the unique skills they will need to succeed in a \nnew global economy. To do that we need to take the power out of the \nhands of Washington, DC, and give it to the State and local school \nboards so they can undertake innovative reforms.\n  We need to pursue policies that expand access and interest in \nscience, technology, engineering, and math because that is what the \njobs of the future are going to be based on.\n  As mentioned a moment ago, we need to get the cost of college under \ncontrol. I know. I graduated with over $100,000 in student loans. We \nneed to give working Americans trapped in low-paying jobs access to \ncollege or a career education that is affordable and flexible so it \nmeets within their busy lives. If you are a working parent--\nparticularly a single parent who is working--you can't just quit your \njob and move to the nearest college town to go to school for 4 years. \nWe have to create programs. We have to reform our existing programs so \nthey are accessible and affordable for people who are in this position. \nIt will give a receptionist at a law firm the ability to become a \nparalegal. It will give a mail clerk at a medical office the ability to \nbecome an ultrasound technician. We have to meet this issue. There is \nan extraordinary need.\n  By the way, we have to give all of our students more access to career \nand vocational education. You can still make a good middle-class living \nas an airplane mechanic or as an electrician. Why have we stigmatized \nthese? Why have we told children in this country that if they go into \nthese fields, they are not successful? These are good, stable, and \nnecessary middle-class jobs. You know what happens when a kid wants to \nwork with their hands but they are not learning it in high school. They \ndrop out. We have to address that--not just at the Federal level but \nacross the country.\n  In addition to a good education, the American dream was built on a \nset of\n\n[[Page S8650]]\n\nfundamental values such as hard work, discipline, honesty, and self-\ncontrol. Teaching these values is the responsibility of our families. \nGovernment can't impose these values, and, quite frankly, it can't \nteach them. Government policies should encourage and reward them.\n  I think we should empower parents by giving them the ability to send \ntheir kids to any school they choose. There is no reason why a parent \nshould not be able to put their kids in the best possible educational \nsetting just because they are poor. There is no reason why we should \nforce people to send their kids to failing schools just because that \nhappens to be the school right down the street. That is not fair. If \nyou are rich, you can send your kids to any school you want. You know \nwhat. They do. Do you know who can't do that? The people who can't \nafford to pay for that. That is wrong, and we should change it.\n  We should strengthen our charities and our churches, which make an \nextraordinary contribution in helping the less fortunate and \nreinforcing values that are so important to success. We should \nreinforce them by making important changes to our Tax Code that will \nencourage and reward Americans for donating more.\n  We need to have safety net programs. The free enterprise system \ndoesn't work without a solid safety net. It needs to be a safety net \nthat helps people who cannot help themselves or to help people who have \nfallen to get back up and try again. We don't need a safety net that is \na way of life.\n  We need to reform our existing safety net programs--welfare, \nunemployment insurance, disability, and Medicaid. They should all be \nreformed so that in addition to providing for those who are in need, \nthese programs should also be promoting work and education and self-\nreliance.\n  Last but not least, I think the American dream means the ability to \nretire with stability and security. That is why having a financially \nhealthy Social Security and Medicare system is so important. We can \nbicker around here all we want about how many votes it takes to get a \njudge in or who is obstructing what. Here is a fundamental fact: Social \nSecurity is going to run out of money in 20 years, which happens to be \nright around the time I will be getting close to being eligible for it. \nMedicare is going to run out of money in as few as 8 years.\n  The good news is that if we act and start to take steps to address \nthat now, we can fix these programs, and we can fix them without \ndisrupting the lives of people who are on those programs now--like my \nmother. I would never support any changes to these programs that would \nhurt people like my mother, who is on Social Security and Medicare. We \ncan fix it, but to fix it, people like me--decades from retirement--are \ngoing to have to accept that while our Medicare and Social Security \nwill be the best in the world, it is going to be different than it was \nfor our parents, but it is going to exist.\n  By the way, beyond this, we should do some other things. We should \nmake it easier, through changes in our taxes, for people to work beyond \ntheir retirement years. We should expand access to tax-advantage \nsavings accounts for those who don't have access to a 401(k). We should \nincentivize people to save for their retirement.\n  I think what has bothered me the most in the 3 years I have been here \nis the lack of urgency about any of this. People talk about it. They \npropose laws called good things that maybe they polled and it sounded \ngood. But in terms of moving on any of these things I just talked \nabout, there is not a lot of urgency about it. We need to have more \nurgency about it. We need to stop wasting time around here changing the \nrules of the Senate to get a couple more of the President's radical \nappointments to the bench confirmed and spend a little bit more time \nfiguring this out.\n  For most of the history of the world, almost everyone who was born \nwas poor, without power, and without wealth. That only belonged to a \nselect few. For most of the history of the world, your future was \ndetermined by your past. If your parents were poor, you would be poor \ntoo. If a person was born without opportunities, so were their \nchildren. What makes our country special is that hasn't been true here. \nWhat makes America special is we are a people not united by a common \nrace or a common ethnicity; we are a people united by a common value: \nThe idea that everyone has the God-given right to achieve a better life \nwithout being held back by the government or by one's social standing.\n\n  Right now, I work here. Washington is broken. It was broken when I \ngot here and it still is. It is a process that is unable to function. \nWith all due respect, it is a process that is plagued with people--in \nboth parties, by the way--who are more interested in being someone than \nin doing something. I am telling my colleagues that if we continue on \nthis road we are on right now, if we continue on the road we have \nplaced this country on, we are going to lose the things that make \nAmerica special. That is what we should be focused on, because there is \nanother direction we can take. If we can find the political courage to \nboldly and responsibly confront and solve the challenges before us, we \ncan restore the American dream. Actually, we can expand it to reach \nmore people than it ever has before.\n  Every generation of Americans before us has had to do this. Every \ngeneration before us has been asked to do something to keep America \nspecial. Each has been asked to make sacrifices and take bold steps to \npreserve what makes us exceptional, and now it is our turn.\n  I remember a few years ago, there was a moment that reminded me of \nwhat is truly at stake here. I have shared this story many times. I was \nabout to give a speech in a hotel ballroom. I think it was in New York \nCity. There was a bartender there who had heard me speak before about \nmy father, who was also a bartender, and he approached me with a gift. \nThe gift he gave me was a name tag that said ``Rubio, banquet \nbartender,'' a name tag the same as they give in hotels. At that \nmoment, I was reminded of how this country literally changed my \nfamily's very life. Not so long ago, it was my father who stood behind \na bar, just like the one that gentleman stood behind, in order to give \nme the chance to earn a better life, and America made that possible. It \nwas never easy. Both of my parents worked well into their retirement \nyears.\n  I remember when I was in high school, well past midnight, on many \nnights, I would hear my father's keys jingling at the door as he came \nhome from another long day of work. When we are young, the meaning of \nmoments such as that escapes us. But now, as I get older and my \nchildren get older, I think I understand that moment a little bit \nbetter. Like the man who gave me that name tag that night in New York, \nmy father was coming back from more than just another day at work; he \nwas coming back from a day of fighting, so that the doors that had \nclosed for him would be open for me.\n  This is still one of the few places on Earth where a person can do \nthat. That is what makes us special.\n  Before us is the question of whether this generation of leadership is \nup to the task of keeping this country that way. I don't personally \nhave any doubt that we are up to the task. Despite our many \ndifferences, I believe our people are much more united than our \npolitics would lead one to believe.\n  Every single one of us, every single American is the descendant of a \ngo-getter, of an immigrant or of a slave or of someone who overcame \nextraordinary odds to stake their claim in this American dream. Every \nsingle one of us comes from someone who refused to accept the life they \nlived and always desired to have something better for themselves and \nfor their families. Every single one of us is a descendant of someone \nwho insisted that their future must always be better than their past.\n  This is who we are as a people. This is who we come from. I believe \nthat is still who we are. All we need now are leaders that reflect that \nin their policies and in their priorities.\n  So I still have more faith in this country than perhaps the political \ncoverage might lead us to have because we are free people, and we are \nalways going to vigorously debate the best way forward. Sometimes, \nbecause of the nature of our Republic, it takes us a little longer to \nget it right, but we always have. I believe we will again. In the end, \nthere is no such thing as the Republican dream or the Democrat\n\n[[Page S8651]]\n\ndream, there is only an American dream. Despite all the challenges this \ncountry faces and despite some of the skirmishes on the floor of the \nSenate--at times unnecessary, such as this debate with the judges and \nthe rule change--despite all of that, I know for a fundamental fact \nthat the American people are not willing or prepared to give up on this \nAmerican dream.\n  That requires us to act. That requires us to stop wasting time around \nhere and to focus on the issues. We have this golden opportunity to \nrestore this American dream and to bring it within reach of more people \nthan ever before. We have an opportunity before us to claim our \nheritage as a people who always leave behind a Nation better than the \none that was left for them. We have a chance to usher in a new American \ncentury and to write the latest chapter in the story of the single \ngreatest Nation that man has ever known. So I hope as we conclude these \ndebates on issues such as this, we will somehow find a way to begin to \nwork together on what really matters, on matters of importance, on what \nimpacts Americans now and those yet to come.\n  That leads me to one final point. I see my colleague from Wisconsin \nis on the floor, as well as others who wish to speak. I will close with \none more point, one more issue I think we are being distracted from \nbecause of the silliness of breaking the rules to change the rules so \nwe can impose on the American people out-of-the-mainstream judges and \ncabinet appointments that are less than qualified, and that is the \nissue of American leadership in the world. Look around the world today. \nLook at the impact of uncertainty about our foreign policy and what \neffect it is having across the planet.\n  I am going to be honest and straightforward about this issue \nespecially: This is an issue for both parties to reflect on for a \nmoment. We all understand why we are wary--and we should be--of \ninternational engagement. We have gone through a decade of two \nconflicts in the Middle East. We turn on the television and we see \npeople we have spent money and sacrificed lives on behalf of burning \nour flag and celebrating our tragedies, and we wonder, Why are we \ninvolved in the world. Why are we engaged in these places? But I hope \neverybody understands that in the absence of American leadership a \nvacuum is created, and that vacuum leads to chaos, and chaos ultimately \nimpacts our national security and our economic well-being.\n\n  Take a brief tour around the world with me for a moment and my \ncolleagues will see what I am talking about. Turn on the news and see \nwhat is happening in Ukraine where a country is being increasingly \nintimidated into going back into basically what looks like an effort to \nreconstitute the former Soviet Union, being torn between that and \nchoosing modernization in the West with the European Union. There are \npeople in the streets protesting against that and riot police going in \nthere to force them out.\n  Look at the Middle East, where Iran proceeds full speed ahead with \nweaponizing, towards creating a nuclear weapon and the impact that \nwould have--and not just on arming the one country in the world that \nmost uses terrorism as a tool of statecraft. We had testimony today \nfrom the administration. No country in the world uses terrorism more \nthan Iran does, and they are going to get a nuclear weapon. It won't \njust be Iran getting a nuclear weapon. If Iran gets a weapon, so will \nSaudi Arabia and potentially Turkey. Look at what is happening in Asia. \nThe Chinese have announced that a certain area belongs to them and \ntheir airspace, that others have to get permission from them and notify \nthem before anyone flies through there. South Korea and Japan and \nothers, they are starting to wonder whether America will live up to its \ncommitments to provide for their defense and to assist them or maybe \nthey need to strike out on their own and provide their own defense \ncapabilities.\n  Look at the opportunities in the Western Hemisphere we have abandoned \nbecause we have taken our focus elsewhere. I could go on and on.\n  Are we a strong enough voice on behalf of religious liberties? \nMeanwhile, religious minorities around the world are being oppressed in \nunprecedented ways. In particular, Christians in the Middle East are \nfacing persecution that is reminiscent of the early days of the church.\n  How about human rights? How about human trafficking and modern day \nslavery? All of these things require American leadership.\n  We can't solve every problem. Foreign aid isn't charity. It needs to \nfurther our national interests and the funds need to be accountably \nspent. But this is something we should be more focused on and we are \nnot. Why? Because we continue to get involved in these sorts of \nskirmishes here and, in particular, undermining the ability of this \nbody to function by changing the rules by breaking them.\n  So I hope this will serve as an opportunity to reevaluate all of \nthis, because the challenges before our country are real and the \nconsequences of not acting appropriately are dramatic. I hope we will \ntake this seriously, because we still have time to get this right, but \nwe do not have forever.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, this is the 52nd consecutive week we \nare in session that I have come to the floor to ask us to please, for \nLord's sake, wake up to the damage carbon pollution is already doing to \nour atmosphere, oceans, and climate, and to look ahead, to use our God-\ngiven sense, and to plan for what is so obviously coming.\n  In those weeks, I have spoken about all different aspects of carbon \npollution, its effect on sports and our economy; its effect on oceans \nand coasts; its effect on agriculture and wildfires; its effect on \nstorms and insurance costs. I have spoken about the measurements we can \nalready make of the harm already happening: Sea level rise, which we \nmeasure with a yardstick, basically; ocean temperature, which we \nmeasure with a thermometer; and ocean acidification--the fastest in 50 \nmillion years, according to research published in ``Nature \nGeoscience''--which we can measure with litmus tests.\n  I have, I hope, to anyone listening with their logic turned on, \nthoroughly rebutted the deniers' phony arguments against solving carbon \npollution, whether those arguments purport to be based in science or \nreligion or economics or our competitiveness.\n  I have listed the thoughtful and responsible groups--from the Joint \nChiefs of Staff to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, from \nWalmart to NASA, from Ford and GM to Coke and Pepsi, from America's \ngarden clubs to just last month our major sports leagues--who \nunderstand the truth about climate change and are saying so.\n  I have done my best to expose the calculated campaign of lies that we \nare up against and the vast scandalous apparatus of phony organizations \nand engineered messages that are designed to propagate those lies. I \nhave traced the connections back to, of course, the big carbon \npolluters and their billionaire owners. I have been obliged to point \nout that the money of those big polluters and billionaires floods this \nChamber, that their lobbyists prowl the outer halls, and that to a sad \nand disappointing degree this Congress is bought and paid for by that \npolluter influence.\n  One factor we have yet to consider is whether as an institution \nCongress has just become completely irresponsible. Maybe this Congress \njust cannot operate as an institution at an intelligent level. Some \nCongresses are going to be smarter and more responsible than others. \nThat is just the natural order of variation. Some Congress is going to \nbe the sorriest Congress ever. Maybe we are it.\n  Some organizations, like NASA, for instance, are very smart. That is \nwhy NASA is driving a rover around on the surface of Mars right now. \nThat is a seriously smart organization.\n  Some organizations take ordinary people and call them to be their \nvery best, to play at a level above their natural talents, to heed a \nhigher calling than their selfish inclinations. At their best, our \nmilitary and our churches tend to achieve that.\n\n[[Page S8652]]\n\n  Some organizations, however, take even the most talented people and \ndrag them down to the lowest common denominator, and stifle the best \nand bring out the worst in even those very talented people.\n  I ask people watching, which type of organization do you think \nCongress is right now? Which type do you think we are? As an \norganization, it is hard to say anything kinder of Congress than that \nit is now a really irresponsible organization. We could not even keep \nthe U.S. Government running. Standard & Poor's estimated that our tea \nparty shutdown foolishness cost Americans tens of billions of dollars \nfor no gain--none. We cannot sort out the basics of building and \nmaintaining our American infrastructure. Our own American Society of \nCivil Engineers gives our country a D-plus for infrastructure.\n  That is not complicated stuff. Yet we flub it like a football team \nthat fumbles the ball at the snap.\n  Get a little more complicated and Congress seems to get even worse.\n  Let me show you just one health care chart. This chart I have in the \nChamber shows the average life expectancy--in years--in a country \ncompared to the cost per capita of health care in that country. \nTogether, they make a pretty good proxy for how a country's health care \nsystem is doing. This group shown here on the chart represents most of \nthe OECD member and partner countries--our industrialized international \ncompetitors.\n  This, shown here on the chart, is us--way out here, all alone, \nspending the most by far for results that are mediocre at best. We \nwould save nearly $1 trillion a year if we could just get our per \ncapita cost down to what Norway and Switzerland spend. They are the \nnext two most expensive countries on the planet, and we are $1 trillion \na year more laid out per capita. Think of what we could do as a nation, \nwhat we could build and invent with $1 trillion a year if we were not \nwasting it on bad health care. And bad it is. We get worse results in \nlongevity than virtually any modern economy.\n  Look who beats us: Japan, Great Britain, Switzerland, Netherlands, \nNorway. Germany does, Italy does, Greece does, Luxembourg does. They \nall beat us. Chile and the Czech Republic are the two countries we beat \nfor longevity.\n  Look at the size of that problem--those lives lost, those trillions \nof dollars wasted--and then look at the quality of the health care \ndiscussion we are having in Congress, and tell me this is not a \ncompletely irresponsible organization.\n  That brings us to climate change. Yes, it is complicated, when you \nare trying to predict and model something as complex as what our \nclimate is going to do in the years ahead. But it is also simple, when \nyou look at the stuff that everyone agrees on, the stuff that you can \nmeasure, the stuff that you would have to be a nut or a crank or an \neccentric to dispute.\n  Nobody responsible--nobody responsible--disputes the principle that \nadding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere raises the temperature of the \nEarth, and that it does so through the so-called greenhouse effect. A \nscientist named John Tyndall figured that out at the time of the \nAmerican Civil War. I brought his musty old paper in here several \nspeeches ago. Its old leather binding was flaking and peeling. When \nthat report was first published, Abraham Lincoln had just been elected \nPresident. In all the years since then, this principle of science has \nalways been confirmed and validated. It is not some questionable \ntheory. The greenhouse effect is real. It would not just be wrong, it \nwould be irresponsible to deny that.\n  Nobody responsible disputes that for over a century our modern \neconomy has run on fossil fuels and that burning those fossil fuels has \nreleased gigatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The Global \nCarbon Project estimates that mankind has pumped about 2,000 gigatons \nof carbon dioxide into the atmosphere since 1870. That is a pretty \nsolid estimate, and I have never even heard anyone dispute it.\n  So we know those two things: adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere \ntraps more heat; and we have released an estimated 2,000 gigatons--\n2,000 billion tons--of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n  Let's go on from there. It is a known principle of science that a \nsignificant portion of that multigigaton carbon load is absorbed by the \noceans, and that the chemical reaction when that absorption happens \ninto the oceans makes the oceans more acidic. No responsible person \ndisputes either proposition. It is not some theory. It is something \nthat you can actually do and measure in a lab. Again, it would not just \nbe wrong, it would be really irresponsible to deny that.\n  We also know that the oceans do more than absorb carbon. They absorb \nheat. Indeed, they have absorbed most of the excess heat trapped by \ngreenhouse gases--over 90 percent of the heat between 1971 and 2010, \naccording to the recent IPCC report. What happens when the oceans \nabsorb heat? They expand. Thermal expansion is a basic \nphysical property of liquids. It can also be shown in a very simple \nlab. It is not a theory. Again, it would be not just wrong but \nirresponsible to deny that too.\n\n  It would not just be wrong, it would be irresponsible to deny what \nthose simple measurements and clear principles tell us. But we do. We \ndo. We deny it. Congress will not wake up and address this problem. \nLike those monkeys: See no carbon, hear no carbon, speak no carbon.\n  Because we are so irresponsible, because we deny this reality, we are \nfailing to take precautions and, as a result, many people will suffer.\n  For those of us who love this country and are proud of it, and are \nproud of our government, and want this country and its government to be \na beacon of hope and promise and rectitude, it hurts a little extra for \nthe Congress to be such a failure. It hurts a little extra that we in \nour generation have driven Congress--the hub of our noble American \nexperiment in democracy, the beating heart of this great Republic--down \nto that low level.\n  It is a harsh judgment that this body is an irresponsible failure. \nBut on climate this Congress got it the old-fashioned way; it earned \nit.\n  I will close with a final observation. Compare the irresponsibility \nof this ``see no carbon, hear no carbon, speak no carbon'' Congress \nwith the recent exhortation from Pope Francis. Here is what the Pope \nsaid. I will quote him at some length.\n\n       There are other weak and defenceless beings who are \n     frequently at the mercy of economic interests or \n     indiscriminate exploitation. I am speaking of creation as a \n     whole. We human beings are not only the beneficiaries but \n     also the stewards of other creatures. Thanks to our bodies, \n     God has joined us so closely to the world around us that we \n     can feel the desertification of the soil almost as a physical \n     ailment, and the extinction of a species as a painful \n     disfigurement. Let us not leave in our wake a swath of \n     destruction and death which will affect our own lives and \n     those of future generations.\n\n  The Pope continued:\n\n       Here I would make my own the touching and prophetic lament \n     voiced some years ago by the bishops of the Philippines:\n\n  And he quotes them:\n\n       ``An incredible variety of insects lived in the forest and \n     were busy with all kinds of tasks. . . . Birds flew through \n     the air, their bright plumes and varying calls adding color \n     and song to the green of the forests. . . . God intended this \n     land for us, his special creatures, but not so that we might \n     destroy it and turn it into a wasteland. . . . After a single \n     night's rain, look at the chocolate brown rivers in your \n     locality and remember that they are carrying the life blood \n     of the land into the sea. . . . How can fish swim in sewers \n     like the . . . rivers which we have polluted? Who has turned \n     the wonderworld of the seas into underwater cemeteries bereft \n     of color and life?''\n       Small yet strong in the love of God, like Saint Francis of \n     Assisi, all of us, as Christians, are called to watch over \n     and protect the fragile world in which we live, and all its \n     peoples.\n\n  What is our answer to the Pope, to this great Christian leader? In \nCongress, it is the monkey answer: Hear no carbon, see no carbon, speak \nno carbon.\n  We still have time to mitigate the worst effects of climate change.\n  We can actually do it in painless ways. We can even do it in \nadvantageous ways, in ways that will boost our economy, but we have to \ndo it. We have to wake up. We simply have to wake up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Mr. President, I rise to address the \nnomination of Cornelia Pillard to the DC Circuit. This nomination is a \ngood example of the government overreach that has led to the ObamaCare \ndebacle.\n\n[[Page S8653]]\n\n  The good Senator from Rhode Island was talking about how much we \nspend on health care in this Nation. The very unfortunate fact is the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act does not address that cost.\n  Let's face it. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is \nabout as Orwellian a name as you could possibly come up with for a \npiece of legislation. We are watching millions of Americans lose their \nhealth care coverage. Those patients are not being protected by the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act. We certainly are not \nwatching the cost of health care decline.\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act did not bend the cost \ncurve down. It has dramatically increased or bent the cost curve up. Of \ncourse, anybody who even has the slightest knowledge of basic economics \nrealizes that if you mandate expensive coverages on any insurance \npolicy, the price is not going to go down, the price is going to go up. \nWe are witnessing that.\n  We are certainly witnessing that in my home State of Wisconsin, where \na young man aged 27, on average, is seeing his premium increase by 124 \npercent, going from a little over $1,100 per year, to closer to $2,500 \nper year. A young woman of that same age, 27, is seeing her premium \nincrease by 78 percent, going from about $1,400 per year to about \n$2,500 per year. That is not bending the cost curve down.\n  That is not even talking about the added or the increased cost of \ntheir deductibles, the increases in their maximum out-of-pocket amounts \nthey are going to be spending every year. So again the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act does nothing that it promises. It is \na disaster for our health care system. It is a disaster for our Federal \nbudget. It is a disaster for people and their health and their lives.\n  I am on the floor of the Senate tonight, normally not down here at \nthis time. Normally, I would be sitting at home doing a little bit of \nhomework. So I guess what I would like to do is spend a few minutes \ndoing what I would be doing at home, reading letters from constituents \nfrom Wisconsin.\n  When I introduced my piece of legislation, trying to protect as many \nAmericans as possible from the damage of the health care law, trying to \nhonor the promise President Obama and Members of this Chamber made \nrepeatedly to the American public that if you liked your health care \nplan, you could keep it, I told a story about a couple in Wisconsin who \ncontacted our office. Initially, this couple wanted to be identified. \nThey wanted their story told. By the time I had gotten ahold of them on \nthe phone, to make sure they were actually getting some help in \nsecuring some health care, the husband had second thoughts. He watched \nhis government. He watched the Internal Revenue Service being used as a \npolitical weapon. So he feared for his privacy. He feared for his \neconomic security. So he asked me: Please do not use my name. Tell my \nstory, just don't use my name.\n  That is a pretty sad fact. That is something we need to ponder. It is \nsomething we need to address. But that couple, their story is pretty \nsimple and pretty sad. His wife was suffering from stage IV lung \ncancer. He was recovering from prostate cancer. They were participating \nin the high-risk pool in the State of Wisconsin, a risk-sharing pool \nthat worked.\n  It was expensive for them, but it was something they could afford. I \nknew it worked because in my 31 years of business, as I provided health \ncare for the people who worked with me, every now and again, \nunfortunately, one of the people who worked for me would have a serious \nhealth condition. When we would go to renew our policy, frequently \nthose individuals, if the condition was bad enough, would be lasered \nout. They would lose coverage under our plan. But that was OK because \nthe State of Wisconsin, very responsibly, made a provision for those \nindividuals, the high-risk sharing pool.\n  So what would end up happening is because they were denied coverage, \nthey automatically qualified for the high-risk pool. I, of course, \nwould pay for that coverage in the same way we would pay for coverage \nthrough our own health plan. What I found over the years, because this \nhappened a number of times, is the coverage was very comparable. It was \nnot a Cadillac plan but solid insurance coverage. So similar coverage \nand very comparable price.\n  It was a plan that worked. It was a plan that covered those \nindividuals with high risks. It was a plan that covered 22,000 \nWisconsinites until this body, this Congress, passed the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act, which I describe here as neither of \nthose two things.\n  As a result of the passage of that bill, those high-risk pools are \nnow obsolete. So this couple got the letter saying they would lose \ncoverage as of January 1. Put yourself in the position of people \nsuffering from cancer or recovering from it. You have a lot of worries \nin life. You do not need the additional worry of losing your health \ncare plan. But that is what this couple faced, as millions of Americans \nare facing the exact same worry, the exact same harm, the exact same \ndamage. It is unconscionable.\n\n  They obviously went onto healthcare.gov, almost 40 times when I \ntalked to them. They were never able to successfully log onto it at \nthat point in time. So we helped this couple get in touch with the \ninsurance carriers that would be operating within the exchange. They \nstarted getting quotes. They quickly learned their premiums were going \nto double. Their out-of-pocket maximums were also going to come close \nto doubling as well. So the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \ndid not protect these two individuals, and it certainly did not offer \nthem affordable care.\n  As I went through letters from our constituents, we did make a few \nphone calls, knowing I was going to come down here, and asked if \nanybody would want to be identified. A few brave souls agreed to be \nidentified. I will read their names as I read their letters. The first \nWisconsinite, Michael Wagner, writes:\n\n       I am self-employed and have a family of four. The President \n     said we could keep our plan if we liked it and our doctors. \n     Not true. We are being pushed off our plan for the exchange. \n     He said the average family of four would save an average of \n     $2,500. Not true. I think he just makes numbers up. My \n     equivalent policy on the exchange will cost $7,500 more per \n     year. That is almost a 100 percent increase.\n       He said we can keep our doctors. Not true. Our current \n     company and PPO network is not offered on the exchange. The \n     list goes on and on. The bottom line is that this needs to be \n     stopped. If it is not, the American people will stand up and \n     the landscape of Senators will be unrecognizable after the \n     next midterm election. Thank you for your time, and I hope \n     you have the gall to stand up for your constituents.\n\n  Mr. Wagner, I definitely have the gall to stand up for my \nconstituents. The reason I ran for the Senate was not because I wanted \nto be a Senator. The primary reason I ran for the Senate was to be the \nvote to repeal this monstrosity, to be the vote to protect Americans \nfrom the damage I full well knew this law would inflict on millions of \nour fellow citizens.\n  The next constituent who wrote to me, Darren Schauf, wrote:\n\n       We are a small manufacturer in Sparta, Wisconsin, who has \n     been in operation since the mid 1960s. We currently employ 24 \n     people and are a family-owned business, fabricating large \n     fiberglass statues and water slides that are shipped all over \n     the U.S. and Canada. We have been providing our employees \n     health insurance for 15 years, paying for 100 percent of the \n     premium.\n\n  Pretty responsible employer. Those are the types of businesspeople I \nknow. Those are the types of businesspeople who are very concerned \nabout the people who work with them. Those are the types of \nbusinesspeople who this President demonizes in his class warfare. Let \nme go on:\n\n       We have experienced the increases in health care cost over \n     the years and weathered them fine. I received our renewal \n     this week for next year. Because of the Affordable Care Act, \n     our premium went from $3,887.77 per month to $7,103 per \n     month. How does this happen? What definition of \n     ``affordable'' is being used to describe this effect? We will \n     not be able to pay 100 percent of our employee's premium at \n     this rate. How can we get a plan that is at least close to \n     the cost that we were paying last year?\n\n  Mr. Schauf, I know how you can get a plan close to what you were \nbuying last year. If this body would take up my bill, If You Like Your \nHealth Plan, You Can Keep It Act, that is a true grandfather clause \nthat actually would honor that promise for millions of Americans. We \ncannot save the policies that have already been lost. We cannot repair \nall the damage already done by this health care law. But we can still \nhelp millions of Americans if we act, if we are responsible, if we \ncare.\n\n[[Page S8654]]\n\n  The next two constituents to write me are Brad and Dawn Nielsen. They \nwrite:\n\n       My wife and I just received a notice that our monthly \n     health care insurance cost will increase by 184 percent, \n     increase by $1,330 per month starting in January 2015, and \n     you need to understand how cheated we feel with this and what \n     you have done.\n\n  I am assuming he is referring to President Obama and Democratic \nSenators and Democratic Members of the House who voted for this \nmonstrosity. Again, I ran to be the vote to repeal this law.\n\n       We are both retired and have been paying our health care \n     insurance for the past 3 years. We have what would be \n     considered a good policy that falls in line with what would \n     be considered a gold package as it relates to the ACA \n     guidelines. We will be able to keep this policy with our \n     insurance carrier through 2014 with a 7\\1/2\\ percent increase \n     in the monthly premium that is to cover the new--\n\n  He puts in quotes--\n\n     ``the Affordable Care Act'' cost. Although we were not happy \n     about the increase, we were told by our carrier that the \n     monthly premiums will increase to $2,054.51 per month \n     starting January 2015. This is not right. You as our \n     representative need to understand what you have allowed to \n     happen to us as well as others.\n\n  Again, Mr. and Mrs. Nielsen, I wish--I wish we would have prevented \nthis.\n  I wish the Members of this body would hear your plea and do something \nto protect you, as the bill claims to do, to repair the damage.\n\n       We have worked hard, made sacrifices to be able to retire, \n     saved through our company's retirement plan, invested when we \n     could and even put both our kids through college. Now to be \n     forced to pay an outrageous amount for something we have had \n     for the last 3 years isn't right. This increase is a game \n     changer for us and will dramatically affect our standard of \n     living moving forward.\n       It is important that you understand what is happening and \n     the need to change this unfair law.\n\n  I hope the President, I hope Members are listening.\n  The next constituent, Jeff Cubinski, writes:\n\n       I am sending you this email about the 2014 ACA. I just \n     received my letter from Humana stating my insurance is going \n     to increase nearly 300% from $550/month to $1559/month. I \n     cannot afford this--how is this Affordable Care? I have \n     carried insurance all my life being self-employed--what is \n     this plan trying to put the self-employed out of business???? \n     I want to keep my plan the way it is--why are we being forced \n     to change to a plan that has benefits we DON'T need?? Please \n     help us citizens that have been carrying health care. Please \n     make Government for the people by the people again!\n\n  I wish to quickly answer that question. Why is this individual being \nforced to change to a plan that has benefits that he doesn't need? It \nis because there are people in Washington, in this alternate universe, \nwho believe they are so smart, so clever, they know what is best for \nevery American. They are so compassionate. They are trying to help.\n  They are not helping much. This law is not helping much. It is doing \nreal harm.\n  President Obama and Senate, Members of the House, please listen to \nthese constituent letters. Have a change of heart. Work with us to \nlimit the damage before it gets greater.\n  Those were the individuals we contacted who were willing to be \nidentified. The rest of the individuals were either not contacted in \ntime or decided, as the couple, that they had seen their government be \nused as a weapon against other citizens and decided to remain \nanonymous.\n  The next Wisconsinite writes:\n\n       I am writing you to inform you that as of January 1st 2014 \n     my family of six and I will no longer have health care. This \n     will be the first time in my life or the life of my children \n     that we will be in this position. The reason for this is the \n     Affordable Health Care Act, laughable name. On that day my \n     premiums through work will go from $250/month to well over \n     $1000/month. In looking through the Market place, my family's \n     premium would also be well in excess of $1000/month.\n       We are a typical middle class family, my wife and I both \n     work full time, our combined income is in the $75,000 range. \n     We are home owners with a mortgage, we drive 8 to 9 year old \n     cars, our children go to public schools, we do not live an \n     extravagant life style.\n       I have been struggling to figure what to cut to be able to \n     afford this new health care system the government stuck us \n     in. No matter what we cut it will not add up to $1000. The \n     other option is to put our house on the market and try to \n     find something else outside of Madison. That is not what we \n     want to do. Our kids are in high school, one with special \n     needs and we feel that would be unfair to them.\n\n  So do I.\n  Continuing:\n\n       Mr Johnson please explain to me how on earth is this \n     affordable and fair.\n\n  I can't. It is not affordable; it is not fair; it is utterly unfair. \nIt is utterly unnecessary, but it is a fact. It is one I hope everyone \nwho supported this bill can live with. I hope it is a fact that \neveryone who voted in support for this bill thinks about and is held \nfully accountable.\n  Continuing:\n\n       I find this Affordable Care Act to be divisive, unfair and \n     an unjust tax on the middle class.\n       I will not vote for anyone that supported this Act or \n     continues to support this Act given the effect that it is \n     having on my family. Sir, I am begging for your help. Please \n     find a way to help my family and the rest of the Americans \n     like us.\n\n  Did we hear that, an American citizen begging for help from the harm \nthat the Affordable Care Act, the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act, inflicted on his family. He is begging this Congress, this \nchamber, this President, for help. Please hear him.\n  Another constituent writes:\n\n       I'm feeling very upset and stressed over the new health \n     care laws. I feel they are unfair and hurting working \n     families. Our household income has shrunk and our health care \n     cost is going up over $300 a month. According to \n     healthcare.gov if insurance costs more than 9.5% of gross \n     income it is considered unaffordable. When a single person \n     applies only his/her income is taken into consideration. When \n     a family applies total household income is used to figure \n     out affordability of single-only coverage. Single only \n     coverage for myself is about 8% of our family income; \n     single only coverage for my husband is about the same. \n     That means 16% of our income would be used for insurance \n     (throughout employers) just for us. 16% of our income \n     would be gone and our 4 children would be uninsured. \n     Family coverage costs 12% of our family income still \n     higher than 9.5%. Where is our tax credit? We don't \n     qualify for tax credits because we have ``affordable \n     insurance through our employers.'' If total household \n     income is used why isn't family coverage affordability \n     taken into consideration. Last year my family made about \n     $55,000 (174% of the poverty level.) Next year we will \n     make less due to reduced hours. Money is already tight, \n     this new law will make things very uncomfortable for my \n     family. I am turning to my representatives for help. \n     Please help families in the same situation to the best of \n     your ability; we need your help! This law is hurting us; \n     be our voice.\n\n  Another Wisconsinite writes:\n\n       I just called Physician's Plus to find out about the status \n     of our Health Insurance policy. Our policy will not be \n     renewed due to the Affordable Care Act.\n\n  It seems these constituents decided to drop the patient protection \nbecause he obviously wasn't feeling particularly protected.\n  Continuing:\n\n       My husband and I are freelancers in the video production \n     field. My husband works so hard to support and take care of \n     me and our two children. We are not rich, by any means, just \n     taking care of business. We have paid 100% of our premiums \n     for 15 years. We have bought coverage that makes sense for \n     our family at different times. Currently, we pay $513.60/\n     month with a $3000 deductible. When I called Physician's Plus \n     yesterday, the person there said that my plan cannot be \n     renewed. He said the new premium for a comparable plan will \n     be $1743.00!!!\n\n  Again, that compares to $513 and it will be $1,743.\n  Continuing:\n\n       We cannot afford this in any way. I guess we are the \n     collateral damage?\n       I have tried to get on the ACA to find out our options. I \n     refuse to give them personal information so I can only go by \n     the Kaiser Foundation estimate. There is only one plan that \n     will keep our Pediatrician and it looks like we will be \n     looking at a $12,000 deductible with close to a $1000/month \n     premium. We are on the high end, so get a very minimal \n     subsidy. We do not want to get any help from the government, \n     we want to be independent, but the government is forcing \n     their hand on us!\n\n  Again, we live in the land of the free, the home of the brave, and \nyet these brave Wisconsinites are being forced. They are being coerced. \nThis is the antithesis of freedom of choice.\n  Continuing:\n\n       Please understand we want people to have health care, but \n     why are they destroying us in the process? I am in the \n     process of scrambling to find a job that provides insurance. \n     I was offered a Educational Assistant job that has been \n     changed to 29 hours, no health insurance.\n\n  I wonder what caused that change in employment.\n  Continuing:\n\n       Most opportunities I am finding have recently dropped \n     insurance coverage has a benefit.\n       We are scared about the future.\n\n\n[[Page S8655]]\n\n\n  This is what the Affordable Care Act has done. That is what the \npatient protection and Affordable Care Act has done to Americans, to \nWisconsinites. It has made them fearful. They are afraid, they are \nscared for their futures. Good job, Congress. Good job, President \nObama. My, aren't we a compassionate lot. Didn't we do a fine job. \nAren't we smart.\n  The next Wisconsinite writes:\n\n       I'm extremely unhappy with the so called ``Affordable Care \n     Act.'' Unfortunately, for my middle class family, the new law \n     is creating un-affordable health insurance. I am a 35 year \n     old project management consultant and my wife and I have 2 \n     children. We currently purchase health insurance on the \n     individual market and are very happy with our coverage. We \n     currently pay $352 per month to cover our family of 4. The \n     plan offers a copay of $35 when going to the doctor, and has \n     a $7,500 deductible for our family.\n       I have begun researching what our health insurance premiums \n     will cost going forward under ObamaCare and I am outraged \n     with what I've found. The cheapest policy I can find is \n     $761.71--\n\n  Let me refer back to the fact that they are paying $352, so that is \nmore than a 100-percent increase.\n  Continuing:\n\n     --$761.71 per month for a Bronze plan and a $12,600 \n     deductible!\n\n  Again, that compares to the $7,500 deductible under the plan that \nthey are ``happy with.''\n\n       This is 116 percent more than what we currently pay, with a \n     higher deductible. If I look at a comparable plan to what we \n     have now, the new cost will be around $900 per month, which \n     is a 156 percent increase. Also, our income is slightly above \n     the threshold to get any subsidies.\n       The new regulations in ObamaCare will not benefit our \n     family, but they will more than double our cost. We need to \n     repeal this terrible law and replace it with simple, market \n     based incentives. Health insurance should be more like car \n     insurance. You don't submit a claim to get your oil changed \n     in your car. Same goes for health care. We should pay out of \n     pocket for routine health care using a transparent price \n     structure that allows consumers to shop for the care they \n     want. Then have a cheap insurance policy for major illness \n     coverage. Republicans need to communicate this alternative, \n     and make it simple for people to understand.\n\n  I could not agree with this individual more. He continues:\n\n       I realize repeal and replace is not possible until after \n     the 2016 elections, but I appreciate and support \n     wholeheartedly your new ``If You Like Your Health Plan, You \n     Can Keep It Act.'' For the millions of people out there like \n     me, we should be able to keep our current plan indefinitely. \n     Hold the President to his promise and pass this law to \n     grandfather in all existing policies.\n\n  Let me just stop a minute and talk a little about the bill I did \nintroduce--If You Like Your Health Plan, You Can Keep It Act. It is a \npretty simple act. I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor it and pass \nit as soon as possible. I wrote it a certain way. I wrote it using the \nexact same grandfather language that was in ObamaCare. The problem with \nthe grandfather language within the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act is that, yes, it grandfathered plans, as long as you totally \nchanged them. We took the grandfather language and we just pulled out \nthe you just have to totally change your plan. We made it a true \ngrandfather provision: the same language, the true intent, the honest \nintent.\n  So I urge my Democratic colleagues to support that bill. Again, let \nme emphasize we cannot at this late hour, unfortunately, salvage most \nof these plans that have already been lost to the individuals whose \nemails I am reading from tonight. But there are millions of Americans \nwho will lose their coverage in the future.\n  Let me tell you how it is going to happen. I bought health care for \nthe people who worked for me for 31 years in my business. I always was \ngoing to do that. There was no way I was ever going to subject the \npeople who worked with me to the financial ruin of not having a health \ncare plan.\n  That being said, as the previous writer was saying, I didn't pay for \ntheir auto insurance, I didn't pay for their homeowners or property \ninsurance. I always kind of wondered: Why am I having to make these \nvery personal decisions for the people who work with me? Why am I \nhaving to decide on their levels of deductible and having to decide is \nit a PPO or an HMO? I know the reason why. It was government \ninterference in the marketplace back in the 1940s, with wage price \ncontrols.\n  Unions very naturally said: You can't raise our wages, give us some \nother benefit tax free, and that began the destruction of our health \ncare system in terms of patient involvement, in terms of a competitive \nmarketplace. Back then, 68 cents of every health care dollar was \nactually paid by the patient. There was free-market competition to \nensure cost restraint, to ensure high-quality and high levels of \ncustomer service. That is what the free market does. Today, only 12 \ncents of every $1 is paid by the patient.\n  But getting back to the millions who are going to be losing their \nemployer-sponsored care, most employers care deeply about the people \nwho work with them. They also would not expose the people who work with \nthem to financial risk. But under the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act, the decision is totally different now. Now an employer is \ngoing to be facing double-digit premium increases when these plans they \nwere able to quickly renew before January 1 come due in 2014.\n  If the exchanges, as they should have been from day one, start \noperating properly, employers are going to be faced with a decision: \nShould I pay $15,000 per family for family coverage? By the way, that \nis up $2,500 per year, not down $2,500 per year as President Obama \npromised us. Do I pay $15,000 per family coverage and try to comply \nwith the 20,000-plus pages of law and rules and regulation or do I pay \nthe $2,000 or $3,000 fine, and I am not putting my employees at \nfinancial risk? I am potentially making them eligible for subsidies in \nthe exchange.\n  That is the decision employers are going to be facing. Here is the \nkicker. Even those who are saying: I am not going to do that; I am \ngoing to keep providing that coverage, just wait until the first \ncompetitor drops coverage and pays the $2,000 fine rather than a \n$15,000 fine. Marketplace competition is brutal. It is not fun. It is \nwhy businesses that succeed should be celebrated, not demonized. But \nthat is a decision to be made by millions of employers. As a result, \ntens of millions of additional Americans will lose the health care \ncoverage they get through their employers using pretax dollars and get \nforced into the exchanges.\n  Maybe some will get subsidies paid for by the American taxpayer--\nactually, paid for by a debt burden placed on the backs of our children \nand grandchildren because we can't afford the Affordable Care Act. That \nis what is going to happen. That is what this Chamber, this Congress, \nthis President needs to consider.\n  That is why I am asking my colleagues in the Senate to join with me \nto pass the If You Like Your Health Plan, You Can Keep It Act--so we \ncan protect millions of Americans, so we can honor that promise that \nwas made repeatedly by this President and Members of this Chamber who \nvoted for and supported this bill. Accept responsibility, be held \naccountable, act responsibly, and join me in that effort to protect \nAmericans.\n  Another Wisconsinite writes:\n\n       Please allow me to introduce myself and my family. We are \n     an average, middle class Wisconsin family that is having a \n     really bad year. My husband was diagnosed with cancer in May, \n     I lost my job and our family health insurance in June. \n     Because of preexisting conditions, our only insurance option \n     was the high insurance risk sharing pool.\n\n  Again, that is the plan in Wisconsin I certainly found worked for \nreal Americans. It worked. It will now be obsolete because of the \nhealth care law.\n  This individual continues:\n\n       For our family of three (myself, husband and college \n     student daughter) our monthly premiums are $783 per month, \n     with a $7,500 individual deductible. With the high insurance \n     risk sharing pool ending December 31, 2013, I am searching \n     for insurance, as I have yet to find employment. I have tried \n     over 20 times to get on the affordable health care Web site \n     with no luck. I have been able to set up a log in and user \n     name, and have entered some information, which is never saved \n     when I have to log out due to a ``please wait'' message that \n     never goes away. I am working with an insurance agent to \n     secure quotes outside of the government Web site, as I am \n     sure we are way too middle class to be afforded any type of \n     subsidy. Although I am unable to determine this through the \n     defective Web site. Our cheapest quote is $1,580 per month--\n\n  Again, that compares to $783 per month. Again, basically a 100-\npercent increase.\n\n     --with a $12,500 deductible.\n\n  Her previous deductible was $7,500.\n\n       Therefore, the Affordable Care Act would cost my family \n     over $9,500 more per year in premiums and our total \n     deductibles to meet\n\n[[Page S8656]]\n\n     will increase to $37,500 from $22,500 for the family. The \n     total effect is $24,500 additionally in 2014. Are we \n     seriously supposed to be able to absorb this into our budget? \n     What does our family do in this situation? We simply cannot \n     afford $1,580 per month for insurance or $24,500 per year. \n     What are our options? My husband will undergo chemotherapy \n     and has a surgery scheduled for 2014. I am feverishly--\n\n  Do you hear that word--``feverishly''\n\n     --looking for employment with health insurance coverage. I am \n     sure we are not the only family adversely affected by the \n     law. Please provide answers for all of us. I look forward to \n     hearing from you.\n\n  Again, my plea is to please provide true protection. Please provide \nsecurity. Please accept the responsibility of what this law, what your \nsupport for this law did and is doing to millions of Wisconsinites, to \nmillions of Americans. It is simply immoral what this law is doing to \npeople, to their lives.\n  It is not going to be pretty what this law is going to do to our \nhealth care system. It will lower quality and it will produce rationing \nbecause the only way the government can afford to provide all of this \naccess is actually by limiting access. Of course, we are already seeing \na very limited number of doctors who are actually accepting these \ncontracts from the networks that are provided in the exchange, \nprimarily because of all of the mandated coverages that are \ndramatically increasing the price of health care, as I have \ndemonstrated this evening in these emails and these letters we are \nreceiving from real people, from people who are suffering because of \nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the topic of the \nnomination of Cornelia Pillard to the DC Circuit.\n  Before I go to that specific topic, I wish to address a broader \ntopic, which is how we got in these circumstances in the first place \nand why we are here tonight, why we are having this discussion, and how \nthis nuclear option, as it has been described, has come about.\n  Most immediately was November 21, 2013, just a few weeks ago, when \nthe majority party in the Senate unilaterally decided to break the \nrules of the Senate, violate the rules and rewrite the rules \nthemselves. Despite the fact the rules clearly say it takes a two-\nthirds majority of the Senate to do that, they decided to disregard \nthat and change the rules themselves. So they did that on November 21, \n2013.\n  What they specifically did, the specific rule change they imposed \nunilaterally on the Senate, was to completely eliminate the opportunity \nfor the minority party to have any ability to be a check or a balance \nto the process of selecting and confirming the nominees of a given \nPresident to the judiciary of the United States of America, the Federal \njudiciary, or to the executive branch.\n  It is a little bit sweeping, but that is exactly what has been done. \nThis is contrary to the entire history of the Republic, where this has \nnever been done before, and it applies to lifetime appointees. Of \ncourse, Federal judges, as we all know, once they are confirmed, they \nhold that office until they decide they are done--at whatever age that \nmight be. It is a lifetime appointment. Unless they commit an \nimpeachable offense, there is nothing anybody can do about it.\n\n  One of the things that is interesting about this decision by our \nDemocratic colleagues is they decided to eliminate the rights the \nminority party has had in the Senate for centuries. They decided to do \nthat despite the fact that 20 of them warned vehemently against \nengaging in this very activity just a few years ago. As a matter of \nfact, none other than the Senate majority leader who personally led \nthis effort, Senator Reid, said in 2009:\n\n       The right to extend the debate is never more important than \n     when one party controls the Congress and the White House. In \n     these cases, a filibuster serves as a check on power and \n     preserves our limited government.\n\n  In 2009 the senior Senator from New York said:\n\n       The checks and balances which have been at the core of this \n     Republic will be evaporated by the nuclear option. The checks \n     and balances say that if you get 51 percent of the vote, you \n     don't get your way 100 percent of the time.\n\n  That is what our friends, the leadership of the majority party, the \nDemocratic party, said very recently.\n  So you have to ask yourself, why would they do a complete reversal? \nWhy would they do a 180-degree switch? Why would they go from a \nposition of absolute vehement opposition to the nuclear option that \ndenies the minority party any say whatsoever in the confirmation of \nFederal nominees--why would they go from that to where they were just a \ncouple weeks ago when they executed their plan and unilaterally broke \nthe rules so they could change the rules to inflict that very policy on \nthe current minority party, the Republican Party?\n  We can look at what the majority leader said at the time. One of the \nthings he said on November 21, 2013, the day on which the majority \nleader made this change:\n\n       There has been unbelievable, unprecedented obstruction. For \n     the first time in the history of our Republic, Republicans \n     have routinely used the filibuster to prevent President Obama \n     from appointing his executive team or confirming judges.\n\n  That is what Senator Reid has asserted as his justification for this \nunilateral, unprecedented deprivation of minority party rights. In \nfact, just this evening Senator Reid was back on the Senate floor, and \nhe used the word ``obstructionism'' about a dozen times. So I think it \nis worth considering what has actually happened. What does the record \nshow? Let's go back to March 2011 because that is an interesting moment \nin this discussion about how and whether and when and under what \ncircumstances to confirm nominees.\n  In March 2011, Republicans decided that, you know what, it probably \nwould be a good idea for the President--President Obama at this time, \nobviously--to be able to get a very large number of nominees appointed \nand confirmed without even having to go through the Senate process. The \nlegislation is called the Presidential Appointment Efficiency and \nStreamlining Act of 2011. Under this act, thousands of appointees from \nthe executive branch were simply no longer subject to Senate \nconfirmation.\n  So what Republicans did in March 2011--far from obstructing \nanything--was to say: Mr. President, here is a huge category of Federal \nnominees, and we won't even require a vote. We won't even require \nSenate consideration. You get these, all of them. You nominate them, \nthey are done, period.\n  Does that sound like obstruction? Not to me. It was passed by a \nRepublican-controlled House, supported by Republicans in the Senate, \nand signed into law.\n  So today the law of the land, as a result of Republican cooperation, \nis that this President enjoys a luxury no previous President has had--\nthis huge category of nominees who are solely, exclusively at his \ndiscretion. It doesn't matter if a single Senator or every Senator \nstrongly objects. It doesn't matter. It is totally irrelevant.\n  So I think we ought to consider that legislation in the context of \nthis discussion. But let's take a look at those nominees who remain \nsubject to and who prior to this legislation have been subject to \nSenate confirmation.\n  One category is Federal judges. We have many district courts around \nthe country. So far, the President has nominated 174 candidates to \nFederal district courts around the country. Of the 174 the President \nhas nominated, I wonder if you could guess how many have been \nconfirmed. I will tell you how many have been confirmed--174. There \nhave been 174 confirmed and zero rejected. At the circuit court level, \nprior to the recent episode, the President had nominated 41 candidates \nto the circuit court. Of the 41, 39 had been confirmed. So the total of \njudicial nominees President Obama has sent to us in the Senate is 217, \nand 215 have been confirmed and 2 have been objected to. By my math, \nthat is something like 1 percent objected to, 99 percent confirmed. \nThis doesn't strike me as unreasonable obstruction.\n  But judges aren't the whole story. There are also the nonjudicial \nnominees, and we ought to consider those as well. So far, at least as \nof when we compiled this data, the President has nominated 1,488 \nindividuals to various Federal spots throughout the executive branch--\nthe agencies, his departments, and so on. Of the 1,488, 1,486 have been \nconfirmed and 2 have been blocked by Republicans. That would include \n100 percent of the President's Cabinet\n\n[[Page S8657]]\n\nnominees and 100 percent of virtually every other category but not \nevery last one. If we add those together, the total of the President's \nnominees, both judicial and nonjudicial, 1,707 confirmed, 4 rejected. \nSo that works out to something like the Senate has confirmed with \nRepublican support--because prior to the rule change, it couldn't \nhappen without Republican support--the Senate has confirmed 99.9 \npercent of President Obama's nominees to judgeships and to \nnonjudgeships. You have to ask yourself, could that possibly constitute \noutrageous obstruction, unprecedented obstruction, as Senator Reid has \nsaid, preventing President Obama from appointing his executive team or \nconfirming judges? How can this possibly be?\n  The majority leader came down to the Senate floor on the date on \nwhich he decided to unilaterally change the rules by breaking the rules \nand he cited as an example the outrageous case of Chuck Hagel, who had \nserved in this body. Chuck Hagel. Whatever became of Chuck Hagel? Oh, \nthat is right, he was confirmed to be Secretary of Defense, as has \nvirtually every single other nominee the President has proposed.\n  The leader seemed to think it was completely unreasonable that \nRepublican Senators would demand some information from former-Senator \nHagel along the way. It seems to me the fact that he is a former \nSenator should not change his obligation to provide the information the \nSenate requests, and when he provided that information, he was \nconfirmed easily.\n  So it seems pretty clear to me, it seems pretty indisputable that \nthis really never was about obstructionism. A 99.9-percent confirmation \nrate? It just can't be about obstruction. It is clearly not.\n  So we have to ask ourselves, if it is not the case that Republicans \nhave been obstructing the President's team--and it is clearly not--then \nwhy did the majority in this body decide to unilaterally change the \nrules and deny the minority the opportunity to have any say whatsoever \non the confirmation process? Fortunately, some of our colleagues on the \nother side have explained this for us. They have told us why they made \nthis change. But let me put it in a little bit of context.\n  We are in a situation here where we have a divided government. It is \ntrue that the American people elected President Obama to a second term, \nand elections have consequences. But on the very same day, the American \npeople reelected Republicans to be the majority party in the House. And \nall elections have consequences, not just Presidential elections.\n  So the reality is that the very liberal agenda President Obama would \nlike to pursue is very difficult. He can't get most of the liberal \nthings he wants to do, whether it is some kind of cap and trade or card \ncheck or his war on coal. This is well outside of the mainstream of \nwhere the American public is, and it is not where the consensus is in \nthe House of Representatives. So his legislative agenda isn't going \nanywhere in the House. The administration understands that very well, \nthe President understands that very well, and so do the members of the \nmajority party here in the Senate.\n  What do you do if you have an agenda that is out of step with the \nAmerican people and can't pass in a duly-elected House of \nRepresentatives? Well, some people think the thing to do is do an end \nrun around the legislative body, bypass the legislation, and use an \nundemocratic--I would argue unconstitutional--process and have \nunelected, unaccountable bureaucrats impose by fiat and through \nregulation that which you cannot achieve through legislation.\n  Of course, that is completely inconsistent with our Constitution, \nwith the way our Federal Government is intended to operate, and with \nthe principle of the separation of powers. It would require pursuing an \nagenda that is out of step with the American people and without the \nconsent of Congress, which, of course, is supposed to be a partner with \nany executive branch, with any President in pursuing any agenda.\n  Of course, our Founders foresaw the danger of an Executive who would \ntry this sort of thing and would do an end run around the legislature \nand try to use the enormous power at the disposal of the Executive, who \nhas massive staff and huge agencies and all kinds of resources, and \nunderstood that it is quite possible that you could have an Executive \nwho would try, for instance, selective enforcement of laws, maybe \nunilateral suspension of laws, as we have seen this administration do, \nwriting rules and regulations that are inconsistent with the laws. \nThese are all behaviors we could anticipate.\n  Our Founders did. They did. They anticipated this could happen. So \nwhat they did is they built a system that would have some checks and \nbalances, that would provide some limitations. Among the other ways \nthey did it--there were many ways this was done, but one of them was \nthe separation of powers and specifically the creation of a judiciary \nwhich would be a referee on whether, for instance, a given agency, a \ngiven regulator, was in fact complying with the laws or whether they \nhad gone rogue, whether they had gone overboard, whether they were \noverreaching, whether they were pursuing some agenda for which they did \nnot have authority.\n  These courts play an absolutely vital and I would say completely \nindispensable role in giving individual Americans their last hope in \nseeking to preserve their liberty against an unfair, arbitrary, and \neven unconstitutional executive overreach. That is what the courts do.\n  As it happens, there is one particular court that plays a \ndisproportionate role in this process of adjudicating and officiating \nover Federal regulations. It just so happens that by virtue of its \nlocation, a big majority of cases in which an American citizen \nchallenges a regulation because that citizen believes this is a \nregulation that is unfair, unconstitutional, illegal or otherwise not \nconsistent with our laws--the venue where this ends up finally getting \nadjudicated is very often the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  This has become a bit of a problem for the administration and some of \nour friends in the Senate because the DC Circuit Court of Appeals has \nbecome a bit of an obstacle to some of the ambitions they would like to \nimpose. One example, for instance, is last year the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals struck down for the second time in 4 years the EPA's \nregulations on cross-State air pollution. This is a complicated story. \nWe do not have to get into all the details but, bottom line, these are \nregulations that would among other things have a devastating impact on \nStates such as Pennsylvania that have a big coal industry and that have \na big utility industry that uses coal to fire generators. The court \nfound that the EPA had gone beyond its legal authority. The statute \nclearly says what the EPA may do and may not do. They were going beyond \nwhat they are permitted to do and the DC Circuit Court of Appeals said \nso.\n  That is not the only case in which the DC Circuit Court of Appeals \nhas ruled in ways that are problematic to some of our friends here. \nAnother was a decision they made regarding recess appointments. You may \nremember this. A while back, the President made a very extraordinary \ndecision. The President decided for the first time in the history of \nthe Republic that it was up to him to determine when the Senate was in \nrecess and when it was not; that was his unilateral decision to make. \nNo other President ever took it upon himself to decide it was his power \nto determine when a different branch of government was in recess, but \nthis President did. He said that is his decision. So I guess by his \nlogic he could decide when we are out on lunch, that is a recess; out \non the weekend, that is a recess; that is up to him by his standard. So \nhe created an opportunity for himself to make appointments that he knew \nwould not be confirmed in the Senate or were unlikely to be confirmed.\n  There was bipartisan, in some cases, concern about some of these \nfolks. He went ahead and made the appointments. The DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals said actually, no, the Constitution is pretty clear. You do not \nhave that authority.\n  These are just a couple of examples where a nonpartisan, completely \ncompetent, and very highly respected appellate court made decisions \nabout Executive behavior. This has not sat so well with some of our \ncolleagues.\n  Why do I bring this all up? Because this is what this is truly all \nabout. This\n\n[[Page S8658]]\n\nis not about Republican obstructionism. What this is about is our \nDemocratic friends want to pursue a very liberal agenda. They cannot do \nit through legislation so they intend to do it through regulation. As \nthey overreach and go beyond the legal authority, which they have \nalready done and intend to continue to do, the victims, American \ncitizens who are victims of this overreach, are going to challenge \nthese rules and regulations in court. When they do, they are going to \nend up in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Some of our friends want to do whatever it takes to make sure they \ncan win those decisions. Those are not just my words. The senior \nSenator from New York complained about the DC Circuit. He was on record \nclaiming the DC Circuit ``overturned the EPA's ability to regulate \nexisting coal plants.''\n  OK. He further went on to say, ``The SEC cannot pass rulings unless \nthey do what is called a cost-benefit analysis.'' That was another \ncomplaint the senior Senator from New York made about the DC Circuit.\n  So he told a group of supporters that in order to reverse this, \nDemocrats will ``fill up the DC Circuit one way or another.''\n  I think this is about as clear as it could be. There are people who \ndo not like the decisions coming out of the court and so their \nintention is to pack the court with people who share their political \nviews and will therefore sustain decisions about the advancement of \ntheir liberal agenda.\n  But it was not only the senior Senator from New York who made these \ncomments. The majority leader himself explained this as well. Referring \nto the DC Circuit Court he said:\n\n       They're the ones that said . . . the president can't have \n     recess appointments. . . . They've done a lot of bad things, \n     so we're focusing a very intently on the D.C. Circuit. We \n     need at least one more. There's three vacancies, we need at \n     least one more and that will switch the majority.\n\n  Could there be a more direct, straightforward statement about what \ntheir real intent is? Their intent is to pack the court with partisan \npeople who will give them the decisions they need so they can advance \nthe agenda they want when it is blocked through the ordinary legal and \nconstitutional legislative process. That is what is going on here. That \nis why we are here tonight. That is what is taking place.\n  When Republicans decided that we do not think it is a good idea to \nmanipulate courts this way, to populate them with partisans, to try \ncourt stacking for the purpose of advancing an agenda, that is when our \nDemocratic friends decided to go nuclear. The pity of this is our \nFounders had enormous foresight. They were absolutely brilliant. They \nconstructed an incredible document, a series of documents that have \nguided this Republic for centuries now. They anticipated a lot. I do \nnot think they anticipated that the leader of the majority party in the \nSenate would just turn it over to the control of the executive branch \nand make this institution just a rubberstamp for what the President \nwants to do. But that is where we are.\n\n  What is the practical consequence of all this? Why is it that this is \nsuch a terrible idea? Let me touch on a few of the reasons. There are a \nlot of reasons I think this is a disastrous policy, but let me touch on \na few of them. One result of this is undoubtedly a further \npolarization, in fact a radicalization of the Federal Government.\n  The second is that as a direct result of this unilateral decision and \nthe ability now of our Democratic friends to simply steamroll nominees \nthrough without any consideration by the minority party, we will have \nto expect fluctuations, volatility in administrative and regulatory \nrulings.\n  Then last and probably most disturbingly, I think there is a real \ndanger that a justice system that has been the envy of the world and is \nrecognized for its impartial and nonpartisan integrity may very well be \nincreasingly viewed as a partisan and biased one.\n  Let me explain this a little bit, the idea that we have a more \nradicalized Federal Government. For 200 years, a President has always \nknown that in order to nominate and to get confirmed one of his \nnominees he would need broad support in the Senate. It would not fly if \nhe selected someone who was only appealing to a few or even a very \nsmall majority. So what does this do? That forces any President, \nwhether it is a Republican or a Democrat, to nominate people who would \nhave that broader bipartisan appeal. Frankly, Presidents of both \nparties are always under pressure from their respective bases to pick \nthe most extreme people. That is what pleases the base of either party. \nIt has always served the Republic well that a President can say I have \nto get that person confirmed through the Senate and if I pick the most \nextreme people that is going to be a problem. The fact that a President \nhas needed that bipartisan support has essentially required that a \nPresident look for people who represent a broad consensus across \nAmerica.\n  In this postnuclear Senate, that moderating influence is gone. There \nis no such influence anymore, and I think it is a safe bet that we can \nexpect more extreme nominees. We have already seen some evidence of it. \nThe Hill ran a story recently. It reported that now that the nuclear \noption has been detonated, far left interest groups are ``pressing \nPresident Obama to select left-wing nominees for key regulatory and \njudicial posts, nominees who could never have been confirmable \nbefore.'' That is no surprise. That is exactly the kind of consequence \nwe should expect.\n  The second consideration is stability in rules and regulations that \nare promulgated by the various regulators and agencies. I hear every \nday across Pennsylvania one of the grave concerns of business that is \nhampering our ability to have a stronger economy, to have the kind of \ngrowth we would like to have, is uncertainty about regulations.\n  It is true and it is important. Guess what. It is likely to get worse \nbecause, first of all, this huge administrative, bureaucratic State \nthat we have devolved into recently touches on virtually every aspect \nof our life and there are hundreds of agencies, boards, and commissions \nthat the administration controls. What is likely to happen now is that \nif the White House and control of the Senate changes parties, we are \nlikely to see big swings in the ideology and the partisanship of these \nfolks because they were not consensus candidates in the first place, \nright. Given that now we have a situation where a majority party just \nsteamrolls their way through whomever they want and has every incentive \nto go to the extremes, when they lose an election what are we going to \nhave? We are going to have the exact opposite swing. So for businesses \ntrying to make a decision about whether to invest in America to grow \ntheir company, to hire more workers, they are going to worry and \nwonder: What will the regulatory regime look like in just a few years, \ndepending on how the election goes? It is much less predictability, \nless stability, and the direct result of that is going to be less \ninvestment and fewer jobs. This is not good news for our economy at \nall.\n  Finally, my concern is that for similar reasons we are going to see a \ndiminishing of the judiciary, of the status of the judiciary among the \nAmerican people, of the credibility, of the respect the American people \nhave had.\n  A moment ago I said I think one of the great strengths of the \nAmerican Federal Government throughout our history has been, generally \nspeaking, that--and there have been exceptions, and there will always \nbe some exceptions--by and large at all levels the American people have \nhad a pretty high respect for the judiciary. They respect the fact that \nour judges are capable and competent and tend not to be partisan hacks. \nThey tend not to be polarizing political figures who are trying to \nadvance an agenda. They have tended to be men and women of ability and \nintegrity who were calling balls and strikes the way they see fit. They \nrealize they are the umps and referees; they are not the players on the \nfield. They are not there to advance an agenda; they are there to \nofficiate based on the law and the Constitution. That has been the \ncase.\n  The reason our judiciary has been so respected is because it is \nnonpartisan. It is independent of the other branches of government, and \nit has behaved that way. The American people have the confidence that \nthey can go before a Federal judge and receive a fair and unbiased \nhearing whether the judge is a Democrat, Republican, liberal, or \nconservative. The fact is that most Americans don't worry and say: Wait \na minute. Is that judge a Republican? It\n\n[[Page S8659]]\n\ndoesn't occur to most people to ask that question, nor should it \nbecause it doesn't matter in most cases.\n  This respect for the judiciary that the American people have is \nextremely important. In Federalist 78, Alexander Hamilton talked about \nthe importance of this deep respect for the judiciary. He said:\n\n       The judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three \n     departments of power.\n\n  Whereas the executive branch has the military and Congress has the \npower of the purse, the judiciary cannot enforce its own decisions. It \nrelies on Americans' respect for it and willingness to enforce its \nrulings as essential.\n  The fact is that the deep respect the American people have had for \nthe judiciary has allowed our courts, including the Supreme Court of \nthe United States, to issue decisions that have profoundly affected our \nlives, profoundly changed our society, and so many times so much for \nthe better. A famous example would be Brown v. the Board of Education, \nwhich reversed the separate-but-equal doctrine. It ended the southern \ngovernment laws that banned White and Black persons from associating \nwith each other. This created a certain upheaval at the time, but it \nstuck, and part of the reason it stuck was because the public saw that \nthis was a decision by a nonpartisan court that was acting as an \narbiter of our Constitution. The respect the American people had for \nour courts was a big part of why a contentious decision quickly became \naccepted and became part of our fabric.\n  Alexander Hamilton explained that the judiciary's integrity and \nindependence are absolutely critical; otherwise, Americans' \n``confidence'' in the courts will be replaced by what he described as \n``universal distrust and distress.'' He said:\n\n       The benefits of the integrity and moderation of the \n     judiciary . . . must have commanded the esteem and applause \n     of all the virtuous and disinterested.\n       Considerate men of every description ought to prize \n     whatever will tend to beget or fortify that temper in the \n     courts: as no man can be sure that he may not be to-morrow \n     the victim of a spirit of injustice, by which he may be a \n     gainer to-day.\n       The inevitable tendency of such a spirit is to sap the \n     foundations of public and private confidence, and to \n     introduce in its stead universal distrust and distress.\n\n  When a President, with the cooperation of a legislature, rubberstamps \njudicial nominees for the purpose of ratifying a political agenda--when \nthis happens, the American people's trust in the judiciary will be \nbadly damaged, and we are at the threshold of that moment now. Of \ncourse, it also completely undermines our whole system of separation of \npowers. The fact is that when judges are seen as being at the beck and \ncall of a legislature, a President, or a party, our individual liberty \nis simply not secure.\n  Again, to quote Hamilton:\n\n       The general liberty of the people can never be endangered \n     from [the courts] . . . so long as the judiciary remains \n     truly distinct from both the legislature and the Executive.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Liberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone, \n     but would have everything to fear from its union with either \n     of the other departments.\n\n  When you have one party ruling and completely controlling this \nprocess--and controlling it for the purpose of advancing a partisan \nagenda--that strikes me as exactly the danger Hamilton warned us of.\n  So where does that leave us in this regard? I don't think we are \ndoomed, but I do think it is very important that the American people \nrise and make their objection to this clearly heard. It is important \nthat the American people contact their Members of Congress. They need \nto exercise their ultimate control of this process at the ballot box \nand urge the Senate majority to give up its plan to use the courts to \nachieve a legislative agenda that they cannot get through a duly-\nelected Congress that represents the American people.\n  By the way, there is another big incentive for our friends to want to \npack this DC Circuit Court, and that is because the front-burner and \nmost prominent policy and political issue of the day is largely going \nto be litigated right there very soon. The DC Circuit is going to hear \na very important case that goes to heart of ObamaCare. The DC Circuit \nis hearing a case about how the IRS has chosen to implement some rules. \nThe law is very clear. The law unambiguously states that the subsidies \nObamaCare has designed for many people who buy health insurance through \ntheir exchange--those subsidies will only be available through the \nState exchanges.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, ObamaCare contemplates two different \ncategories of exchanges through which people are forced to buy the \nmandated insurance. There are State exchanges, and in those States that \ndon't operate an exchange, there are Federal exchanges. Well, the law \nsays that the subsidies are available only for the people who purchase \ntheir health insurance through the State exchanges. What the \nadministration is attempting to do is to completely disregard the law \nand make the subsidies available to people who buy through either the \nState exchange or the Federal exchange. That is not what the law says. \nI understand that this administration routinely disregards the law, but \nthat is why we have an independent judiciary--to impose a check when \nthey do this.\n\n  There is a legal scholar by the name of Mike Garvin who is following \nthis case closely. He has explained what is going on. He said:\n\n       Congress knew that the federal government cannot require \n     the states to establish or operate Exchanges, so it offered \n     subsidized insurance premiums for residents of states with \n     State-operated exchanges to entice states to undertake this \n     responsibility. Instead, fully 33 states--from Texas to Ohio \n     to President Obama's and Vice President Biden's home states \n     of Illinois and Delaware--have said ``thanks, but no \n     thanks.'' Instead, these states have chosen to shield their \n     businesses and residents from the worst of the potential \n     ``train wreck.''\n\n  That creates a bit of a problem for the administration because with \nso many States choosing not to participate in this disaster and having \nonly a Federal exchange, if they actually comply with the law they \nsigned, then there would be a lot of people who would not be eligible \nfor the subsidy. If the DC Circuit Court of Appeals were to simply \nfollow and impose the law, then that would create a huge problem, which \nstrikes me as yet another incentive for why perhaps we have gone \nthrough what we have gone through over the last couple of weeks--\nbecause it is so important for our friends on the other side to get the \ndecisions they want out of this court.\n  All of this brings me to what we really ought to be working on. By \nthe way, all of these nominees who are before us and tying us up this \nweek are all entirely at the choosing of the majority leader. None of \nthese are essential, none of these are urgent, and none of these are \nemergencies. We could be passing legislation, such as our Defense \nauthorization legislation. We have a budget deal that could be on the \nfloor. We have a farm bill that is overdue. We have a lot of things we \ncould be doing. We could be trying to deal with the enormous problems \ncaused by ObamaCare, but we are not. We are dealing with nominees \ninstead.\n  I think we ought to focus on the problems that ObamaCare is causing, \nand I will admit that sometimes it is hard to know where to begin \nbecause these problems are so huge. I will start with the taxes \nObamaCare has been imposing on us and continues to impose on us. It is \na pretty extraordinary list. As best we could tabulate, there are \nsomething like 20 different taxes that were created as part of \nObamaCare. There is over $1 trillion worth of taxes to burden this \neconomy and diminish our opportunities to grow and invest and create \nthe jobs we need at a time when our economy is weak and needs an \nopportunity to recover. Instead, we saddle it with all of these taxes.\n  For instance, we have an excise tax on charitable hospitals.\n  We have a tax in the form of the codification of the economic \nsubstance doctrine. It is a tax hike of $4.5 billion that allows the \nIRS to completely disallow legal tax deductions.\n  We have the black liquor tax hike, which is a tax increase on a type \nof biofuel.\n  We have a tax on innovator drug companies.\n  We have a $2.3 billion annual tax on the industry. We have a Blue \nCross Blue Shield tax hike, which is a special tax deduction in current \nlaw that would only be allowed if 85 percent or more of the premiums \nare spent on clinical services. That is a tax increase which went into \neffect in 2010.\n\n[[Page S8660]]\n\n  We have a tax on indoor tanning services.\n  We have taxes that took effect in 2011. There is the medicine cabinet \ntax. Americans are no longer able to use health savings accounts or \nflexible savings accounts or health reimbursement pretax dollars to \npurchase nonprescription over-the-counter medicine. So the inability to \nuse these taxpayer accounts for legitimate medical needs is a tax \nincrease.\n  We have the HSA withdrawal tax hike.\n  Going into effect in 2012, we have the employer reporting of \ninsurance on W-2.\n  In 2013 we have a surtax on investment income. We have a whole new \n3.8-percent surtax on investment incomes, and this can only have the \neffect of diminishing investment in our economy. It diminishes the \nreturn on investment, diminishes the incentive to take a risk and start \na new business, provide capital to a new business, grow a business, \nwhich is all due to ObamaCare.\n  We have the hike in the Medicare payroll tax.\n  One of the most egregious of them all--we have the tax on medical \ndevice manufacturers. This one is particularly egregious because it is \nso badly designed on top of being ill-conceived. This is a 2.3-percent \ntax on the sale of medical devices. Irrespective of whether a company \nhas any income whatsoever or makes any money from this, we are imposing \na tax on the sale of these products. The average medical device company \nhas a profit margin of less than 5 percent. A 2.3-percent tax is about \nhalf of all their income that now goes to a new sales tax. By the way, \nthey still have to pay income taxes, all the ordinary income taxes.\n\n  This is absolutely devastating, because what these companies are then \nforced to do is, if virtually the entire bottom line goes for taxes, \nthey don't have the money to reinvest in their business. The medical \ndevice industry is one of the best industries we have in this country. \nIt is so dynamic. It is so creative.\n  I wish my colleagues would come with me to parts of Pennsylvania \nwhere this industry is just thriving--or was thriving but not so much \nanymore. It was thriving because of the creativity, the innovation, the \ndevices, and inventions that people are making, improving the quality \nof life and extending life. It is amazing, the marriage of technology \nand creative minds and experts in health care, what they are creating.\n  But, unfortunately, for a lot of these products, it takes a long time \nbefore they are actually profitable for the company that sells them, \nlong after they have begun sales. This tax imposes the burden before \nthey have ever become profitable. What is the effect of that? It is \nthat it makes this whole industry less appealing to invest in, less \nattractive to entrepreneurs, to investors. Whether it is venture \ncapital or private equity or wherever the source might be, less is \ngoing to medical devices, an industry that is saving lives and \nimproving the quality of lives. It is a big manufacturing industry. \nMost of these companies manufacture their products in the United States \nand many in Pennsylvania. We sell a lot of them overseas. We have a big \ntrade surplus in medical devices because we lead the world.\n  What does ObamaCare do? It slaps a new tax on the sales. It is a \nterrible policy.\n  We have a high medical bills tax. Currently, those people who face \nhigh medical bills are allowed a deduction for medical expenses to the \nextent that those expenses exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income. \nThe new provision, which took effect just earlier this year, raises \nthat threshold before a person can take that deduction. That is just a \ncomplicated, convoluted tax increase on people who have high medical \nbills.\n  There is the flexible spending account cap. There is the elimination \nof the tax deduction for employer-provided retirement drug coverage in \ncoordination with Medicare Part D. There is the individual mandate \nexcise tax. There is the employer mandate tax. There is the tax on \nhealth insurers. There is an excise tax on comprehensive health \ninsurance plans.\n  There are 20 different taxes, the combined effect of which is, \nwithout a doubt, to significantly weaken our economy.\n  But that is not the only way ObamaCare weakens our economy. The \nmandate ObamaCare imposes on employers kicks in on employers who have \n50 or more employees. I have spoken with a number of Pennsylvania \nemployers who have 45 or 47 or 48 employees. They are not subject to \nthe hugely expensive mandates of ObamaCare, and do my colleagues know \nwhat they tell me? They are not going to be subject to it. They will go \nto great lengths to avoid hiring the fiftieth employee. They will hire \ntemps. They will pursue automation. They will do all kinds of things \nthey wouldn't otherwise do because this government makes it too \nexpensive for them to hire a fiftieth employee. At a time when our \nworkforce participation rate is at a record low because so many people \nhave given up even trying to find work, ObamaCare makes it too \nexpensive for employers to hire new workers.\n  It has a similar effect on hours worked, because this 50-employee \ncount applies to anybody who works 30 hours or more, so one of the ways \na business can avoid these crippling costs is to cut back on the number \nof hours for their workers. That doesn't work out so well for somebody \nwho needs those hours to pay their bills to support their family. It is \nhappening all across the country.\n  Another aspect that is really outrageous is this mandate in ObamaCare \nthat employers must--regardless of whether the employees want it or \nnot--provide contraceptive and abortifacient coverage. One of the \nproblems with this is that these services run completely contrary to \ndeeply held religious views for a lot of people, faith-based \ninstitutions, and others. So the administration decided they will offer \nan accommodation for faith-based institutions. The accommodation they \noffer is pure sophistry. What they offered was to say you won't have \nto--you, the faith-based institution--you won't have to actually pay \nfor those services which you find objectionable based on your faith. \nYou won't have to pay for them, but you have to buy an insurance plan \nthat has them and the insurance company will just have to give you that \nfor free.\n  This is the most ridiculous thing in the world. Private companies \naren't in the business of offering their services for free. If there is \nan aspect of it that they supposedly have to give away, then they will \npass on the costs for the services they provide. Nobody is fooled by \nthis. This is yet another of the details of ObamaCare.\n  But, really, some of the biggest problems I have saved for the end, \nand that is the series of broken promises that ObamaCare constitutes. \nOne of the most glaring is this promise we have all heard. I don't know \nhow many times we have heard it, but we all have. We heard the \nPresident and so many of our Democratic colleagues who support this \nbill say: If you like your health plan, you can keep your health plan. \nLet's be very clear. Everybody who supported this bill who is familiar \nwith it--and that would certainly include the President of the United \nStates and my friends here--they knew from the beginning that was not \npossible. They knew that because the legislation was designed to \nprevent many people from keeping their health insurance. It was written \nfor that purpose, in part, because they had to. The whole point, or a \nbig part of the point of ObamaCare was to establish standards that the \ngovernment determined were appropriate, regardless of whether an \nindividual American thinks that a given plan is adequate or not or \nsuitable for herself or her family. It was up to the government to make \nthis decision, not the individual, and they would establish criteria, \nand if your plan didn't meet the criteria, your plan was going to be \ncanceled. That is in the legislation. That is codified. It always was. \nIt is at the heart of this legislation.\n  So for anybody to go around the country saying, If you like your \nhealth plan, you can keep your health plan, they were knowingly stating \nsomething that was completely untrue, was always untrue, and was \nnecessarily untrue. The examples abound.\n  I have emails from constituents. I have too many. I won't have a \nchance to run through them all this evening. I may have to come back on \nanother occasion. But I will share a few with my\n\n[[Page S8661]]\n\ncolleagues. This is from a small business owner from Lancaster County, \nPA. I got this just--I think I got this earlier today. I will just \nquote from this email from my constituent, addressed to me. It says:\n\n       As my Congressional representative, you need to know how \n     ObamaCare is harming my life and health care.\n       I work for a small construction company. My cost for family \n     health care was already over $11,000 per year. We received \n     notification that our policy was being canceled since it did \n     not comply with the requirements of the Affordable Care Act.\n       Our company looked for the best rates they could find for \n     comparable coverage which did comply. They chose a new \n     insurance company. We just recently were given the costs for \n     next year. My costs to cover myself and my family will be \n     over $17,500, a 59-percent increase. Even with that, the \n     deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums are higher. This is \n     not ``Affordable Care''. This would eat up a major part of my \n     income.\n       I attempted to log onto the healthcare.gov website several \n     times, but always get kicked out. I do not hold much hope \n     that I will get any better rates, because I don't qualify for \n     a credit.\n       We were already struggling to live on my take home pay. We \n     cannot afford to have it reduced by over $6,500.00. We may \n     have to drop coverage for my wife or kids, and pay the \n     penalty.\n       I suspect that this law will result in many more people \n     losing more health care, at the expense of a few getting free \n     or reduced cost healthcare.\n\n  I got this just a week ago from a man from Cumberland County, PA. He \nsaid:\n\n       My wife Barb and I have been trying for almost three weeks \n     now to get signed up. . . . all income and health info and \n     private information is on the unsecured web site and the \n     application is accepted . . . but we have not been able to \n     get on to pick the plan or get our price . . . so nobody has \n     been paid. Thus our canceled insurance ends on Dec. 31st and \n     we look to be out.\n       A BIG mistake by the folks who voted for this . . . I've \n     had cancer a couple times, my wife has had cancer and we both \n     see our doctors when needed. This ACA will ruin many families \n     if we can't get onto an insurance plan.\n\n  A woman from Lebanon County, PA, sent me this email a week ago. She \nsaid:\n\n       We had our healthcare discontinued, and after an appeal we \n     were able to get it reinstated, but only for this year. \n     Currently we have a health care savings plan with a \n     deductible of $3,000 a year. . . . In the new plan, our \n     deductible would increase to $12,000 . . . and our premiums \n     would increase to $9,000 a year. How is a middle class \n     married family supposed to pay for that?\n       This is absolutely ridiculous, and this is our situation. I \n     hope every government worker has to purchase their plan \n     through this plan.\n\n  Here is another. A man from Delaware County in southeastern \nPennsylvania:\n\n       I am 66 and I am on Medicare. My wife is 63. Her insurance \n     company canceled her ``longstanding'' policy due to the \n     requirements of the ACA. Her ``new'' policy costs $350 more \n     per month. We are on a strict budget. . . . We are the hard \n     working middle class. Who stands for us?\n\n  There was another promise we frequently heard, and that promise we \nfrequently heard was that if you like your doctor, you will be able to \nkeep your doctor. This too was known to be impossible. Since the law \nwas designed to discontinue health insurance plans and force people on \nto alternative plans, not all plans cover the same doctors. Certainly, \nsome were going to lose their coverage. Let me give an example of an \nemail I got from Westmoreland County just last week. She writes:\n\n       I have been self-employed for 13 years and have never been \n     without health insurance. 3 years ago I was diagnosed with \n     multiple sclerosis. Having an expensive preexisting condition \n     was not a problem for me as I had never let my insurance \n     lapse. My medications cost (without insurance) $4,000+ per \n     month. I received notice several weeks ago that they would \n     now cancel my plan and would do so as of Jan 1, and I had to \n     sign up for new coverage through the health insurance \n     exchange.\n\n  My staff reached out to this woman and tried to help and, after \nseveral attempts, she was able to access the exchange. Do my colleagues \nknow what she learned? She learned that in her region there were two \noptions available to her. One covers her doctors who have been treating \nher for her MS for years. The other covers her prescription drugs. \nNeither one covers both.\n  These are the kinds of decisions people are being forced to make all \nover America. They are the kinds of decisions people are being forced \nto make every day. It is the direct result of the loss of personal \nfreedom that this legislation imposes on people, and this is the topic \nthat we ought to be addressing in this body so we can pursue the only \nsolution, which is to repeal this bill and move health care in a \ncompletely different direction.\n  I believe my time has expired, so I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n          Fallen Firefighters Assistance Tax Clarification Act\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a particular \nincident that occurred in Webster, NY, a beautiful town near the City \nof Rochester.\n  On Christmas Eve, 2012, nearly 1 year ago today, the 125-member West \nWebster Volunteer Firemen's Association--a volunteer fire department \neast of Rochester, NY--faced an unimaginable tragedy when four of their \nbrave members were wounded, two fatally, when they responded to a fire \nbut instead faced an ambush of unspeakable proportions.\n  While many families across our Nation were waking up last Christmas \nEve morning to finish preparing Christmas dinner, shopping, wrapping \npresents, picking up the family from the airport, four Webster families \nwere instead confronting a heart-wrenching tragedy.\n  The call of a house on fire came into the West Webster Fire \nDepartment at 5:30 a.m. on December 24, and although it was a cold \nsnowy morning, still dark before the Sun rose, everyday heroes from the \nWest Webster Fire Department courageously did what they volunteered to \ndo on behalf of their neighbors and on behalf of their hometowns. They, \nsimilar to millions of brave volunteer firefighters throughout our \ncountry and throughout its history, left their homes and their families \nin safety to put out a fire that always creates danger.\n  This routine call turned into a tragedy which shocked the community, \npeople throughout the country, and even people throughout the world.\n  Firefighter Joseph Hofstetter, a 14-year volunteer for West Webster \nFire Department, arrived first on the scene. Firefighter Theodore \nScardino arrived soon after with LT Mike Chiapperini in a pumper truck, \nfollowed by 19-year-old firefighter Tomasz Kaczowka driving the \ndepartment's SUV.\n  What they did not know was that the fire was intentionally set by the \nhome's owner in order to lure these innocent firefighters into a \nsenseless sniper ambush. The sniper was hiding behind a berm amid the \nchaos of the fire and began shooting at the responding firefighters.\n  The firefighters were confused at first to hear popping sounds and \nthought it might be from the fire but LT Mike Chiapperini, who was also \na Webster police officer, knew better and shouted to his fellow \nvolunteers to take cover, but unfortunately it was too late.\n  Firefighter Hofstetter was shot in the pelvis while trying to alert \ndispatchers on the radio to the situation.\n  Ted Scardino was shot in the shoulder, and 5 minutes later he was \nshot again in the leg. The 16-year volunteer lay there while bleeding \nfor over an hour, enduring the December cold while sustaining second-\ndegree burns on his head as the fire now spread to consume six other \nneighboring homes.\n  Lieutenant Chiapperini and Firefighter Kaczowka both died in the \nambush.\n  As news of this horrific, senseless Christmas Eve tragedy spread, \nwell-meaning people from across the Rochester and Finger Lakes area, \nacross New York State, across the Nation and the world reached out to \nthe West Webster Volunteer Firemen's Association to offer support and \nprayers.\n  Thousands of incredibly generous people flooded the department with \ncountless financial contributions to support the volunteer department, \nto support the four firefighters--and in the case of Lieutenant \nChiapperini and Firefighter Kaczowka, to support the families they had \nleft behind.\n  Not realizing that collecting and distributing the funds to the \nfamilies would jeopardize the association's tax-exempt status with the \nIRS, the association accepted donations from generous people all around \nthe Nation wanting to help the four families who suffered the most on \nthat day.\n  They collected these donations for the victims, for their families, \nand they want to give these donations to\n\n[[Page S8662]]\n\nthe victims and their families. It defies reason that they would be \nunable to do so now because of a technicality in the Tax Code.\n  Just as we did after 9/11, and again after a similar fire department \ntragedy in California in 2006, it is our obligation to make sure the \nWest Webster Volunteer Firemen's Association can now disburse to these \nfamilies the contributions that their neighbors and unknown, countless, \ngenerous others wanted them to have.\n  As it is, the disbursement of these funds has been delayed for months \nand now almost 1 year. That is why I am asking the Senate to proceed \nwith consideration of the Fallen Firefighters Assistance Tax \nClarification Act.\n  This proposal merely clarifies--as we did after 9/11 and again after \nthe California tragedy in 2006--that the West Webster Volunteer Fire \nDepartment will not lose its status as a nonprofit association by \ndistributing the donations to these firefighters and their families.\n  As we again enter the Christmas season and approach the 1-year \nanniversary of this tragedy, now is the time to make this right.\n  We need to do it on behalf of the families of the fallen and the \ninjured. The family of 43-year-old LT Mike Chiapperini includes his \nwife Kim, his 19-year-old son Nick, and his daughters, 4-year-old Kacie \nand 3-year-old Kylie.\n  Known to many as Chip, Lieutenant Chiapperini was a West Webster Fire \nDepartment volunteer firefighter for 25 years. He was past chief of the \nWest Webster Fire Department and adviser for its Fire Explorer Post. He \nalso served with distinction for 19 years as a police officer with the \nWebster Police Department and rose through the ranks as a dispatcher, \npolice officer, investigator, sergeant, and lieutenant. In short, he \ncommitted his entire life to public service for the town of Webster.\n  Likewise, 19-year-old firefighter Tomasz Kaczowka left behind his \nparents Janina and Marian Kaczowka, along with his older twin brothers \nand a large extended family. Firefighter Kaczowka was selflessly \ndevoted to his family and his community. In fact, he was not even \nsupposed to be on duty that Christmas Eve but elected to make the shift \nso that older department members could be home with their families that \nday.\n  The surviving firefighters, Ted Scardino and Joseph Hofstetter, have \nhad to endure long rehabilitations for their injuries and their \nfamilies have had to deal with life's ordinary challenges and day-to-\nday expenses as Ted and Joseph recover and move forward with their \nlives.\n  The fact is, ordinary Americans, moved by the heroic sacrifice of \nthese volunteer firefighters, have offered their generous support. They \nhave intended their contributions to help these families in the wake of \nthe tragedy and in recognition of the service of these brave \nfirefighters.\n  These were volunteer firefighters--volunteers. I know many of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle are well acquainted with the \nvolunteer fire service. Many may even have a membership in a volunteer \nfire company themselves.\n  You all know men and women just like the members of West Webster. \nThey are the epitome of the American spirit.\n  The French observer de Tocqueville was taken by that spirit when he \nvisited America and the Rochester area in 1831 and thought voluntarism \nwas one of the things that set America apart from the rest of the \nworld. That was true then. It is still true today.\n  These heroes do not ask for anything. They just want to protect their \nneighbors and their community. It is just plain wrong that they would \nlose their not-for-profit status simply for being a passthrough to \nconvey donations to these families after an unspeakable tragedy.\n  In that same spirit, I had hoped to request unanimous consent this \nevening to move forward with the consideration of this legislation. Who \ncould object? Who could object? However, I understand that some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle object to me making the \nrequest at this time. Therefore, I will withhold that request this \nevening and sincerely hope my colleagues will think about this \novernight and allow us to proceed with consideration tomorrow. It is, \nindeed, the right thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my colleague \nfrom New York. He has been a tireless champion for the terrific, \ndedicated, self-sacrificing firefighters of New York City.\n  Tonight we are on the floor addressing the question of whether we \nshould confirm Cornelia Pillard as a candidate for the DC Circuit \nCourt. She is a law scholar with a long track record of public service. \nShe served twice in the Justice Department and successfully defended \nthe Family and Medical Leave Act, a crucial piece of legislation for \nworking families. She now teaches law at Georgetown University, one of \nthe top law schools in the Nation.\n  The truth is, she is an extremely well-qualified nominee who will be \nan excellent addition to the DC Circuit Court. She has personally \nargued and briefed Supreme Court cases brought or defended by \ngovernment lawyers from Republican administrations, and Republican-\nappointed Justices have often authored majority opinions in her favor.\n  She is currently the codirector of the Supreme Court Institute at \nGeorgetown Law, where she personally assists lawyers preparing for the \nSupreme Court on a pro bono, first-come basis, without regard to which \nside they represent.\n  In fact, Professor Pillard chaired the American Bar Association \nReading Committee that reviewed Samuel Alito's writings during his \nnomination process for the Supreme Court. Her committee's assessment \nled the ABA to give Justice Alito their highest rating of ``well-\nqualified.''\n  Professor Pillard's unbiased approach to the law has won the respect \nof her colleagues in law and in government, including former Department \nof Justice officials in Republican administrations who have endorsed \nher nomination to the DC Circuit.\n  In short, Professor Pillard is a fairminded, highly accomplished \nlitigator, with an outstanding reputation for public service.\n  Then why are we here now, after midnight, carrying on this debate? To \nget to the root of that question, we have to examine the dysfunction \nthat is present in the Senate.\n  Virtually all Americans know Congress is not working well. Virtually \nall Americans know the Senate is broken. I saw a poll that said 92 \npercent of Americans believe Congress is dysfunctional, and I wondered: \nWhat is wrong with the other 8 percent? They must not be paying \nattention. Because what we have experienced in the Senate is a \ncontinuous campaign of obstruction and paralysis of the normal \nproceedings.\n  There was a time when we had a Senate that had a core principle, \nwhich was up-or-down votes, with rare exception--up-or-down votes, with \nrare exception. That was the tradition of the Senate. That tradition \nwas rooted in the courtesy--the courtesy--of hearing out every Senator \nwho wished to share their opinion on a topic before the Senate would \nmake a decision.\n  Maybe that was something easier to do when there were only 26 Members \nof the Senate. We now have 100 Members of the Senate. So maybe it takes \na while to hear the opinions of every Member, but still that courtesy \nhas been honored through the years. But the counterpart to that is that \nfolks knew in the end the Senate, with very rare exception, would get \nto a simple majority vote. The entire structure of our Constitution and \nthe vision of our Founders was that this body would make decisions with \na simple majority vote.\n  Recall, if you will, that the Founders put into the Constitution \nspecial occasions for a supermajority. Those special occasions were \nthings such as overriding a Presidential veto. Those special occasions \nwere things such as reviewing a treaty. But they envisioned a simple \nmajority vote for the legislature because they felt the majority \ndecision most of the time would be a better direction to go than the \nminority opinion. That is the principle of democracy. The direction \nthat most Senators believe is the correct direction is the basis for \ngoing forward.\n  This principle has been completely lost in the last few years. A \nsmall\n\n[[Page S8663]]\n\ngroup of Senators decided they should replace the constitutional \nprinciple of a simple majority with a supermajority, that virtually \nevery action would be subject to a requirement to have 60 votes to \nclose debate rather than the constitutional 51.\n  This has been applied in ways American citizens cannot even imagine. \nLet's take motions to proceed. A motion to proceed simply says it is \ntime to take up this bill. Let's vote yes or no on taking up this bill. \nThat is the motion to proceed.\n  But in recent times the minority has said: You know what. We can use \nthis motion to proceed as an opportunity to paralyze the Senate. We can \nobject to having that simple majority vote, and then we can deny--there \nbeing this supermajority to close debate--even if we have nothing to \nsay, and we can simply waste the Senate's time on debating whether to \ndebate.\n  I have argued for a long time that this abuse must end. It is time to \nget rid of the filibuster on this motion to proceed. But nonetheless we \nhave it and my colleagues in this permanent campaign to paralyze the \nSenate have chosen to exercise this filibuster, if you will, this \nsupermajority requirement, simply on a motion to debate an issue as \nopposed to actually being in debate.\n  Let's take conference committees. It was extraordinarily rare for \nconference committees--the formation of them--to be subject to a \nsupermajority in the history of the Senate. Conference committees were \nvery common in the seventies and eighties. I was first here as an \nintern in 1976 with Senator Hatfield, here on Capitol Hill working for \nCongress in the 1980s.\n  If one Chamber of Congress and the other Chamber had both passed a \nbill, well then automatically you had a conference committee meet and \nresolve the differences. That is just common sense. Why would you delay \nthat for a second? But when I came to the Senate in 2009 as a Senator, \nI was mystified to discover that conference committees were not being \nheld. So I inquired why that was. The answer was that the minority had \ndecided to use the filibuster, the supermajority, on establishing a \nconference committee; in other words, block the House and Senate from \neven talking to each other to resolve differences between two houses.\n  That drove the debate out of the public realm, in a public room with \na TV camera, into private discussions as negotiators tried to resolve \nand develop a common version of the bill. There too I proposed that we \nneed to get rid of this filibuster on conference committees. It is \ndisrespectful of the most valuable commodity of this body; that is, \ntime; that is, time is wasted on filibusters on whether to start a \ndiscussion with the House when both the House and Senate have passed a \nversion of the bill.\n  Then, of course, we have the ongoing campaign of subjecting virtually \nevery nomination to a supermajority. In fact, in the history of \nAmerica, in the entire history, before President Obama, only three \ntimes was there a filibuster of a district court nominee. But in the \ntime President Obama has been in office, we have had 20 filibusters of \ndistrict court nominees. Only 3 in our history until President Obama is \nPresident and then 20 filibusters when he became President until now--\n20 out of 23.\n  That is just a pure deliberate campaign of paralysis and obstruction, \nundermining the contribution of this body, its responsibility as a \nlegislative body. It is not only judicial nominees, it is executive \nnominees as well. In our entire history as a nation, 168 nominations \nhave been filibustered--168 in our entire history--82 of them have been \nnominations by President Obama; 82 nominees just in the 5 years \nPresident Obama has been in office out of the 168 in our entire \nhistory. So we see, whether we are looking at motions to proceed or \nconference committees or judicial nominees or executive nominees, a \ncampaign of deliberate paralysis and obstruction rather than a \ndedication to serving our Nation as the Constitution requires.\n  Indeed, some have justified this ongoing paralysis. Some of my \ncolleagues have said: But remember, President Washington said the \nSenate should be a cooling saucer. That concept is that you have a cup \nof hot tea, and it is too hot to drink, you pour it into a saucer, it \ncools and then it is just right.\n  President Washington would never recognize this strategy of \nobstruction and paralysis as legitimate under the U.S. Constitution. \nIndeed, there were elements designed to make this body deliberative. \nBut there is a difference between deliberation and the destruction of \nthe legislative process. There is a difference between a cooling \nsaucer, thoughtful deliberation, and a deep freeze.\n  But certain Members of this body have decided they did not come here \nto fulfill the constitutional vision of the Senate as a deliberative \nbody, they instead have come to paralyze the function of this body, to \nobstruct this body.\n  So there we see it in the filibuster of the conference committees, in \nthe filibuster of the motions to proceed, in the filibuster of the \nexecutive branch nominees, filibuster of the judicial nominees, and, of \ncourse, the filibuster of legislation that has reached extraordinary \nlevels never seen in the history of our Nation.\n  Just a little while ago one of my colleagues chose to quote Alexander \nHamilton in defense of this strategy of paralysis. I would encourage my \ncolleague to actually read more of Alexander Hamilton because he \nactually directly addressed this question of filibusters and the \npotential to obstruct the will of the majority.\n  What did Alexander Hamilton say? He said: The real operation of the \nfilibuster ``is to embarrass the administration, to destroy the energy \nof government, and to substitute the pleasure, caprice or artifices of \na significant, insignificant, turbulent or corrupt junta, to the \nregular deliberations and decisions of a respectable majority.\n  He went on to say: When the majority must conform to the views of the \nminority, the consequence is ``tedious delays, continual negotiation \nand intrigue, contemptible compromises of the public good.''\n  That is a pretty good description of what Americans see happening in \nthis Chamber as a result of the deliberate campaign of paralysis and \nobstruction: tedious delays, continual intrigue, contemptible \ncompromises of the public good.\n  Many in this Chamber have tried to reason and convey to Members that \nwe should return to the tradition of the Senate, up-or-down votes with \nrare exception. In 2005 it was the Democrats in the minority and it was \nthe Republicans who were in the majority. At that time the Democrats \ndecided to filibuster a series of judicial nominees. So this was \ncertainly a tactic employed by both Democrats and Republicans.\n  Our Republican friends who were in the majority said: That is not \nacceptable. They said: That is not consistent with the philosophy of \nup-or-down votes with rare exception. They said that is not consistent \nwith the power vested in the Constitution and the President to be able \nto place forward his nominees for consideration under the advice and \nconsent clause of the Constitution.\n  Our Republican colleagues were persuasive. The Democrats in the \nminority agreed not to filibuster judges except under rare exceptions, \nexceptions of extraordinary flaws of character and experience. Then the \nclock turned. We came to 2009. Now we have a Democratic President and \nDemocratic majority. The deal that was cut in 2005, agreed to by both \nsides, that there would be only rare filibusters based on exceptional \nflaws of character or experience disappeared. It disappeared \ncompletely. The new minority did not honor the deal that had been \nnegotiated in 2005.\n  So come January 2011, there was a debate on this floor about trying \nto again restore the traditional understanding, up-or-down votes with \nrare exception. There was a deal made. It did not last but a few weeks. \nThen there was another attempt in January 2013. On this occasion, there \nwas a promise made on the floor of the Senate. The minority leader came \nto the floor and said: The Republicans will return to the norms and \ntraditions of the Senate regarding nominations.\n  What are those norms and traditions? Those norms and traditions are a \nsimple majority vote with rare exception. Within weeks, that promise \nwas completely shattered. The first ever filibuster in U.S. history of \na Defense nominee, ironically a former colleague from the Republican \nside of the aisle.\n  Then we had 43 Senators write a letter and say they would not allow \nanyone to be confirmed for the position as\n\n[[Page S8664]]\n\nDirector of the Consumer Federal Protection Bureau, certainly \ninconsistent with up-or-down votes with rare exception for issues of \ncharacter.\n  Then there was another big effort in July of 2013, just earlier this \nyear. We all got together in the Old Senate Chamber and we shared our \nfrustrations and our views. Again, the promise was put forward: We will \nstop filibustering except under rare circumstances related to character \nor qualifications.\n  Well, that was terrific.\n  We had confirmation of the person who was awaiting to be Director of \nthe Environmental Protection Agency, Gina McCarthy. We had confirmation \nof the person who had been waiting for a very long time as the nominee \nof the Labor Department, Tom Perez. We had the confirmation of the \nfolks who had been waiting to be confirmed to the National Labor \nRelations Board. In fact, I think that was the first time we had all \nfive members Senate confirmed in 10 years.\n  We had the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, \nRichard Cordray was finally confirmed. Shortly thereafter, we had \nSamantha Powers confirmed to the United Nations, and so forth. The norm \nwas restored but only for a couple of weeks.\n  Then came the nomination of Mel Watt to head the Federal Housing \nFinance Agency. Suddenly the commitment for up-or-down votes \ndisappeared. Then we had a whole new strategy on the judiciary. This \nstrategy had never been experienced in U.S. history. It was: No matter \nwhom President Obama nominates for the DC Circuit Court, we are going \nto block that nominee because we only want to leave in place the \nnominees that were put in place by President Bush.\n  That is in direct contravention of the vision of the Constitution \nwhere each President as elected has the power to nominate. This Chamber \nis a check. It gets to vote up or down and decide whether they should \nbe in office. But this was a deliberate strategy to pack the Court, to \nsay that when a President of my party is in power, there will be up-or-\ndown votes, as was insisted in 2005 when the tables were turned, but \nwhen the President is of the other party, we are going to have a \nperpetual campaign and we are going to block up-or-down votes.\n  Let's picture down the road and the new President is a Republican \nPresident. Is there truly any Member here who would say, from the \nRepublican side, that when the Republican President is in place, they \nwere still going to believe they should not fill vacancies on key \ncourts around this country?\n  It is too bad this campaign of paralysis has been allowed to go on so \nlong. We should have acted long before to fulfil our responsibility to \nhave a deliberative body because that is what legislation is. It is \ndoing enormous damage to the United States of America. First, because \nof the paralysis, we are not doing the work we should be on \nlegislation. We are not addressing the big issues facing America. There \nare all kinds of job creation bills that have not been able to get to \nthis floor because they have not been able to get through the gauntlet \nof paralyzing filibusters that have been laid down.\n  Americans actually want to work. Americans want to have living-wage \njobs. They expect us to act, to make that happen, not to paralyze this \ninstitution so it is unable to do so. Indeed, in addition, we are \ndamaging the view of the United States around the world because it used \nto be the world looked to the United States and said: Look how well \ntheir Congress works. They had this Great Depression. They took on and \nfixed all kinds of flaws in their financial system. They established \ninsurance for bank accounts so there would not be runs on the banks. \nThey replaced a flawed mortgage strategy, which involved callable \nballoon mortgages, with noncallable fully amortizing mortgages so we \ndid not create a series of dominoes.\n  They took and created organizations, the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, to oversee stock markets so folks could have faith, invest \nin stocks, and put their capital in knowing there was a very good \nchance that capital would be well utilized because there were \naccounting standards and qualifications that block predatory practices \non Wall Street.\n  The world saw the U.S. respond to World War II and convert our \neconomy through enormous amounts of legislation in a single year to \napply it to the war effort and take on the big challenge of defeating \nthe Nazis.\n  Then the world saw America use its legislative power to build the \nlargest middle class the world has ever seen. Those living wage jobs, \nevery one of them means a foundation for a family. If we want to talk \nfamily values, then fight to have this body, this Senate, work on \nlegislation that creates living-wage jobs. Quit paralyzing the Senate.\n  Then we have, of course, the fact of this new strategy in these \nrecent months, a deliberate attack on the balance of powers. The \nConstitution envisioned three branches in balance. It has no hint of \nany kind that a minority of one branch should be able to undermine the \noperation of the other two branches. Some colleagues have seized upon a \nstrategy of trying to undermine the integrity of our judiciary. Some \ncolleagues have seized on a strategy of trying to undermine the \ncapability of the elected executive branch, the President and his \nexecutive branch.\n  Read your history--balance of powers, not the ability of the minority \nor one branch to undermine the success of the other two branches. We \nneed these three branches each doing their assigned roles.\n  We are at this point after this long set of strategies of paralysis, \non motions to proceed, on legislation, on conference committees, on \nexecutive branch nominees, on judicial nominees. We have taken the \nfirst step toward restoring the function of the Senate, and we have \nsaid we should return to the notion of up-and-down votes as envisioned \nunder advise and consent. This is as envisioned by Alexander Hamilton \nand the other Founders who railed against the notion that a minority \nwould be able to block the will of a majority in the Chamber.\n  We have done that with nominations. In a continuation of a strategy \nof paralysis, we are here tonight rather than having voted much earlier \nin the day. Instead of working on legislation that would create jobs, \nwe are standing here through a series of nominations as the minority \ninsists on wasting the valuable commodity of time in this Chamber.\n  I hope my colleagues who are intent upon creating this huge imbalance \nbetween the branches will reconsider, that they will decide they want \nto see this Chamber become what it was when I was first here in the \n1970s and when I worked for Congress in the 1980s, a great deliberative \nbody. What it was when we took on the Great Depression, what it was \nwhen we took on World War II, what it was when we built the great \nmiddle class, this is what the United States wants to see. May we make \nit so.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, tonight we will vote on the nomination of \nNina Pillard to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. On \nTuesday, we were finally able to invoke cloture on her nomination, \nafter it had been unjustifiably filibustered by Senate Republicans for \nnearly 3 months after being favorably voted out of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. The DC Circuit is often considered to be the second most \nimportant court in the Nation and should be operating at full strength. \nWe are finally taking another step towards making this Court operate at \nfull strength for the American people.\n  Nina Pillard is an accomplished litigator whose work includes 9 \nSupreme Court oral arguments, and briefs in more than 25 Supreme Court \ncases. She drafted the Federal Government's brief in United States v. \nVirginia, which after a 7 to 1 decision by the Supreme Court made \nhistory by opening the Virginia Military Institute's doors to female \nstudents and expanded educational opportunity for women across the \ncountry. Since then, hundreds of women have had the opportunity to \nattend VMI and go on to serve our country.\n  She has not only stood up for equal opportunities for women, but for \nmen as well. In Nevada v. Hibbs, Ms. Pillard successfully represented a \nmale employee of the State of Nevada who was fired when he tried to \ntake unpaid leave under the Family Medical Leave Act to care for his \nsick wife. In a 6 to 3 opinion authored by then-Chief Justice William \nRehnquist, the Supreme Court ruled for her client, recognizing\n\n[[Page S8665]]\n\nthat the law protects both men and women in their caregiving roles \nwithin the family.\n  She has also worked at the Department of Justice as the Deputy \nAssistant Attorney General in the Office of Legal Counsel, an office \nthat advises on the most complex constitutional issues facing the \nexecutive branch. And prior to that, Ms. Pillard litigated numerous \ncivil rights cases as an assistant counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense & \nEducational Fund. At Georgetown Law, Ms. Pillard teaches advanced \ncourses on constitutional law and civil procedure, and co-directs the \nlaw school's Supreme Court Institute. She has earned the American Bar \nAssociation's highest possible ranking--Unanimously Well Qualified--to \nserve as a Federal appellate judge on the DC Circuit.\n  Today, however, I have heard some unfortunate and unfair attacks on \nthis fine woman. I have heard comments that she would be ``the most \nleft wing judge'' in U.S. history; that she has extreme views on \nabortion and religious liberty; and that she would ``rubber stamp'' the \nmost radical legislative and regulatory proposals. One might expect \nthese outrageous accusations to come from right wing fringe groups, but \nto hear some of these outlandish accusations on the Senate floor is \nunfortunate.\n  So let me clear the record. Nina Pillard is one of the finest \nnominees we have had before this body. On the issue of abortion, \nRepublicans have cherry picked quotes and taken them out of context to \ntry to paint her as someone she is not. The truth is that taken as a \nwhole, her writings have focused on bridging the gap between pro-life \nand pro-choice advocates by ``finding common ground for ways to reduce \nreliance on abortion.''\n  More importantly, I cannot ignore the double standard of certain \nSenators on the issue of abortion. In 2002, the Senate unanimously \nconfirmed President Bush's nomination of Michael McConnell to the Tenth \nCircuit by voice vote. Professor McConnell argued that Roe v. Wade was \nwrongly decided and urged the Supreme Court to overturn it. He \napplauded a Federal judge for refusing to convict anti-abortion \nprotestors, even though they had clearly violated the law, because of \nhis sympathetic reading of the defendants' motives.\n  Similarly, in 2002, the Senate confirmed William Pryor to the \nEleventh Circuit, even though he called Roe v. Wade the ``worst \nabomination in the history of constitutional law.'' Another President \nBush nominee, J. Leon Holmes, was confirmed to the Federal district \ncourt in Arkansas, even though he had argued that abortion should be \nbanned even in case of rape because pregnancy from rape is as uncommon \nas ``snowfall in Miami.'' He had also written that wives should be \nsubmissive to their husbands. He was not filibustered. He was \nconfirmed.\n  Each of these judicial nominees stated under oath in testimony before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee that they could set aside their personal \nbeliefs and would interpret the law consistent with the Constitution \nand Supreme Court precedent. They were confirmed. Nina Pillard \ntestified under the same oath that, ``A judge's opinions and views \nshould have no role in interpreting the Constitution.'' Are we to \nbelieve that only judicial nominees who do not support a woman's access \nto abortion services are able to set aside their personal views to be \nfair and impartial judges? I cannot help but notice the glaring double \nstandard that is imposed on Nina Pillard.\n  On the issue of religious liberty, Senate Republicans continue to \nmisrepresent comments Ms. Pillard made about the possible outcome of a \nSupreme Court case to suggest she is hostile to religious freedom. In a \n2011 briefing to educate the press on legal issues in Hosanna Tabor v. \nEEOC, she described the issue in the case, identified what was \ndifficult about it, and offered a prediction of how the Court might \nresolve it. Her prediction turned out to be wrong.\n  If Senators, who have also sworn to uphold the Constitution, were \nheld accountable every time they incorrectly predicted the outcome of a \nSupreme Court case, I am not sure how many of us would be left. \nUltimately, she has testified that if confirmed she would uphold the \nSupreme Court's precedent on the issue.\n  The suggestion that Ms. Pillard will be ``the most left-wing judge in \nthe history'' is simply outlandish hyperbole, as demonstrated by the \nbipartisan support she has received. Viet Dinh, the former Assistant \nAttorney General for the Office of Legal Policy under President George \nW. Bush, wrote in a letter of support for her nomination that ``Based \non our long and varied professional experience together, I know that \nProfessor Pillard is exceptionally bright, a patient and unbiased \nlistener, and a lawyer of great judgment and unquestioned integrity. . \n. Nina has always been fair, reasonable, and sensible in her judgments. \n. . She is a fair-minded thinker with enormous respect for the law and \nfor the limited, and essential, role of the federal appellate judge--\nqualities that make her well prepared to take on the work of a D.C. \nFederal Judge.''\n  Former FBI Director and Chief Judge of the Western District of Texas \nWilliam Sessions has written that her ``rare combination of experience, \nboth defending and advising government officials, and representing \nindividuals seeking to vindicate their rights, would be especially \nvaluable in informing her responsibilities as a judge.''\n  Nina Pillard has also received letters of support from 30 former \nmembers of the U.S. Armed Forces, including 8 retired generals; 25 \nformer Federal prosecutors and other law enforcement officials; 40 \nSupreme Court practitioners, including Laurence Tribe and Carter \nPhillips, among many others.\n  Despite having filled nearly half of law school classrooms for the \nlast 20 years, women are grossly underrepresented on our Federal \ncourts. We need women on the Federal bench. A vote to end this \nfilibuster is a vote to break yet another barrier and move in the \nhistoric direction of having our Federal appellate courts more \naccurately reflect the gender balance of the country.\n  I commend President Obama on his nominations of highly qualified \nwomen like Nina Pillard, Patricia Millett, Elena Kagan and Sonia \nSotomayor. In each of these women, the Senate has had the opportunity \nto vote to confirm women practicing at the pinnacle of the legal \nprofession. Once the Senate confirmed Justice Kagan, the highest court \nin the land had more women than ever before serving on its bench. With \nthe confirmation and appointment of Nina Pillard, the same will be true \nfor what many consider to be the second highest court in the land, the \nDC Circuit because she will be the fifth active female judge on the \ncourt. Never before have five women jurists actively served on that \ncourt at one time. I look forward to that moment and to further \nincreasing the diversity of our Federal bench.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to confirm this outstanding nominee. \nThis Nation would be better off for Nina Pillard serving as a judge on \nthe DC Circuit.\n  Today, the Senate will also vote on the nominations of Elizabeth A. \nWolford, of New York, to be U.S. District Judge for the Western \nDistrict of New York; Landya B. McCafferty, of New Hampshire, to be \nU.S. District Judge for the District of New Hampshire; Brian Morris, of \nMontana, to be U.S. District Judge for the District of Montana; and \nSusan P. Watters, of Montana, to be U.S. District Judge for the \nDistrict of Montana.\n  Senate Republicans have continued to abuse the filibuster and \nrequired cloture to confirm all four of these noncontroversial district \ncourt nominees. All four of these nominees were reported unanimously by \nvoice vote from the Senate Judiciary Committee. They all have the \nsupport of their home State senators. With the filibuster of these four \ndistrict court nominees, Senate Republicans have now filibustered 24 of \nPresident Obama's district court nominees. Not a single district court \nnominee was filibustered under President Bush's 8 years in office. I \nhope Senate Republicans come around so that we can work together to \nmeet the needs of our Federal judiciary so that the American people can \nhave the justice system they deserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. SCOTT. To change the rules our friends on the left had to break \nthe rules. We are here tonight because the Obama administration and our \nfriends on the left needed a distraction by invoking the nuclear option \nleading up to the vote on Nina Pillard of the DC Circuit. They are \nattempting to quiet a disaster of their own making.\n\n[[Page S8666]]\n\n  Please note that this is a court that will hear the ACA disputes. It \nwas easy enough for them to paint a rosy picture of life after \nObamaCare. For 3 years they did it, and they did their best to do so, \nbut words could only go so far and no speech will help the failed \nimplementation of the monster they have created.\n  Health care premiums for the average American family have already \ngone up by $2,500 since ObamaCare has become law. I wish to say that \none more time. The average premium that an American family will have to \nface and then pay is $2,500.\n  As costs continue to rise for middle-class Americans, the median \nhousehold income has dropped by more than $3,600 under President Obama. \nIf we take $2,500 and add in the drop of income of $3,600, the \ndifference for the average American household under President Obama's \nwatch is significant. That doesn't even take into consideration the \nskyrocketing costs and the increasing deductibles under ObamaCare.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal, the average individual \ndeductible for what is called a Bronze plan on the exchange, the \nlowest-priced coverage is a $5,000 average deductible. This is 42 \npercent higher than the average deductible today of $3,589 one would \ncurrently purchase in 2013.\n  Tell me how this helps those in need. How does this help the most \nvulnerable in our society? The answer is simple. It doesn't.\n  We are here because Democrats need a break from having this pointed \nout to them again and again as newspapers, magazines, and TV stations \nhave been doing for the last several weeks.\n  In South Carolina we have about 4.7 million people and 600,000 or \n700,000 folks do not have health insurance coverage. Think about that. \nThere are 4.7 million South Carolinians, of which about 700,000 today \ndo not have health insurance.\n  Under ObamaCare, we would hope that the number would go down, not up, \nthat it would go down from 700,000 to 600,000 or 500,000 or 400,000. \nOver 430,000 of the 700,000 people are eligible for ObamaCare. The \nnumber is not going down. The number is going up because 150,000 South \nCarolinians have received cancellation notices.\n  Let us frame that a little bit. We have 700,000 uninsured, of which \n430,000 are eligible for ObamaCare. Instead of seeing the number of \nuninsured go from 700,000 down to 600,000 or 500,000 or 400,000, we \nhave seen the number go up because 150,000 people have received \ncancellation notices--150,000 South Carolinians have received \ncancellation notices.\n  Someone would obviously ask the question: How many folks have signed \nup for ObamaCare in South Carolina?\n  If 430,000 South Carolinians are eligible to sign up, we ought to \nanswer the question of how many have signed up.\n  As of late November, only 600 South Carolinians have successfully \nsigned up for ObamaCare. This means that under the implementation \nprocess of what some consider the solution to America's woes on health \ninsurance, only 600 South Carolinians have been able to successfully \nsign up for ObamaCare, even though 430,000 are eligible and 700,00 do \nnot have insurance. Only 600 of them have been able to sign up for \nObamaCare.\n  When we think about those numbers, it reminds me of the challenges we \nface with going through the process of seeing the DC Circuit Court \nstacked to hear the disputes.\n  Part of the challenge we see is that ObamaCare hasn't worked, so \nstacking the court seems that it is the most likely option for our \nfriends on the left.\n  When we started out having these conversations about ObamaCare, we \nstarted a conversation about those who are uninsured. I think every \nAmerican in our country wants to see greater access to health \ninsurance.\n  The vast majority of Americans do not want to see the government take \nit over, and now we understand why. In 2009--not 1999, but 2009--we had \nestimated for the unaffordable care act around $900 billion. In 2011 \nthey came back and said: Wait, wait, I need to take another look at \nthis.\n  The estimate came back at $1.8 trillion. In 2009, it was $900 billion \nand in 2011 the number had already increased to $1.8 trillion or a 100-\npercent increase in the estimated cost of the Affordable Care Act.\n  Only 2 more years later we could see that the number could perhaps \neclipse $3 trillion. All we are talking about is the up-front pricetag, \nthe price of ObamaCare on the front. We haven't delved into the actual \ncost of ObamaCare because those estimates say that on the back end of \nthe Affordable Care Act we are going to see a $7 trillion increase or \naddition to our debt.\n  We started in 2009 with $900 billion; in 2011, $1.8 trillion; in \n2013, perhaps over $3 trillion, adding $7 trillion to the deficit. That \nis not the whole picture.\n  Families in South Carolina still have to struggle with finding access \nto affordable health care, and ObamaCare is not simply providing the \naccess. We see families such as the Hucks, the everyday American \nfamily. Mr. Hucks loves his family. He is in Greenville, SC. He loves \nhis family. He spends 12 to 14 hours a day working as a financial \nadviser in South Carolina.\n  Mr. Hucks, unfortunately, faces the challenge of buying health \ninsurance through ObamaCare. As he went through the process of trying \nto figure out what would happen--certainly he liked his coverage, but, \nof course, he can't keep it, period. He can't keep it. He cannot keep \nhis coverage.\n  As I was talking to Jason Hucks in Greenville 2 weeks ago, Jason \ncurrently has a Blue Cross Blue Shield high-deductible plan. Remember \nthe word ``deductible'' because we will come back and have a \nconversation about deductibles. He has a high-deductible plan that \ncovers him, his wife, and their two cute little boys.\n  Instead of having a conversation between Mr. and Mrs. Hucks about \nplanning for the college education of those two fine young men, they \nare having instead a conversation about whether they can afford the \nhealth care coverage.\n  What has happened? Let us take a look. Their current plan was a \n$10,000 deductible that cost them over $415 a month.\n  To stay on the Blue Cross Blue Shield plan under ObamaCare, Mr. Hucks \nand his family would have to pay nearly $1,000 a month--$895--almost \n$1,000 a month, more than doubling the premium. They will see their \ndeductible increase by 150 percent.\n  A deductible that was $10,000 is pretty high, significantly high. It \nwill go to $25,000 for this young family of four. That doesn't seem \nright to me; it doesn't seem fair.\n  We believe in fairness. For those who are most vulnerable, having \naccess to $25,000 before their health insurance company is able to \nstart paying is quite a high price to pay. Digging into your savings \naccount for $25,000--because ObamaCare takes their $10,000 deductible, \nand not the $15,000, not the $20,000, but the $25,000--is simply not \nfair. This is not how we treat the most vulnerable in our society, by \nseeing their deductible go up by 150 percent. I simply don't \nunderstand. It is just wrong. It is not right.\n\n  Even if they were willing to switch companies, he would still see his \nrates rise almost 75 percent and his deductible would still rise from \n$10,000 to $12,000. No wonder they are trying to stack the DC courts. \nWe see here a young family not planning for a 529 plan, not planning to \nsend their kids to Clinton University or the University of South \nCarolina, but instead they are planning on tightening their belts \nbecause they have to have a budget that plans for not a $10,000 \ndeductible but a $12,000 deductible, with a 20-percent increase in the \ndeductible and a 75-percent increase in the cost. This is the effect of \nthe Affordable Care Act. It becomes unaffordable for the average \nAmerican family.\n  As for a plan with copays, Mr. Hucks says flatly that he can't afford \nto have a conversation about copays because a plan with a copay would \nskyrocket his premiums from $415 or so to as high as $1,200 or $1,500 a \nmonth. So instead of being able to go see a doctor and have a \nconversation and pay a 20-percent copay, instead of having the \nopportunity to do what many of us have been doing for the last decade-\nplus--pay a $15 or $20 or $25 or $30 copay when you go see your \ndoctor--he has to first satisfy a deductible of not $15,000 but now a \n$25,000 deductible. This is higher than $15,000. This is wrong. It is \nnot right.\n  Mr. Hucks' family is an example of how it is not just premiums that \nare\n\n[[Page S8667]]\n\nrising but deductibles are going through the roof. This is painful for \na family who should be planning for college but instead is planning to \nspend more money on their health care because the Affordable Care Act \nis so unaffordable.\n  The New York Times recently quoted someone faced with this problem as \nsaying the deductibles were so high--$4,000 to $6,000 a year--that it \nvery much defeats the purpose of having insurance. I wonder why we say \nthat. Well, think about it for a minute or two. Think about a family \nwho has a $4,000 deductible. What does that mean to the average family, \nwhere Americans are spending over 100 percent of their income? What \nthat means to the average family is they have to figure out how to pay \n$4,000 for visiting their doctors, getting their x rays, and having \neverything done at the doctor's office, getting their blood work done, \nbefore they can satisfy that $4,000 deductible and their health \ninsurance plan starts paying. Under ObamaCare, one would think that \nnumber would go down, but it doesn't. It goes up. As a matter of fact, \nit goes up quickly in the first year of ObamaCare. It goes from an \naverage out-of-pocket expense of $63.50 to over $12,000--not $4,000, \nnot $5,000, not $6,000 but over $12,000 in out-of-pocket expenses.\n  So I am looking forward to the day we have a serious conversation \nabout a free market solution that would reduce the cost of health \ninsurance and at the exact same time create greater access for the \naverage person in America to afford a free market health insurance \npolicy. That is where we need to go. That is where the conversation \nshould be. Instead of having that conversation, we are having a \nconversation about deductibles jumping $5,000, out-of-pocket expenses \ngoing up significantly. And I should have said that when you combine \nthe out-of-pocket expenses and the deductibles, the out-of-pocket total \nfor a year is the $12,000. The average deductible is a little over \n$5,000.\n  We are talking about a significant taking from the average American \nfamily--taking their money out of their pockets in the form of \ndeductibles, taking money out of their pockets in the form of copays. \nAnd God forbid they actually go outside of the network. In many of \nthese plans, we are talking about zero coverage out of network for \nambulatory care. A family would bear 100 percent of the cost. So don't \ntravel to the wrong place with the wrong plan at the wrong time. You \nwill find yourself stuck without benefits because, unfortunately, the \nACA isn't affordable for most Americans. I find that sad.\n  We think we are having a conversation about nominees here today, and \nwe think we are having a conversation about nominees because President \nObama has somehow, some way been treated differently than President \nBush and other folks. But the facts are simply inconsistent with the \nreality of the alternate universe that has been created by the left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All postcloture time has expired.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are going to have a confirmation vote on \nCornelia Pillard. That will be the first vote. Then we are going to \nhave--I don't believe there will be a need for a rollcall vote on the \nquorum. I think there will be enough Senators here that the Chair will \nbe able to see clearly there are 51 Senators here. Then we will have a \ncloture on Executive Calendar No. 378, Chai Rachel Feldblum of the \nDistrict of Columbia to be a member of the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission. Then, Mr. President, the next vote will be tomorrow morning \nat 9 a.m. This morning, yes; I am sorry.\n  We are going to do everything we can to finish our schedule before \nChristmas, but it is going to be pushing it. We will do our best. But \nthis session doesn't end until the end of the year, so we are going to \ncontinue working until we get our work done. I am not going to yield \nback all of our time on all of our nominations. We are going to do \nthose piece by piece.\n  I hope the body has been able to understand what a waste of time this \nhas been, but we are going to confirm these nominations, and that is a \nstep in the right direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Cornelia T.L. Pillard, of the District of \nColumbia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the District of \nColumbia Circuit.\n  Mr. COATS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, it was after 2 a.m. this morning when \nthe Senate finally passed this historic measure which puts the fiscal \ncliff behind us, if--if--the House of Representatives follows through \nand passes it as well. I hope they take it up today or as quickly as \npossible and pass it with the same bipartisan spirit and vote we saw on \nthe floor of the Senate last night. If\n\n[[Page S8612]]\n\nI am not mistaken, the final vote was 89 to 8, which was a significant \nbipartisan vote.\n  It was a moment of high emotion in the Senate for several reasons. \nFirst, on a personal level, many of our colleagues were casting their \nfinal vote as Senators. Those who are leaving the Senate gathered in \nthe well and we wished them the best. It was also a moment of high \nemotion because I cannot think of another vote in recent times the \nAmerican people followed so closely. I couldn't sit down on an airplane \nor at a restaurant in Chicago without having somebody come up to me and \nsay: What is going to happen? They were very concerned, as they should \nhave been, because the so-called fiscal cliff is a threat to our \neconomic recovery and one that, I believe, finally mobilized the \nmajority necessary to pass this measure in the Senate on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  The President showed extraordinary leadership on this matter. I know \nhe was personally invested in it. He thought about it long and hard. He \nleft his family vacation, which he looks forward to, and even more so \nafter the campaign, to come back to Washington and try to put together \na solution to this fiscal crisis. He was successful in the Senate, and \nI hope he will be in the House as well.\n  The President also had the able efforts of his Vice President, Joe \nBiden, to help in this effort. Last night, Vice President Biden came \nback to his home, the Senate, where he served for 36 years, and spoke \nto the Senate Democrats about the importance of this vote. It was for \nalmost an hour and a half on New Year's Eve, somewhat surreal, as we \ngathered--some away from their spouses for the first time in decades--\nfor this important vote, and for an hour and a half we spoke and asked \nquestions of the Vice President and expressed our feelings. We could \nsense during the course of that meeting an emerging consensus among the \nDemocratic Senators. In the end, all but three of the Democratic \nSenators voted in favor of this measure.\n  There are parts of the bill many of us disagree with even today, but \nwe understand it is the nature of compromise that part of what we have \nto accept may not be popular, but we have to be willing to compromise \nto solve problems. When we look at the issues before us, I think we \nmade some significant progress. The most significant progress was to \nprotect 98 percent of American families from any tax increase. If the \nSenate measure is approved in the House, we will see 98 percent of \nAmerican families spared a tax increase today.\n  The vast majority of working families, middle-income families, \nstruggle. They live paycheck to paycheck. The Pew Institute did a \nsurvey within the last year or two asking working families a very basic \nquestion: If an emergency came up, could you find $2,000, borrow or \nfind $2,000 to meet an emergency need? Two thousand dollars is not an \nextraordinary amount of money until we consider that a simple trip to \nthe emergency room or urgent care clinic could result in a $2,000 \nmedical bill. They asked working families, and barely half of American \nfamilies had access to $2,000. That tells us how close to the edge so \nmany families live.\n  Had we not acted on this measure early this morning, these middle-\nincome families would have faced an increase in their taxes of more \nthan $2,000 a year. That is not only in Illinois and California but \nacross the Nation. So we had to come together to protect those \nfamilies.\n  That was the starting point for the President's position on this \nissue and the starting point for the Democrats. We passed, 6 months ago \nin this Chamber, a measure which would have protected these families. \nWe sent it to the House. They never called it, and we had to renew our \nefforts last night, and successfully we were able to achieve that by \nthe end of the evening.\n  We had to bargain, as usual, in the political atmosphere and had to \nraise the exemption from $250,000 of family income to $450,000 of \nfamily income. But, in so doing, we have protected working families \nfrom this tax increase which otherwise would have taken place. These \nfamilies need the resources to not only meet the bills they face each \nmonth but to try to save a little bit for the future, for their \nfamilies, and for some of their own dreams about a better life.\n  So that was the important first step in this package that was passed \nearly this morning.\n  The other thing that was part of it was a 5-year extension--I wish it \nhad been permanent--but a 5-year extension on the Recovery Act \nexpansion of the earned-income tax credit. The earned-income tax credit \nis a measure passed during the Reagan administration which said we \nwould give working families a tax benefit for working: the earned-\nincome tax credit. That is probably, as President Reagan described it, \nthe best way to eliminate and reduce poverty in our Nation. So the \nRecovery Act expansion of the earned-income tax credit has been \nextended for 5 years.\n  The child tax credit, which does exactly what it says--it says to \nfamilies with children: We will give you a tax credit to help you raise \nthose children--that, too, was renewed for another 5 years at the \nenhanced Recovery Act level. And a provision in the law, which was \nadded by Senator Schumer of New York years ago, which helps working \nfamilies to pay for college education, that, too, was included in this \nmeasure.\n  So from a working family perspective, there were many good and \nimportant elements that were included in this measure.\n  We also considered a lot of other tax measures, some of which I liked \nand some I did not like. One of them in particular, the estate tax, is \na tax that is widely misunderstood. This is a tax which applies to a \nvery small fraction of a percentage of American families that when the \nbreadwinner passes away have a valuable estate that can be subject to \nFederal taxation. It is a very small percentage. Some 3 percent might \nbe affected by an estate tax. At the higher levels that we have \ndiscussed in our debate on this issue, less than 1 percent of estates \nend up paying any tax whatsoever to the Federal Government.\n  The Republicans insisted on a provision which Senator Kyl of Arizona \nhad been championing for years, which would raise the exemption for \nestates to over $5 million, which means a $5.1 million estate would not \nbe subject to any taxation, and over that amount would be subject to a \n40-percent tax responsibility.\n  I personally think it should have been a lower figure. We are dealing \nwith the wealthiest people in America, again, and many of them make \nplans, estate planning, to avoid this tax throughout their lives, and \nit turns out that fewer than one-half of 1 percent of those who use \nthis benefit are actually small businesses or farmers. Most of them are \nvery wealthy people who have done well.\n  I can think of a friend of mine in central Illinois. Her father was a \nfarmer and started with very modest means, bought some land, and over \ntime the land has mushroomed in value to the point where his estate is \nworth multimillions of dollars. She will have an estate that is huge \nfar beyond what she could imagine, and she would be subject to this \ntax. She is not a farmer. I do not think she has ever been on a \ntractor, unless she did as a child, and it is an asset which would be \nsubject to the estate tax.\n  So we have reached an agreement, albeit a reluctant agreement, to \nestablish this estate tax exemption of $5.1 million, subject to a tax \nbeyond that of 40 percent.\n  There were many other provisions related to the Tax Code, some of \nthem very esoteric, but that was an important starting point, \nprotecting working families, protecting the deductions and credits they \nneed the most, and making certain we have revenue coming in from this. \nWe anticipate some $600 billion in new revenue coming in to help reduce \nour deficit as a result of this.\n  We also have something in law which the Acting President pro tempore \nand I talked about for a moment: the alternative minimum tax. There was \na time when they took a look at America and said: How can this possibly \nbe that some of the wealthiest people pay no taxes? So we established \nsomething called an alternative minimum tax, which said: If under the \nregular Tax Code you escape all tax liability, you are going to be \nsubject to the alternative minimum tax, where you will pay something.\n  Well, it was not a bad idea 30 or 40 years ago when the debate \nstarted. But\n\n[[Page S8613]]\n\nbecause we did not index the income that was associated with it, over \nthe years, this alternative minimum tax hit not only the wealthy, but \nit started hitting those in middle-income categories. So each year we \nhad to kind of postpone the impact of this tax on middle-income \nfamilies--let's say, families in the $100,000 to $200,000 range. This \nhas been vexing us for decades.\n  Last night, in the Senate--or this morning, in the Senate--with the \npassage of this legislation, we have dealt with the problem once and \nfor all. We have a permanent fix on the alternative minimum tax. It is \nsomething I am sure most American families are probably puzzled over, \nbut it is an important element in getting this behind us which was \ncritically important as well.\n  We also managed to extend the doc fix. What is that all about? Over \n10 years ago, we said we are going to save some money in Medicare. We \nare just going to take a little percentage cut each year in how much we \nwould pay doctors and hospitals who treat Medicare patients; therefore, \nwe will reduce the cost of Medicare and be done with it.\n  Well, guess what. We had a great idea, but when it came to imposing \nthe law, the doctors and hospitals pushed back and said: Wait a minute. \nWe need this compensation for our care of Medicare patients. Therefore, \nwe postponed it. Every year we postponed it, what we were supposed to \nsave we had to come up with from other sources. The so-called doc fix, \nSGR, is another one like the alternative minimum tax, which has haunted \nus as we have done these budgets year in and year out. We did not solve \nthis problem permanently.\n  We solved it for 1 year. Otherwise, what would have happened is, \nstarting today, doctors and hospitals would have seen a reduction of \nover 25 percent in their government reimbursement for treating \npatients. The net result would have been, in Springfield and Chicago, \nIL, and across the Nation--in Ohio and California--many doctors and \nhospitals would have said: We can no longer afford to treat these \npatients, and the people--the 50 million-plus Americans who depend on \nMedicare--would have had fewer choices for treatment. So we have \nresolved that issue. In the early morning hours, with this vote, for 1 \nyear we have solved that problem.\n\n  Another thing we have done, which is critically important, is extend \nunemployment benefits for 1 year. Two million Americans--2 million--\nwould have lost their unemployment benefits this morning as a result of \nthis so-called fiscal cliff if we had not taken action.\n  I can tell you that it means an awful lot in my State of Illinois. As \nI mentioned, 2 million on a nationwide basis, but we also have 88,000 \nin my own State who face the same basic problem. These are people who \nhave been out of work for a long time. Some of them are in school. Some \nare taking courses for retraining. All are trying to keep their family \ntogether, not lose their home while they are unemployed.\n  So the extension of these unemployment benefits was the President's \nsecond highest priority, after protecting middle-income Americans, and \nit was included in this package. It is an important element.\n  One last point. When you ask the Congressional Budget Office: If you \nhad to spend one tax dollar to help the economy, where would you spend \nit, they will tell you over and over again, it is clear: Unemployment \nbenefits. The $1 you spend on unemployment benefits goes directly back \ninto the economy. These people are not salting it away for a rainy day. \nThey are not investing it. They are spending it on goods and services \nto get by--utility bills and rent and mortgage payments and food and \nclothing, the basics of life.\n  As they spend it back into the economy, it is respent. So each $1 has \nkind of a multiplier effect behind it of $1.60, ultimately, into the \neconomy. So not only is it the humane and right thing to do for those \nwho are out of work and struggling, but it is also a good thing for \nboosting economic growth. That is an important part.\n  One of the real disappointments last night--and I have to tell you, \nit really is sad that it has come to this--relates to the farm bill. We \nhave a chairman of the Agriculture Committee in the Senate, Senator \nDebbie Stabenow of Michigan. Past chairmen who are serving here all \nacknowledge, as we do, she has done such an extraordinary job. Her \nleadership in constructing a farm bill this year was masterful.\n  I have been around Congress for 30 years--the House and Senate. You \ncan pick out the real legislators, and Debbie Stabenow is a real \nlegislator. She sat down and crafted a farm bill.\n  Now, you may not think of Michigan as a farm State; it is. And she \nlooked at this bill in terms of its entirety. In its entirety, the farm \nbill is about more than farmers and ranchers. It is also about \nnutrition and food programs and school lunch and food stamps. They are \nall included in this bill.\n  She tackled it with the ranking Republican member, Pat Roberts of \nKansas, and came up with an amazing work product. She had over 63 votes \nin the Senate for this farm bill--bipartisan support for this farm \nbill.\n  Let me tell you what it did. We not only ended up with a bill that \nhad the support of every major farm organization, which is no mean \nfeat, it saved over $23 billion in deficit reduction in 5 years. She \nwent after some of the indefensible programs, such as the direct \npayment program to farmers, which they readily acknowledged needed to \ngo away, took those programs aside and put the money to deficit \nreduction.\n  She went to the nutrition programs, which are critically important in \na struggling economy, with families facing income inequality, and she \nprotected those. Those are important to me, and I have worked with her, \nand I think we came up with an honest, balanced approach when it came \nto nutrition programs.\n  We passed the bill. We passed it months ago in the Senate, and we \nsent it to the House of Representatives. They not only could not pass \ntheir own farm bill--never did--but they would not even consider \ncalling the bipartisan Senate bill. The farm organizations were begging \nthem: Call it. We need a 5-year program on farming. They would not do \nit. They never did it.\n  So there was a lot of frustration over here that we did good work on \na bill, the House could not put a bill on the floor, and would not take \nup our bill.\n  The thing that brought it together, incidentally, at the last \nminute--why it was included in this emergency package--it turns out \nthat under the law, if we do not pass a new farm bill, we revert to the \n1949 farm bill. Talk about going back in history and picking up a law \nwhich has little application to today's world, that is what happens. \nOne particular issue jumped off the page: dairy support.\n  Now, last night I bid farewell to Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin. I \nam going to miss him more than most people can imagine because Herb \nKohl spent the time and understood America's dairy program.\n  Madam President, I confess, I do not understand this program. \nVaguely, yes; but if it was on the final, I would flunk. So I used to \ngo, on dairy issues, to Senator Kohl. Wisconsin dairy farmers and \nIllinois dairy farmers always saw eye to eye.\n  I said: Herb, you are my dairy expert. You tell me. You are my \nadviser. Well, Herb is retiring. I will need a new adviser. But we \nfound out that if we had not passed a new farm bill, and reverted to \nthe 1949 dairy program, the price of milk would double to $10 a gallon. \nThat, to me, was unacceptable. It was unacceptable to the White House. \nAs a result, we had to come through with an emergency measure to avoid \nthat possibility.\n  We should have taken the bipartisan Senate farm bill. Senator \nStabenow begged for us to do this, could not get that into the \nnegotiation.\n  I will say one thing that really disappointed me last night. At the \nlast minute, they had one aspect of the dairy program they needed to \ntake care of. It costs $60 million to $100 million.\n  We needed to find a pay-for and, unfortunately, the other side of the \naisle insisted that the pay-for for this dairy support come from the \nFederal Food Stamp Program. That is just--that is sad. We had so much \nwaste in our agriculture programs that we identified in our farm bill. \nThe fact that they would turn to the Federal Food Stamp Program, the \nSNAP program, to come up with this money, to me, is difficult to \nunderstand, explain or defend. I am saddened by that. I guarantee we \nwill return to that.\n\n[[Page S8614]]\n\n  What we did in the early morning hours is important for us. It isn't \nthe end of the story. There is more we will face. In 60 days, if we \ndon't take care, we are going to face another cliff of our own making \nbecause in 60 days three things come together.\n  The debt ceiling, what is the debt ceiling? America's mortgage. When \nwe spend money for a war, for the Department of Agriculture, whatever \nit happens to be, ultimately, we borrow 40 cents for every $1 we spend. \nSo every President is forced to renew the mortgage, the debt ceiling of \nthe United States.\n  I think of President Ronald Reagan. It was done over and over again \nmany times without even a record vote. But now it has become a \npolitical hot potato, and in a matter of 60 days or so we will be \nfacing another need to renew America's mortgage. In other words, this \nis the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, and that is going \nto be contentious, a matter of debate.\n  At the same time, the continuing resolution, our temporary spending \nbill, expires. At the same time, the sequestration kicks in, which is \nautomatic spending cuts. So we will have, in 60 days, if the House \nfollows the Senate lead on the fiscal cliff, another challenge. Let us \nhope we have learned a lesson from this one.\n  The American people are sick and tired of incompetence, political \nposturing, and failure of Congress to come together on a bipartisan \nbasis to solve a problem and they want us to get the problem solved and \nget this Nation moving forward.\n  In the early morning hours in the Senate, we finally achieved it. It \nshould have been done long ago, I understand, but we achieved it. Now I \nhope the House will do the same, follow the Senate example, and 60 days \nfrom now we can approach this problem in a sober, honest, mature way \ninstead of a partisan fashion. That is what the American people expect.\n  I took a look, incidentally, at the specific impact of this morning's \nvote on my State of Illinois. For the record, over 5 million Illinois \nfamilies will be spared a tax increase under the agreement we passed in \nthe early morning hours. Many of them, almost all of them, the working \nfamilies whom I described earlier, without an agreement, the average \nfamily in Illinois would have faced an increase in taxes of more than \n$2,000.\n  Half a million families in my State will continue to receive college \ntuition tax credits, making it easier to send their kids to college. \nThis could be as much as $1,000 of assistance each year, which I am \nsure is a helping hand.\n  Also, 1.5 million Illinois families raising children will continue to \nbenefit from the child tax credit, a yearly savings of about $1,000, on \naverage, for each of these Illinois families with kids. Working \nfamilies in Illinois will continue to receive the earned-income tax \ncredit. Over 230,000 Illinois families benefited from that tax credit \nlast year.\n  More than 1 million Illinois taxpayers are protected from an increase \nin taxes under the alternative minimum tax, which I mentioned earlier. \nThousands of Illinois children will continue to have access to school \nreadiness programs such as Head Start. Low-income families will \ncontinue to benefit from low-income home energy programs, LIHEAP.\n  The deal, the agreement, protects funding for nutrition assistance \nfor women, infants, and children and prenatal care, so we can have more \nhealthy babies and healthy moms. The elderly, disabled, low-income \nfamilies and veterans will continue to receive housing assistance. Over \n88,000 Illinoisans will continue to receive the unemployment benefits I \nmentioned earlier, and Illinois businesses will benefit from more than \n$8.5 billion in consumer spending by middle-class families, families \nspending more on goods and services at a time when we desperately need \nthis in our economy.\n  Let me say one last word. I have been involved in this deficit \ndiscussion for a long period of time. This is not a deficit-reduction \nmeasure, period. It does reduce it in some aspects, but the arcane \nscoring by the Congressional Budget Office will not give us any credit \nfor reducing the deficit. We do have more revenue coming in toward \ndeficit reduction, but some of the other measures I mentioned would be \nscored as expenditures.\n  Having said that, we still have a deficit issue. We still have a \ndeficit problem.\n  What we tried to establish this morning in this vote is revenue has \nto be part of every solution on deficit reduction. The other side of \nthe aisle reluctantly, after years of resisting, came to our side in \nthe early morning hours. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, we need to take an honest look at entitlements. Here are what \nthe facts are. Social Security untouched, unamended, unchanged will \nmake every promised payment for 20 years. We can't say that about any \nother Federal program, 20 years of payments, with cost-of-living \nadjustments every single year. But on the 21st year there will be a \ndropoff of 30 percent in terms of Social Security benefits. We have 20 \nyears. We can wait. We can wait 5, 10 or 15 years to do something or we \ncan do it soon, maybe even this year, 2013. That is what I would like \nto see.\n  I am preparing legislation to be introduced shortly, which will call \nfor the creation of a commission with a very simple assignment, come up \nwith a plan for 75-year solvency of Social Security. When they have it, \nand it has been certified to be a valid plan, report it to Congress to \nbe considered, without debate--I shouldn't say without debate--without \nfilibuster, without delay. When it comes to the floor, any Member who \ncan offer a substitute amendment that achieves 75 years' solvency may \nalso call their measure at the same time. Let us have a chance to have \nthis debate and make sure we have solvency for Social Security that \nwill affect not only all our lives but the lives of our children and \nbeyond. That, to me, is the responsible thing to do.\n  Medicare is much tougher. Medicare goes broke in 12 years--12 years. \nWhy? Because, lo and behold, today, 10,000 Americans reached the age of \n65, and 10,000 reached that age yesterday and will tomorrow and for the \nnext 10 or 15 years. The baby boomers have arrived.\n  We knew it was coming. But as they show up, their demands for \nservices that they have paid for and invested in throughout their \nworking lives are going to continue to grow. Those people who say: \nThere is too much government spending; we have to stop the government \nspending, I want to ask them: So are you going to say to the millions \nof Americans who paid into Social Security for a lifetime, paid into \nMedicare for a lifetime, that we are going to walk away from our \nobligations? Of course not.\n  What we have to do on Medicare is find a way to meet this growing \npopulation with demands and the mushrooming costs of health care. We \ncan do it. There are ways to save money, humane ways to save money and \nprotect the integrity and the future of Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid. I think the President's ObamaCare, as it has been \ncharacterized, or Affordable Care Act, is a step in that direction, but \nwe need to do more when it comes to Medicare.\n  I see my friend and colleague from Ohio on the floor. I yield to him \nand thank him for his friendship and his leadership on these important \nissues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I thank the senior Senator from Illinois, the \nassistant majority leader.\n  I concur in the remarks Senator Durbin just made, especially about \nthe vote last night. The primary thing we did was we spared that $2,000 \ntax increase for so many families in California, Illinois, Ohio, and \nacross this country. I remember the Presiding Officer telling a group \nof us last night how many hundreds of thousands of Californians would \nhave lost their unemployment insurance if we had not acted last night \nthe way we did.\n  My fundamental criteria on voting on this issue and voting for this \nissue was we were able successfully to stop cuts in Social Security to \npay for some of this plan or raising the retirement age for Medicare or \nnot doing the unemployment insurance in the way we did. So all those \nwere victories last night.\n  I also concur with Senator Durbin that while adding 5 years to the \nearned-income tax credit, locking in one of the best poverty-fighting \nprograms to be begun by Ronald Reagan, suggested, I believe, by Milton \nFriedman--supported by both parties for\n\n[[Page S8615]]\n\nmany years--we are not seeing that the way we used to with the earned-\nincome tax credit. It rewards families that work, a family making \n$30,000 a year. This is not a whole lot more than the minimum wage, $3 \nor $4 more, maybe, than the minimum wage but not a livable wage, and \nthey get significant tax credits. This is sort of what Friedman called \na negative income tax, and this works so well for encouraging work in \nthis country.\n  We did that only for 5 years, while bringing the estate tax up to a \n$5 million exemption, which I thought was far too generous because it \nis only paid by far fewer than 1 percent of the American people. That \nwas made permanent while the earned-income tax credit was only made for \n5 years.\n  The tax credit for college students, for families, was so important \nin this legislation too. Much of what we did was simply ask the wealthy \nto pay a little bit more, to bring tax rates, as the Presiding Officer \nknows, back to the levels of the 1990s.\n  I think it is important to put this in a little historical \nperspective. In the 1990s, tax rates were a little bit higher for upper \nincome people. We saw in those 8 years in the 1990s, from 1993 to \n2000--the Presiding Officer's first year in the Senate, 1993, my first \nyear in the House--we saw incredible economic growth. Wages went up for \nthe average American, average Ohioan, average Californian, average \nAmerican. We saw 21 million private sector net jobs created, and \nPresident Clinton left office with the largest budget surplus in \nAmerican history.\n  We know what happened the next 8 years, where we saw very little \neconomic growth, only about 1 million--being generous--only about 1 \nmillion private sector net jobs created in those 8 years.\n  In what hit my State particularly hard, we saw a real decline in \nmanufacturing. From 2000 to 2010, we lost, in this country, net, 5 \nmillion manufacturing jobs--manufacturing jobs. Maybe people who dress \nlike this around here don't think much about that. I know the Presiding \nOfficer does because her State is the No. 1 manufacturing State in the \ncountry.\n  It is especially important in my State. We lost hundreds of thousands \nof manufacturing jobs. While we lost 5 million manufacturing jobs \nnationally, tens of thousands--I believe 60,000 is the number--of \nmanufacturing plants closed in those 10 years.\n  But the good news is that since the auto rescue, we have seen what is \nbeginning to be significant manufacturing job growth, some 500,000 new \nmanufacturing jobs since 2010. Almost every month--not quite every \nmonth but almost every month--an increase in manufacturing jobs. We \nknow what a manufacturing job does in a community. For workers earning \n$20 or $25 an hour, that worker is spending money in that community. \nThat worker is buying things, buying a home, buying a car, putting \npeople to work creating jobs at restaurants and creating jobs at the \nhardware store. Those workers are paying property taxes to hire \nteachers and paying the local city income tax to hire firefighters and \npolice. So we know what manufacturing jobs do as we see that increase.\n  In fact, since the auto rescue, in my State, the unemployment rate \nwent from 10.6 percent soon after the auto rescue sort of took effect, \nif you will, and now the unemployment rate is under 7 percent. It is \nnot what it ought to be, but I think that is what last night's vote, \nultimately, was a recognition of; that the people here with this 89-to-\n8 vote--89 votes yes, 8 votes no, with strong bipartisan support, which \nI hope we see this afternoon in the House--I think it was a recognition \nthat we don't grow the economy by tax cuts for the rich and trickle-\ndown economics. We tried that in the last decade. It didn't work. We \nunderstand, historical evidence shows--and I think we recognized it \nlast night--by focusing on the middle class, tax cuts for the middle \nclass, investments in schools, and investments in infrastructure and \nunemployment insurance for people who have lost their job, keeping \nSocial Security and Medicare strong, investing in college credits, and \nrewarding work through the earned-income tax credit, we grow the \neconomy from the middle class out. That succeeded in the 1990s. There \nwere 20 million-plus new manufacturing jobs. Trickle down didn't do so \nwell the 10 years after.\n  Now we are coming back and recognizing, with this overwhelming vote \nlast night, both parties are recognizing we grow the economy from the \nmiddle class out.\n  I think that is why last night was a huge victory, surely, \npolitically for the President. But what it was a victory for, truly, \nwas a victory for the middle class and a victory for those who want to \njoin, aspire to the middle class, and a victory for this country, for \nour economy, for our economic growth and for our future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/01/senate-section/article/S8615-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8615-S8620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             RULES CHANGES\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, we are busy patting ourselves on the back \nfor avoiding the fiscal cliff. I don't know how much congratulations we \nought to have for that.\n  Yesterday, I was buying some groceries, and the guy at the checkout \nstand had no idea who I was and shouldn't have. He said: What is going \non, on Capitol Hill? What are those people doing? We ought to fire \neverybody in Congress. They can't get their work done. We have to get \nour work done. They don't have to get their work done.\n  He made a good point. I am telling you, it is down to the level of \ngrocery store checkout people--and I suspect different levels than \nthat, different occupations than that. Americans, because they are kind \nof tuned in to the news media, which is kind of an information media or \nan entertainment media, built this fiscal cliff so it appeared to be \nNiagara Falls with money running over it. It is more of a gradual \nslope. But we have to stop the downward slope we are on. It is \nimportant we do that. And this is a body that can do that. Congress can \ndo that.\n\n  We conduct a war of words around here--of this protecting the \n``rich''--and it sticks. You know, I don't know of anybody who is \ntrying to protect the rich. The problem comes with the definition of \n``rich,'' and that is a hard one to explain. Any attempt that looks \nlike that, and we go back to the sticky word of ``rich,'' whom nobody \nis trying to protect.\n  I used to be in business. I used to be one of those small \nbusinessmen, and I knew that at the end of the year, the business would \nshow a profit. Now, unfortunately, we couldn't take the money out of \nthe business if we were going to continue to grow the business, if we \nwere going to bring on more people. It also meant we needed to have \nmore product, and that meant we had to have more investment in the \nbusiness. So the money we could have taken out that showed as \n``profit'' actually went back into the business.\n  We kept saying: How can we have so little money when we make so much \nmoney?\n  Well, that is the position a lot of the small business men and women \nare in around this country. They are having to put all their money back \ninto their businesses. And I understand when people say don't protect \nthe rich--those making $250,000 or $400,000 or $450,000, whatever the \namount comes out to be--but the person working in that business, \nprobably making $30,000, $40,000, $50,000, or $60,000, says: If all I \nam making is that amount and they are making $250,000, we really ought \nto tax them. You know, it is a fairness issue. But when it gets down to \nthe point of what they actually get to take out, what their take-home \nis, it is a lot different. They look really good on paper, they look \nrich on paper, but the money they get to take out is significantly less \nthan that, and that is where the divide came in when trying to solve \nthis problem. Now, could it have been solved? Yes, it could have been \nsolved.\n  What we need to do around this institution is to start legislating \nand stop deal-making. We are a legislative body. You can't have 100 \npeople involved in a deal, and consequently we don't. We have the group \nof 2, as in the case of this one, or a group of 4 or 6 or 9 or maybe as \nmany as 12 getting together and putting together some kind of \ncomprehensive package to put before this body, and those who aren't in \nthe group are really kind of insulted by it. They do not make a big \ndeal out of it because that has become the tradition, but that is not \nhow it is supposed to work.\n\n[[Page S8616]]\n\n  I have been there. I have gotten to legislate. It is one of the \nprivileges of this country. The main person with whom I legislated was \nSenator Kennedy. Senator Kennedy was considered one of the most liberal \npeople in the Senate, and I have always been considered one of the most \nconservative people in the Senate, but we were able to work together to \nget 38 bills out of committee and through this body, and the worst vote \nwe ever got was 15 votes against. How did we do that? Well, we didn't \ntry to solve the world's problems all in one bill. We took an issue at \na time, and we found the common ground. We found what we could agree \non, and that was usually about 80 percent of the whole issue. That is \npretty good.\n  We worked on issues that had been around here 10 or 12 or 15 years \nwithout passing, having come to the floor numerous times, and mainly \nwhat we did was we would sit down with the stakeholders, who were \nintensely interested in the bill, who had been lobbying on that bill \nfor years and years, and we would say to them: This is what we can get. \nThis is what we have to leave out.\n  It wasn't compromise. Compromise is when you give up half of what you \nbelieve in, I give up half of what I believe in, and we wind up with \nsomething that neither of us believes in. But common ground happens. \nThere is common ground on every one of these issues, and that is what \nwe have to find--the common ground.\n  So we would meet with these stakeholders, and they would say: No, you \nare leaving out the most important part of this whole bill. This is \nwhat we really want.\n  If it was Senator Kennedy's constituency, he would have to make the \ncomment, and if it was mine, I would have to make the comment: How long \nhave you been working on this?\n  They would say: We have been working on this for 10 years.\n  I would say: How much of it have you gotten?\n  Then they would say: Well, nothing.\n  I would say: Here is what we can get for you.\n  And I would outline it again, and I would say: Isn't that better than \nnothing?\n  The light would come on, and they would say: Oh, that would be good \nprogress.\n  Then they would quit pushing against us, and they would get together \nwith us.\n  It is amazing sometimes that the advocates for a bill are really \nsometimes the ones who are stopping the bill from happening, and it is \nover the issues--that 10 percent on each side, which amounts to 20 \npercent--that we are not going to get resolved. There are some basic \nvalues on both sides, and they are important to both sides and they are \nboth right, but they are not common ground.\n  But this is where we have to go. We have to get to common ground \nagain, and the way we do that is by legislating. We put out a bill that \nis 80 percent of the whole issue, not 100 percent of the whole issue \nbecause that is comprehensive. We need to put out the 80 percent both \nsides agree on and then allow amendments on it. That is something we \nhaven't been doing around here for a long time.\n  First of all, a bill needs to go to committee. The committee is where \nthe people intensely interested in that particular bill preside and \nwork and exert their efforts. That is where they want to concentrate.\n  When a bill comes to committee, you can have maybe 200 or 300 \namendments in committee, and the chairman and the ranking member--that \nis the name we give to the person with the most seniority in the \nminority--can sit down together and sort through these amendments. Out \nof the 200, there are probably 100 that nobody in their right mind \nwould really offer. Out of the remaining ones, you will find there are \npeople on both sides who have very similar ideas on how to solve that \nproblem, so you get those people to sit down together and take a look \nat all the amendments that are similar to that one and see if they \ncan't come up with a single amendment that will solve that part of the \nproblem. And you know what. They do. Now, it might not be 100 percent \nof what they want. It is probably, again, only 80 percent of what they \nwant. But it is something on which they can all agree.\n  Here is the really magnificent part that helps a bill get through \ncommittee: They can all say: It was my idea. They can all go to the \nmedia and put out the release that says they solved this particular \nproblem, and that helps a lot around here.\n\n  So committee work is extremely important, but when a bill comes out \nof committee, it is not perfect. When Senator Kennedy and I were \nworking the bills, we not only recognized they weren't perfect, but we \nwere able to talk to those Members whose problems we weren't able to \nsolve by the time the amendment process came up in committee, and we \npromised to work with them until the bill got to the floor and not to \ntake the bill to the floor until we had a solution to that problem or \nthe right for them to offer an amendment. That helped a lot to get the \nbill out of committee.\n  Once a bill comes out of committee in a bipartisan way--meaning \npeople from both sides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats and \nIndependents, support the bill--then there is a chance of bringing it \nto the floor and actually getting some time to debate. And the debate \npart is important. That is kind of where we bring America along. There \nis coverage during the committee process, but that is a little harder \nto follow. The debate here on the floor is where we bring America along \non whatever ideas we have, and so the debate here is very important.\n  Over time, there has been this process where the leaders have \ninvented some things that actually concentrate the power in the hands \nof the leaders rather than the body as a whole, and that is the \nfilibuster process, and that filibuster process can be manufactured.\n  I have to tell a couple of stories. One bill I worked on around here \nhad a solution for health care. I called it small business health \nplans. The idea behind the bill was that small businesses could get \ntogether through their association or any way they wanted to, across \nState lines, even nationwide, to form a buying group big enough to take \non the biggest of the insurance companies. Think about that--the power \nto take on the biggest of the insurance companies. Yes, there was some \nopposition to that--call it the insurance companies. But many of them \nworked with us and began to understand how they could participate in \nthe process and then went along with it.\n  One of the biggest insurance companies in the Nation had some ads out \nof Massachusetts opposing the bill, and eventually that helped to keep \nthe bill from ever happening. But the biggest thing that kept the bill \nfrom happening--Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nanother 10 minutes or the right to allow the Senator from California to \nspeak and then have it come back to me.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am wondering if the Senator can finish in 5 minutes, \nand then I would speak, and then he can have more time.\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes, just a couple more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. So on this small business health plan, when it came to the \nfloor, I had the unfortunate experience of having Senator Frist setting \na filibuster and filling the tree. ``Filling the tree'' means nobody \ncan make another amendment to the bill. But here is the catch: After \nthis came out of committee, we got the people together who had a \nproblem with the bill, and we had one amendment that would have solved \nthose problems. With the tree filled, that one amendment couldn't come \nup. That one amendment couldn't happen.\n  So what happened? We talked about the bill and how it lacked this \nparticular part. I kept explaining how we had an amendment that would \ntake care of that. Everybody in the Chamber knew that amendment was not \ngoing to happen, and consequently, on a process vote, it was killed \nwith just over 40 votes. That is what happened with the filibuster. Had \nthat amendment been possible, we would have had one of the things in \nplace for health care--just one, but it would have solved a lot of \nthings for a lot of businesses, and that is where a lot of people work \nin this country, and that is where jobs are.\n  So that is how we can do this job of legislating.\n  My second story would be--and this one is much shorter--about the \nyear Senator Harkin and I brought an FDA\n\n[[Page S8617]]\n\nbill to the floor. When it got to the floor, we explained to the leader \nthat there were going to be 14 amendments--8 of them would be brought \nup and would fail, and the other 6 would be withdrawn. A week later we \nfinally got to start on the amendments for that bill. There was worry \nthat there would be some extraneous ones thrown in. We already had \nagreement, I guess you could say, from the most conservative and most \nliberal from each of our sides that they would not bring up the \nperipheral amendments, and they didn't. So a week later, when we \nfinally got to start to vote--and we could have done that the same day, \nalthough we finished up in a day and a half--we had eight amendments \nthat got defeated and six amendments that were withdrawn. So we wound \nup exactly where we knew we were going to be, and the bill passed here \n96 to 1.\n  That is how the committee process can work, and that is how not \nhaving a filibuster can work, and that is what we need to get back to. \nWe need to be legislating, not deal-making. And I will talk later about \nsome of the deal-making, and we have seen that with the cliff process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to say to Senator Enzi that I \nagree with so much of what he said. Our being here on New Year's Eve, \nsome of us without our families, is nothing to be proud of, and having \nbeen able to do our work through the committee system, I think he made \na very good point.\n  Enzi and Kennedy were quite a team; Baucus and Grassley had their \nsuccesses; Levin and McCain recently had their success on the Defense \nbill, with lots of amendments; Boxer and Inhofe on the Transportation \nbill. I can tell you, you couldn't find two people more different, and \nyet Senator Inhofe and I were able to do that work and get that done \nand protect 2 to 3 million jobs. And also Stabenow and Roberts in the \nAgriculture Committee.\n  So my friend is absolutely right; we can do this in the right way and \nnot have to be here in the middle of the night. I don't think that is \nanything to be proud of. However, I do believe what we did early this \nmorning was right and very important. I think Senators Durbin and Brown \nlaid it out as to why that vote was so critically important: It \nprotected our families, it gave certainty to our businesses, and it \nkeeps this economy moving forward. All this is true if the House passes \nthis bill.\n  As Senator Enzi said so eloquently and in such a straightforward \nfashion, this is a deal. Each of us could write our own deal, and each \nof us would be so much happier with a deal that we personally could \nwrite. But that is not the way it is. We are not a parliamentary system \nwhere one party controls everything.\n  In a parliamentary system that we see in Europe, one party controls \neverything. They have a program. The other party opposition has a \nprogram. There may be other parties as well but two major parties. One \nof them gets elected, they put together a coalition, they have \ndiscipline, they have a program. They don't have to sit down with \npeople they don't see eye to eye with. They just have to get together \nand pass the program. If the people don't like it, there is a vote of \nconfidence and out they go and in comes the opposition. They have a \nchannel. That is not the American system. Our system is much more \ndifficult in so many ways. So many of us are so passionate on so many \nissues and believe so strongly, and yet we know we have to compromise, \nas Senator Enzi has said.\n  When I sat down with Senator Inhofe on the Transportation bill--and I \nwill be doing it now with Senator Vitter on the WRDA bill--the water \nresources bill--I laid out the five things I cared most about, he laid \nout the five things he cared most about, and, to be honest, there were \nonly a couple things that matched. So we started with those things, and \nthen we met each other in the middle with the rest. Then the Senate had \na chance to work its will.\n  When the bill got over to the House, it was stuck. It was trapped. We \nall went over there, all of us together on a bipartisan team, to speak \nto Speaker Boehner and Chairman Mica and say: OK, let's get it done. \nAnd we did. So it can get done.\n\n\n                            The Fiscal Cliff\n\n  But we are where we are, where we are. This morning we had a choice, \nand, frankly, I was proud to see the overwhelming vote we had. It was \namazing, 89 to 8. I don't know what motivated every colleague; I only \nknow what motivated me to believe this was an important ``aye'' vote \nfor me to cast.\n  I will never forget this recession that we are just coming out of \nnow, the worst recession since the Great Depression. As Treasury \nSecretary Hank Paulson--who put his head in his hands and was \noverwhelmed with what he actually called the potential collapse of \ncapitalism. That is what we faced.\n  We have short memories here because our lives are so filled with \nfast-moving events every day. Some of them are wonderful, some of them \nare awful, some of them lift up our hearts, some of them break our \nhearts. So we don't remember the things that happened a couple years \nago.\n  When President Obama took over after a very lifeless economy, as my \nfriend Senator Brown said, where only 1 million jobs were being \ncreated--maybe not even that many--in the private sector over an 8-year \nperiod, and suddenly there was a collapse brought on by the greed of \nWall Street and manipulation of securities dealing with housing--a \ncrash, a nightmare, and we were losing 800,000 a month. Then the auto \nindustry was on its knees.\n  Believe me, in the past I haven't been the biggest fan of the auto \nindustry for California because I believed they weren't producing the \ncleanest cars they could, the most fuel economy cars they could. I \nbelieved they were missing out on an opportunity. But let me tell you, \nwhen I was faced with the issue of whether to let them go bankrupt or \nstand and give them a chance, I chose that chance. And I am proud that \nI did it, and I am proud of this Congress for doing it. I am proud of \nthis President for leading the way. That was a critical vote. And this \nvote this morning, I believe, was a critical vote if we really wanted \nto keep this economy moving forward.\n  A lot of people say: How did President Obama ever win with that \nunemployment rate so high? All the historians were saying it was never \ngoing to happen because it has never happened. Well, I will tell you \nwhy I believe it happened. I believe people understood what we went \nthrough, what we suffered through, what he inherited, not to mention \ntwo wars on a credit card that he had to end. So I think people \nunderstood this. We don't give the people enough credit. They got it. \nThey understood it. And I hope they realize this President has led us \nto this point, with the Vice President, with Senator McConnell, with \nSenator Reid, to move this economy forward.\n  Let me tell you very quickly why it is so important to my home State. \nA lot of my colleagues roll their eyes when I tell them we have 38 \nmillion people in California. My friend from Wyoming, how many people \nin Wyoming? There are 562,785, and we have 38 million people. All \nright?\n  I want to tell you what it means that we voted the way we did. It \nmeans 400,000 people this morning will lose their unemployment \ninsurance unless the House acts. If the House acts as we did, they will \nnot lose it.\n  What does this mean to people, 400,000 of them? As my friend, the \nPresiding Officer--who is so good on economics--knows, there is a \nmultiplier effect. For every dollar we give in unemployment benefits, \nwe get a bang for the buck $1.42 in the community because the people on \nunemployment spend it because they are out of work.\n  They are about to lose this help. We need to help them, and in this \npackage we did--2 million nationwide, 600,000 jobs at stake from the \nmultiplier effect, and in my State 400,000 people. Almost as many \npeople as reside in the State of Wyoming were about to lose their \nunemployment insurance. Imagine--almost that.\n  I ask for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. So when we talk about our vote this morning, it is not a \nwonky discussion. It is real people. Five million Californians are \nabout to get trapped into the AMT problem, the alternative minimum tax, \nwhich was set up for a very fair reason. I wasn't here at that time, \nbut I remember reading about millionaires getting away with paying no \ntaxes because we\n\n[[Page S8618]]\n\nhad no alternative minimum. They took advantage of the Tax Code, got \ntheir deductions, and paid nothing. We put it in place, but it is \nimperfect. We had to fix it to make sure it doesn't catch the middle \nclass--5 million of my people.\n  So this is like a partridge in a pear tree in a way: 400,000 people \nwould have lost their unemployment compensation; 5 million would be \ncaught in the alternative minimum tax, which would have been an extra \nin taxes right there; and 15 million would have seen their tax rates go \nup on average of $2,200.\n  This bill we voted for this morning had real consequences, and I know \na lot of people are worried about the future and what is coming down in \n30 days, 60 days, and 90 days--and I worry too. But I have been around \nhere long enough to know it isn't going to get better if we put this \noff until then and we have twice as many issues on our plates to deal \nwith.\n  So I believe what we did this morning--and my voice is going because \nit was a very difficult and emotional day for all of us, some being \naway from their families for the first time. I know my friend from \nRhode Island and I talked about it. It wasn't easy, but we know what we \nare doing here is critical. We are not proud of the fact that it took \nus this long to get it done.\n  I agree with my friend from Wyoming. It is nothing to be proud of, \nbut it is important what we did. We have certainty for businesses that \ndepend upon consumerism. We have an economy that is driven by consumer \nactivity, about 70 percent of it. Now the business community knows--if \nthe House acts. I have to keep reminding myself it is not done. If the \nHouse acts, we will give certainty to our families, to our businesses, \nto our low-income people who depend upon refundable tax credits, to our \nenergy community that relies on energy tax breaks to keep on moving and \nkeep on producing.\n  So I don't want to see economic growth derailed. It was too hard and \npainful to sit through this very difficult economic recovery inch by \ninch, every day hoping we would push forward despite the odds. We had \nthe economic crisis in New York that weighed on us as well.\n  Well, what we did this morning was important. So I want to close by \nsaying this to my friends in the House, all of them--Democrats, \nRepublican, liberals, and conservatives--this is not the perfect deal. \nWe all know it. Each of us can find a piece of it that we really, \nreally don't like. But on the whole it will give certainty to this \neconomy.\n  In many cases, many of the provisions are permanent, such as the AMT. \nIt gives certainty, and certainty is critical. We will not go back. We \nwill not take billions and billions of dollars out of this economy. We \ncan't do that now.\n  I would say to my conservative friends over there: Now it is the \nfirst of the year. You are actually cutting taxes now because as of \ntoday they went up. So you could take credit for cutting taxes.\n  I just hope and pray that the House will do the right thing; that \nDemocrats and Republicans will come together as Americans and put the \ncountry first. I believe they will do this. I pray they will do this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to join the Senator from California \nin the hope that the House will pass the bill that was sent over from \nthe Senate last night. It was a tremendous amount of effort that was \nput into it by a number of people over a number of days and weeks, and \nI think it is the best answer that we could come up with at this point \nin time.\n  I particularly want to thank Leader McConnell and Vice President \nBiden for working numerous hours; starting, again, yesterday morning at \n6:45 and winding up with something late last night, more than 12 hours \nlater, over the last two issues, as I understand it. And, yes, I am \nglad that AMT was fixed. I would remind everybody that AMT is the last \neffort we had to tax the rich, and it backfired to where it now taxes \neverybody or almost everybody. So it desperately needed a fix. Now we \nare talking about taxing the rich again, and I hope we can come up with \nsome collective ways that will be certain for the people who are rich \nand that it will last over time instead of just for a few short years.\n  In my area of the world, the biggest thing in that bill was the \nestate tax. People who own land in Wyoming that they bought maybe at \n$40 an acre now have land that is worth $2,000 an acre or more, and \nthey haven't figured out how to pay the taxes on these few acres they \nwere able to scrape together over a period of time if the amount of the \nexemption went down to $1 million, and that is where we were headed. At \n$1 million, they would have to sell off part of the ranch or part of \nthe farm in order to pay the taxes when somebody died. All the time \nthat land is making a profit people are paying taxes on it. Then when \nthey die, they would have to pay taxes on something they would like to \nkeep and continue in operation.\n  So the estate tax piece of that was a very important part for a lot \nof America, and not just the ones where people are land rich and dollar \npoor.\n  Of course, I keep wondering what would have happened if a month ago a \nbasic bill would have been put on the floor--perhaps the President's \nproposal--and both sides had been able to do amendments to it, even \nmultiple amendments on the same topic, like the Department of Defense \nbill. We did 119 amendments in a day and a half or 2 days. What if that \nhad happened on this bill? Would we have been able to come up with a \npackage that would, I suspect, be very similar to what we passed last \nnight but done it with everybody participating, everybody \nunderstanding, the American public thinking that Congress is actually \ngetting something done? That would be a huge relief. I think we could \nhave done that with an open amendment process, limiting it probably to \nrelevant amendments.\n  There are a lot of different things people would like to bring up \nbecause they don't know any other way they are going to get votes, but \nI keep reminding my colleagues that when you bring up one of those \nirrelevant amendments, it might make it into the bill, but it will be \npulled out in conference committee. You still did not win anything. I \nguess you could make a big press release about how you got that into \nthe bill to begin with, but it is not in the bill.\n  I want to talk today about the questions I hear from Americans who \nsay: Why can't politicians in Washington get along? Why is there this \ngridlock?\n  Those are questions folks outside the beltway have been asking, but, \nlike may questions, the answer is involved. For many, including \nPresident Obama and Senate Majority Leader Reid, it is easy and \nstrategic to oversimplify the answer. They have identified GOP Senators \nas the culprits and the filibuster as the instrument. But as one of \nthose GOP Senators, let me give you my side of the story.\n  What I think people are missing and what some of the majority wants \nyou to miss is why a filibuster happens. You do not hear this from the \nmajority leader, but for the last few years many filibusters in the \nSenate have been designed and instigated by him; they have not been \nthrough the committee process.\n  Here is how it works. He has a bill that is popular with his party \nand whose title really sounds great. He knows many of those on our \nside, the minority, would actually agree with many parts of the bill, \nbut we would want votes on the items that could potentially be \npolitically embarrassing. In order to avoid these votes, he skips the \ncommittee of jurisdiction and brings the bill directly to the Senate \nfloor. Then he uses an arcane Senate parliamentary procedure--he files \nfor cloture and fills the amendment tree. That means he prevents \namendments on the Senate floor, and often because he believes they \nmight be embarrassing for Members on his side.\n  Our majority leader is no slouch; he picks bills with great titles \nthat on the surface anyone could support--anyone. Remember, most of \nthese have not been to committee. Who could possibly be against \nstudents or veterans or seniors or women? The problem for the minority \nis that within these great-sounding bills is usually something that \ndeep down, philosophically in our bones, many just cannot accept. An \nexample would be tying a woman's health care to a mandatory public \nfunding of abortions or adding gun control to an otherwise acceptable \ncrime bill. These\n\n[[Page S8619]]\n\nare poison pills that the majority knows the minority won't swallow. \nBest of all politically for the majority, the minority gets blamed for \nfilibustering and the majority leadership looks like the hero fighting \nhard for the cause. That is how a filibuster can be initiated by the \nmajority leader to make the minority look like obstructionists.\n  If the majority party brings up a bill containing a poison pill, even \nthough the bill has a great title, they should not expect the other \nparty to swallow the poison pill without using every delay tactic \npossible. In fact, they don't expect the minority to go along, and they \nuse it to their full political advantage.\n  Those of us on this side in the minority have been seeing bill after \nbill that did not even go through committee, with great titles, \ncontaining poison pills, come to the floor directly. We were not \nassured even of a vote to try to take the pill out even though the \nmajority had sufficient votes to ensure the poison pill would stay in. \nThat is the meaning of majority--enough votes to always win. If you can \nalways win, why stop the vote? So stopping the right to vote should and \nhas resulted in a filibuster.\n  The big, dirty, not-so-secret secret is that a filibuster can be \ncontrolled by the majority leader. If the leader agrees to allow an \nopen amendment process, permission to proceed would be a formality, and \nwork could start immediately. That is what happened with the Department \nof Defense authorization we just finished. It was a fresh breeze \nthrough what the majority has turned into a stale Senate. We worked \nthrough more than 100 amendments in short order. But if no agreement to \nan open amendment process is agreed to before starting the bill, the \nminority has to believe their amendments will be blocked.\n  The majority can vote down any proposal it does not like and with a \nmotion to table can do it quickly. Let me say that again. With a motion \nto table, they can do it quickly, they can actually limit debate. That \nis why the minority has been filibustering on motions to proceed and \nalso why the majority leader wants to end that process. Delaying action \non motions to proceed is our best chance to ensure an open amendment \nprocess. We can slow the bill down to try to get that agreement. The \nmajority still does not have to agree, and if they have 60 votes, they \ncan move ahead. If they do not have 60 votes, it has to be at least a \nlittle bit bipartisan--just a little bit.\n  The real point gets lost in all this; that is, to be effective, \nCongress has 535 people looking at every proposal--lots of viewpoints, \nlots of experience. If all the decisions are going to be made by the \nmajority leader, how does every American's elected leader get to \nrepresent his or her constituents? The people back home who put their \nfaith in their Senators expect to be represented by their Senators, not \na party or a majority leader who does not know them as their own \nSenators do.\n  The majority leader has used the filibuster count to effectively \nfalsely claim obstruction by Republicans. Remember, you can manufacture \na filibuster. Now he wants to weaken the filibuster further. That may \nhappen the day after tomorrow. That is damaging America's faith in \nCongress. That is damaging what the Senator from California said was \none of the basic principles of this body. There are already filibuster \nrules. If used, they would make those objecting spend time on the floor \nexplaining themselves, actually talking. That already exists, and in a \nvery limited way, each Senator has the right to 1 hour of debate during \na filibuster--1 hour. They can have other people cede their hours to \nthem, but it is still a very limited amount. At any point, if there is \nnot somebody on the floor to take more of that hour, the Presiding \nOfficer can end that part of the filibuster. So there are already ways \nto shorten the delay involved, but they are not being used.\n\n  Using current rules would be much better than breaking the rules for \nthe first time in order to change the rules. We have never done that. \nIt has been threatened once before. It did not happen. I hope it does \nnot happen during the time I am in the Senate. Breaking the rules to \nchange the rules is not the way of the Senate for the history of the \nSenate.\n  I know there are amendments on which the majority does not want to \nhave a recorded vote. That would put his Members on record. But that is \nthe price for being in the majority. I think our side would like to be \nin the majority and have to take those kinds of votes. They are putting \nus on record without the poison bill being obvious in the vote. All we \nare voting on is a bill title. That is the way the people of America \nlooked at it, and it worked very well in the last election.\n  Going all out to avoid votes is silencing the voices of millions of \nAmericans and tearing down the institution of the Senate and \neliminating transparency. The media usually demands transparency. This \nhides transparency.\n  The proposal to weaken the filibuster would only hasten the Senate's \ndecline. It is like adding lemon to a recipe that is already too sour. \nWe do not need a new recipe. We do not need to change the rule as the \nmajority is proposing. We need to use the great system that has been in \nplace for hundreds of years. Even now, we get glimpses of it working.\n  If the majority leader and those advocating for the weakening of the \nfilibuster were in the minority, they would speak out against it. In \nfact, they did. In 2005, when he was in the minority, the GOP started \ntalking about challenging the filibuster, and Senator Reid warned of \ngrave consequences. I want to quote Senator Reid.\n\n       The time has come for those Senators of the majority to \n     decide where they stand, whether they will abide by the rules \n     of the Senate or break the rules for the first time in 217 \n     years. . . . Will they support the checks and balances \n     established by the Founding Fathers?\n\n  That is a quote from the majority leader. He asked if the majority \nwould ``silence the minority in the Senate and remove the last check we \nhave in Washington against this abuse of power.'' That is a quote from \nleader Harry Reid. I hope he will follow his own advice and that that \nwill not be a part of the problem right after we swear in the new \nMembers this next week.\n  I hope the institution of the Senate will continue to be a Senate. I \nhope we will have more of a committee process where people can work out \nthe things there are difficulties with and bring a more consolidated, \nmore comprehensive, less compromising area between which neither of \nthem believe that will get to the floor and then have an open amendment \nprocess on the floor, and I guarantee things will happen faster than \nthey have been in the Senate. Holding up things a week or 2 weeks while \nwe go through the whole filibuster process is a waste of our time. \nAmendments are not a waste of our time. I hope we get back to that \nsystem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for the \nSenator from Wyoming and considerable affection. Indeed, he is my \nranking member on the HELP Committee, and he has been kind enough to \noffer his perspective on this question of the rules change. I will \nreciprocate by offering my perspective.\n  We were in the caucus the other day. Our leader reported that during \nthe time Lyndon Johnson was the majority leader, which was a very \nactive and disputatious time in the Senate, he faced one filibuster, \nand Leader Reid reported that he had faced 391, I think was the number \nhe used. So clearly the use of the filibuster as measured by the number \nof cloture motions is completely out of control.\n  The Senator from Wyoming correctly points out that filling the tree \nis a challenge to the minority, but I believe, if I recall correctly--I \nwas planning to speak on something else, and I don't have the numbers \nexactly accurate at hand--I believe the number of times the tree has \nbeen filled is something like 70. So there is a huge disparity between \nthe number of times the majority leader has filled the tree and the \nnumber of times he has been forced to file cloture.\n  The reason is that very often there is not agreement on amendments. \nWhile on a major bill, an open amendment process is good, I believe, \nand we have seen examples of that recently on this floor--Senator \nMcCain and his work on the Armed Services bill, along with\n\n[[Page S8620]]\n\nSenator Levin, is an example--there are also times when filibuster by \namendment takes place and it becomes abusive.\n  I can remember sitting in the chair where the distinguished Senator \nfrom Ohio is now sitting and watching Senator Kennedy on the floor. He \nhad a bill that would raise the minimum wage. We often get big, fat \nbills on the floor. This was a bill that I think was literally one \npage. It was the smallest, shortest bill because it was just changing a \nnumber, basically.\n  Hundreds of amendments--literally hundreds of amendments had been \nfiled against it. When the majority leader is faced with that--many of \nthem were completely nongermane and not relevant--when the majority \nleader is faced with a circumstance where hundreds of amendments are \nfiled on a small bill like that, it is easy to see why you have to move \nforward by trying to limit the time because the whole rest of the \nsession could have been devoted to that bill if you can't get control. \nIf you can't get an agreement--and very often, agreement is withheld as \nto a fixed number of amendments--then you have no choice but to take \nyour best shot with the bill by filling the tree.\n  Even if I am right that the number is 70, I contend that the number \nof what the minority might consider a malicious filling of the tree \nmight be a number considerably smaller than 70. Many of them might be \nmade necessary by the actions of the minority by offering hundreds of \namendments and by refusing to enter into agreements to offer a \nreasonable number.\n  I think it is a problem, but I think on balance I stand by the view I \nhave expressed before that there is an unprecedented level of \nobstruction in this body, and I say that with some humility because the \ndistinguished Senator from Wyoming has been here a bit longer. I have \nbeen here only for 6 years. But that is what people who have been here \nfor many, many years confirm--that there has been really nothing like \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/01/senate-section/article/S8620-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Mr. President, I will speak off the topic of the day. \nObviously, we are focused on the fiscal cliff. The measure is now over \nin the House, and the distinguished Senator from Wyoming and the senior \nSenator from California expressed their hope--and I would say \nconfidence--that the House will act. Given the dysfunction of the House \nand its Republican leadership, I am perhaps a little bit more cautious \nthan they are about this.\n  I remember that we did a very good bipartisan highway bill here. It \npassed with an enormous vote of 70-some, if I remember correctly, and \nwent over to the House. They could not even pass a highway bill. They \nhad no bill at all. They got so snarled up that finally they passed a \nbill that did nothing but to appoint conferees to argue about our bill. \nThey could not bring a bill of their own into conference.\n  We worked very hard on a farm bill here. It was a bipartisan farm \nbill. Senator Stabenow was particularly energetic in that, as was her \ncolleague from Kansas. Again, that was a bipartisan bill, which \nrequired a lot of hard work and had many compromises. We are in a \nterrible drought--which is something I will talk about more in a \nmoment--and they cannot pass the farm bill over there.\n  The Speaker tried to respond to having withdrawn from his \nnegotiations with the President on the fiscal cliff by coming up with a \nnew so-called Plan B alternative. He could not even get that through \nhis caucus. There is an unprecedented degree of extremism and \ndysfunction in the House Republican caucus, and I hope that does not \ndisrupt the progress we have made on the fiscal cliff. We will have to \nwait and see. Today will tell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/01/senate-section/article/S8620-3", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8620-S8621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. What I am here to talk about is not the topic of the \nday because the fiscal cliff is the topic of the day. What I am here to \naddress is never the topic of the day. It is the unmentionable issue; \nthat is, climate change. It is so apparent now that changes in our \nclimate and in our environment are occurring from pole to pole and from \nthe height of our atmosphere to the depths of our oceans. The \noverwhelming majority of scientific research, indeed statistically the \nnow virtually unanimous scientific view, indicates that all these \nobserved changes in the Earth's atmosphere are the direct result of \nhuman activity--specifically the emission of carbon dioxide from our \nburning of fossil fuels.\n  If we continue with these destructive levels of carbon pollution, \ncarbon change will not just alter our environment, it will alter our \neconomy. Very often discussions in Washington steer away from things \nthat have to do with environment and the health and enjoyment of human \nbeings of the natural world and instead it comes down to money, as it \nso often does in this town.\n  Let's talk about climate change in the context of money. Markets and \nbusinesses across this country have developed to fit the prevailing \nenvironmental conditions in their different regions of the United \nStates. These markets and these businesses are going to face real \nchallenges when our climate changes those prevailing conditions. \nWhether it is higher sea levels, stronger storms, warmer winters or \ndryer summers, no State and no economy will be unaffected by climate \nchange.\n  We are already seeing real-life examples of economic consequences of \na rapidly changing environment. The Economic Research Service of the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture reported that 80 percent of American \nagricultural land is experiencing drought, making this the most \nexpensive drought since the 1950s--more than half a century ago. Last \nmonth, Deutsche Bank Securities estimated that the drought will reduce \n2012 economic growth in the United States by one-half to 1 percent.\n  Shipping on the Mississippi River has been reduced and may stop in \nareas where drought has left water levels too low for safe passage. The \nAmerican Waterways Operators and the Waterways Council estimate that $7 \nbillion worth of commodities are supposed to ship on the Mississippi in \nDecember and January alone. An interruption of that would have a \nconsiderable economic effect. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has \nbegun a $10 million project to clear rocks from the waterway to prevent \nthat shutdown. The other option is to release water from the Missouri \nRiver, but that would just draw down water supplies in upriver States \nthat are already suffering from drought themselves, such as Montana, \nNebraska, and North Dakota.\n  Water is also essential for power generation. According to the U.S. \nGeological Survey, powerplants account for nearly half the daily water \nwithdrawn in the United States. Drought and heat go hand in hand to \npush powerplants toward shutdown. A 2008 drought put several \npowerplants in the Southeast within days or weeks of shutting down. \nTexas, California, and the Midwest now face a similar challenge with \ndrought stressing their power production.\n  In the Northeast, it is not low water but warm water that caused the \nshutdown of Unit 2 at the Millstone powerplant in Connecticut. The \ntemperature of the water in Long Island Sound, from which the plant \ndraws its cooling supply, climbed to over 75 degrees Fahrenheit this \nsummer--too warm for cooling the Newark reactor. Of course, the cost to \nour economy of disruptions in our power supply is particularly high \nduring warm weather, when energy use is at its height to run air-\nconditioners.\n\n  Scientists tell us the droughts and heat waves will get worse and \nwater temperature will continue to increase. Agriculture, shipping, and \npower industries will be operated under new baseline environmental \nconditions.\n  Warmer oceans, ocean acidification, and extreme weather events create \nan\n\n[[Page S8621]]\n\nobvious threat for our fishery industries and the marine trades they \nsupport. It is not just the fishermen who are affected but the people \nwho repair their engines and nets, sell them equipment and gear, as \nwell as the companies that buy and process their catch are affected.\n  In my home State of Rhode Island, average coastal water temperature \nhas risen by 4 degrees over the past two decades, affecting our \nhistoric fish stocks and hurting local fishermen. It is not just in \nRhode Island where the seas are changing. To use another example, \nrising ocean temperatures and acidity threaten corals, which, as well \nas being a cornerstone of ocean biodiversity--but never mind, this is \nsupposed to be a speech about the money--the coral reefs are a mainstay \nof Florida's water and boating industry. People go there to snorkel, \nscuba dive, and see the corals. If the corals are not there, it is \ngoing to affect those industries.\n  The increasing acidification of ocean water driven by the rising \ncarbon dioxide in the atmosphere lowers the ocean's saturation levels \nof calcium carbonate. That sounds boring. Who the heck cares about the \nocean saturation levels of calcium carbonate? Calcium carbonate is the \nfundamental building block of the shells of aquatic species such as \noysters, crabs, and lobsters. Fisheries we actually do care a lot \nabout, even if we may not care about calcium carbonate. It is the basic \nbuilding block of the plankton that comprise the very base of the food \nweb. Ocean acidification caused 70- to 80-percent losses of oyster \nlarvae at an ocean hatchery in Oregon from 2006 to 2008. Wild oyster \nstocks in Washington State also failed under the stress of that more \nacidic water. This is an industry worth about $73 million annually \nalong our Pacific coast, and it is faced with the threats from climate \nchange.\n  The pteropod, which is also known as the sea butterfly, will be \nharmed by ocean acidification. The pteropod is a humble beast. It is a \ntiny aquatic snail. Nobody goes fishing for pteropods, so who the heck \ncares? Salmon care. Indeed, 47 percent of the diet of some Pacific \nsalmon species is pteropods. The salmon fisheries which support coastal \njobs and economies care an awful lot about the salmon.\n  Extreme weather events such as storm surges have become more frequent \nas our climate and oceans warm. Extreme storms such as that are \nparticularly hard on shell fisheries. The National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration reported that ``because oysters require two \nor more years to grow to marketable size, full recovery from . . . \nhurricanes may take years, and some oyster habitats may be lost \npermanently.'' National Geographic noted that after Hurricane Katrina, \n90 percent of Mississippi's oyster beds and 74 percent of Louisiana's \noyster beds were destroyed. Just this fall, Hurricane Sandy disrupted \nshellfisheries all along the east coast.\n  Coastal economies, such as in my home State of Rhode Island, are \nthreatened in other ways by sea-level rise and extreme storms. The \nRhode Island economic development Council notes that tourism in Rhode \nIsland is at the absolute center of our summer economy. People from all \nacross the Nation come to Rhode Island in the summer to enjoy our \nbeautiful beaches, our sparkling bay, sail, and participate in all the \nbeachside activities. Damage to that economy would be very significant.\n  We are rebuilding from Hurricane Sandy so we will be ready when our \nbeach visitors come this summer, but it is a reminder of how important \nthat economy is to Rhode Island, and it is a reminder of how vulnerable \nit is to extreme weather.\n  Let's turn to the West, where by August of this year more than 6 \nmillion acres had burned in wildfires. A new analysis by NASA predicts \nthat by the middle of the century we can expect to match the severity \nof 2012 fires every 3 to 5 years. It is going to become commonplace.\n  A recent study by the University of Oregon--and I see the Senator \nfrom Oregon on the floor--found that large wildfires caused long-term \ninstability in local labor markets. Increased local spending fighting \nthe fires is not enough to outweigh the economic loss caused by the \ndisruption of businesses and damage to property from the fire.\n  In August, Reuters reported that wildfires were hurting tourism in \nWestern States. One small business owner in Salmon, ID, claimed she had \nnothing but cancellations as a result of the fires.\n  The New York Times has reported that the declining snowfall and \nunseasonably warm weather had been a drag on winter sports and \nrecreational tourism last winter. The reported forecast is that before \nthe end of the century, the number of economically viable ski locations \nin New Hampshire and Maine will be cut in half. Skiing in New York will \nbe cut by three-quarters, and there will be no ski area in Connecticut \nor Massachusetts. That will have an economic effect.\n  Looking back West again, the Park City Foundation in Utah predicted \nan annual local temperature increase of 6.8 degrees Fahrenheit by 2075, \nwhich would cause a total loss of snowpack in the Park City resort \narea. The Park City Foundation report estimates this will result in \nthousands of lost jobs, tens of millions in lost earnings, and hundreds \nof millions in lost economic output to Utah. Ominously, in Colorado the \nski season was pushed back at least a week this winter for lack of \nsnow.\n  I am sure my colleagues on both sides of the political aisle, whether \nfrom coastal, agricultural or mountain States, feel the concern for \ntheir State's economy as I do for Rhode Island. To protect these \neconomies, we will all have to act prudently, and that means waking up \nand addressing climate change head on in Congress. The majority of \nAmericans of all political affiliations accepts the science behind \nclimate change. Yet Congress refuses to act.\n  There is a consensus among scientists where around 98 percent--the \nother day I came with a circle graph which showed a tiny little wedge \nof fringe dispute on this question is barely visible in the sea of \nagreement. Yet Congress refuses to act. Even after hearing from our \nnational security officials about the dangers and threats from climate \nchange, Congress refuses to act.\n  That refusal to act will have an impact on the American economy. A \nBrookings report has found that well-designed climate legislation would \nincrease investment, increase employment, and significantly increase \nAmerica's gross domestic product, but here in Congress we are more \nlikely to hear that any climate change legislation would hurt the \neconomy and kill jobs. The opposite is true. We are missing \nopportunities to grow a clean economy that is manufacturing and export \nintensive and that creates the kinds of jobs that support a strong \nAmerican middle class. We are failing to protect against carbon \npollution that will harm our States' economies all across the country, \nand we are failing to take prudent steps to protect ourselves against \nthe coming changes from our carbon pollutants that have now become \nunavoidable. With the carbons up in the air, the changes are going to \nhappen. We can't stop those. We need to prepare for them, and we are \nfailing to take those prudent steps. Those of us on the east coast who \nweathered Sandy have gotten a preview of coming attractions as the \noceans continue to warm and extreme storms become more common.\n  As I said before, here in Congress we are sleepwalking through \nhistory. We are lulled by the narcotic of corporate money from the \npolluters and from their allies, we are ignoring the scientific facts, \nand we are refusing to awaken to the many ringing alarms that nature is \nnow sounding. I hope we can soon find a way to correct this grievous \nfolly and omission.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI.

Mr. President, I want to first address the bill we \npassed in the early hours this morning.\n  It is very unusual to be passing a bill in the early hours, certainly \non the first day of the year. And this bill had a lot in it. This is \nthe fiscal cliff bill. There are a number of reasons that I supported \nthis bill, but there are a number of concerns I have as well. I thought \nit might be appropriate to just summarize why it was important this \nbill pass last night, but also why we should also be aware that the \nbill has laid out a path that requires us to do substantial additional \nwork in order to avoid having that path be one that leads us into a \nthicket.\n  First, we do not pass this bill if the House does not get it done. It \nis being considered by the House right now. Then there would be a very \ngood probability, economists estimate, that the economy would turn down \nin the coming year by somewhere in the range of about 2 to 3 percent, \nand so we would go into a recession. That means living wage jobs for \nAmerican families would disappear. That is an enormous amount of \nhardship, and this is a self-inflicted political wound. So it was \nimportant to pass that bill last night to avoid that.\n  The second is that one of the immediate impacts would have been the \nend of unemployment insurance for a huge number of families across this \ncountry. In Oregon, it would be about 30,000 families immediately \nterminated from unemployment insurance, and in the course of January it \nwould be another 10,000 families. So if you can imagine a bill that \nwould have directly impacted the ability of 40,000 Oregon families to \npay their car payments, to pay their rent, to pay their heating bills \nin the middle of winter, that was the bill we were considering last \nnight. It is a very big reason why it is important that it pass.\n  In addition, the bill we addressed last night adjusted the rates in \nterms of the compensation to doctors under Medicare, called the doc \nfix. If the doc fix did not get adopted, and we had roughly a 25-\npercent reduction in payments, then what we would see is that folks \nwould have a very difficult time getting in the door of a doctor's \noffice. We don't really have a Medicare plan if we can't get in the \ndoor of a doctor's office, and we don't really have medical care at all \nif we can't get in the door of a doctor's office. So it is important \nthat we address that--again, affecting thousands of people in my home \nState of Oregon.\n\n  In addition, there was a lot of concern that this fiscal cliff bill \nwould do some things that were entirely unacceptable in regard to \ncompromising the benefits under Medicare and Social Security. There was \na proposal to increase the age limit for Medicare from 65 to 67. I \nadvocated fiercely that that would be unacceptable. I cannot tell you \nhow many townhalls I have gone to and had folks approach me and say: \nYou know, I am 62 years old. I have these three conditions I am \nwrestling with. I have no medical care, and I am just trying to stay \nalive until I hit 65 so I can get medical care.\n  That is a common situation in a country where many people do not have \nhealth insurance. To raise the age by an additional 2 years for those \nfolks who have no medical care would be cruel at best, and for some it \nwould be a death sentence. That was unacceptable.\n  Others proposed that instead of making the cost-of-living provision \nin Social Security match better what seniors buy, they proposed making \nit match less well what seniors buy, saving money by inaccurately \nestimating the impacts of cost-of-living increases. It is important to \nrecognize that neither of these elements that would have attacked the \nbenefits of Medicare and Social Security was in the bill last night. \nThose programs were not on the table.\n  Because we needed to avert a recession, because we needed to make \nsure we did not slash unemployment, cut people off at the knees \novernight, block folks from being able to get in the door of their \ndoctor's office, and because the bill did not do some of the things \nthat would have been 100 percent unacceptable, it merited support last \nnight in this Chamber. I say last night, but it was actually in the \nearly hours of this morning, the first day of 2013.\n  I supported this bill, but I have grave concerns about certain \nelements. This bill essentially adopted 90 percent-plus of the Bush tax \ncuts. Unless we continue to wrestle with the fact that revenue is at a \nhistoric low in this country and the gap between revenue and spending \nis very high, we are laying out a path for structural deficits as far \nas the eye can see. That is not in the best interests of this country.\n  Folks who are well off got a very good deal last night--a very low \ntax on capital gains, a huge loophole in the estate tax, a very low tax \non dividends, and only the very top tax bracket for the most wealthy \namong us was touched at all. It was not the $250,000 level President \nObama had said he was fighting for, it was $400,000-plus. There are not \nmany folks who are at that level, and only that top bracket was \ntouched. If you are very well off in America, you got a very good deal \nlast night, but America got a big problem, which is the potential for \nenduring deficits, structural deficits that undermine the soundness of \nour future finances.\n  In addition, the bill we considered last night created some \nadditional fiscal cliffs in the very near future, within 2 months--in \nMarch. One is that it does not address the debt ceiling. The debt \nceiling is not about what we spend, not about the decisions on what we \nspend, it is whether we are going to pay the bill after the spending \nhas been authorized. It is like saying to yourself: When the credit \ncard bill comes, I am just not going to pay it because I should not \nhave spent so much money. That is what the debt ceiling problem is--not \nto pay the bills we have already incurred.\n  What happened the last time we had this controversy was our national \ncredit rating was diminished. That means when you borrow money, you \nhave to pay more. So we shot ourselves in the foot to no purpose.\n  The time to make the decision over what you spend is when you are \nmaking the spending decision, not when the bill arrives later. You have \nalready made that commitment. You are already in that boat. You have a \nresponsibility to fulfill payment of the bills you have signed up for. \nBut we will have that ahead of us in just 2 months.\n  In addition, the bill we had in the wee hours this morning pushes off \nthe sequester for only 2 months. What is the sequester? The sequester \nis a series of mandatory payment cuts that fall on working people. \nThere was a big budget deal a year ago that I voted against because \nwhat it said is that if the supercommittee does not come up with a good \nplan, we are going to balance the budget on the backs of working \npeople. I voted against it. The bill last night did not do that because \nit pushed off the sequester, but it only pushed it off for 2 months. So \nif you are concerned about a nation in which the bonus breaks for the \nbest off are untouched while cuts fall on working people, then you \nshould be concerned about the battle that is just 2 months ahead.\n  In addition, there was a last-minute addition of a farm bill--not the \nSenate's farm bill, not a bill that was adopted in committee process, \nnot a bill that was adopted on the floor of this Chamber, it was an \nindividual leader's farm bill. The minority leader's farm bill was \ninserted last night.\n  Earlier, we had a speech by one of my colleagues, who was saying that \nit is so important that we do the hard work in committee and that we do \nthe hard work on the floor with an open amendment process. That is what \nwe did with the Senate farm bill. Senator Stabenow from Michigan, the \nchair of the committee, Ranking Member Roberts--they worked very hard \nto have\n\n[[Page S8623]]\n\nan honest, open, public debate and votes on the individual elements. In \nthe course of that, we adopted disaster aid for farmers and ranchers \nacross America who were scorched by the worst fires in a century and \none of the worst droughts in the last century. They should have been \nhelped immediately upon those disasters, but they could not be helped \nbecause the farm bill had expired. Leaders said we will quickly \nreauthorize it. The Senate reauthorized it, we put those provisions in, \nwe sent it over to the House, and the House never acted on it.\n  Then we tried to take those emergency provisions and put them into \nthe Hurricane Sandy bill. If we are going to address the disaster for \nHurricane Sandy, as we absolutely should and must, we should also \naddress the disaster of the worst droughts and worst fires in the \ncentury.\n  An area in Oregon the size of Rhode Island burned this last summer. \nThe forage burned. The fences burned. Farms and ranches were \ndevastated. In other parts of the country, it was drought that was \ndevastating. The version of the farm bill stuffed in last night does \nnot have those emergency provisions even though this Chamber put them \nin. This Chamber supported them. The committee supported them.\n  We also did something else on the floor: We said the historic \nimbalance between those who farm in a more traditional fashion and \nthose who farm in an organic fashion is going to be righted. You know, \nunder crop insurance there was a provision for organic farmers that \nsaid: We are going to charge you a lot more for your insurance, but in \nrecognition for that, you are going to get the price of organic goods, \nwhich is higher, if you have a disaster that this covers. But the \nDepartment of Agriculture never got around to calculating the organic \nprice, and therefore the farmers got short shrift, paying high premiums \non the front end without the compensation we promised on the back end.\n  This Chamber fixed that, but last night the minority leader stuffed a \nfarm bill into this package that stripped it out. So much for the \nconversation I have been hearing about good committee work and good \nfloor work. I absolutely agree with the Senator who spoke earlier today \nabout good committee work and good floor work, but that was not honored \nin the farm bill that was stuffed in last night.\n  I will tell you there is a lot more to this. Research on specialty \ncrops has a big impact on my home State. We have a lot of specialty \ncrops. The Willamette Valley grows virtually anything. It is one of the \nbest farming places in the country. It is not pure wheat or pure rice \nor pure soy; you can grow a lot of specialty crops. But a lot of that \nresearch was stripped out. So we did not get the bill this Chamber \ndecided upon.\n  The chair of Agriculture has come to this floor and expressed extreme \nduress and frustration. She is absolutely right. The Senate actually \ndid a very good job of process. It does not often do such a good job of \nprocess. It went through committee, it went through a floor debate, it \nwent through an amendment process, and all of that was ignored. So the \nnext time we hear lectures about process, I would like it to be noted \nabout what happened last night and how ranchers and farmers across this \ncountry were betrayed by the farm bill that was stuffed in at the last \nsecond.\n  We have a lot of work to do in this Chamber. The path we were \nstarting on last night is one that addresses immediate emergencies, \npeople being able to get in their doctors' doors, and folks being able \nto continue to have a coherent unemployment insurance policy while they \nare looking for work while unemployment rates are still high. But we \nhave a lot of work to do from here forward or we are going to end up in \nsome places that make our path forward as a nation much more difficult.\n  I certainly am committed to continuing the effort to put this country \non a sound financial footing and continuing to try to make the process \nhere in the Senate work better. In that context, we have a debate that \nis going to begin in just 2 days about the process in the Senate.\n  In the course of my lifetime and in the lifetime of everyone here, \nthe Senate has gone from a deliberating chamber, a decisionmaking \nchamber admired around the world, to perhaps one of the most \ndysfunctional legislative chambers to be found anywhere. There are \nstill Members who like to think of the Senate with the words ``the \nworld's greatest deliberative body,'' but they are the only ones who \nmight think that about the Senate because no one else paying attention \nconsiders the Senate to be a great deliberative body. It has become \ndeeply paralyzed.\n  The root of this goes partially to the circumstances of the bitter \npartisanship that has dominated our politics, and that is unfortunate. \nBut it also goes to the fact that as the social contract unraveled--and \nperhaps related to that partisanship--you have rules that worked well \nin the past that do not work well now. One of those is certainly the \nfilibuster.\n  In the early Senate, you can imagine 26 Senators, 2 from each State, \nsaying: We should have the courtesy of hearing each other out to make \nsure we make great decisions so we get everybody's opinion on the \ntable. That is the courtesy of not ending debate until everyone has \nsaid what they want to say.\n  Over time, the Senate grew larger. It became a little more difficult, \nbut the principle was honored because when the debate had wound down, \nsomeone asked unanimous consent to hold a vote, and generally they \nwould get unanimous consent and the vote would be held. It was \nunderstood that this was a simple-majority body. If you were going to \nstand in the way of that final vote after everyone had their say, then, \nin fact, you were interrupting the process by which this Chamber makes \ndecisions and helps take this country forward. Certainly the heart of \nit was the understanding that the pathway favored by the most is most \nof the time better than the pathway favored by the few. The majority \nvote is the heart of the democratic process. And we had challenges \nalong the way. There were occasionally periods where folks gave long \nspeeches and managed to stop a vote before this Senate went on recess, \nbut in general it worked pretty well, in part because the individuals \nwho might abuse the process realized the rules could be changed by a \nsimple majority. If they abused it on one occasion, the privilege of \nbeing able to express their full views for an extended period might be \nchanged by the majority changing the rules. So it kept the process in \ncheck. There was an understanding that everyone got to be heard, \neveryone got to have their opinion considered, but if it was abused \nthere could be a response to that.\n\n  Well, in 1917 it was abused. A small faction blocked the ability of \nthe bill to go forward that would put armaments on U.S. commercial \nshipping, and those ships were being sunk by Germany. President Woodrow \nWilson and Senate leaders were outraged. How could a small faction \nallow our ships to go unarmed in a situation where they are being sunk; \nthat is unacceptable.\n  Well, that small faction had their reasons. They believed once they \nput armaments onto a ship, they were probably going to be firing shots. \nWhen they fired shots, they were involved in the war. They wanted to \nblock the United States from getting involved in the war, but there was \nonly a small group in the Senate who believed we should allow Germany \nto sink our ships with no response.\n  So the Senate came together and said: OK. We are going to respond to \na small faction obstructing the will of this body of not allowing us to \ngo forward. They had their say, we heard them out, and they have their \nopinions. We are going to allow two-thirds to shut down debate and get \nto a final vote. That was in 1930. It was the first such motion, and it \nwas the cloture motion--as in closing debate. This continued to work \npretty well. It worked well until about 1970. So for 50 years it worked \npretty well.\n  Why did it work well? In part because there was a big overlap between \nDemocrats and Republicans. If I were to chart out those who were the \nmost liberal Republicans and the most conservative Democrats, there \nwould be a lot of overlap in the middle. It was generally understood \nthat this was a simple majority body and there should only be an \nobjection to a simple majority vote when everyone had their say. If it \nwas a principle that was of a deep and exceptional nature, such as a \npersonal principle or an issue affecting a Senator's State, and because \nthat Senator was objecting to the ordinary\n\n[[Page S8624]]\n\nfunctioning of this body, that Senator felt a compulsion to stand and \nmake the case before colleagues. In a sense it was because the Chamber \nhad reporters on the upper level who followed Senators making their \ncases before American citizens.\n  Well, over time, the filibuster, which is an objection to a simple \nmajority vote, evolved in two ways. Instead of it being a faction \nstanding on principle, it started to be utilized as an instrument of \nthe minority party to obstruct the ability of the majority party to put \nforth an agenda. Instead of it being a small group and an important \nprinciple, it became a legislative tactic of the minority leadership. \nIt is true for Democrats and Republicans. There is not one party who is \nmore guilty of this, if you will. They both employed this tactic over \ntime.\n  In addition to the increasing polarization of America, we started to \nget less overlap in the perspective of Democrats and Republicans. \nTwenty years ago we might have had 30 Senators in that span between the \nmost conservative Democrat and the most liberal Republican, so normally \nthey would have that overlap of 30 Senators so they could still get \ntwo-thirds of the Senate, and that served as a check on the use by the \nminority of the filibuster as a tactic of penalization.\n  As the Senators from World War II started to move out of this \nChamber, and as those from the House who had adopted kind of a ruthless \npartisan strategy started to move into this Chamber, we saw that social \ncohesion break down, and we started to see more and more use of the \nfilibuster.\n  I have some charts. The first chart probably sums it up pretty well. \nDuring the time that Lyndon Johnson was majority leader for 6 years, he \nfaced one filibuster. During Harry Reid's 6 years--a week or so ago \nwhen I made this chart, the filibusters were 387. Now it is in the \n390s. In 2 days I guess we will not have any filibusters, so we may not \nbreak 400. What a contrast between the amount that Lyndon Johnson had \nwhen he was majority leader and basically 400 in the 6 years Harry Reid \nhas been the majority leader. That is an enormous change.\n  In addition, normally the objection to a majority vote was done on \nthe final vote of a bill. But starting in about 1970, folks realized \nthat on any debatable motion, the same paralysis could be brought. They \ncould object to a simple majority vote on a simple debatable motion.\n  I will lay out how this has changed over the last 40 years in \ndifferent categories. One change is in nominations. Here we see that \nbefore approximately 1968 there were virtually no filibusters on \nnominations. In fact, I believe the rule was changed in 1949. There was \na question raised over whether the filibuster could be used on \nnominations, and after some debate this Chamber decided to change the \nrule and allow it on nominations. So when people say: Well, this is the \nway we have always operated, it is 200 years of history, first, there \nwas no cloture motion before 1917. In fact, the simple majority could \nchange the rules back then. Also, there were no cloture motions on \nnominations, so we have this new world.\n  If I move this podium so everyone can see the far right edge, we can \nsee this steady increase in this tactic. Note this very tall bar in \n2012. This impact is not just on this number of these two dozen \nnominations, this affects and creates a whole backlog of unfilled \npositions in the executive branch and the judicial branch. Since 1970, \nthis Chamber has essentially said: You know what. There is supposed to \nbe three equal branches of the government, but we are going to use our \nadvice and consent power under the Constitution to effectively \nundermine and attack the judiciary and executive branches.\n  That is not what the Framers had in mind. In the discussions over how \nthe Constitution was put together, show me a Federalist Paper where any \nof our Framers argued that advise and consent is designed so that \nCongress can basically damage the executive and judicial branches by \nrefusing to consider nominations. So that is one big change.\n  Well, let's take a look at motions to proceed. We see back in 1932 \nthere was a filibuster, and in the early 1960s we see a few \nfilibusters. Then in about 1970 we see that it took off. It was not \nthought to be appropriate to filibuster just any debatable motion. The \nidea was there was an issue of deep principle in which a Member had to \nmake a stand to block the bill from final passage.\n\n  Now, suddenly, we can paralyze the process by even keeping a bill \nfrom getting to the floor. What sense does it make to argue that a \nMember is facilitating the debate by blocking the debate from \nhappening? Many people come to the floor and say the filibuster is all \nabout facilitating debate and making sure everybody has a say. Blocking \nthe bill from getting to the floor doesn't facilitate at all. We see \nthis as a growing form of paralysis.\n  The same story is true on amendments. So on amendments again, we see \nfrom the early 1970s forward there is big growth. Well, previously it \nwas the perspective that the filibuster was going to stop the bill from \ngetting enacted. Members didn't know what the bill would be until the \namendments were fully debated, so a Member didn't block the amendments \nfrom coming to a vote. Again, the process grew.\n  So let's take a look at final passage. Here we see the traditional \nuse of the filibuster. One or two was the average during this time \nperiod, from 1917 until the early 1970s, and then we have this \nexplosion. No longer were Members blocking a bill on a deep issue of \npersonal value or something that was key to their State that they were \nwilling to take to this floor and talk about, but instead it would be \njust a routine obstruction using an instrument not of principle but of \npolitics.\n  We even have a challenge of getting bills to conference committee. \nThis was a case where the Senate and the House passed a bill, and we \njust wanted to start negotiations. How does it facilitate debate in any \nkind of way to block getting it to a conference committee and starting \nthose negotiations? That was never done until the early 1970s. There we \nhave it, the growth of this measure.\n  Once this instrument of obstruction was utilized, then this Chamber \noften decided to forego the conference committee. We gave up on it. \nWhen I was here in 2009, I would say: Well, let's get the conference \ncommittee going. Well, they would not do that because it would take \nweeks of this Chamber's time to get the conferees appointed and the \nthree debatable motions done to be able to get to a conference \ncommittee. What? Isn't it outrageous that we cannot even have a \nnegotiation with the House? So we have to go through this complicated \nprocess of sending the bill over to the House, and the House has to \namend it and send it back to us, and we have to amend it and send it \nback to them.\n  Sometimes there are even informal negotiations that are out of public \nview instead of a conference committee that would be in an official \nsetting with official recordings of what was being said and what \namendments were being proposed and how it was being worked out. Instead \nof doing it in public, it was done in a back room. So this is certainly \ndamaging to our process.\n  We could go on about one other area, which is conference reports--\nthose reports coming back. This is a little bit more like final passage \nin that this is before something becomes law and goes to the \nPresident's desk. Again, here we see this was rarely used until the \nearly 1970s, and then there was an explosion of this tactic not for \ndeep personal principle but for paralysis.\n  I have found it quite interesting to hear some of my colleagues say \nthis was the constitutional design, the Senate be a supermajority \nchamber. That is beyond out of sync with American history or any facts. \nThey say: Well, isn't there a story about George Washington talking to \nThomas Jefferson where George Washington says: The Senate's meant to be \nthe cooling saucer, and, therefore, wasn't the Senate always a \nsupermajority body? The answer is, no. It wasn't a supermajority body.\n  As I have demonstrated by these charts, it was very rare before 1970 \nto oppose a final majority vote; and when it was done, it was done for \nprinciple. People also took to this floor. They didn't have to, but \nthey took to this floor and explained themselves to their colleagues \nand the American public. The Framers were very suspicious of using a \nsupermajority in the setting of legislative action. They thought it \nshould be used for serious changes in the design of the government.\n  For example, they considered that if we are going to pass a treaty, \nit should\n\n[[Page S8625]]\n\nbe a supermajority. They put that into the Constitution. They laid out \nthat if we are going to override a veto by the President, it should \ntake a supermajority to do that, and they put it into the Constitution. \nThey said, if we are going to amend the Constitution itself, we should \ntake a supermajority. They put that in the Constitution. They didn't \nput a supermajority for legislating in. Oh, they thought about it. They \ntalked about it. They wrestled with it. They kept coming back to the \nbelief that the heart of the Democratic process is the path the \nmajority chooses as the right path is the path that should prevail, not \nthe path chosen by the minority.\n  So there were commentaries on this in various of the Federalist \nPapers. Here we have Alexander Hamilton on supermajority rule. He said \nsupermajority rule in Congress would lead to ``tedious delays; \ncontinual negotiations and intrigue; contemptible compromises of the \npublic good.'' That is what Hamilton thought. That overlays pretty well \nwith a lot of what we see on the floor of the Senate today.\n  How about Madison. Madison had commentary on this. He said, ``The \nfundamental principle of free government would be reversed'' if this \nChamber did legislation by supermajority. Why did he say that? Because \nit would mean the path chosen by the few would prevail over the path \nchosen by the majority.\n  There is a lot of nostalgia when people think back to a time when the \nfilibuster was an instrument of principle. Many Americans think about \nthis. They think about the movie where Jimmy Stewart portrays Jefferson \nSmith, a newcomer to the Senate, and he comes to the well of the Senate \nand he fights for the principle of avoiding the corrupt practices \nregarding a boys camp. He didn't have to take the floor and demand a \nsupermajority vote for blocking the simple majority, but he was \ndetermined to both make his case before the American people as well as \nhis colleagues and certainly eat up as much time as he could \nphysically, which was another strategy of the standing, talking \nfilibuster, so the public would have a chance to respond.\n  Many folks say that is just a romantic Hollywood thing. But the \ncharts I have shown my colleagues show the filibuster was used only \nrarely. It was viewed as an exceptional instrument of fighting for a \npersonal principle when you were willing, when you had the courage to \nstand before your colleagues and make a stand. It was that way when I \ncame here in the early 1970s. I came as an intern in 1976. In the \nprevious year, there had been a big fight over the filibuster because \nof the early abuses we saw on those charts in the early years of the \n1970s. The attitude changed. The filibuster started to become used as \nan instrument for partisan politics rather than personal principle.\n  So they had a debate in 1975, and they said we are going to change it \nfrom 67 to 60. That is where they ended up. It started with this body \naffirming multiple times that its intent was to use simple majority to \nchange the rules as envisioned under the Constitution. It is also the \nway it was envisioned under the rules of the Senate: A simple majority \ncould change the rules, until 1970. There are a lot of observations by \nordinary Americans that the Senate is broken, and we should listen to \nordinary Americans who expect us to be a legislative body that can \ndeliberate and decide.\n  This is a cartoon that came out recently by Tom Tolls of the \nWashington Post showing a Senator at the podium and the Senator says: I \nwill tell you all the reasons we shouldn't reform the filibuster. No. \n1, it will restrict my ability to frivolously stymie everything. No. \n2--and he thinks for a while and he can't think of any other reason we \nshouldn't reform the filibuster, so he asks the staff: How long do I \nhave to keep talking? The little commentary down here: You can read \nyour recipes for paralysis.\n  The filibuster has become a recipe for paralysis. It is up to us 2 \ndays from today, when we start a new session of Congress, to take \nresponsibility for modifying the rules of the Senate because we have a \nresponsibility to the American people to address the big issues facing \nour Nation and we can't do that when this Chamber is paralyzed.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the time to address this issue. I \nlook forward to the debate we are going to have 2 days from today.\n  I see our majority leader has come to the floor, and I thank him for \nall the dialogs over the last 2 years on this topic. The majority \nleader may not have seen the chart I put up to start with, but it is \nhis picture.\n  Mr. REID. I saw it.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. He has been suffering, if you will, through these nearly \n400 filibusters in the 6 years he has been majority leader, while so \nmany issues in America go unaddressed; each one of these filibusters \nprocedurally taking up as much as a week of the Senate's time, even if \nwe can get to vote to shut it down.\n  We must change the way we do our business in this Chamber to honor \nour responsibility under the Constitution to legislate in order to \naddress the big issues facing Americans.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I did watch the presentation of my friend \nand I appreciate his tenacity and his thoroughness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/01/senate-section/article/S8625-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO TONY HANAGAN AND KEIRA HARRIS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

[. . .] A wide range of \n     views and information was made available to voters through \n     the media, providing candidates with a platform to present \n     their programmes and opinions freely'';\n       Whereas such election conduct is consistent with actions \n     that demonstrate progress toward a mature and free democracy; \n     and\n       Whereas, on November 29, 2013, Georgia initialed an \n     Association Agreement with the European Union (EU), making \n     Georgia a member of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade \n     Area, removing significant trade restrictions with the \n     European Union, and signifying an important preliminary step \n     towards the signing and eventual implementation of the \n     Association Agreement by all European Union members states \n     and Georgia: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) declares that the United States supports the \n     sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of \n     Georgia and the inviolability of its internationally \n     recognized borders, and expresses concerns over the continued \n     occupation of the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South \n     Ossetia by the Russian Federation;\n       (2) encourages the President to enhance defense cooperation \n     efforts with Georgia;\n       (3) supports the efforts of the Government of Georgia to \n     protect its government, people, sovereignty, and territorial \n     integrity within its internationally recognized borders;\n       (4) reaffirms its support for Georgia's NATO membership \n     aspirations, congratulates the Government of Georgia on the \n     steps it has taken to further its integration with NATO, and \n     commends the determination of the Government of Georgia to \n     maintain its troop contribution to International Security \n     Assistance Force and its willingness to extend its mission in \n     Afghanistan beyond 2014;\n       (5) congratulates the Government and people of Georgia on \n     the presidential election of October 27, 2013, commends the \n     Government and people of Georgia on a peaceful and democratic \n     transfer of power, and encourages all parties to work \n     together constructively to maintain continued movement toward \n     a free and democratic society;\n       (6) strongly encourages the Government of Georgia to defend \n     the rule of law, improve the independence of the judiciary, \n     and protect the rights of political opposition - all \n     essential components of a free and open democracy and which \n     can and should be demonstrated in the upcoming 2014 local \n     elections;\n       (7) strongly supports a United States and international \n     election monitoring mission for this final phase of Georgia's \n     election cycle;\n       (8) further encourages the Government of Georgia to refrain \n     from politically motivated arrests and prosecutions;\n       (9) affirms that the path to lasting stability in this \n     region is through peaceful means and long-term diplomatic and \n     political dialogue; and\n       (10) remains committed to assisting the people of Georgia \n     in their efforts to establish an enduring democratic society \n     with strong institutions within the rule of law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/11/senate-section/article/S8674-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 318--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE \n     REGARDING THE CRITICAL NEED FOR POLITICAL REFORM IN \n     BANGLADESH, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n  Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Enzi, and Mr. Murphy) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S. Res. 318\n\n       Whereas the nation of Bangladesh was established in 1971 \n     after a bitter war in which it split from Pakistan, and for \n     many of the ensuing years until 1990, it was ruled by \n     military governments;\n       Whereas political tensions have at times turned to violence \n     in Bangladesh, undermining the democratic process;\n       Whereas the last parliamentary elections in Bangladesh \n     originally scheduled for January 2007, were postponed \n     indefinitely after the military intervened amid rising \n     violence and questions about the electoral process's \n     credibility;\n       Whereas a military-backed civilian caretaker government \n     held power until December 2008 when Bangladeshis returned to \n     the polls to elect a new parliament for the first time in \n     many years;\n       Whereas ongoing antagonism between the country's two ruling \n     parties, the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist \n     Party, distracts from the important needs of the country;\n       Whereas concerns have grown about religious extremism in \n     the otherwise usually tolerant country;\n       Whereas the United States-Bangladesh relationship is strong \n     and involves many shared interests, including regional \n     economic integration, counterterrorism, counter-piracy, \n     poverty alleviation, food security, regional stability, and \n     mitigation of natural disasters;\n       Whereas bilateral trade between the United States and \n     Bangladesh now tops $6,000,000,000 annually, with major \n     United States companies making significant long-term \n     investments in Bangladesh;\n       Whereas the economy of Bangladesh has grown six percent per \n     year over the last two decades, despite a range of \n     challenges;\n       Whereas the poverty rate in Bangladesh dropped from 40 \n     percent to 31 percent between 2005 and 2010--a notable \n     accomplishment in a country in which poverty has been deep \n     and widespread;\n       Whereas the Grameen Bank's revolutionary microfinance \n     lending to the poor has helped reduce poverty not only in \n     Bangladesh, but has served as an innovative and powerful \n     model for helping the poor elsewhere in the world;\n       Whereas the Department of State, Congress, and other high \n     profile international voices have recognized the Grameen \n     Bank's innovative work and expressed great concern over \n     actions by the Government of Bangladesh that undermine the \n     Bank's independence;\n       Whereas Bangladesh, an example of a moderate and diverse \n     Muslim-majority democracy, is scheduled to have national \n     elections on January 5, 2014;\n       Whereas, in 2013, hundreds of Bangladeshis died in violent \n     clashes as a result of political violence and unrest, and \n     some opposition and human rights activists have been \n     arrested;\n       Whereas trials held by the International Crimes Tribunal in \n     Bangladesh--set up to prosecute those responsible for \n     atrocities committed during Bangladesh's war of liberation \n     with Pakistan in 1971--have fallen short of international \n     standards;\n       Whereas the Government of Bangladesh eliminated a \n     constitutional provision requiring the governing party to \n     cede power to a neutral caretaker government three months \n     before an election;\n       Whereas the 18-member opposition coalition in Bangladesh \n     called for numerous nationwide strikes and transportation \n     blockades in 2013, resulting in dozens of deaths;\n       Whereas Bangladeshi students cannot attend school and \n     complete mandatory exams due to the strikes and blockades and \n     related violence;\n       Whereas many citizens of Bangladesh have had their work and \n     daily activities disrupted due to the strikes and related \n     violence, which come at a cost to the economy and stability \n     of Bangladesh;\n       Whereas a stable, moderate, secular, Muslim-majority \n     democracy with the world's seventh-largest population, and \n     the world's fourth-largest Muslim population, will have \n     lasting positive impacts in the region and beyond;\n       Whereas the success of the democratic process in Bangladesh \n     is of great importance to the United States and the world; \n     and\n       Whereas during the week of December 8, 2013, United Nations \n     Assistant Secretary General Oscar Fernandez-Taranco visited \n     Bangladesh to foster political dialogue between Bangladeshi \n     political parties and leaders in order to bring a halt to \n     violence and allow for a credible peaceful election: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the political violence in Bangladesh and urges \n     political leaders in that country to engage directly and \n     substantively in a dialogue toward free, fair, and credible \n     elections;\n       (2) expresses great concern about the continued political \n     deadlock in Bangladesh that distracts from the country's many \n     important challenges;\n       (3) urges political leaders in Bangladesh to take immediate \n     steps to rein in and to condemn the violence as well as to \n     provide space for peaceful political protests;\n       (4) urges political leaders in Bangladesh to ensure the \n     safety and access of observers in its upcoming elections;\n       (5) supports ongoing efforts by United Nations Assistant \n     Secretary General Oscar Fernandez-Taranco to foster political \n     dialogue between political factions in Bangladesh; and\n       (6) urges the Government of Bangladesh to ensure judicial \n     independence, end harassment of human rights activists, and \n     restore the independence of the Grameen Bank.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/11/senate-section/article/S8674-2", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8674-S8675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARINGS\n\n\n               COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Pursuant to the provisions of S. Res. 15 of \nthe 113th Congress, there will now be up to 8 hours of postcloture \nconsideration of the nomination equally divided in the usual form.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is my understanding that if I yield \nback 40 minutes, the vote will occur at 9 a.m. tomorrow morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I yield back 40 minutes of the Democrats' time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is so yielded.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Madam President, I rise to address the nomination and some \nother issues.\n  I want to say a few words about nominations. The Senate just \nconfirmed President Obama's third nominee to the DC Circuit this year, \nand did so without the support of a single Senator from the minority \nparty.\n  I have only been in the Senate for a year, but I understand the \nimportance of minority rights and the moderating effect that the \nminority has on the nominations and on legislation as a whole. \nRequiring the support of at least some of the minority Senators \nencourages both the nomination and appointment of more mainstream \nnominees.\n  I think in the case of executive nominees, it ensures the heads of \nexecutive agencies are responsible to both the minority and majority \nparties. Minority input reinforces the separation of powers and \nsafeguards the ability of Congress to conduct effective oversight.\n  Let me give a couple examples of where I think this is important and \nsomething we have lost once the nuclear option was employed with regard \nto executive appointments.\n  Earlier this year we had the appointment of a person to head the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. It is an extremely important agency. \nIt is important to Arizona--particularly since Arizona has a lot of \nFederal, State, and public lands--where actions of the Federal \nGovernment are perhaps amplified, and so that was an extremely \nimportant appointment. I ended up voting for Gina McCarthy. I think she \nis a good nominee.\n  I understand that the President won the election, and he has the \npower to appoint his people and his team. Unless there are \nextraordinary circumstances, he ought to have that right. I have voted \nfor nearly all of his nominees.\n  In this case, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, while \nshe was the nominee she knew she needed 60 votes. She knew she ought to \nsee not just the Members of the majority party but those in the \nminority as well, and she made the rounds to my office as well as \nothers.\n  We had a good meeting. For example, I explained the importance of the \ndust regulations that are promulgated by the EPA where Arizona has a \nproblem. We have occasional dust storms that are not recognized as \nsuch, and sometimes we have to fill out paperwork that is costly and \ntime consuming just to convince the Federal Government that an \noccasional dust storm does blow through. It has nothing to do with the \nair quality protections or provisions that have been put in place but \njust because of the conditions on the ground. The Environmental \nProtection Agency's guidance and regulations have not caught up to \nthat.\n  She was understanding of that. She worked at the State level and \nagreed to talk to the stakeholders and interested parties in Arizona \nabout this issue. She made good on that promise. We had that conference \ncall a few weeks later, and it was the first time that many of these \npeople in Arizona had been heard on the issue. They had a good meeting \nwith the EPA, and I think it will lead to better regulations coming out \nof the EPA.\n  That was a product of the process we had here which requires nominees \nfrom the President to not just go to the majority party, but to go to \nthe minority party as well. I fear that has been lost, and I think that \nis a shame. I wish we could go back to the system we had and the system \nthe Senate has operated on for a long time.\n  When I gave my maiden speech on the floor a few months ago, I \nmentioned that the party holding the gavel is on a short leash. \nBringing even the most noncontroversial resolutions to the Senate floor \nrequires the agreement, or at least the acquiescence, of the minority \nparty. I mentioned at that time that over the past decade both parties \nhave chafed under these arrangements. Both parties have, at times, \nconsidered changing the rules that would in some measure make the \nSenate more like the House. I mentioned at that time, up to that time, \nthat both parties had resisted that urge. They had been convinced by \ntheir own Members and others that it wasn't the way to go. \nUnfortunately, that is no longer the case, and I think this body, this \ninstitution will be the poorer for it. I hope we can return to the \ntraditions of the Senate, one where consensus is the hallmark of this \nbody. I hope we can get there.\n\n  Let me turn my attention to one of the issues that I think is a good \nexample of what happens when one party moves legislation through this \nbody too quickly, without consultations from the other party. It has to \ndo with the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act passed with \nnot a single Republican vote in the House or in the Senate. I think it \nis a good example of what can happen if legislation is rushed through \nwithout consultation or input from both parties.\n\n[[Page S8679]]\n\n  Let me speak about some of the issues that have come up with the \nAffordable Care Act, better known as ObamaCare. The Wall Street Journal \nhad an editorial the other day that talked about some of the issues \nthat are going on with the enrollment data. It says:\n\n       Most of Washington seems to have bought the White House \n     claim that 36 federal exchanges are finally working. . . .\n\n  They go on to explain what working really means:\n\n       A charitable reading suggests that ObamaCare's net \n     enrollment stands at about negative four million. That's the \n     estimated four million to five and a half million people who \n     had their individual plans liquidated as ObamaCare-\n     noncompliant--\n\n  They are liquidated because they were noncompliant with ObamaCare--\n\n     offset by about 364,682 who have signed up for a plan on a \n     state or federal exchange and the 803,077 who have been found \n     to be eligible to receive Medicaid.\n\n  So if we take that and net it out, it means that net enrollment--\npeople who now are covered by insurance of some type--has gone down by \nabout 4 million. I think when we consider things are picking up in \nterms of people signing up, they are still being dropped far faster \nfrom private insurance plans than they are being picked up.\n  It goes on, this editorial from the Wall Street Journal, saying:\n\n       HHS is boasting of enrollment for November that was four \n     times as high as October, yet 62 percent of the total was in \n     the state exchanges, some of which are marginally less prone \n     to crashing than the federal version. Then again, 41 states \n     posted sign-ups only in the three or four figures, including \n     eight states that run their own exchanges. Oregon managed to \n     scrape up 44 people. Among the 137,204 federal sign-ups, no \n     state is reaching the critical mass necessary for stable \n     insurance prices.\n\n  One problem they mention as well is that these figures are probably \nmisleading. They say:\n\n       A larger problem is that none of these represent true \n     enrollments. HHS is reporting how many people ``selected'' a \n     plan on the exchange, not how many people have actually \n     enrolled in the plan with an insurance company by paying the \n     first month's premium, which is how the private insurance \n     industry defines enrollment. HHS has made up its own \n     standard.\n\n  I think when we find out that there is probably a pretty large \ndropoff between those who actually enroll and those who actually sign \nup, then they will realize these figures are misleading as well.\n  Let me turn to another related issue. Michael Tanner of the Cato \nInstitute had a piece the other day where he said:\n\n       The good news, if you want to call it that, is that roughly \n     1.6 million Americans have been enrolled in ObamaCare so far.\n       The not-so-good news is that 1.46 million of them actually \n     signed up for Medicaid. If that trend continues, it could \n     bankrupt both federal and state governments.\n\n  He notes:\n\n       Medicaid is already America's third-largest government \n     program, trailing only Social Security and Medicare, as a \n     proportion of the federal budget. Almost 8 cents out of every \n     dollar that the federal government spends goes to Medicaid. \n     That's more than $265 billion per year.\n\n  As these Medicaid rolls expand, we know that is going to be a huge \nexpense and probably a greater number of people signing up than anybody \nwe thought would do. The Federal Government has committed to pick up \n100 percent of the cost of new enrollees for a 3-year period, and then \n90 percent thereafter. If the Federal Government makes good on that \npledge, it may cost us a lot more than we figured, and it will increase \nthe budget pressure on the Federal Government. If the Federal \nGovernment does what it often does and shifts those costs to the \nStates, then the States are going to need to be prepared for a big \nincrease as well.\n  Mr. Tanner mentions:\n\n       State governments pay another $160 billion for Medicaid \n     today. For most states, Medicaid is the single-largest cost \n     of government, crowding out education, transportation and \n     everything else.\n       New York spent more than $15 billion on Medicaid last year, \n     roughly 30 percent of all state expenditures. The Kaiser \n     Foundation projects that over the next 10 years, New York \n     taxpayers will shell out some $433 billion for the program.\n\n  There are going to be increasing pressures on State budgets as well.\n  So these are some of the things we haven't considered yet.\n  As we go into the new year, the next big shoe to drop will be in \nApril or so when insurance companies actually see who is enrolling and \nwho is not in the exchanges. I think everyone's fear is that there are \ntoo few healthy 28-year-olds signing up and more who are more high-cost \nenrollees and the numbers just will not add up and the insurance \ncompanies will be forced to jack up their rates, which will make \ninsurance even less affordable than it is today and could increase the \npressures we are talking about both on the Federal Government, on State \ngovernments, and, most importantly, on families across the country.\n\n  I found of interest today a story by CNN. CNN looked at four stories \nafter the ObamaCare so-called fix. They concluded in their headline \n``many are still left out.'' Let me discuss briefly a couple of these \nand it gives some idea of what families are facing. This is exactly \nwhat I am hearing at home from neighbors and family and friends and \nexactly what I am experiencing enrolling in the Federal exchange as \nwell--these kinds of cost increases. It reads:\n\n       In the face of mounting criticism, President Barack Obama \n     announced last month that he would allow insurance companies \n     to renew so-called ``subpar'' plans for existing customers. \n     But nearly a month later, not everyone is seeing the benefit \n     of this policy change.\n\n  They note that they spoke to four people in the days and weeks \nfollowing the President's announcement to see how they have been \naffected. The results were varied, and for some of them the future \nremains uncertain.\n  When we read through the stories it seems for everyone it is a pretty \nuncertain and more costly future.\n  The first person they talk to is a woman by the name of Catherine. \nShe said it is a 280-percent increase in premiums for her family.\n\n       It was in September when Catherine received her letter. The \n     much-maligned HealthCare.gov Web site had yet to be launched \n     and approval ratings for the President's signature health \n     care law were on the upswing.\n       Catherine knew she would have to sign up for a new \n     insurance plan but didn't expect her options to be so costly. \n     She is a mom and a Navy veteran employed part-time as a \n     nurse. Her husband is a small business owner. Her employer \n     offers insurance plans but because she was not working full-\n     time, getting a policy to cover her family of three was \n     expensive. Unfortunately for her, a provision in the new \n     health care law states that since her company offers plans \n     that she could afford to cover herself but not her family, \n     she does not qualify for a subsidy from the Federal \n     Government, even though she is below the income threshold. \n     She is, therefore, subject to an unusual loophole that \n     requires her to pay the full premium of a new policy if she \n     wants to cover her family or leave her job to get the \n     subsidy.\n\n  So we are seeing a huge increase in premiums. She experienced a 280-\npercent increase in premiums. That mirrors what I have been hearing \nfrom others as well.\n  Greg and Linda live just down the street from me at home. I got an \nemail from Greg, a friend of ours, the other day. He said that he and \nLinda, who are near 60 years old, had their insurance canceled because \nit was noncompliant with the new law. They went out and shopped on the \nexchange and found that the cheapest policy or the policy that most \nclosely mirrored theirs--actually not as good as theirs but most \nclosely mirrored theirs--was double their previous cost to more than \n$800 a month. That is what I am hearing again and again and again. When \nwe read through these stories, we see it again and again.\n  Here is another one, again from the CNN story:\n\n       By most people's standards, Valentina Holroyd is in \n     excellent health. She works out six to seven days a week and \n     competes in triathlons with a group of equally high-energy \n     friends. She participates in 10 or 12 races a year. She is a \n     moderate Democrat who hoped that this new law would help \n     people with preexisting conditions such as her husband get \n     access to insurance and would allow people who could not \n     afford insurance to get plans within their reach.\n\n  It goes on to say that she had a plan, but then everything changed in \nOctober. She was notified by her insurer that her plan could not be \nrenewed for 2014. The comparable plan offered was a 29-percent increase \nin premiums with higher copays as well as significantly higher \nprescription drug costs.\n  The people I talk to, virtually all of them, are saying not only is \nthere an increase in premiums but there are higher copays, higher max \nout-of-pocket costs. It is just not as affordable as it was before.\n\n[[Page S8680]]\n\n  I think the fear all of us have is that as we go into the new year \nand we see the numbers of those who are actually signing up or not \nsigning up, it simply means that rates are going to go up again and \nagain. Once the employer mandate kicks in and a lot of businesses then \nunload their employees into the exchange, we are simply going to see \nthe same problem. Only those who can afford it or those who are more \nexpensive to insure will be signing up, by and large, and too few \nhealthy individuals to lower the cost for everyone in a high pool, so \ncosts will simply go up again.\n  We can't have this go on for very much longer. This is called the \nAffordable Care Act, but I think most of us are finding it is anything \nbut.\n  Let me just go to one more of these stories while I have time. This \nis a Connecticut psychologist by the name of Martin Klein, and he is \nsomeone who has had plenty of experiences dealing with insurance \ncompanies. He has been practicing in the State for 11 years, runs two \noffices.\n  Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield sent him a letter notifying him that \nhis plan would no longer be offered for renewal when it expires in \nJanuary. They said he needed to shop on the exchange. He goes on to \nexplain that it is simply not as affordable as his old plan.\n  As we go along in this coming year, we have to find out how we can \nactually make good on the promise that was given to have health care \nthat is actually accessible and affordable for those who can't access \nit now. We all know the current system doesn't work very well. It needs \nto be changed. But change in this matter simply means that more people \nare uninsured and unsure about the future as well.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to be here and speak about this tonight \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, good morning, Wyoming. In Wyoming it is \nmidnight right now. I suspect there are people watching and probably \nwondering what the heck is going on. We are here at this hour dealing \nwith a nonessential distraction, and it is being done so that it is a \ndistraction from the mounting ObamaCare problems.\n  None of these nominees need to be confirmed, not even the circuit \ncourt judges, and maybe especially the circuit court judges. I was here \nwhen President Bush tried to fill those circuit court judges in the DC \nCircuit. And I remember Senator Reid and the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee making an impassioned speech that they were not needed, that \nthe workload was too low in the District of Columbia, that they should \nnot be approved. Of course, since they were in the majority, they had \nthe capability to ever keep that from happening. But when the shoe is \non the other foot, they need those DC court judges, even though the \ncaseload has not gone up.\n\n  So they broke the rules to the change the rules, and part of that was \nso that--we are calling it ObamaCare 2--it was so that the American \npeople would be distracted from the problems they are having signing up \nfor ObamaCare. Some of my constituents ask that I not call it \n``ObamaCare.'' They ask that I call it ``the Obama tax'' because that \nis what the Supreme Court said was the legal part of it, that we can \nvirtually tax anybody anything we want as long as we call it a tax. If \nwe put it in the Commerce clause, oh, that will not work. But that is \nthe ruling we got from the Supreme Court.\n  So right now the Democrats are trying to distract us from what is \ngoing on across this country; and, oh boy, is it going on across this \ncountry. So we should be dealing with the problems of ObamaCare. Each \nday the health care law is going to fail to live up to the promises \nmade by the administration. How many people have heard the President \nsay--and he started doing this clear back in the joint sessions of \nCongress so he could explain his law--he said: If you like the \ninsurance you have, you can keep it. That has not been true almost \nsince day one. It especially has not been true since some of the \nregulations have been put in place.\n  So we have a failed law. Let me tell you how bad it is failing. A \ncouple weekends ago I got to Cheyenne, WY, early enough to address some \nschool kids. I actually read a children's book to the kindergarten \nclasses of the whole school. After I finished, a little girl came up. \nShe could not have been any taller than that, and she said: Are we \ngoing to be able to fix this health care mess? When it has gotten down \nto kindergartners, you know that the adults are talking about it even \nmore.\n  It is a problem. It is a problem that needs to be solved. We should \nnot be playing ``the Grinch that stole Christmas'' and doing a whole \nbunch of nonessential appointments that could well wait until after \nChristmas or next year without hurting the courts at all. But, again, \nthey want this outcry. They want this to detract from what is happening \nwith ObamaCare.\n  Millions of people have lost their health care plans that they were \ntold they could keep. Of course, the President has been forced now to \nadmit that he broke his promise. But he did not remove the promise from \nthe White House health care Web site. A week ago, it still said: If you \nlike your plan, you can keep it, and you do not have to do a thing. I \nguess that might be partly true because he announced a new initiative \nthat he said would really allow people to keep their existing health \ninsurance plans this time. He should have added, if he wanted to be \nhonest: for a short time. Because that is all he gave them. That is not \neven true because one thing he does not have the power under the \nConstitution to do is to rewrite or ignore the law.\n  We passed a law by this body and the House, and he signed it, and he \ncontinually talks about how that is settled law and you cannot change \nit. Then about twice a week he changes it without authority, ignoring \nthe written laws passed by Congress.\n  So it would also mean that he would have to be willing to ignore a \n2010 administration regulation that has prevented insurers from \ncontinuing to offer insurance for millions of individuals and small \nbusinesses. That is right. At the same time the President was promising \nout of one side of his mouth that people could keep their health \ninsurance, the other side was approving rules that would make that \nimpossible. Everyone who was in the Senate at the time knew it. It was \nright there in the Federal Register. It was written by the President's \nown administration. Congress knew and the administration knew the \nPresident was not telling the truth. But he kept making the promise \nanyway.\n  When one party has 60 votes in the Senate, the minority party has \nvery limited things that it can do. There are a few exceptions to the \nmajority leader's control. But essentially he decides what the Senate \ncan debate and vote on. I have noticed if an amendment comes up that he \ndoes not like, instead of having us vote on it, he pulls the bill down.\n  Now, that is not the way it used to be. We used to be able to put \namendments in, and even if the majority did not like the amendment, we \nstill had to vote on it. Of course, if they did not like it, they voted \nit down. But that does not happen anymore. A number of bills that we \nhave done around here have been prevented from having amendments, and \nsometimes this negotiation process that the leader uses takes 2 or 3 \nweeks. The amendments could be voted on in a week if they were just \nallowed to be voted on. But this process of negotiating so that he can \ntell the minority what amendments he is willing to address of ours--\nthat takes away the right for us to represent our constituents.\n  Problems are different in the West. Problems are different in \nWyoming. Problems are different in big cities. You cannot have one size \nfits all that works for everything. The reason there are so many \nMembers of the Senate and so many Members of the House is so that the \nunintended consequences might be found before a bill becomes law. That \nhas not been the case around here. That definitely was not the case on \nObamaCare.\n  So the leader has helped the majority to prevent us from being able \nto bring up any amendments on any number of topics, and that has led to \nwhat we are doing tonight. We are taking advantage of some of our \nrights as the minority to see if we are going to get a chance at all. \nNobody ever expected one party to be able to dictate to the other \nparty. Of course, the other side did have 60 votes, and when you have \n60 votes you can do anything you want because there is no such thing as \na filibuster if you can get all 60 votes.\n\n[[Page S8681]]\n\n  Of course, you probably remember that the majority had to kind of buy \nsome of those votes. Yes, there was the Nebraska ``Cornhusker \nkickback,'' and that Senator decided not to run again, and there has \nbeen the ``Louisiana Purchase,'' and that Senator is up for election. \nThere was the Florida deal and the New York deal that dealt \nwith Medicare Advantage. Now, none of the rest of the States got those \ndeals, and they had to be done. Those are places where there are a lot \nof seniors, and it was going to take away some of their capability for \nhealth care insurance that they already had. In fact, the bill stole \n$716 billion from Medicare. Medicare is going broke, and it did it to \nmake new programs. It did not do it to fix Medicare.\n\n  Tomorrow in the Finance Committee we are going to be marking up a doc \nfix, a thing so that doctors will be paid adequately, because there was \na provision there that will continually reduce the amount they are \ngetting. Of course, as you reduce the amount that a doctor can get, \neven in times of inflation, pretty quickly the doctors cannot afford to \nrun their practice. When they cannot run their practice, they do not \nsee Medicare patients. In fact, some practices shut down. Others sell \nout to the hospital. Do you think it is cheaper to get health care from \na doctor or health care from a hospital? That drives up the cost again.\n  So one sure way to inject something not approved by the majority \nleader is to find an offensive regulation and petition the Senate for a \ndebate and a simple majority vote. We have this thing called the \nCongressional Review Act, and that is exactly how it works. But you \nhave to keep your eye on the Federal Register because that is where the \nadministration reports what the effects are going to be and what the \nactual regulations are. Sometimes the regulations have more of an \nimpact than the law itself, and that was the case in this instance. \nAgain, it dealt with this: If you like your health insurance, you can \nkeep it. But there was a regulation that came out in 2010 that took \naway that right.\n  Yes, I am the accountant. I read the bills, and now I even have to \nadmit that I read the Federal Register. But there are a lot of dollars \nthat are mentioned in there, and some of those are consequences of the \nbill. If you can catch one of those regulations within 60 days of the \nregulation's publication, and you can get enough people to sign the \npetition, you are guaranteed 8 hours of debate and an up-or-down vote. \nIf you miss that date, it cannot be brought up again, and once it has \nbeen brought up, it cannot be brought up again. So if you lose the vote \nor you lose the opportunity, it cannot be brought up again. That \nopportunity is gone.\n  That is an opportunity that Democrats in the Senate squandered. Every \nsingle one voted to defeat my resolution, and many ridiculed the \neffort. Over the next few months their constituents are going to make \nthem answer for this. I can tell, some of them are already antsy over \nit. They are already drafting bills, and, of course, when you draft a \nbill in the context of a crisis, there is this legislative rule that if \nit is worth reacting to, it is worth overreacting to.\n  So, once again, it is not something that will be brought through the \ncorrect process and ironed out so there are not unintended \nconsequences. They will have to pay a price. They need to pay attention \nwhen there is a rule that is going to affect people adversely. I have \nheard their arguments. There were a number of issues in this \nregulation, and there were two that they thought were good.\n  There is not any reason they could not have voted for the thing, \ngotten rid of it, and then brought those two back. That is how it ought \nto work. I really think that Congress ought to have the right to review \nevery major regulation, and if we do not have a majority vote for that \nregulation, it should never go into effect.\n  A lot of the regulations are written by the administration. But the \ndirection for doing the regulation comes from Congress. It is to get \ninto a level of detail that we do not handle here, but maybe we should. \nMaybe that ought to be our biggest job: to make sure that the \nregulations are what we want to have happen, and to be sure that the \nunintended consequences are not even in the regulation. We have kind of \ngiven that away. But now we need to be sure we take back some oversight \nover that; otherwise, you have an administration that is a runaway. And \nthat is the situation we have right now.\n  I fought against the new health care law for the past 4 years because \nI knew there was no way the President could keep all of the promises he \nwas making about how the law would affect the average American. As an \naccountant and a former small business owner, I understood that you \ncannot mandate that everyone must purchase gold plated health insurance \nplans without increasing costs and causing millions of people to lose \ntheir existing insurance plans.\n  In fact, I have talked about exchanges, and the exchange that is \nthere is not the one that I envisioned at all. I did not expect that \nthe Federal Government would say: There are only four kinds of plans \nyou can buy. You pick it out from bronze to platinum, but if you do not \npick out one of our four plans, you cannot have a plan.\n  We did prescription Part D, and at that time there were only two \ncompanies that were providing seniors with prescription drugs in \nWyoming. I was a little worried about what was going to happen if we \nopened the market a little bit. I was hopeful it would cause more \ncompetition, and that is exactly what happened. Instead of 2 companies \nproviding the pharmaceuticals, 48 of them were interested in doing it. \nThat created a little confusion, but there was an exchange that you \ncould go into, and you could list the drugs that you were taking, and \nwhen you hit the button it said: These are the companies that can \nprovide that drug, and this is the price that you will have to pay.\n  Before that went into effect, it saved seniors 25 percent. That is \nwhat competition does. That is how the insurance plans should be set \nup. I have had a 10-step bill since before the President became a \nSenator that suggested how we could provide insurance for everyone.\n  Another thing that kind of fascinates me is the President talks about \nhow we eliminated the caps for chronic illnesses so that nobody has to \nlose their insurance or lose their pay just because they have a chronic \nillness. Do you know what the flaw in that one is? If you are in \nMedicare, there are still caps. If you are a senior, there are still \ncaps. We did not remove those. So even that is not a completely true \nstatement.\n  So there is a little bit more here. If you cannot keep the health \nplans you like, then you are going to have a tougher time keeping the \ndoctors and the hospitals you like. We are hearing those stories all \nover the Nation right now. Of course, the biggest problem--and the one \nthat this little kindergartner was raising--was getting on the Web site \nto even be able to sign up for one of these policies that has more in \nit than what a family might want, particularly what an individual might \nwant.\n  There is a lot of discussion on that. But that Web site is just the \ntip of the iceberg. That is what we have seen so far, the Web site \nfailures. I think a lot of people have noticed that there are some Web \nsite failures out there. In fact, I remember Jay Leno saying: You got \nto watch these health care sites because there are 700 sites already \nthat are trying to steal your personal information, steal your \nidentity. But he did point out that there is one way to know if you are \non one of those phony sites: If you are able to sign up, you are on a \nphony site.\n  So, yes, there have been Web site failures. Here is what is coming: \nhigher premiums, canceled coverages, you cannot keep your doctor. If \nyou cannot see your doctor, do you have any insurance at all? I do not \nthink so. And then there is the fraud and identity theft I mentioned \nand higher copays and deductibles. Pretty universal. There might be a \nfew examples out there of where this has benefited someone, but most of \nthe people are now paying through the nose and finding out that it is \nvery hard for them to be able to afford the insurance they want.\n  So we should get ready for the next wave of disappointment and \nfrustration from the expectations created by this President and his \npublic relations machine as they come crashing up against the harsh \nreality of the real world.\n\n[[Page S8682]]\n\nObamaCare casualties will continue to grow even if the President \nlaunches media blitz after media blitz--and those cost some money, \nincidentally--in an attempt to convince people that higher premiums, \nworse coverage, and a bigger debt for this country is a good thing.\n  One of the things we were able to get in the bill was a requirement \nthat the Senate and the House come under the same rules as everyone \nelse when it comes to exchanges. That has created quite a bit of \nconsternation around here.\n  In the committee, it has improved things. I remember that about 4 \nmonths ago in the Finance Committee we were having a hearing with the \npeople doing this Web site that has all of the failures. Both sides \nwere asking intense questions because we wanted to be sure this would \nwork.\n  One of the questions was: How is it coming?\n  They said: Oh, it is fine. We have already beta-tested it. It will \nwork when it comes to October 1. Everything will work.\n  Well, I remember Senator Baucus saying: Can we get a list of the \npeople who beta-tested it?\n  To my knowledge, he has never gotten that list because what we found \nout since is that it had not yet been tested at that time. So would \nthat be considered a lie? I am not sure that all of the hearings are \nunder oath. Maybe they ought to be.\n  But at any rate, it was not ready. As it turned out, there was 26 \nhours of beta testing. Talking to some of the other companies that \nwould have liked to have tried to bid for a final project instead of \nbidding for a cost-plus job--that is what we got, a cost-plus job. \nAnyway, that complicates it, makes it more expensive, makes them earn \nmore money. Talking to some of those other companies, they said that \nshould have been beta-tested for at least 6 weeks to 6 months. Not only \nthat, they should have had professional hackers trying to get into that \nsystem to see what is happening.\n  We keep having hearings on this issue. I remember at one of them \nSecretary Sebelius was there. We were asking about the security of the \ninformation. I am still trying to figure this out. She said the \ninformation goes in there, it pings around to the different people who \nneed it, but none of it is stored on the system. Everybody is saying: \nSo how do you retrieve your records? Well, I guess that is the problem \nso many Americans are having. They put in their information, they try \nto retrieve their records, and they cannot get their records. So it is \na system that is fraught with a lot of problems and should never have \nhappened. I guess that is what happens when you get in a hurry and you \nare not ready for it and you are more interested in public relations \nand media blitzes than you are in getting it right.\n  I know the President went coast to coast and all over the place and \nhe sent others trying to convince people that higher premiums and worse \ncoverage and a bigger debt for this country is a good thing.\n  There was another interesting thing at our hearing. They said the \npremiums came down. So there were some extensive questions about that \nbecause there were not very many people who were aware of any of them \ncoming down. The explanation was that the administration's estimate was \nthat the prices would go up by 68 percent and they only went up by 45 \npercent. So that was a reduction in rates. No, that was an increase in \nrates. You cannot fool the American people that way. A lot of this is a \nsmoke-and-mirrors attempt. It is not working.\n  So what is the opposition doing? We are doing a bunch of judges who \ndo not need to be approved. That is to take the attention off \nObamaCare. Well, we are not going to let that happen. The American \npublic deserves to know what is happening with ObamaCare. The American \npublic is concerned about it. We have kindergartners concerned about \nit. We have a lot of people concerned about it.\n  In fact, we had a cookie party at our office today. My wife bakes a \ncouple thousand cookies every year. It is for the people who do the \nreal work around the Senate. It is for the janitors and the carpenters \nand the electricians and the plumbers and the guards and people who \nwork in the restaurants, and they all come by. I was surprised at how \nmany of them were concerned about what is happening with their \ninsurance and their ability to get on it. Some of them even recognized \nthe effort I made in 2010 to get the Congressional Review Act--the only \nwindow we had to reverse that lie that if you like your insurance, you \ncan keep it.\n  So during the health care debate, the President and his congressional \nallies also promised that the new health care law would reduce health \ninsurance premiums for American families. I covered that briefly. I and \nmy colleagues argued that rather than saving money, the new law instead \nwould drive up the cost of insurance for millions of families. There is \nno way in there to increase the competition. If you are going to \nincrease the competition, you need to have a sale of insurance across \nState lines and you need people to be able to go through an association \nto get a big enough group who can effectively negotiate with an \ninsurance company. There are a lot of ways of getting that to increase. \nThat did not happen. There also were some co-ops that were formed. Now \nit looks as though the money that went to the co-ops may have been \nmoney poured down the drain because apparently they are not doing too \nwell. So the disastrous planning and implementation of the \nhealthcare.gov Web site made it difficult for Americans to learn just \nhow much this partisan law has driven up costs.\n\n  We warned, when it was 60 votes that could pass the whole thing, that \nif the 60 votes passed the whole thing without a single Republican \nvote, they would be stuck with it. That is exactly where the majority \nis at the present time--stuck with it.\n  So people are learning how much their premiums are increasing. The \nmore they do, the more people will not appreciate how the President's \npromise failed to reflect the reality of the new health care law. I \nthink they really thought they might get to just kind of pick what they \nneeded and find out what the cost was. That was my idea for how we \nought to do it. I presented that at the summit with the President. He \ninvited several of us after the bill passed. He should have done it \nbefore the bill passed, but he did it after the bill passed. A dozen of \nus and a dozen Democrats got invited to the Blair House to tell him \nwhat we thought should be in the bill. The strange thing about that was \nevery time Republicans threw out an idea, he chopped it to bits. He did \nnot comment on the Democratic ones. At the end of the day he gave a \nspeech he had obviously written the day before because it did not deal \nwith any of the ideas we had discussed on either side of the aisle. He \nobviously rejected every one of the Republican ideas.\n  I talked about exchanges and said: You should be able to go online, \nhave a list of insurance possibilities. You could check whatever \npossibility you thought you needed. One of the things they talked about \nis if you are a 60-year-old lady who has had a hysterectomy, you \nprobably do not need maternity care, so you would not check that box. \nBut you would check the boxes that you thought applied, that you would \nreally like to have. Then when you hit the ``enter'' key, it would \nbring up the list of the companies that would provide exactly what you \nwanted and tell you what the cost would be. You would not have to sit \ndown with a dozen or two dozen insurance agents and hear their pitch \nfor why they are the best. You would be able to tell what you wanted, \nand then you would be able to see who provided it and what it would \ncost. Then you would have choices. That would inspire competition, \npartly because each of the companies would know what the other \ncompanies were selling things for. That sometimes brings prices down as \nwell.\n  So we had disastrous planning and implementation. People are starting \nto learn how much their premiums are increasing.\n  The President and his allies also promised that the new law would \nimprove the economy and protect Medicare beneficiaries. I have often \nbeen wondering how that would work. We now know that the small \nbusinesses across the country are not hiring workers because of the \nimpact of the health care law and the impact it will have on the bottom \nline.\n  I am traveling Wyoming, and I run into a guy who says: You know, I \nhave this great business. It is time for me to\n\n[[Page S8683]]\n\nexpand. In this town I want to go to, there is a phenomenal location. \nIt is the perfect location and the price is right. Should I expand?\n  One of the questions that I ask is, How many employees do you have? \nIf he says 45 to 50, I say: I would take another look at it because you \nbetter see the effects ObamaCare is going to have on what you are \ntrying to do. In most of those instances, they have not increased. \nThere are a number of problems like that.\n  I was in a small business committee hearing. I was kind of wondering \nwhat ``aggregation'' meant. That is a pretty big word to use. But they \nwere able to explain aggregation. An aggregation means this rule that \nif you work under 30 hours, you are considered part time. So we changed \nit from being under 40 hours to being under 30 hours before it was part \ntime, and that has caused a lot of people to take two jobs and not get \nbenefits from either of the jobs. So they are getting a reduction in \npay because of this law.\n  But here is the kicker. That doesn't help the small businessman \nanyway. Here is how aggregation works. You have 10 employees at 29 \nhours; that is 290 hours. You divide by 30, and then you find out that \nyou still have 9 2/3 employees. So by making this drastic cut, you were \nonly able to reduce your numbers by one-third of an employee. Again, \nthat is kind of a fraudulent situation to rope people into doing the \nObamaCare thing.\n  Another way that aggregation works, according to this hearing I went \nto, is that if you own a piece of one business and you own a piece of \nanother business but you do not own a majority of either of the \nbusinesses, the two have to be combined to figure out whether you have \nemployees who come under ObamaCare. That is wrong. That is fraud.\n  These things ought to be very clear. I think that if we were able to \nget a vote on raising that part-time work back up to 40 hours, we would \nsee a huge number of people who would vote for it or a huge number of \npeople who would not be around here much longer. Of course, the Small \nBusiness Administration says that a small business is not 50 employees, \na small business is 500 employees.\n  So just by changing those two things in ObamaCare, we could probably \nhave more jobs in the economy than the stimulus package ever provided. \nThere are other changes we could make in ObamaCare that would have a \nbigger effect than the stimulus package. Oh, yes, that is right, that \nis not a very high mountain to climb, is it?\n  Another thing we ought to do is eliminate some of the regulations \nthat have been put out there. I know of six regulations that if we got \nrid of them, it would not affect our way of life, but it would increase \njobs and the economy more than the stimulus. We could have an increase \nin the economy around here, but we cannot do it if we keep loading up \nthe businesses with more regulations. You know we had a government \nshutdown not too long ago.\n  I got an interesting letter from a trucker from Pinedale, WY. He said \nhe was getting a little tired of all of the people who were riding in \nthe wagon and how many fewer people were pulling the wagon. What he is \nreferring to with that is that every time we expand the government, \nevery time we do one of those new programs and put a whole bunch of new \npeople on the payroll--heck, we got a whole bunch more just in IRS \npeople who are supposed to be checking on ObamaCare. If you put them in \nthe wagon and the private sector has to pull it, there will come a \npoint where they cannot pull it anymore.\n  What he was suggesting was that if we wanted to really find out about \nAmerica, that the private sector ought to have a shutdown. It would not \ntake 16 days for us to realize the effect of the private market. That \nis something we have to watch out for because that is where the taxes \ncome from.\n  Oh, yes, all of us in government pay taxes. None of us pay as much in \ntaxes as we receive in wages. We are riding in the wagon, and it is \ngetting tougher and tougher to pull.\n  ObamaCare is something that really loaded the wagon with the \nregulations they have to pull around. It is a tremendous burden. A \nsmall businessman can't read the thousands of pages of regulations. Do \nyou know what. They have to.\n  I was able to get a review committee, and it was over $1 million in \ncosts in new regulations. That is a very severe committee. They do a \nvery good job. I am pleased with the people who run it. Unfortunately, \nagain we are missing an enforcement piece, so that again the regulation \ndisappears for small businessmen. It is going to be very detrimental.\n  We try to do these one-size-fits-all things around here, which is \nwhat ObamaCare is. Well, it is four-sizes-fit-all. One-size-fits-all or \nfour-sizes-fit-all won't take care of America. This is probably the \nmost diverse country in the whole world and the most successful country \nin the whole world because it is so diverse. We have so many different \nkinds of people doing so many different things.\n  It has also been one of the most innovative countries in the world, \nand that is where we want be. We want to be inventing things for the \nworld and having the other countries pick them up when they get a \nlittle older and steal them at that point. That is the way it has \nalways worked. But we are taking away the incentives for these people \nto use their minds to create new things that will sell all over the \nworld the way we are used to it. That is what has brought prosperity to \nthe United States--inventiveness. We invented a new government, and it \nhas worked very well up to now. We have invented all kinds of things \nfrom which the world has benefited. We need to make sure that what we \ndo encourages that instead of discourages it.\n  This thing that the government knows best--I don't run into many \npeople who think that is right. Most of them think the government \ndoesn't have enough experience in business.\n  I go back to Wyoming almost every weekend, and I travel to a \ndifferent part of the State. Over the weekend I try to get into a \nbusiness or two. I try to find out what they do, how they do it, and, \nmost importantly, how the Federal Government might interfere or help \nthem. It is very valuable. I have found that if a person hasn't been in \nbusiness, every business looks simple.\n  We should look at how people look at our jobs. It looks very simple. \nThey don't expect that anybody is going to be speaking at 2:30 in the \nmorning. They think all we do is vote, which is not true. We have to \ndraft bills. But it is more difficult in the private sector than it is \nin government because people's wages, people's food, and people's \nhousing rely on that business paying them.\n  Among the small business committee--and I keep explaining that one \nreally hasn't been in business unless they wake straight up in the \nmiddle of the night in a sweat, saying: Tomorrow is payday. How do I \nmeet the payroll? That is being in business, and it happens to every \nsmall businessman out there once in a while. For some of them, it is \nthe end of that small business.\n  We have to watch out for those small businesses because those are the \nones that grow into big businesses. Those are the ones that become a \npart of the world market. There is more opportunity for that now more \nthan there ever was, but there won't be if we keep stifling them, if we \nkeep piling regulations on so they spend all of their time reading the \nregulations that we did. Thousands of pages of regulations are turned \nout all the time. I read the Federal Register, and it is getting \nheavier to carry all the time.\n  We know that small businesses across the country are not hiring new \nworkers because of the impact of the health care law and what it will \nhave on their bottom lines. If they are not profitable, they will be \nout of business. They are not like the government. They can't spend \nmore money than they have. They don't understand why we don't \nunderstand. Why do we keep spending more money than we have coming in \nand doing it continually? I guess it is because we can sell bonds and \nwe don't think there is going to be any consequence to it. If interest \nrates go up, we are not going to be able to do even national defense. \nSo we need to be more careful about what we are doing and do things \nmore timely.\n  Millions of Medicare beneficiaries are going to face reductions in \ntheir existing benefits as a result of the billions that were taken \nfrom Medicare. That was to fund the new law; it wasn't to\n\n[[Page S8684]]\n\nprovide more benefits for seniors. Most of the seniors have figured \nthat out. I already mentioned that they have caps on their benefits \neven though the President promised there wouldn't be caps on benefits. \nThere aren't caps on benefits if someone is out there working in the \nprivate sector, which, incidentally, makes it very hard to figure out \nthe actuarial cost of a plan.\n  It is not quite 2014 yet, and most of the thousands of pages of the \nnew law haven't even gone into effect. But each day it seems there is a \nnew breaking story about what a debacle this health care law is turning \nout to be.\n  I received a letter from Jessica in Laramie, who explained how this \nhealth care law is negatively affecting her. Jessica's catastrophic \nhealth care plan, as a single adult, according to healthcare.gov, is \n$297 per month. This is with the premium support from the Federal \nGovernment. I repeat, this is with the subsidy.\n  The University of Wyoming health insurance rate for a semester is \n$452. This is over the course of 4 months. The university's rate is \nnothing new; it was available for students long before the Democrats \nforced their health care disaster through Congress.\n  Today, Jessica's premiums would cost more than any of her medical \nbills to date. Jessica recently fractured her foot--a very common \ninjury--and that cost her less than $300 in some medical bills. When \nthey start looking at the Web site, they are going to find out that the \ndeductibles have gone up dramatically.\n  One of the things that has been constrained and in some cases \neliminated is health savings accounts. That is the right thing for \nyoung people to have. Of course, that doesn't pay for the older, sicker \npeople, so we had to force them out of that system and get them into \nthe regular system with everybody else and compress the prices so that \nthe younger people are paying for the older people. I don't think they \nare going to stand for that for very long. I think they are going to be \nupset about it. I think they are already upset about it. Health savings \naccounts provided them a way to have catastrophic insurance and the \nright to put money, tax free, into an account that could grow over time \nand provide for the deductible they have. That is very essential. If \nthey keep putting money in the account tax free and it keeps growing, \nit might take care of their health care for the rest of their lives. I \nthink it is a solution for everybody. Again, it is one of those where \none size doesn't fit all, but it fits a lot of people, and they ought \nto have that option, but they don't.\n  Of course, the bill doesn't really allow us to do the flex spending \naccounts either. That is one where some people have the right, through \ntheir company's health insurance plan, to set aside some additional \nmoney to take care of health care during the year--again, tax free. Of \ncourse, since it is tax free and we want to raise taxes, we are going \nto eliminate that. Well, I don't want to. I think that was essential \nand we ought to have it. But the other side of the aisle decided it was \nterrible and we ought to eliminate it or reduce it and put extra \nrequirements on it so there was less that you could get with it even \nthough those are individual choices on health care expenditures that a \nperson has to make with their own money.\n\n  That is one of the keys to bringing down health care expenditures--\nhave people make their own choices with their own money. If people are \nmaking the choices with their company's money or the Federal \nGovernment's money, it doesn't make nearly as much difference. If they \nare not participating in a plan at all and they can get whatever they \nneed and they can go to a very expensive place instead of a less \nexpensive place, that is going to break the system, and that is some of \nwhere we are.\n  I mentioned Jessica's plan and how it is going to go up considerably \nhigher than what her costs are for normal medical. Well, Jessica's \nmother also works for the State government and she has health care \nthrough the State. However, even though she is under the age of 26, \nJessica is not allowed to join her mother's insurance plan. That is yet \nanother example of a broken promise from the Obama administration. The \nPresident's flawed health care bill is a raw deal for our students and \nfor our Nation.\n  Jessica said: It feels like the government is punishing everyone for \nthe few people who have health care bills worth more than a house. It \nisn't remotely fair.\n  Students are paying the price, and they are realizing it. They know \nwhat a bad deal has been foisted on them.\n  Karen from Cody contacted me because her construction company had to \ndrop their Blue Cross Blue Shield health insurance plan. Why? The \nPresident's flawed health care plan mandates health care coverage for \nfull-time employees who work more than 90 days for the company. The \ncompany was already providing health care plans for their employees, \nand now these folks can't keep the health care plan they like. Their \nemployees are mostly young Americans, and they are trying to make their \nbudgets work. They couldn't afford to sign up for health care plans \nthat would reduce their pay. As a result, all of her employees will \nhave to seek individual policies in 2014. Karen also said there is a \nlack of information on insurance plans. She doesn't know what doctors \nand what medical facilities will be included or even available in any \nhealth insurance plan next year. Karen is upset. I am upset too.\n  I have said for 5 or 6 years that if a person can't see a doctor, \nthey don't have any kind of insurance. And that is what we are running \ninto. Doctors are changing the way they operate, and they are saying: \nIf you are on Medicare, I don't think I will be able to take you. We \nhave problems with doctors who deliver babies because of the long tail \non their potential liability, which goes until the child is of age. \nThat creates a lot of other costs, but that is a different story.\n  It is time for Congress to heed the calls of the majority of \nAmericans and repeal this partisan law. That isn't going to happen \nunless ordinary Americans continue to speak out and demand those who \nbrought them ObamaCare keep their promises, every one of them.\n  I can go on about health care much more, and I may come back to it, \nbut I am going to talk about the budget deal because I am a little \nupset about that.\n  One of the problems we have is that we are now in a mode of making \ndeals instead of legislating. This body isn't designed to make deals, \nto send half a dozen people to solve a problem or, in this case of the \nbudget deal, 2 people--one from the House and one from the Senate. \nEverybody else feels as if they ought to have some input. No--everybody \nfeels their constituents should have some input, and that is what we \nare missing.\n  We send 2 people, 6 people, or 10 people to come up with a deal, we \nset a date so the media can crescendo up to that point, and then they \nbring us what the budget deal will be and we vote yes or no. We don't \nget to do any amendments. That is not how we are designed, and that \nwon't work either.\n  I would like to talk about the recently announced Murray-Ryan budget \ndeal. I hoped we would have an open process to finally come up with a \nsolution to our Nation's spending problems, but that didn't happen. \nInstead, we have another backroom deal put together by two Members. \nThat is bad for our country. It is tough on those individuals. They \nworked hard and came up with something, but they didn't have all of the \ninput from everybody. That makes it difficult too. It is usually done \nthrough amendments--amendments that are debated and voted up-or-down. \nBut that doesn't happen anymore.\n  This budget deal increases spending and shows that one thing \nDemocrats and Republicans can agree on is putting off the tough \ndecisions. We can't keep on doing that. I just showed how we are piling \nit onto the young with ObamaCare. Now we are piling it onto them with \nthe budget deal. Every man, woman, and child out there--a child who was \njust born today already owes $50,000 in national debt. How would you \nlike to carry that burden around and then be looking at student loans?\n  Incidentally, student loans were a part of paying for ObamaCare. \nPeople probably heard the controversy where the rates were to go to \n6.88 percent. At that time the Federal Government was paying .86 \npercent for interest, so that other 6 percent was to go to help fund \nObamaCare. But the students found that out and said: That is not fair. \nThe President said: Yes, it is not fair. We\n\n[[Page S8685]]\n\nare going to change that. We are going to knock it down to 3.44 \npercent. Well, that is still 3 percent the students are paying on \nObamaCare. But the real kicker is that it was just extended for 1 year \nand it was only extended for 40 percent of the students attending \ncollege. That is wrong. When it came up the next time, several of us \ngot together and did a little bill. That bill makes its more fair for \n100 percent of the kids going to college. We set it as a slight fee \nabove whatever the Federal Government is borrowing the money at. What \nthat fee is when you enter into that loan will be the price of that \nloan for the life of the loan, and it will apply for 100 percent of the \nindividuals. So we found a way, and it actually passed. I think \neverybody was relieved, although we have this habit around here of \nwanting to hold people hostage 6 months at a time. That is what we have \nbeen doing on the doc fix for quite a while.\n\n  But to get back to the budget deal, the plan does spend more than the \ncurrent law. It charges people in States for more things and uses the \nmoney to increase the spending in nonrelated areas. Spending cuts are \nscheduled for outlying years. We say: Oh, yes, we are going to cut that \nstuff, but we are going to do it on the end of 10 years, but the so-\ncalled savings from that are used up right now.\n  Is there anybody in America who can go ahead and spend their future \nearnings now and not have to do it on the other end, when it actually \ncomes due? That is what we have been doing for far too long. Those \nspending cuts are scheduled for outlying years and are called savings \nbut are used up right away, and that just isn't real. Let's call it \nwhat it is. It is not real, and it is wrong.\n  This bill has a lot of problems. It again raises rates for premiums \nthat private companies pay the Federal Government to guarantee their \npension benefits. I worked on a bill--the Pension Protection Act--\nseveral years ago, and the goal of that bill was to make sure companies \nthat promised people pensions would result in people getting pensions. \nWe wanted to do it without putting the companies out of business \nbecause then it falls on the Federal Government with this Pension \nBenefit Guaranty Corporation.\n  Two years ago, we raised the rates, and the PBGC could use the money, \nbut that isn't where the money went. We put it into highways for 2 \nyears. Ten years' worth of money, 2 years' worth of highways. Now we \nare raising that pension guaranty again by $200 per person. How many \ncompanies do you think are going to keep their pension plans?\n  People might not be aware that pensions are voluntary in this \ncountry. They are not mandated. They are voluntary. Fortunately, there \nare a lot of companies that realize the value of maintaining their \nemployees and so they have pension plans and they worry about those \npension plans. They want to make sure they are going to be solvent so \nthey can provide what they need to. They are liable for it. So it is \nwrong for us to increase a tax to say we are going to help make sure \nthose are more secure and then the money never goes into the fund that \ninsures it. Let's see. Should that come under the category of fraud?\n  So those savings from these rate increases will be spent on Federal \ndiscretionary programs, and employers are still in the process of \nimplementing a $9 billion rate increase to pay for the highways in last \nyear's transit bill. So to put it simply, over 2 years the flat rate \npremium will have increased 40 percent, and over 3 years the variable \nrate premium will have increased over 100 percent.\n  If you are in business and you are looking at a 100-percent increase \nin your pension costs, you have to take a look at it and say there has \nto be a different way we can go, and that is going to mean a lot of \npeople are not going to have pensions. They will have the pensions they \nhave been promised to that date but not the pensions they were looking \nforward to at the time they retire. That is a huge tax and it will \ncause companies to end their voluntary pension and their retirement \nplans.\n  These pensions are completely voluntary, and if the cost to keep them \ngoes up, companies may have to reevaluate. Workers and their families \nwill be forced to find other ways to save for retirement due to this \nincreased tax on companies.\n  There isn't anything else you can call it. I notice they are trying \nto call it a fee. The definition of a fee is if you don't participate, \nthen you don't have to pay it. But that isn't what we are trying to do. \nWe are trying to have companies provide pensions. We are not trying to \nhave them realize they can't afford the pensions they are giving out \nbecause of increased charges by the Federal Government. So that is \nwrong.\n  Under this budget deal, they are again telling Wyoming, Montana, \nUtah, Colorado, New Mexico, and other States that allow for the \nproduction of minerals on their land that the Federal Government \ndeserves more than half the revenue. Under Federal law, States are \nentitled to half the royalties collected by the Federal Government for \nenergy production on their lands. To distribute the State's share, the \nlaw intends for the Minerals Management Service to divide the amount of \nmineral royalties collected by the two and to write a check for that \namount and mail it to the States. But an even split isn't enough under \nthis new budget. In an attempt to satisfy an insatiable appetite for \nspending, the budget bill plans to take more money away from our \nStates--about $40 million each year.\n  We had an interesting situation this last year when they did the \nsequester. The Federal Government said: OK. Our half of the money when \nit comes in is revenue. Your half of the money when it goes out is an \nexpenditure. Therefore, we need to take the 5.3 percent out of that. \nWhen we heard that, we started passing a bill around and getting a lot \nof traction on it from both red and blue States saying: That is wrong. \nYou can't take our money away. If you are going to take something out \nfor sequester, it at least ought to come out of both halves, but it \ndefinitely doesn't deserve to come out of what is by law money that \nbelongs to the State.\n  We raised enough furor, and it looked like that bill could pass--and \nI am sorry we didn't go ahead and pass it. The Federal Government \ndecided they were wrong, so they have agreed they are going to pay back \nthat 5.3 percent they stole from the States. But this budget puts about \nanother $40 million each year in there that the Federal Government is \ngoing to keep out of the State's half. That is money the States use for \nroads, for health care--yes, health care--education for children and \nmore efficient environmentally friendly development of our energy \nresources.\n  It is money that finds its way directly to the people, not down some \nbureaucratic black hole. A disproportionate share of this funding--\nabout $20 million--comes from my home State of Wyoming, which supplies \na disproportionate share of energy to this country. Yet the Federal \nGovernment still wants more. Unlike bureaucrats, we have to answer to \nour constituents. Mine are telling me they do not want the Federal \nGovernment to take any more of our State's money. I am sure my \ncolleagues will hear the same thing. Whenever you have some money, they \nare saying: OK. The States are rich now, compared to the Federal \nGovernment, and that is true for almost every State. So they are \nplanning on how they can steal money from the States and give to it the \nFederal Government.\n  Worst of all, the so-called budget conference committee, for all \npractical purposes, did not exist. The agreement was the sole product \nof one House Member and one Senate Member. I sat on the conference \ncommittee, but I can tell you that I am hearing the particulars of the \ndeal at the same time as the public. They weren't part of the process \nor the negotiations and neither were we. We did have a meeting to begin \nwith, and everybody got to give statements for how they thought this \ndeal ought to go, but there were no further meetings of the conference.\n\n  Any conference I have ever been on, once there was a deal made, you \nmet again and you got an explanation of the deal and then all the sides \nvoted. If it didn't receive a positive vote in the Senate and in the \nHouse, it wasn't passed on as a conference that was finished yet. You \nwent back to the drawing board again.\n  I guess we are in a crisis here and decided we had to do something in \na\n\n[[Page S8686]]\n\nhurry, but that is the worst of all worlds when you do that. We were \nnot a part of the process or the negotiations, and it is not the way \nthis body was designed. Conference committees have a definite purpose.\n  Actually, the task should not have even been assigned to the Budget \nCommittee. The task should have been assigned to the spending \ncommittees. We were at the point where in the calendar business there \nare already bills that the appropriators--the spending people--have put \ntogether for all 12 items. Those could have been brought up one at a \ntime, probably would take 1 week for each of them, if amendments were \nallowed, and we would have wound up with a pretty good budget, in \npretty good standing.\n  Of course, I am kind of fascinated. We are about to January, and in \nJanuary I will have dozens of people visiting me. It is a long trip \nfrom Wyoming to come out here and they will come out here on individual \nprograms of the Federal Government and they will say: Please, this is \nhow important this particular program is. Please make sure we get \nfunding for it.\n  One of them is Head Start. They actually think we get to look at the \nHead Start budget and make additions or subtractions from it. We don't \neven get to look at Health and Human Services or transportation or any \nof those. They all get lumped together sometime in the year. There is \nno oversight. There are no decisions by the main body on how to spend \n$1 trillion a year. That is the wrong way to do it.\n  So this is a symptom of the abandonment of the committee process. \nInstead of Representatives and Senators offering constructive \namendments and debating spending bills in public, a couple of people \nand their staffs sit in a room and then present a take it or leave it \nright before a holiday or a manufactured crisis deadline.\n  We are going to have that yet on the Omnibus spending bill. Right now \nwe are just doing a continuing resolution and allowing those agencies \nto spend one-twelfth of what they spent the year before, essentially. \nSo they do not know what they get to do for the rest of the year. When \nthe sequester hit, it was supposed to be 2.3 percent, so they had to \ntake those cuts out of the last 4 months. The result was they had to \ntake 5.3 percent out.\n  I mentioned Head Start. They came to me and they said: We can't \nafford to have a 7\\1/2\\-percent cut every year. I said: Where did the \n7\\1/2\\-percent come from? They said: That is what we are being cut.\n  It looks to me like what happened is the bureaucracy in Washington \ntook their 5.3-percent cut but stole 2.3 percent from the local folks \nin order to pay for the Washington bureaucracy. So it was the kids who \nsuffered. The kids didn't get the money. More kids had to be taken off \nthe roll instead of more kids put on the roll. If it is going to hurt, \nit ought to hurt in Washington. It shouldn't hurt out there where the \nkids are.\n  I have some solutions for it. One of them is the no government \nshutdowns. The way that would work is if those spending committees \ndon't have their work done by the time they are supposed to, which \nwould be October 1, each spending committee would have to take 1 \npercent off of what they are allowed to spend each quarter until they \nactually get their work done. I think that would be a little incentive \nfor them to get their work done.\n  I also have a penny plan. A penny plan would cut one cent off of \nevery dollar the Federal Government spends. That in conjunction with \nthe sequester would balance our budget in just 2 years--just 2 years. \nThat would be 3.2 percent for 2 years. I think the people would say: \nYou know, that wasn't too bad--provided we didn't make it hurt.\n  That is one of the terrible things about government. They always like \nto pick the things people will notice, instead of eliminating things \nsuch as duplication. There is plenty of duplication out there. There is \n$900 billion a year in the Federal Government in duplication. We ought \nto be able to eliminate half of duplication, shouldn't we? That would \nbe a better deal than the sequester. But we don't do that. We make it \nhurt. We want people to notice their item is being cut and then they \ncomplain and then we restore it and that is how you get to $17 trillion \nworth of debt.\n  But with the penny plan everything would be on the table. It would \nhave flexibility so it didn't have to hurt. We could get rid of that \nduplication.\n  Then, of course, I am also proposing a biennial budget. The way that \nwould work is we would appropriate for every agency for a 2-year period \nso they know what they are doing for 2 years. They could actually do \nsome planning. We shouldn't wait until we are 8 months through the year \nbefore we tell them how to spend their money for the last 4 months.\n  I have a little twist in my biennial budgeting. I would split the 12 \nspending bills into 2 categories. Right after an election, that year we \nwould do the six bills that are tough, and then the next year we would \ndo the six bills that are easy. Then we would actually be able to look \nat those individual items, and then a lot of these things that come up \non the floor as extraneous amendments to other bills wouldn't need to \nbe done because they would be done with the spending part they are \nsupposed to do.\n  So those are a few plans right there. We do have a spending problem. \nWe don't have a revenue problem. We shouldn't raise taxes in order for \nWashington to spend more. We can't spend our way to prosperity. That is \nmore people getting in the wagon and less people pulling the wagon.\n  Identifying a process forward for tax reform is where part of the \neffort for the budget conference should be focused. If done correctly, \ntax reform will help to generate additional revenue through economic \ngrowth. Let me repeat that--not through new taxes but through economic \ngrowth to reduce the deficit and pay down the debt, and I am ready to \nmake that happen.\n  We need to prioritize spending. Find the spending cuts that do the \nleast harm and start there. It has worked in Wyoming. Our Governor knew \nhe might be having an 8-percent cut in the revenues the State was going \nto get. So what did he do? He got ahold of all the agencies and said: I \nwant to know what you would cut if you had to cut 2 percent; what you \nwould cut if you had to cut 4 percent; what you would cut if you had to \ncut 6 percent; and what you would cut if you had to cut 8 percent.\n  Why did he do that? That gives him four lists to look at and he can \nsee what that agency thinks is the most important to cut. What would be \nthe least hurt to cut. That is exactly what they did. They wound up \nhaving to do a 6-percent cut and there wasn't a whimper. We could do \nthat too.\n  I sit up nights worrying about our Nation's debt and how it will \naffect Wyoming children, my children, grandchildren. There is a chance \nto apply reasonable constraints to impossibly high future spending, but \ninstead we get more spending and no plan to solve the problem.\n  America wants a plan. There is nothing as universal as that. They \ntell me every time in Wyoming: We have got to quit spending more than \nwe take in. I agree. Congress should have been working on Federal \nspending bills and a responsible budget for months, and the Senate \nmajority put that work off.\n  I could go into some things on the Defense bill. I have a lot of \nthings here, and over the next few days I will be talking about these. \nBut what we are going through right now is, instead of these things \nthat are really important to the American people and will really make a \ndifference in their lives, we are working on judges which doesn't make \nany difference. There are plenty of judges out there already. But that \nis to detract us from these problems of ObamaCare and a budget. We have \ngot to solve the real problems and quit worrying about whether the \njudges can be stacked in the District of Columbia so that the President \ncan have his way. That is wrong.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I first thank my distinguished colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Wyoming, who is a good friend and a fine example to \nall those who know him. People from both sides of the aisle can learn \nand benefit from my friend from Wyoming who, as a businessman, later as \na mayor, as a devoted husband and father, has served his country well \nand has served his colleagues in the Senate well.\n  His remarks on the Senate floor tonight have been especially \ninsightful, and I have learned something from him\n\n[[Page S8687]]\n\nthis evening as I do every time he speaks. He is one who reached out to \nme shortly after I arrived here in the Senate and has always shown to \nme great kindness. I have always been grateful for that, and I look \nforward to continuing to work with him in the Senate.\n  What is happening in the Senate right now is more than just an \nattempt by the majority to end debate on nominees. It is an attempt to \nshut out the American people from the political process.\n  President Obama and the majority party in the Senate are so dedicated \nto enacting their progressive agenda that they will do anything, even \nif it means running roughshod over the minority and ignoring the will \nof the people.\n  Our Founding Fathers drafted the Constitution to prevent this sort of \nthing from happening and to protect the rights of all Americans. They \ndevised a constitutionally limited government, with a system of checks \nand balances, so that no one branch of government would wield unlimited \npower. The whole idea of this system was to prevent the excessive \nabrogation of power, the excessive accumulation of power within the \nhands of a few.\n  Under our Constitution, the President's representative function is to \nfaithfully execute the law and not to make it. Congress as a whole \nalone makes the laws, including a deliberative Senate whose majorities \nreflect minority views. Senate Democrats' recent actions are an assault \non republican institutions and on the protections that they provide to \nall Americans.\n  The current administration and Senate Democrats view the Constitution \nas an impediment to the enactment of their agenda. This is why the \nPresident illegally amended the Affordable Care Act--a law passed by \nCongress--through executive action instead of asking Congress to amend \nit. It is also why Democrats are willing to break the rules of the \nSenate in order to change the rules of the Senate so that they can more \nquickly, more easily confirm the President's nominees.\n  Make no mistake. The executive and judicial nominees we are \nconsidering will be tasked with implementing and upholding President \nObama's agenda. Congress is a representative body and is the only \nbranch of government given the constitutional authority to make laws. \nWe represent the people. When the President illegally changes the law \nor when he tramples on the rights of the minority in the Senate, he \nguarantees that the people will have no voice and no representation. \nThese are not trivial matters. These are not matters that we can \ncasually cavalierly cast aside. These are matters of great importance.\n  We have to remember what happened just a few short months ago, when \nwe were told on July 2 of this year that President Obama had decided to \nchange the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in several \nmeaningful ways.\n  This of course was a law that was passed without consensus. It was \npassed without any semblance of bipartisanship. It was a law that was \npassed without a single Republican vote. Not a single Republican voted \nfor it in the Senate; not a single Republican voted for it in the \nHouse. All 2,700 pages of this law--a law that wasn't read before it \nwas passed, a law that we were told Members would have to pass in order \nto find out what was in it--this law took effect. Over time, as the \nAmerican people learned about the law's contents, they didn't grow more \nfavorably predisposed toward the law.\n  The law has in fact never enjoyed the support of a solid majority of \nAmericans, but over time its popularity has tended to diminish. Perhaps \nseeing this, President Obama on July 2 of this year chose to wield his \nexecutive pen in such a way as to amend that law.\n  He chose, among other things, to announce that although the law \ncontains a number of deadlines, a number of start dates, that he would \nnot be enforcing the employer mandate in the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act. He would of course still be enforcing, as of the \nJanuary 1 start date, the individual mandate. But he would not be \nimplementing or enforcing, at least for the first year of the law's \nfull operation, the employer mandate. Of course, he had no authority to \ndo this. The Constitution sets in place a system for making law.\n  In order to become law, a legislative proposal has to make its way \nthrough the House of Representatives, has to make its way through the \nSenate, has to be passed by most of the people in the House and in the \nSenate, and then it has to be presented to the President consistent \nwith article I, section 7, clause 2 of the Constitution before it may \nbecome law.\n  But of course, once it is law, it is law; and a law passed under one \nadministration can't simply be vetoed or fundamentally altered by a \nsubsequent President. In fact, it can't be vetoed or subsequently \naltered by even the same President who signed it into law in the first \nplace. And yet, that is in some respects exactly what happened here.\n  The President modified the law. He was too impatient, too unwilling--\ntoo unwilling to defer to the legislative branch, too unwilling to \nrespect the oath that he took to uphold, protect, and defend the \nConstitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic, too disrespectful \nof that very document, our founding document that has fostered the \ndevelopment of the greatest civilization the world has ever known. Too \nunwilling to defer to that document in order to follow its most basic \nprecepts and its most basic commands.\n  He suggested that he needed to do this because the law wasn't ready \nto be implemented. He later suggested that he did this because he had \nto do it because, as he put it: Under normal conditions, under more \nideal conditions, obviously the thing to do if you wanted to change the \nlaw would be to go back with that branch of government charged with \nmaking the law--that branch of government which passed it into law in \nthe first place--Congress. But, as he pointed out, these are not ideal \ncircumstances.\n  No, they are not ideal. Not ideal, because he controls only one \ndivision of the legislative branch of government, the Senate. The \nSenate is under the control of his party and the House of \nRepresentatives isn't.\n  This can hardly justify this kind of blatant usurpation of \nlegislative authority. This can hardly justify a President taking upon \nhimself the sole task of changing legislation. It is in fact an act of \nlegislation unto itself. Yet this is what he did by a stroke of the \nexecutive pen. This is exactly what the Founding Fathers tried to \nprotect against, this kind of unilateral action by the executive, this \nkind of accumulation of power in the hands of the few--or, in this \ncase, the hands of one person. Yet this is what he did, and he has done \nit on several occasions.\n  Some people have suggested that if what the President did was wrong, \nif it was unconstitutional, if it wasn't authorized by the \nConstitution--which it wasn't--if it wasn't authorized by an act of \nCongress, either the Affordable Care Act or some other statute--and it \nwasn't--then perhaps the courts can and should and must and will remedy \nthe constitutional problem embodied in that act. There are some \nproblems with that.\n  First of all, as we all know, not every unconstitutional act can \nnecessarily be remedied in court. Many unconstitutional acts are \nthemselves outside the purview of the Federal courts' ability to \nreview. In some cases, an unconstitutional act might be something that \nthe courts consider a nonjusticiable political question, not subject to \nthe court's authority, or something that the courts aren't willing to \nwade into.\n  In other circumstances, an unconstitutional act might occur in a \nsituation in which no one party is likely to be able to develop and \nestablish article III standing in order to challenge that \nunconstitutional act.\n  In order to establish article III standing--in other words, in order \nto establish the right to sue in Federal court--article III of the \nConstitution requires that the plaintiff be able to establish that the \nplaintiff has suffered an injury in fact, an injury in fact that is \nfairly traceable to the conduct of the defendant, and, thirdly, that it \nis subject to redress by the authority of the court.\n  In this circumstance, one must ask the question: Does anyone really \nhave standing? Can anyone really establish the kind of standing in \norder to challenge the President's refusal to implement and enforce the \nindividual mandate while refusing or declining to enforce and implement \nthe employer mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act?\n  Who has standing to do that? Who has been harmed by that? One could\n\n[[Page S8688]]\n\nsuggest, I suppose, that an employer might want to look into that. But \nwhen they would examine the situation, most or all employers would \nprobably have to acknowledge that they have been given a reprieve. So \nemployers, No. 1, are not likely to be aggrieved by it in the sense \nthat they are not likely to feel the need to sue; and, No. 2, if they \nwere to try to sue, it seems to me they would have a very difficult \ntime establishing in a court of law the fact that they had suffered an \ninjury in fact.\n  Who else might do it? Most constitutional scholars would conclude--\nprobably correctly--that a Member of Congress would lack article III \nstanding under the applicable Supreme Court precedent, Flast v. Cohen \nand other Supreme Court precedents. Merely being a Member of Congress \nis not necessarily enough to give a person article III standing.\n  So I think it is very difficult to reach the conclusion that anyone--\nat least obviously--has article III standing to sue.\n  So we cannot necessarily rely on the courts to be able to undo this \nconstitutional damage, to be able to seek an adequate remedy in a court \nof law for this blatant insult to the U.S. Constitution. Even if they \ncould, moreover, even if somebody could establish article III standing, \neven if somebody could come before an article III Federal judge and \nconvince that judge that they have standing, would that Federal court \nbe in a position to dispose of this case within the roughly 1-year \nperiod in which this provision of the law is effectively suspended? It \ntakes a lot of time to litigate a case all the way through to \ncompletion, and I think it is doubtful whether somebody would be able \nto bring an action in Federal court and have it be fully litigated all \nthe way through to judgment in the roughly 1-year period in which it \nwould still be relevant.\n  If you could not get it done in that time period, then it would \nappear very likely that the case would be rendered moot at that point. \nSo this, quite simply, is the kind of case in which no Federal suit is \nlikely to be brought and if one is brought it would likely fail. So \nthat is yet another reason why we as a Congress ought to be looking \nvery closely at this, you see, because this is one of those many \ninstances in which it is possible that someone can violate the U.S. \nConstitution, here the President of the United States, without the \ncourts being in a position to effectively remedy that constitutional \ndefect.\n  We too as Members of this body have taken an oath to uphold the \nConstitution of the United States. In my mind, that means doing more \nthan simply refraining from that which the Supreme Court of the United \nStates would obviously invalidate. To my mind, that means more than \nsimply saying: If someone has violated the U.S. Constitution, then I am \nsure the courts will take care of it. We simply know that is not true. \nWe know that in many circumstances--and I have just outlined a couple \nof them--the courts are not in a position to be able to remedy a \nconstitutional defect, to be able to remedy a blatant insult to the \nConstitution and an absolute violation of the Constitution's \nprovisions.\n  So we need to continue to hold this President accountable when he \nfails, quite blatantly in this circumstance, to do that which the \nConstitution requires. This is a question that I think is particularly \nimportant, not only in light of how this particular act of Congress \ncame to be, not only in light of how it was enacted and the fact that \nit is 2,700 pages long, that it has now resulted in 20,000 pages of \nregulatory implementing text but also in light of the fact that it was \nchallenged in court; that is, the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act was challenged in court as to its constitutionality, but it \nwas upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in a most unusual \nfashion. Let's talk about that for just a moment.\n  A number of States and a few others banded together and challenged in \nFederal court a few years ago Congress's power to enact certain \nprovisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Among \nthose provisions that they challenged were the individual mandate. The \nargument was Congress lacks the power asserted by Congress in the \nAffordable Care Act, pursuant to article I section 8 clause 3, the \ncommerce clause, to tell individual Americans that they must buy a \nproduct--health insurance; not just any health insurance but that \nspecific kind of health insurance that Congress in its infinite wisdom \ndeemed absolutely essential for every American to purchase. The \nchallenge asserted that Congress lacks this power under the commerce \nclause.\n  The lawsuit also alleged among other things that Congress lacked the \npower to tell States that the States had to expand their Medicaid \nPrograms and gave the States no choice; that this, too, violated the \nConstitution, that it exceeded certain limitations on Congress's power \nbecause the courts have long recognized that Congress lacks the power \nto commandeer the States' legislative and administrative machinery in \norder to carry out a Federal program.\n  Congress has the power to encourage States, to ask States to do this, \nbut it lacks the power to direct a State to do X or Y or Z. We cannot \njust tell a State to do something just because we want it to be done. \nWe might be able to persuade the State to do something. We might even \nbe able to fund the State, to offer funding in case a State wants to \nparticipate in a given program, but we lack the power to dictate to \nStates that they do such a thing.\n  In this circumstance, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \nwas unmistakable in its clarity. It simply told the States they had to \nexpand their Medicaid programs in the fashion outlined in the Act \nitself.\n  So these two core pieces, these two core aspects of this judicial \nchallenge made their way up through the Federal court system, made \ntheir way up to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Court \ndecided these two issues, as I said a moment ago, in a most unusual \nfashion. Turning to the commerce clause issue, the Court addressed that \nissue right after addressing another issue that was sort of a \njurisdictional question, an introductory question. The Court had to \ndetermine first of all, before it even got to the merits of the \nconstitutional challenge as to the individual mandate in the Affordable \nCare Act--it had to address the question of whether the individual \nmandate and the enforcement mechanism attached to it could fairly be \ncharacterized as a tax, for purposes relevant to the so-called anti-\ninjunction act, a Civil War-era statute that basically says that any \ntime someone wants to challenge a tax in Federal court they have to \nwait until such time as that tax is actually being collected. Then that \nchallenge is brought as against the attempted enforcement of the tax \nstatute.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States, using centuries' worth of \njurisprudence, looked at the language of the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act, it looked at the manner in which it was written, \nand easily concluded, no, this is not a tax. This is a penalty. Because \nit is a penalty and it is not a tax, we, the Court, may proceed to \nconsider the merits of the arguments brought up in this case, the \nmerits of this challenge brought as to Congress's authority, vel non, \nto enact something like this, the individual mandate under the commerce \nclause. So the Court quickly dispensed with that issue and reached the \nmerits of the constitutional question before it.\n  The Court then went on to conclude that Congress does, in fact, lack \nthe power under the commerce clause, under article I, section 8, clause \n3 of the Constitution, to tell individual Americans they must buy a \nparticular product, health insurance; not just any health insurance but \nthe specific kind of health insurance that Congress told the American \npeople they have to buy in the Affordable Care Act.\n\n  The Court fairly easily and, in my opinion, correctly, decided that \nCongress lacks that power because of the fact that the power Congress \nhas to regulate interstate commerce is meaningfully different than the \npower to compel individuals to enter into commerce, to regulate \ninactivity, to punish inactivity, to punish the failure to buy a \nparticular product that the people might not want to buy.\n  You see, for a long time we had this understanding as Americans that \nthe power given to Congress was in fact limited. We look at all the \nauthorities granted to Congress under the Constitution, the \noverwhelming majority of which can be found in article I, section 8. \nAll of these were limited and\n\n[[Page S8689]]\n\nthey were limited with good reason. They were limited with good reason \nbecause that played a very large part, that played a very significant \nrole in how and why we became a country.\n  We broke away from Great Britain, not just because we grew tired of \nhaving a monarch but because we grew tired of the authority of a \nparliament--a parliament that not only refused to grant us any \nrepresentation but also a parliament that refused to acknowledge any \nnatural limit on its power to regulate us, and it did in fact regulate \nus and it regulated us heavily, mercilessly. It taxed us overwhelmingly \nand it refused to recognize any meaningful--failed, refused to \nrecognize any meaningful limit on its own authority.\n  That is one of the reasons we became our own country. That is one of \nthe reasons the Founding Fathers put in place this system in which our \nnational legislative body would be vested with only a few specifically \nlisted or enumerated powers. The founding generation understood that \neach of those powers would in fact be limited, so much so, in fact, \nthat James Madison described the powers given to Congress as few and \ndefined and characterized those reserved to the States as numerous and \nindefinite.\n  During the first 140, 150 years or so of our Republic's existence, we \nas a people continued to recognize the necessarily limited nature of \nCongress's power. Much of that started to change during the New Deal \nera in which President Franklin D. Roosevelt, with the assistance of \nDemocratic majorities in the House and in the Senate, pushed forward \nwith a very progressive agenda, one that expanded not only the role of \ngovernment in general but also the role of the Federal Government in \nparticular.\n  Initially, the Supreme Court resisted and the Supreme Court \nacknowledged the fact that the powers granted to Congress under the \nspending clause and the commerce clause were, in fact, limited. But the \nmore FDR and the more Congress pushed back against the Supreme Court, \nthe more the Supreme Court seemed inclined to relent. Ultimately, we \nsaw the Supreme Court of the United States back down in the late 1930s \nfrom its what had been previously more rigorous, more restrictive \ninterpretations of the spending clause and of the commerce clause.\n  The Supreme Court ended up adopting a set of rules that would \nbasically say that as long as Congress was acting broadly within the \nfield of what could be loosely considered a regulation of interstate \ncommerce, that the courts would stay away in second-guessing Congress's \ndeterminations.\n  The Court, starting out with a case called NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin \nSteel in 1937 and culminating in another case 5 years later in Wickard \nv. Filburn in 1942, ended up concluding that Congress may, without \ninterference from the courts, regulate any activity that when measured \nand evaluated in the aggregate, has a substantial effect on interstate \ncommerce. Regardless of whether the discrete activity in question might \nactually occur entirely intrastate, Congress would be able to regulate \nthat activity pursuant to its commerce clause authority, regardless of \nhow intrastate that activity might be when viewed in isolation.\n  Under this very broad interpretation, Congress's power could, in a \nsense, be viewed as extending to virtually every aspect of human \nexistence because, after all, almost everything we do when measured in \nthe aggregate might well be understood to have a substantial effect on \ninterstate commerce. Yet even under that broad analysis, that couldn't \nextend to what was being regulated in the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act--in the individual mandated provision, which was \ninactivity. Remember, this is an enormous breadth that the Supreme \nCourt said Congress could, without interference from the courts, \nregulate under its commerce clause authority.\n\n  In Wicker v. Filburn what was at issue was the cultivation of wheat. \nCongress adopted a statutory framework in which farmers would be \nseverely restricted in how much wheat they could grow--how much they \ncould produce of this or that agricultural commodity.\n  There was a farmer named Roscoe Filburn who committed a grave offense \nagainst the Republic. His offense did not involve dealing drugs; it \ndidn't involve murder or kidnapping. His offense involved growing too \nmuch wheat.\n  Roscoe Filburn grew more wheat than Congress--in its infinite \nwisdom--viewed appropriate for any American to grow. He was fined many \nthousands of dollars, which during the New Deal era was an enormous \namount of money because of the fact that he grew too much wheat.\n  Roscoe Filburn was fortunate in that he had access to some good \nlawyers, and his lawyers advised him on this. They represented him \naggressively and competently in court. What they argued, relying on \ntrue facts, was that, yes, our client Roscoe Filburn did, in fact, grow \nwheat in excess of the limit imposed by Federal law, but the amount of \nwheat he grew in excess of the grain production limit applicable to his \nfarm that year was grain that never entered interstate commerce.\n  In fact, it never entered commerce at all. You see, that grain never \neven left Roscoe Filburn's farm. He used it on his farm to feed his \nfamily, to feed his livestock, and he held on to the remainder of it to \nuse as seed for a subsequent planting season.\n  In a very real sense that wheat was not part of interstate commerce \nat all. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court of the United States, lacking \nnothing in imagination, said that even that wheat was within Congress's \nalmighty grasp--within the all-knowing, wise reach of the Federal \nsovereign. What the Court said was that the wheat grown by Roscoe \nFilburn in excess of the grain production quota was itself something \nthat when viewed in the aggregate, could substantially affect \ninterstate commerce.\n  In other words, if lots of farmers everywhere--just like Roscoe \nFilburn--grew too much wheat, even if their wheat never entered instate \ncommerce, the growing of all of that excess wheat would inevitably have \nan impact on the supply and demand and ultimately the price and \navailability of wheat on the interstate market. Therefore, even that \nwheat which was entirely locally grown and locally consumed would be \nsubject to Congress's reach.\n  Wicker v. Filburn thus erected an extraordinarily low barrier for \nCongress to clear in establishing that it had properly invoked its \nauthority under the commerce clause. Yet even that extraordinarily low \nbarrier was high enough to stop Congress from acting pursuant to the \ncommerce clause in enacting the individual mandate under the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act. Thus ended the Supreme Court's \nanalysis in June 2012 when it ruled that Congress had exceeded its \nconstitutional limits under the commerce clause in enacting the \nindividual mandate.\n  Significantly, this was only the third time in about 75 years--only \nthe third time since NLRB v. Jones and Laughlin Steel and Wicker v. \nFilburn--in which the Supreme Court of the United States recognized \nCongress had overstepped its limits under the commerce clause. This was \na rare thing for the court to do. It was foreseeable because the \nindividual mandate in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \nwent so far beyond anything that had ever been seen before. Yet it was \nonly the third time in the last 75 years in which that had happened.\n  Then something different happened--something very few people on \neither side of the aisle in this body or on either side of the \npolitical divide in America generally had seen. After concluding that \nCongress lacked this power under the commerce clause, the Supreme \nCourt, under the pen of Chief Justice John Roberts, proceeded to \nanalyze the government's backup argument; that is, the argument that \neven if, as the Court had now concluded, Congress lacked the power to \ndo this under the commerce clause, Congress still had the power to do \nthis consistent with its power to impose taxes.\n  The Court went on to conclude that Congress did have this power. \nStrangely, the Court also went on to conclude that is essentially what \nCongress had done here.\n  This was odd on many levels. No. 1, the Court had already concluded, \nas it had to conclude in order to proceed to the case--as it had to \nconclude in order to exercise jurisdiction over this case--prior to the \nimplementation of the law, prior to the collection of this alleged tax, \nthat it was, in fact, not a tax but\n\n[[Page S8690]]\n\na penalty. It was very strange that the Court was now basically saying: \nOK, it is a penalty and not a tax for some purposes, but it is a tax \nand not a penalty for other purposes. Yet that is what the Court did.\n  It was also strange that the Court did this for the additional reason \nthat Congress had considered legislative proposals in a different, \nearlier iteration of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \nthat would have enforced the individual mandate by means of a tax.\n  Congress considered language that would have done that. Congress \nknew, and still knows, how to enact legislative language that imposes a \nnew tax. Yet when it tried to use that language, language that under \n100 years' worth of jurisprudence everyone understands would have \nimposed a tax, Congress could not get the votes to pass it even in what \nwas then a Congress in which the Democratic Party dominated both \nHouses.\n  Even in that Congress they tried but failed to get the requisite \nnumber of votes to pass the individual mandate enforced by means of a \ntax. They could not do it. It was therefore very odd that the Supreme \nCourt of the United States would interpret what Congress couldn't pass \nas a tax in such a way as to make it a tax for constitutional purposes \nwhen Congress itself didn't have the votes to do it.\n  In order to pass legislation raising revenue--in other words, in \norder to pass legislation imposing a new tax--the Constitution requires \nthat legislation of that sort originate in the House of \nRepresentatives. Why is this? I think most who looked at the issue \nwould agree it has do with the fact that the House of Representatives \nis the entity within our Federal Government structure that is, by \ndesign, most representative of the people.\n  In the Senate we have elections every 6 years. In the House it is \nevery 2 years. From the outset the House was the body in which the \npeople were represented because, of course, at the outset the Senate \nwas the body in which the States were represented. That is no longer \nthe case. We are directly elected by the people.\n  But it was always the case, and still is the case, that tax \nlegislation must start in the House because it is the body closest to \nthe people and most responsive to the needs and the desires and the \nconcerns of the people. It is therefore quite ironic that this law--\nthis tax, as the Supreme Court called it--was put into place as a tax, \nnot by the body within the Federal Government that is most accountable \nto the people, the House of Representatives, but instead by the body \nwithin the Federal Government that is the very least accountable to the \npeople, the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  I believe this amounted to a usurpation of constitutional authority. \nI believe this amounted to a betrayal of the judicial oaths of the five \nrobe-wearing men and women who signed on to that opinion. They did not \nhave the power to legislate. They did not have the power to create a \ntax. They did not have the power to create out of whole cloth tax \nlanguage out of penalty language--language that under a century's worth \nof jurisprudence, the Court's own precedence carrying stare decisis \neffect made clear it was a penalty and not a tax. Yet that is exactly \nwhat the Court did.\n  When people discover this--when they learn about and hear about it \nand dare to plow through the Supreme Court's opinion so they can \nunderstand what happens, they will inevitably ask: How can the Court do \nthis? Does the Court have that power--the power to legislate, the power \nto impose a tax where Congress has not chosen to impose a tax? No, the \nCourt doesn't have that power.\n  Then how can the Court do that? How could the Court do that? Why did \nthe Court do that? The Court did that because it could, not because it \ncould in the sense that it had the constitutional power to do it but \nbecause the Court has an exercise of raw political power. It chose to \ndo so and did do so.\n  This was a tragic day in American history. It is a day we should not \nsoon forget and a day we should do all in our power to remedy. This \ndecision was wrong. It was unconscionable. As a matter of \njurisprudence, it was unforgivable.\n  The Court then went on to address the challenge related to Congress's \npower to compel the States to expand their Medicaid Programs. Medicaid, \nas we all know, is a program that is partially funded by the Federal \nGovernment but administered and partially funded by the States. In the \nAffordable Care Act, Congress directed the States--whether the States \nwere so inclined--to expand their Medicaid Programs. It gave them no \nchoice but to expand them and to expand them to a very significant \ndegree. It expanded them in a way that would bring about not only \nsignificant costs to the States over the years but also very \nsubstantial administrative burdens as well. Yet the Affordable Care Act \nleft the States with no choice. You must do this. Just do it because we \nare Congress and we are all powerful. You have to do it because we say \nso.\n  There is this anticommandeering principle embedded within our \nconstitutional jurisprudence, rooted in the enumerated powers doctrine \nand rooted partially in the Tenth Amendment as well. It says that \nCongress lacks the power to commandeer States' administrative or \nlegislative machinery to put in place, to carry out the legislature, to \nadminister a Federal program. The Supreme Court of the United States \nconcluded that Congress had violated this anti-commandeering principle \nin passing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and in doing \nso in a way that left the States with no other alternative.\n\n  So this was the second constitutional defect in the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act.\n  But, here again, the Supreme Court chose to rewrite the law a second \ntime in order to save it. Ordinarily, what the Court would do in this \ncircumstance--in that circumstance, after concluding that Congress had \nviolated this anti-commandeering principle and that this aspect of the \nAffordable Care Act was, in fact, unconstitutional--the Court would be \nunder an obligation to go into what is called severability analysis, to \nanalyze whether or to what extent or in what way Congress might have \nintended to allow the rest of the statute's provisions to operate \nindependently, notwithstanding the unconstitutionality of the provision \ndeemed invalid by the court. In this case, quite steadily, the Supreme \nCourt engaged in no such analysis. It never reached the severability \nquestion, even though it had been the discussion of extensive briefing \nand conversation and oral argument.\n  The Supreme Court didn't get into severability at all. The Court \ndecided it just didn't need to. It didn't need to because the Court \nrewrote the statute in order to make it constitutional. The Court wrote \ninto the law a carve-out provision. It simply said, We are going to \nread this law as though it gave the States an opt-out provision, as \nthough it gave the States an option of deciding whether or not to \nexpand their own Medicaid programs.\n  The only problem is the text of the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act contained absolutely no such language. We can read through all \n2,700 pages of that law, and we won't find any opt-out provision such \nas what I just described. No, the Court created this too from whole \ncloth. The Court did this in the absence of any text. This too amounted \nto a betrayal of the judicial oaths of those who signed their names to \nthat opinion. This too was a blatantly unconstitutional act that was an \ninsult to the high judicial office that those individuals occupy. That \ntoo is an insult to the constitutional system, which has fostered the \ndevelopment of the greatest civilization the world has ever known.\n  We can't likely overlook crimes against the Constitution. We can't \nlikely overlook the usurpation of authority by the few. We can't likely \noverlook the fact that laws--our most fundamental laws--have been \nopenly flouted in this case, nor will we soon forget the fact that it \nhas occurred here.\n  So here are all of these reasons why some of us feel so strongly, so \npassionately that this law started with some unconstitutional premises \nand has had its constitutional defects compounded over and over and \nover, as we have had the Supreme Court of the United States rewriting \nit, not just once but twice, in order to save it. We have the President \nof the United States rewriting it, in effect, legislating through the\n\n[[Page S8691]]\n\nstroke of the executive pen several times now, because, among other \nthings, he says the law is not ready to implement. He doesn't have the \npower to legislate on his own any more than the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States has the power to legislate, any more than the Queen of \nEngland has the right to legislate for the United States of America.\n  The legislative power belongs here. It belongs here in the Congress \nof the United States, and we must exercise that power. When someone \nelse takes that power from us, when someone else independently \nexercises the legislative power, we must guard it jealously. We must \nprotect it. I don't care whether one is a Republican or a Democrat, and \nI don't care whether one is President Obama's biggest fan or his most \naggressive critic. The office we occupy here requires us, compels us to \ndefend our institutional prerogative as Federal lawmakers. When someone \nelse exercises that power--a power that does not belong to them but to \nus--we must protect it, not because it is ours but because it belongs \nto those we represent. It belongs to those who elected us to serve \nhere, those who elected us and not someone else to make the laws. \nWhenever--to any degree--we overlook the fact that someone else has \nlegislated, someone not vested with lawmaking authority, we do \nourselves and our country a disservice and we reflect a certain \ncavalier disregard for the oath we have taken to uphold the \nConstitution of the United States, which was put in place to make the \nmen and the women of the United States of America free.\n  There is another issue related to all of this that I think we need to \ntouch on, which is the issue of excessive delegation of legislative \nauthority to the executive branch. In some circumstances, we have a \nsituation in which Congress may voluntarily relinquish some of its \nlawmaking power to the executive branch. I say it may do that, that it \ncan do that, but that is not necessarily saying that it should do that. \nPerhaps the most influential political philosopher in America's \nfounding era was Charles de Montesquieu. Charles de Montesquieu wrote \nthat the power to legislate is the power to make laws, not the power to \nmake legislators. He recognized, I think, that there was a natural \ntemptation among elected lawmakers to want to pass the buck along to \nsomeone else, to want to give to someone else the task of making law.\n  We do this sometimes when we pass an extraordinarily broad law and \nthen we direct some executive branch agency to simply fill in the gaps, \nto effectively make the laws. The Affordable Care Act is replete with \ninstances in which this kind of thing occurs, in which certain broad \nparameters are spelled out and in which we then say to this department \nor that department that it will have the power to promulgate rules \ncarrying the force of generally applicable Federal law, which that same \ndepartment or that same agency will then have the power to enforce.\n  So that is part of how we end up with 20,000 pages of implementing \nregulations already under ObamaCare--20,000 pages and counting--because \nwe have a lot of instances in which we have delegated de facto \nlawmaking power. That too presents its own kind of constitutional \nproblem--not necessarily a constitutional problem that the courts are \ninclined to recognize, but a sort of constitutional problem \nnonetheless, because the more we delegate de facto lawmaking power to \nan executive branch agency, the less we see that anyone is accountable \nto the people for our laws.\n\n  One can imagine, for example, if taken to an extreme, what this could \nlook like. Let's suppose one day we just decide we are tired of \ndebating and discussing and voting on and having to pass laws that are \ncontroversial, laws that are specific, laws that require us to get our \nhands dirty, laws that require us to make difficult decisions, so, once \nand for all, we are going to pass a law that everyone can get behind. \nIt will be called the law of good laws. A law that says we shall have \ngood laws and we hereby delegate to the herewith created U.S. \nDepartment of Good Laws the power to make and enforce good laws. We \nthen pass that and we give this Department of Good Laws the power to \nissue regulations and to enforce those regulations. This is actually \nnot all that different from what we do all the time and what has been \ndone under ObamaCare to a very significant degree--about 20,000 pages \nof regulations so far, and that is still building.\n  One of the reasons this is a problem is because when the people don't \nlike our laws, they can come to us and they can hold us accountable for \nlaws that we may have voted to enact. They can choose to replace us \nwith someone else, someone who wouldn't vote for that kind of law the \nnext time they have the chance. But when the law that they don't like \nis not one that we have enacted but instead one that has been \npromulgated by an executive branch agency, the people come to complain \nto us and, in that circumstance, we say: Don't look at me; go to the \nexecutive branch agency; they are the ones who did it. They go to the \nexecutive branch agency, and they see that the people occupying the \nexecutive branch agency, as well mannered, well educated, well \nintentioned, and well groomed as they might be, are not subject to \nelections, so they can't be voted out. They can't be fired by the \npeople. That is why we are entrusted with the lawmaking power. It is \nnot necessarily that we are the best equipped in every way to do it; it \nis that we stand subject to elections in 6-year intervals in the case \nof the Senate, and in 2-year intervals in the case of the House of \nRepresentatives. It is yet another reason why we ought to be more \nresistant, more concerned when it comes to enacting legislation that \ndelegates an excessive amount of de facto law-making power to an \nexecutive branch agency.\n  It is yet another reason why I think we need to pass something akin \nto the proposal that has been introduced as the REINS Act, which would \nsay anytime an executive branch agency issues a new rule, a new \nregulation deemed by the Office of Management and Budget to constitute \na major rule, that major rule will take effect if, and only if, it is \nfirst passed into law by the House and then by the Senate and then \nsigned into law by the President. Then and only then do I think we will \nbe able to start to reclaim that legislative power which is rightfully \nours, and that, more importantly, the American people will be able to \nhold Congress accountable for the responsibilities properly given to \nCongress under the Constitution. This is about allowing the people to \nbe governed by those they choose. When we delegate excessively our own \nlawmaking power to executive branch agencies, we deprive the people of \ntheir right to have their laws written and enacted by men and women of \ntheir own choosing.\n  This is important, and it should be important to people of all \npolitical backgrounds, to people at every end, at every step, at every \nstage along the political continuum. This is an issue this is neither \nRepublican nor Democratic, it is neither liberal nor conservative, it \nis simply American.\n  When we pass laws, we pass laws through democratically elected \nSenators and Representatives. We do not do it through nameless, \nfaceless bureaucrats who, regardless of how well-educated and well-\nintentioned they may be, do not serve the people in the sense that they \nare not elected by the people. They are not subject to reelection. They \nare not subject to dismissal by the people.\n  We must hold that power here. That power belongs to us, not to \nbureaucrats. It belongs to us, not the President. It belongs to us and \nnot to nine Justices wearing black robes across the street in the \nSupreme Court of the United States.\n  These are some of the things that are at stake. These are some of the \nreasons it is so significant that we have this prolonged, protracted \neffort by the President of the United States to usurp power that is not \nhis own. We must not facilitate the President in his ongoing effort to \naggregate power, to accumulate power within the executive branch of \ngovernment that is not his own.\n  That is why we need to stand up to the President. I am against some \nof these nominees he has pushed forward again and again and again \ntrying to trample over the rights of the minority. We have to do that. \nWe have an obligation to stand up to the President, especially because \nhe is taking power that is not his own, and he is doing it, among other \nthings, to move forward with ObamaCare, a law that a majority\n\n[[Page S8692]]\n\nof the American people have never approved of and a law the American \npeople are growing steadily more against every single day.\n  I see my time is expired.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, the matter before us is that of a \nnominee to be Commissioner of the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission for a term expiring July 2018. This nominee was asked to \nserve as a Commissioner by President Obama and was confirmed by the \nSenate by a voice vote in December 2010 for a term ending July 2013. \nWhile her term expired at that date, she can continue to serve until \nthe end of this congressional session, December 2013, so she is still \nin the position, continuing to serve.\n  I have gone through her entire biography, and I would have some \nquestions if I were to have an opportunity to visit as a Senator today \nwith this nominee to be Commissioner of the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission. I would like to ask the nominee if she is \nwilling to forgo Federal employee insurance, which she currently has, \nto go onto the insurance now forced upon most of America through the \nPresident's health care law. Would she, who is now seeking nomination \nand seeking confirmation, be willing to do what Americans are being \nasked all around the country to do, people who received letters that \nsaid: Sorry, your insurance isn't good enough. Sorry, you can't keep \nyour insurance regardless of what the President may have promised. What \nwould this nominee say? Is the President's health care law good enough \nfor her? Is what the President is promising to Americans good enough \nfor her? I shouldn't even say ``promising''--offering, if they can get \nit, depending on whether the Web site is working on a given day, \nwhether they can afford it, whether they want it, whether it works for \nthem. Is this something this nominee would think is a good idea for \nher?\n  Because, of course, she is in position as Commissioner of the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission, I would like to ask the nominee \nregarding her views of employers who are being forced to change health \ncare plans offered to their employees as a result of the Democrat-\nmandated and passed on party-line votes Obama health care law. What are \nher views on employers being forced to change health care plans offered \nto employees because of what this Senate body did?\n  I would also like to ask the nominee whether she believes an employer \nwho requires some of his or her employees to join the exchange and is \nOK about exempting other employees--whether that would be a violation \nof the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission laws. Does she believe \nan employer who requires some of his employees to join the exchange \nwhile exempting others--would that be a violation of the laws. That is \nwhat the majority leader of the Senate has done. Do the laws not apply \nto the majority leader? Can he decide one way or the other?\n  We have heard his explanation. I know the Washington Post gave him \nthree Pinocchios, meaning there is a considerable amount of untruth in \nhis explanation. But what about this nominee before us today?\n  I would also like to hear her thoughts regarding whether people in \npower should have the right to change rules at any time in a manner \nthat restricts the rights of those whom the rules were intended to \nprotect because that is what has happened on this floor of the Senate \nin the last couple of weeks. A group broke the rules to change the \nrules in a way that has denied the minority rights that had been \nprotected for centuries. So I would be interested in hearing what the \nnominee has to say about that.\n  It is interesting because the facts that have been brought forth on \nthe floor by the Senate majority leader regarding the filibuster have \nactually been described as fraudulent: ``Democrats' Filibuster Fraud.''\n  On November 21, majority leader Harry Reid broke his promise not to \nemploy the nuclear option when he and Senate Democrats eliminated the \nfilibuster on nominations. They did so based on what Senator Hatch once \ndescribed as a ``filibuster fraud.'' Orrin Hatch, a longstanding Member \nof this body, probably knows the rules better than any.\n  I believe they did it in an attempt to divert attention away from \nthis ObamaCare nightmare--people faced with higher premiums, canceled \ncoverage, people finding out they can't keep their doctor, fraud and \nidentity theft which is going on even until today and I think is going \nto continue to get worse in the future, and higher copays and \ndeductibles.\n  One of our Senate colleague's staffers was trying to sign up for \ninsurance on Monday, I understand was on a Web site that pretty much \nlooked identical to the government Web site, and what he found was it \ntook him to a page where they asked for his bank account number and his \nPIN number. I think everyone agrees that is not part of the health care \nWeb site. This is a staff member who works for the Senate and found \nhimself taken through the computer--I should say the broken Web site, \neasy to maneuver and manipulate--it took him to a page asking for his \nbank account number and his PIN number.\n  He then called the help line, spent several hours on hold waiting to \ntalk to people, and they said: Just get off of that Web site. The folks \nhe was talking to even seemed surprised to know that he logged in to \nwhat he thought was the correct Web site and what looked identical to \nthe government Web site, but yet there was a problem there.\n  So I believe what we are seeing is an effort to divert attention away \nfrom the ObamaCare nightmare and ensure that the circuit court of \nappeals will be a rubberstamp for the President's agenda. And what has \nhappened? The Washington Post looked at the comments by the Senate \nmajority leader, who on November 21 said:\n\n       In the history of the Republic, there have been 168 \n     filibusters of executive and judicial nominations. Half of \n     them have occurred during the Obama Administration . . .\n\n  The Washington Post, which looked at it, said: Leader Reid's figures \nconfused cloture motions, which are requests to end debate, with \nfilibusters, the response to those requests.\n  So just making a request isn't a filibuster; it is actually making a \nfilibuster response to the motion.\n  They said: This was despite the clear admonition of the June \nCongressional Research Service Report that cloture motions don't \ncorrespond with filibusters.\n  Apparently Senator Reid did not have a chance to read that or wanted \nto ignore it. It didn't fit the scenario or the story that he was \ntrying to weave. They went on to say:\n\n       Since the majority leader files nearly all cloture motions, \n     Senator Reid himself created the very statistic that he \n     relied upon to force a rule change.\n\n  Senator Reid himself by filing all these cloture motions, he is the \none who created the very statistic that he relied upon to force a rules \nchange.\n  Many of these, the Washington Post reports, were clearly unnecessary. \nIn fact they say 32 percent of all cloture motions in the past 4\\1/2\\ \nyears were withdrawn before a vote. Even the fact checker of the \nWashington Post rejected the majority leader's claim. They said:\n\n       But we especially find it hard to get past CRS's admonition \n     that the data in its report should not be used to calculate \n     the number of filibusters, as Reid's office has done.\n\n  They have given him a couple of Pinocchios on that one too. It is \nfascinating that the majority leader of the Senate receives Pinocchio \nafter Pinocchio in the Washington Post for continuing to distort or \ntell his version of a story which is just not true at all.\n  I believe all of this is in an effort to distract people from all of \nthe issues that are damning and hurting the President's standing in the \neyes of the American people.\n  It is interesting. You do not have to go too far back in the \nnewspapers. You just go to Wednesday, December 11, yesterday. The Wall \nStreet Journal, page 4, ``Poll: Health Law Hurts president \nPolitically.''\n\n[[Page S8693]]\n\n  The American people know this is the law that the President forced \nthrough, a party-line vote, in the middle of the night, Christmas--and \nit looks like we may be here Christmas again this year, because of an \nunwillingness of the Democrats to work together to accept Republican \nideas, to talk with their colleagues. Let's see the subheadline here, \n``Obama's Job-Performanace Disapproval Rate Rises to All-Time High.''\n  The President's disapproval rate of his job performance rises to an \nall-time high of 54 percent. Then it says ``Even As Americans Upbeat On \nEconomy.''\n  So the President is at an all time high of his disapproval even at a \ntime when people from an economic standpoint believe that things are \nnot as bad as they may be. Why is it? Because of the health care law. \nPeople all across the country--the numbers are 5 million now who have \nlost their insurance, gotten letters from their insurance companies \nsaying sorry, you have lost your insurance. It might have worked well \nfor you.\n  I talked to folks at home in Wyoming, a ranch family. They have \ninsurance. It works for them. It is what they wanted, it is what they \nhad for many years, but they found out it didn't qualify because it was \nnot good enough. It is interesting to hear the President say better \ninsurance. Not better for them. More expensive, more things to cover \nthat they don't ever need. The reason they lost their insurance is \nbecause it didn't fit the President's 10-point criteria. It didn't \ninclude maternity coverage.\n  A woman who knows I am a doctor, knows I practiced medicine in \nWyoming for 24 years--and I talked to her at the Wyoming Farm Bureau \nmeeting in Laramie a couple of weeks ago--said: I have had a \nhysterectomy. She said: Doctor, you know somebody who has had a \nhysterectomy doesn't need maternity coverage. They are not going to \nhave more babies.\n  So she lost insurance that the family has had. It worked for the \nfamily, and they could afford it. They had it included in their budget, \nand they lost it because she doesn't have maternity coverage, because \nshe has had a hysterectomy. She had insurance that worked for her.\n  Who does the President think he is, to say that he knows better than \nshe does, what is right for her and for her family? That is why the \nPresident is being hurt politically. It is the health law. It is the \nmandates on the American people. It is the President and the Democrats \nin this body saying: We know better than you do. We know what your kids \nneed, we know what your family needs, we know what works in your life.\n  I will tell you, the President does not know. He has no idea what \nworks for these people at home in Wyoming and that they have made \nintelligent choices, thoughtful choices. They know what works for them. \nHe doesn't know their lives, and he doesn't know their needs. His \ndisapproval rate--not surprising to me--is at an all time high, and it \nis well deserved because people are being faced with not just the Web \nsite failures, which drew attention to this, that I believe made the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services the laughing stock of America \nbecause of her comments and how they played forth on the comedy shows, \nbut also and more important, because of what is below the tip of the \niceberg, the higher premiums. My friend in Wyoming has found that what \nshe needs to do in terms of the insurance that the President said she \nneeds--it is going to cause their premium to skyrocket. She is going to \nbe forced to buy insurance because the law says all Americans need to \nbuy insurance. She is going to be forced to buy insurance that really \nthey don't need, they don't want, they are never ever going to use, \nthey cannot afford, and it is money not going to be used for other \nthings--for books for the kids, for food for the table, for things \naround the house. They are going to lose that opportunity. That is what \nthis is all about.\n  That is why the President's numbers have dropped so significantly. It \nis interesting when you go through these statistics, findings--and this \nis a combined poll from the Wall Street Journal and NBC news--the \nhealth care law, whether it was a good idea or bad idea. According to \nthis poll: bad idea, 50 percent, good idea, 34 percent--50 percent bad, \n34 percent good.\n  Then they say what is the impact of this health care law on your \nfamily? That is what people wonder about. What does it mean to them? \nWhat does this mean to them personally? Because it was interesting. On \nthe exit polling from the Presidential election last year with Mitt \nRomney and Barack Obama, people across the country believed at that \ntime that in response to the question of ``cares for someone like me,'' \nBarack Obama did much better, scored much higher than Mitt Romney.\n  Now the President is underwater because people are saying he doesn't \ncare about me; he doesn't know about me; doesn't care about me; is not \nthinking about me, is thinking about his legacy but not thinking what I \nam going to have to pay in premiums; not thinking about my insurance \nbeing canceled; not thinking about me not able to keep my doctor; not \nthinking about fraud and identity theft; not thinking about the higher \ncopays and deductibles. Right now, in terms of the poll that was in \nyesterday's Wall Street Journal by NBC news, whether this was going to \nhave a positive or a negative impact on people's lives, fewer than 1 in \n8 Americans believe that this health care law is going to have a \npositive impact on them and their families. Fewer than 1 in 8. It is \nastonishing that fewer than 1 in 8 people think that this health care \nlaw is going to have a positive impact for them and their family.\n  Yet it was crammed down the throats of all Americans, forcing them to \nface all of these issues and costs related to that. The poll shows the \nPresident's disapproval at the highest rate ever, 54 percent, going \nback from the time he was elected. In terms of how you look at this--\nstart reading the article.\n\n       The federal health-care law is becoming a heavier political \n     burden for President Barack Obama and his party, despite \n     increased confidence in the economy and the public's own \n     generally upbeat sense of well-being, a new Wall Street \n     Journal/NBC News poll suggests.\n       Disapproval of Mr. Obama's job performance hit an all-time \n     high in the poll, at 54%, amid the flawed rollout of the \n     health law. Half of those polled now consider the law a bad \n     idea, also a record high.\n\n  There was the flawed roll out and Web sites can be fixed. The Web \nsite can be fixed--and that is why the Web site failure is only the tip \nof the iceberg. What has really gotten people mad is the 5 million \nletters, and we don't even know how many letters went out in Illinois, \nOhio, Texas. We don't have those numbers yet. So the numbers of folks \nwho lost their health care coverage that worked for them, that they \nliked, that number is, I believe, going to be higher than 5 million. So \nthis is going to continue to roll out with people showing huge \ndisappointment. I expect the President's popularity to fall even \nfurther.\n  I think it is going to get even worse come January 1 as people start \nto go to a doctor and find out that maybe they think they bought \ninsurance through the health care Web site and find out that they \nactually do not have it. We have people I have talked to that have put \nin all the information. They spent hours, but the Web site went down. \nThey came back for more hours but don't have confirmation yet. They \nreally do not know if they have insurance yet. They would like to know. \nThey would like to see assurance. They would like to have confidence \ntheir government can get something right. They do not see it now. They \ndon't see the President doing what he promised.\n  The President was on television with President Clinton, at the \nClinton World Summit in New York, just 3 or 4 days before the Web site \nwas unveiled, and there was the President sitting with former President \nClinton saying that this was going to be easier to use than Amazon. \nCheaper than your direct phone bill, and if you like your doctor, you \ncan keep your doctor.\n  Did the President really believe that or was he so detached, so \ndisconnected from the reality of what is happening in this country that \nhe was not even overseeing his job. This is his signature achievement. \nYet it seems like he ignored the implementation process.\n  For those in this body who served as Governors, as chief executives \nof States, as the Presiding Officer of the Senate has done, you never \nlet that happen. You might have tested it for yourself: What is it \ngoing to look like? I am curious, what happens when people sign on? How \ndoes it work? But just to push ``go'' and have this blind confidence \nthat everything is going to be\n\n[[Page S8694]]\n\nfine and not know and 3 or 4 days before on a world stage saying: Oh, \neasier than Amazon, I think is very distressing to many people. That is \nwhy the President's performance shows such high disapproval, 54 \npercent. That is why, according to the Wall Street Journal poll and NBC \nnews, the health law is hurting the President politically.\n  This is not just a survey of a couple of people. This survey is of \n1,000 adults. It was conducted between December 4 and December 8. What \nit did is it found a sharp erosion, they say, a sharp erosion since \nJanuary in many of the attributes of a President.\n  What are the attributes you would like to have in a President? What \nwould a nation look to in a President? Attributes that say: This is \nwhat we want in our President. Honesty--that is what you would like to \nhave, a President who is honest. Leadership ability to handle a crisis. \nThey say that had kept President Obama aloft through the economic and \npolitical turmoil of his first term, but now it is not there anymore. \nThe feeling about the President regarding his own honesty has dropped \nprecipitously.\n  You do not want our country to have a President who the people think \nis not honest, but that is where we are right now. I will tell you, he \nbrought it upon himself and he did it intentionally, he did it \ndeliberately and he did it by looking into that camera and \nintentionally misleading the American people about his health care \nlaw--not just in the lead-up to passing the law but continued all the \nway through. What does the President say? He said if you like your \ninsurance, you can keep your insurance, period. It was his punctuation \nof that sentence that said there is nothing after that. He said if you \nlike your doctor, you can keep your doctor, period. He has continued to \nsay that.\n  It was interesting, even after the whole debacle, the letters going \nout, so many people finding their coverage had been canceled, the White \nHouse Web site continued with a video of the President saying, ``If you \nlike your coverage, you can keep your coverage, period.'' If you like \nyour doctor, you can keep your doctor, period. Is it any surprise that \nthe American people no longer find the President trustworthy, honest? \nIs it a surprise, then, that the President finds that the health law is \nhurting him politically? Is it a surprise that the disapproval of his \nperformance is now at an all-time high? That is what we are dealing \nwith in this country, and yet the President continues to go forth and \nsay, are the Republican ideas?\n  We have had idea after idea. We tried to visit with the President \nabout those ideas. He wants to hear nothing. He wants to hear nothing. \nHe wants his talking points and he doesn't really have a clear \nunderstanding of what damage he has done to America with this law that \nhas hurt so many families across the country and continues to cause \npain and suffering and anxiety, and as a result anger, and as a result \nthe health law hurts the President politically. Those are the issues \nthat are in front of us. Those are the issues that are in front of us.\n\n  I have a letter from a gentleman who lives in Cody, WY, that I want \nto read and share. This came in a couple of days ago online.\n  For the most part people in Wyoming know me as Dr. Barrasso. I have \ntreated many of them. I have been involved with the Wyoming health \nfairs and taking low-cost blood screenings to people all around the \nCowboy State. I still attend the fairs and visit the small communities. \nWe did a poll there about why people go to health fairs. The No. 2 \nreason they go is for their health, and the No. 1 reason is to \nsocialize and see other people in their community.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has seen similar things in his home \nState when he goes to activities that people go to, and they want to \nsee one another.\n  This email is by a gentleman who wrote to me and knows about my \nactivities at the health fairs and as a doctor.\n  He said:\n\n       Just got a quote from my insurance agent on Obama care \n     insurance. From $860 I currently spend per month for my \n     family of 4, to $2,400. All with the low deductible of \n     $10,000 per person per year.\n\n  That is the other issue: Higher copays and deductibles. This is a big \npart of what is happening with this health care law. I mean, it is \ninteresting.\n  This is Monday's Wall Street Journal, dated December 9: ``Deductibles \nFuel New Worries of Health-Law Sticker Shock.'' That is what my friend \nfrom Cody, WY, is finding after being hit with the higher deductibles.\n  I will share some of the things the Wall Street Journal said and then \nget back to the letter from my friend in Cody.\n  It says:\n\n       The average individual deductible for what is called a \n     bronze plan on the exchange--the lowest priced coverage--is \n     $5,081 per person a year, according to a new report on \n     insurance offerings in 34 of the 36 states that rely on the \n     federally run online marketplace.\n       That is 42 percent higher than the average deductible of \n     $3,589 for an individually purchased plan in 2013 before much \n     of the federal law took effect.\n\n  ``Deductibles Fuel New Worries of Health-Law Sticker Shock.''\n  Right under the article, ``Health Site Snafus Plague Maryland.'' I \nunderstand that is a State that has their own exchange. That is not \neven a Federally run exchange. When the President says the States are \ndoing such a great job, and if we let the States do all of these \nthings, we wouldn't have all of these problems. Maryland is having huge \nproblems, as are quite a few of the States.\n  Getting back to the letter written by this gentleman from Cody, WY, \nwho was hit with an incredibly high deductible--higher than the \naverage. The average is over $5,000, which is higher than it was last \nyear for people around the country. He said:\n\n       I'm not sure what planet they think I live on, but there is \n     no way I can spend more than \\1/2\\ of my monthly income on \n     insurance. For the first time in my adult life I will soon be \n     without insurance.\n\n  What does President Obama have to say about that? How does the \nObamaCare health care law--I thought it was written in a way that \npeople would get insurance, not lose insurance. Wasn't that the purpose \nof this? This gentleman said this is the first time in his life he will \nbe without insurance. Why? Because of the law.\n  He said: ``What does it matter if my 18-year-old children can stay on \nmy insurance plan if I can't afford to keep one?''\n  I mean that is the big talking point on the other side of the aisle; \nyoung people up to age 26 can stay on their parents' health care plan. \nI think it is a good idea to allow young people to stay on their \nfamily's insurance plan. Of course the President tends to add in that \nit is free, and it is not free. There is a cost to that. I think it is \na good idea to help with families.\n  As this gentleman from Cody, WY, says:\n\n       What does it matter if they can stay on the insurance plan \n     if I can't afford to keep one? Also all the air time to pre \n     existing conditions are meaningless if I can't afford to keep \n     a plan.\n       I feel greatly blessed to have the good paying job that I \n     have. It puts me above the pay level that would allow me to \n     get any subsidies.\n\n  He has a family of four and can't get subsidies. He said: ``By the \nway, with the system in place this year, I wouldn't have needed \nsubsidies.'' With the current system he wouldn't need subsidies, but \nwhen he goes from $860 to $2,400, he can't afford it even though he \ndoesn't qualify for subsidies. Yes, we see the genius of the Obama \nhealth care law by ignoring what happens in real people's lives.\n  I think it is interesting to see that the people who wrote this law \nwrote it behind closed doors. I know the President said this evening he \nwas not a Member of this body at the time, but it was written behind \nclosed doors through that door of the Senate. The people who knew the \nmost about what is in that law, they seem to be the very people who \nhave been excluded by the majority leader from having to live under it. \nThose are the people who got the exemption, and they are the ones who \nknow what is in it.\n  It is so ironic that the majority leader of the Senate would say that \nhis people who helped to write this law don't have to live under it. \nThe Washington Post calls him on it. Yet the rest of America has to \nlive under what is not good enough for the majority leader's own staff. \nIt is ironic and sad to see a day like this come to our country.\n  As this gentleman says, he has never needed to have subsidies before. \nHe\n\n[[Page S8695]]\n\nsaid: ``I have never needed them in the past and would like to continue \nto never get a handout from my government.'' This is an independent \nindividual. He doesn't want a subsidy. He is not asking for a subsidy. \nHe just wants the insurance that worked for him and his family for all \nof these years, and now he has no insurance.\n  He said:\n\n       I employ about 35 people with my company. When we first \n     opened about a year and \\1/2\\ ago we were talking about \n     getting some sort of coverage. It became very clear that we \n     will not be able to do this . . .\n\n  They have 35 employees, so under the 50, but still wanted to do the \nright thing. He wanted to give people coverage. He said:\n\n       It became clear that we will not be able to do this, and \n     have stopped any of our plans to provide this in the future. \n     We also know for sure that we cannot afford to ever employ \n     more than 50 people as we continue to grow, there is an \n     upward limit on how many people we will hire.\n\n  That is as a result of the law and not because the business is not \nthere and not because the economy won't support it. It is not because \nthey don't want to employ more people, and not because they don't want \nto help their community. Because of the health care law, they are \nputting a cap on the size of their business.\n  He said:\n\n       Simple economics, Obamacare is a job killer in Wyoming. It \n     has never been easy to be in business, that is part of the \n     fun of being successful. It is discouraging when our federal \n     government limits the American dream for everyone.\n\n  The Federal Government is limiting the American dream for everyone. \nHe said: ``I am thankful for your efforts, but from my office chair in \nCody, it is already too late.''\n  I know I am not the only person in this body who is getting letters \nlike this. I know people who actually voted for the health care law are \ngetting letters like this. I am not sure what kind of responses they \nare giving them. We call these people. The staff has worked with them, \nand I visit with them when I get home on the weekends to listen to \nfolks.\n  But when we look at that sort of letter and that sort of well thought \nout rational approach from somebody who is working and has had \ninsurance their whole life, that provides for his family and builds a \nbusiness in a community, hires people, wants to provide insurance and \nnow says: Not going to provide insurance, going to limit our growth, \nand my family loses insurance--why? It is because of a health care law \nthat I think the President--I don't know if he had any idea of what the \nimpact of this was going to be. We came to the floor on this side of \nthe aisle day after day and week after week talking about why when you \nread the law, it is a real problem. We talked about why the concerns \nexpressed by the American people should have been listened to but \nregrettably were not listened to, and why I think it is a terrible \nmistake and very harmful to the American people.\n  It is not just the Web site. It is the higher premiums that my friend \nfrom Cody is hearing about because his coverage was canceled because it \nwasn't good enough according to the President.\n  We will get to whether he could keep his doctor or not in a second. \nWe have talked about higher copays and higher deductibles, and those \nare the things we are facing now in this country. People are noticing \nthem around my State and all around the 50 States. Doctors are noticing \nit.\n  I was in my medical office last week talking to some of my \ncolleagues--my former medical partners. They are being swamped right \nnow with folks coming in for care. This is not just in the middle of \nWyoming. This is all across the country.\n  I talked to a surgeon yesterday on the faculty at Duke University. He \nhad the same story there. So we are seeing it east and west and north \nand south. Doctors' offices are being swamped with patients who have \ninsurance now.\n  The President's health care law was to make sure that more people got \nmore insurance and coverage after the first of the year. These are \npeople who have insurance now and are afraid they will not have it \nafter the first of the year. They don't know if they will have it. If \nthey had to go onto the exchanges, they haven't gotten confirmation \nfrom the exchanges yet. They are anxious about that; they are also \nangry.\n  They don't know if they are going to be able to keep their doctor, \nwhich gets to the point of ``can't keep your doctor.'' So what they are \ndoing is going to their doctors' offices now and saying: I have been \nputting this off for a while--my shoulder that has been bothering me or \nmy hip or my knee, and I want to get it taken care of now while I know \nyou are still my doctor. I know that I can still come to you at least \nuntil the end of the year, and I know for sure I still have insurance \nright now.\n  Hospitals, medical offices, and clinics are all being swamped by \npatients trying to get caught up with things they may have put off for \na while. They don't know what will happen come January 1st, and I will \ntell you neither does the President of the United States. I think the \nPresident doesn't know what will happen on January 1.\n  I think he is standing there with his fingers crossed and hoping it \ndoesn't get any worse. I will tell you. I think it will get worse with \nmore people, with sticker shock of higher premiums, and coverage \ncanceled. People are going to find out all across the country they \ncan't keep their doctor.\n  Fraud and identity theft is going to get worse as more cases get \nreported, and we are going to see more and more people not being able \nto pay their deductibles.\n  I wanted to spend a second on this issue--on the whole issue of the \nPresident's promise that if you like your doctor, you can keep your \ndoctor. As a doctor, there is a very special relationship between a \ndoctor and a patient and a patient and a doctor. It goes both ways.\n  I think it was very telling, as well as distressing to many people, \nthis past Sunday when on one of the Sunday news shows, Ezekiel Emanuel, \nRahm Emanuel's brother, who is a professor at the University of \nPennsylvania and a physician in the academic setting--one of the \ninterviewers asked him: Was it a true statement, ``If you like your \ndoctor, you can keep your doctor?'' He said: The President never said \nyou could go to all of these other people and specialists. The \ninterviewer said: Wait a second. Let's get back to if you like your \ndoctor, you can keep your doctor. Ezekiel Emanuel basically said if you \nlike your doctor, you can keep your doctor if you are willing to pay \nmore. That is not what the President said. The President used the \npunctuation point, used that period at the end of his sentence: If you \nlike your doctor, you can keep your doctor, period. Now we have Ezekiel \nEmanuel on the Sunday shows saying: Well, the President never really \nsaid that. But he did. He said it dozens of times.\n\n  Folks in this body have asked me about the bond between a doctor and \na patient, and I think the President knew very well about that bond \nwhen he made the promise that if you like what you have, you can keep \nit. So I put pen to paper and had an editorial in yesterday's \nInvestor's Business Daily--Wednesday, December 11, 2013--called ``A \nSpecial Bond Deeply Severed By ObamaCare.'' I would like to share some \nof those thoughts with my colleagues today because I think that is a \nspecial bond. As a doctor, I know what that bond is like with my \npatients.\n  I write in this column:\n\n       A central architect of the president's health care law \n     admitted this week that the often repeated promise that ``if \n     you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor'' simply isn't \n     true.\n       Instead, Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel explained that if you like \n     your doctor, you will simply need to pay more to keep your \n     doctor.\n\n  I write:\n\n       As a physician, I know firsthand how this will hurt many \n     Americans.\n       Families look to doctors as trusted friends, as confidants \n     and as counselors and turn to them for advice in making life \n     and death decisions.\n       In Wyoming, patients have included me in graduations, in \n     weddings, and asked me to serve as a pallbearer. They have \n     asked me to pray with them, to referee family disputes, and \n     to provide reassurance when a doctor they did not know was \n     called in to consult.\n\n  I go on:\n\n       Norman Rockwell's painting ``Doctor and Doll'' tells the \n     story.\n\n  I think people here can kind of visualize that picture.\n\n       A little girl holds up her doll as the trusted family \n     doctor listens to the doll with his stethoscope. The caring, \n     compassionate physician takes the time to reassure the \n     concerned little girl.\n\n[[Page S8696]]\n\n       The doctor-patient relationship is a very special bond. It \n     requires faith and trust for a patient to allow me to cut \n     into their body to remove a tumor, to replace a warn-out \n     joint, to fix a broken bone, to repair a torn ligament and, \n     above all else, to do no harm.\n       The President knew of the special relationship between \n     people and their doctors. That is why when he was trying to \n     gain support for his health care law, he made a clear and \n     simple promise to the American people. The President said, \n     ``If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor, \n     period.''\n       Now people across the country are finding they can't keep \n     their doctor.\n       The same law that has caused millions of Americans to lose \n     the health insurance that worked for them is now causing \n     people to lose their doctors.\n       People shopping for insurance on government exchanges and \n     people going to the Web site are being forced to purchase \n     insurance for things they don't want, don't need, or will \n     never use.\n       To keep costs down, many of these policies limit the \n     doctors and limit the hospitals that patients can use.\n\n  So not just the doctors, the hospitals as well, including the Mayo \nClinic and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center--they are excluded from many \ninsurance networks.\n\n       Some of the best children's hospitals in the country are \n     also excluded from the exchanges. This means a child with \n     cancer--\n\n  And there have been articles about this--\n\n     may lose access to his or her doctor and the specialty \n     hospital because of this law.\n\n  Come January 1, there are kids in this country who are not going to \nhave the ability under their new plans to go to the hospitals that have \nbeen treating these young people.\n\n       In New Hampshire--\n\n  There are two Senators here from New Hampshire, one on either side of \nthe aisle.\n\n       In New Hampshire, 10 of the state's 26 hospitals--\n\n  So there are 26 hospitals; 10 of the State's 26 hospitals--\n\n     are excluded from the only carrier offering insurance in the \n     exchange.\n\n  There is only one carrier in the exchange. I remember the President \ntalking about all of this competition. There is 1 carrier in the \nexchange. There are 26 hospitals in the State, and 10 of them are \nexcluded from the only carrier that is offering insurance.\n  I will tell my colleagues that this next sentence is fascinating.\n\n       The head of the medical staff of one of the excluded \n     hospitals--\n\n  This is the chief of staff of the hospital--\n\n     learned that her plan does not even allow her to seek \n     treatment at her own hospital where she is the chief of \n     staff.\n\n  It is unbelievable.\n  We take a look at that and say: How could this have happened? But \nthat is the law that was passed, and that is the 7-foot tower of \nregulations that has come out from the bureaucracy.\n  I write:\n\n       The situation could be equally bad for seniors on Medicare.\n\n  For seniors on Medicare, if you can't keep your doctor, it is a \nreally big deal. It is sometimes difficult for a senior on Medicare to \nfind a doctor. If they get one and then they like that doctor, they \nwant to keep the doctor. As we have seen, seniors sometimes move to \nother communities to be closer to their kids and grandkids. To find a \ndoctor is a struggle, it is a challenge, but I think the situation \ncould be equally bad for Medicare, and here is why, and I wrote about \nit in this editorial in the Investor's Business Daily yesterday:\n\n       Thousands of doctors caring for seniors on Medicare \n     Advantage--\n\n  And about one in four people is on this program called Medicare \nAdvantage.\n\n       Thousands of doctors caring for seniors on Medicare \n     Advantage have been dropped from their networks. Those \n     Medicare patients will now be challenged with finding a new \n     doctor to take care of them.\n       The president's health care law is making it harder for \n     doctors as well as patients.\n\n  It is not just the patients; it is very hard for doctors.\n\n       Doctors know their patients' health history, they know \n     their families, they know their lives. Doctors value the \n     personal relationship as much as the patient does.\n       That's why people become doctors in the first place--to \n     take care of their patients.\n\n  In my graduating class, the way we felt about it--and I was invited \nback to speak at the commencement. I think it was about the 30th year \nafter I had graduated that I got invited back as a guest speaker, \ntalking to those medical students who were graduating. That is the same \nreason people continue to go into medicine. They want to take care of \npatients. They are intellectually stimulated and challenged by all the \nnew advances, but people go into medicine to take care of their \npatients.\n  In this editorial, I say:\n\n       Even if someone is able to keep their doctor, they won't \n     necessarily be able to spend as much time with that doctor as \n     they might like. That's because nearly two-thirds of the \n     doctors expect to spend more time on paperwork under the \n     requirements of the new law.\n\n  So doctors are going to have to spend more time on paperwork. Some of \nthis is done with computers, with electronic medical records, but there \nare still paperwork-keeping activities. It is interesting because so \noften doctors have the computer in the office with the patient, and \npatients feel the computer that is mandated under the health care law \nis interfering, with the doctor looking at the computer screen rather \nthan looking at the patient. So this is all having a significant \nimpact.\n  I conclude by saying:\n\n       This is not at all what the president promised. People all \n     across America put their faith and trust in Barack Obama when \n     they elected him President.\n       It's the same kind of faith and trust they have in their \n     doctor. When patients lose trust in their doctor--or citizens \n     lose trust in their president--it is extremely difficult to \n     regain.\n\n  That is why--going back to yesterday's Wall Street Journal: ``Health \nCare Law Hurts President Politically''--the disapproval rate has risen \nto an alltime high of 54 percent. Fifty-four percent disapprove of the \nPresident.\n  I go on to say in this article, which is what happens:\n\n       I continue to hear from my patients in Wyoming. They have \n     always had my home phone number. They are anxious. They are \n     angry. They call me at home. They know what they wanted from \n     health care reform. What they wanted was access to quality, \n     affordable care.\n\n  That is what the President talked about in his speeches, but that is \nnot what he delivered in his health care law.\n\n       That's not what they got with this law. Now, many face \n     losing the doctor who has always been there for them.\n       If President Obama wants to regain the trust of the \n     American people, he will sit down with Republicans to deliver \n     reforms that will help all Americans and fully protect the \n     doctor-patient relationship.\n       After all--\n\n  And I hear this at home in Wyoming--\n\n     President Obama has his own doctor at the White House who is \n     dedicated to his care. I'm sure he values that relationship \n     just as much as other Americans value their relationship with \n     their doctor.\n\n  So that is what I felt when I wrote this article called ``A Special \nBond Deeply Severed By ObamaCare'' in yesterday's--December 11--issue \nof Investor's Business Daily, that people can't keep their doctor and \nthere are great concerns about that, and they are being impacted in so \nmany ways.\n  It is interesting. Since this health care law passed, I have come to \nthe floor just about every week with a doctor's second opinion about \nthe health care law to talk about ways that I felt this health care law \nwas bad for patients, bad for doctors and nurses, physician assistants, \nand others who take care of patients, and why I thought it was terrible \nfor the taxpayers. But it seems that in recent weeks we can pick up any \nnewspaper and there is a story basically saying this law is bad for \npeople.\n  This is the New York Times, and they support the law. This past \nMonday, Robert Parry, a well-known journalist who writes frequently on \nthe topic of the health care law and on health exchanges, said:\n\n       Premiums may be low, but other costs can be high. For \n     months, the Obama administration has heralded the low \n     premiums and medical insurance policies on sale in the \n     insurance exchanges created by the health care law, but as \n     consumers dig into the details--\n\n  Which is something I was asking for on this Senate floor a number of \nyears ago when the law passed: Will the Democrats please dig into the \ndetails to see what impact this is going to have on people in terms of \nhigher premiums, in terms of canceled coverage, in terms of trying to \nkeep their doctor, in terms of higher copays and deductibles, in terms \nof people on Medicare trying to find a doctor to take care of them.\n\n\n[[Page S8697]]\n\n\n       As consumers dig into the details, they are finding that \n     the deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs are often much \n     higher--\n\n  Often much higher; not a rare case--\n\n     than what is typical in employer-sponsored health plans, \n     which says that the exchanges are not going to be helping \n     many people.\n\n  I found it interesting--talking a little about people not being able \nto keep their doctors but also not being able to keep their hospitals--\nwhy is that? I think we are seeing a number of these exchanges and \npolicies being offered. They realize that the people who go to certain \nhospitals have more serious conditions, likely more expensive, and as a \nresult don't include those hospitals.\n  In the Financial Times this week, ``Healthcare insurers cut costs by \nexcluding top hospitals.'' This was Monday of this week, and we are \nseeing this week after week, which is why I have been coming to the \nfloor with great regularity to share with this body what people across \nthe country are seeing.\n  It says:\n\n       People buying insurance plans under ``ObamaCare'' will have \n     limited access to some of the leading U.S. hospitals, \n     including two renowned cancer centers, as insurers try to cut \n     costs.\n\n  There is a picture of MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of \nTexas. It says the plan will not cover treatment at the Houston cancer \ncenter. I didn't even get into that in my article. I talked about \npediatric hospitals, and I talked about New Hampshire hospitals. But we \nare talking about major cancer hospitals that are not included in the \nexchanges for the most part, and that is what we are seeing all across \nthe country. You can kind of compare it to what kind of car you could \nbuy. What kind of coverage can you get. But the bottom line is people \nwere misled by the President and people feel deceived by this \nPresident.\n\n  Tuesday's Washington Post: ``Under health law, insurers limiting drug \ncoverage.'' ``Costs may soar for those with HIV, other ailments.'' This \nis not on the back page. This is on the front page of the Washington \nPost. This is all as a result of what the Democrats, in a party-line \nvote, passed and forced upon the country.\n  That is what is going on here. We have a health care law that people \nare very uncomfortable with, and they are going to continue to let the \nPresident know that, which is why he is being hurt, his disapproval is \nthe highest ever, and what has been sharply eroded are folks' belief in \nthis President's honesty and his leadership ability to handle a crisis.\n  This is a crisis for the President. This is a crisis for the country. \nWhat is the President doing about it? He is blaming the Republicans for \na law that passed with no Republican votes. He is blaming the \nRepublicans for an idea that was his and was forced through on party-\nline votes, without Republican input, written behind closed doors, \nright through those doors over there, by people who have now been \nexcluded, do not have to go under the health care law. Yet in the \nWashington Post: ``Harry Reid's explanation for why not all of his \nstaff is going on ``ObamaCare' ''--and the big three Pinocchios. \nRemember the story of Pinocchio, the boy whose nose grew whenever he \ntold falsehoods. That is what the Washington Post has to say about the \nmajority leader of the Senate in not making all of his employees live \nunder what the rest of the country is having to deal with right now.\n  I think it is very distressing. That is what we are facing. The \ncountry is facing higher premiums. Are people going to not have \nChristmas because they are, instead, having to use that money to pay \ntheir January premium? Are they going to not pay the January premium? \nHow does that play into all this? Are they going to decide: I don't \nthink I am going to have insurance, like my friend from Cody who wrote \nto me, who has had insurance all of his life but not now.\n  We have a Senator from Wyoming, the other Senator, the senior \nSenator, Mike Enzi. He was one who was also sounding the alarm during \nthis entire debate. He saw the impacts beforehand. It was interesting. \nThere was a letter to the editor in the Powell Tribune, a newspaper in \nWyoming, that talked about what we saw coming with this health care \nlaw. It was written by someone from Gillette, a Marion Scott. The \nheadline is: ``Enzi saw ACA impacts beforehand. . . . '' It says:\n\n       Dear Editor:\n       Fox News had a very interesting and informative program \n     Tuesday evening Nov. 6 on ``The Kelly Files with Megyn \n     Kelly.''\n       As anyone who watches Fox News knows, they are covering the \n     beginning effects of the Affordable Care Act, also known as \n     ObamaCare, as it is being implemented. Megyn Kelly began her \n     program stating she had a special guest who had predicted \n     three-and-one-half years ago almost exactly what will happen \n     when the Obamacare law goes into effect this October.\n       Her special guest was our own Wyoming senior Senator Mike \n     Enzi and he had made his predictions in a speech on the \n     Senate floor three-and-one-half years ago. He was then called \n     a fearmonger and radical rightwinger.\n\n  And he was. That is what they called him, as Senator Enzi went to the \nfloor because of his concerns that you would not be able to keep your \ninsurance. He had actually read the Federal Register, saw the \nregulations that came out, and he said: Millions of people are going to \nlose their insurance. He said it from right here at this desk over \nhere. He came to the Senate floor. He said it 3\\1/2\\ years ago, and \nthose on the other side of the aisle voted against Senator Enzi's \nproposal that would actually let people keep their insurance. It was \nthe regulations regarding grandfathered insurance policies, that people \nwould be able to keep their policies. That was the vote. Those on this \nside of the aisle all voted to allow people to keep their policies \nbecause that is what the President promised them. Folks on the other \nside of the aisle voted against Senator Enzi's proposal.\n  But those on the other side called Senator Enzi ``a fearmonger and \nradical rightwinger.''\n  It says:\n\n       Senator Enzi was probably one of a very few elected \n     officials who had actually read the bill.\n\n  Senator Enzi, it says, was one of the few elected officials who \nactually read the bill. I believe that. Who can forget Nancy Pelosi \nsaying: First you have to pass it before you get to find out what is in \nit. That video has been played and played again and again. I believe \nthat many of the people who voted for it never did read it. I believe \nthey did not read the bill. I believe they did not really understand \nit, and part of it is, I believe, they actually believed the President \nwhen he said: If you like what you have, you can keep it. If you like \nyour insurance, you can keep it. If you like your doctor, you can keep \nyour doctor. So they took this as an article of faith.\n  I read the bill. Senator Enzi read the bill. I know a number of our \nMembers who read it were very concerned and came to the floor and spoke \nabout different parts of the bill. I can remember Senator Susan Collins \nstanding here with her sign about the impact on small businesses and \nhow detrimental it was going to be. I remember Senator Olympia Snowe \ndown here on the floor focusing on how it was going to impact \nbusinesses in Maine. Yet all of these concerns that we raised, which \nare now coming home to roost today, were ignored on the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  This woman continues and concludes by saying:\n\n       With this kind of representation in the Senate I would ask \n     Wyoming voters this question. Is now a good time to send a \n     new Senator to Washington and lose this experience and \n     seniority?\n\n  I will tell you, I am proud to stand with Senator Enzi, and he saw it \ncoming. He saw it coming 3\\1/2\\ years ago with the amendment on the \nSenate floor. We voted that way, and the Democrats voted essentially to \nconfirm that people would lose their insurance. They were not going to \nbe able to keep it even if they liked it.\n  So these are the problems that continue to plague the health care \nlaw, continue to plague folks all around the country, as they are \ntrying to deal with something they never anticipated. You kind of think \na year in advance: What is going to happen with our kids? What is going \nto happen? Are we going to need to do something with the car? Patch a \nhole in the roof? How do we kind of budget for the year? I will tell \nyou, my friend in Cody, WY, never ever saw it coming that he was going \nto have to go from $860 a month to $2,400 a month for health insurance.\n\n  We know that at least 5 million people have gotten letters that they \nhave lost their insurance. For them, I do not think they are going to \nfind it is going\n\n[[Page S8698]]\n\nto be a very happy holiday season, a very Merry Christmas. I think they \nare going to be trying to figure out: Do I have insurance or do I go \nwithout it, as what is going to happen with my friend there. Those are \nthe things we are looking at.\n  Then, of course, there is the Web site. It is just interesting. This \nis an article in this week's Jackson Hole News & Guide in Jackson Hole, \nWY. ``New health care glitches plaguing Jacksonites. Marketplace \ninsurance companies try to mail paperwork to Jackson street \naddresses.'' But they only get mail in post office boxes there.\n  But that is how the Web site was set up. It was not set up so there \nwould be a separate area if you do not have a street address. They need \na physical address, but in some places you do not get mail that way, in \nmany places around the country, in certain rural American locations. \nBut the people who wrote it, the people who did this whole thing were \nrather clueless about how the country works, rather clueless about what \nhappens in people's homes, in people's families, in people's \ncommunities. I am sure they are very smart people and got degrees from \nadvanced places but really do not have an idea of what is going on out \nthere.\n  I also found it interesting that even when the President tried to \ntell success stories of people who may have had some success under \nthis, it does not even pan out.\n  A story on CNN: ``Woman Hailed by President as Obamacare Success \nStory Now Can't Afford Obamacare.''\n\n       CNN reports that a woman the President hailed as an \n     ObamaCare success story just realized she won't be able to \n     afford ObamaCare because it is too expensive.\n\n  It is too expensive. This is the tragedy. This is a national tragedy, \nthis Obama health care law. It was a self-inflicted wound on our \ncountry. No foreign enemy did this to us. The President of the United \nStates, who gave speeches that painted a broad picture of a better \nworld, has delivered a much worse world for folks through this \nlegislation.\n  I think this is devastating to the country, to patients, to doctors, \nto the nurses, the caregivers, and to the taxpayers. The reason we \nneeded health care reform in the country was because of the cost of \ncare. That is what this was all about, trying to help people get the \ncare they need from a doctor they choose at lower cost. That is what we \nwere really focused on.\n  So we needed reform. We needed the right kind of reform--reform that \nactually lowers patients' costs, improves health, and protects the \nvulnerable. So that means more affordable insurance options. It means \nhelping people with preexisting conditions. It means protecting quality \ncare for older Americans. We do not have any of that with this \nPresident's health care law. This is causing costs to go up, causing \nquality to go down, causing people to lose their doctor. The President, \ntime and time again, in speech after speech, talked about providing \ncoverage, but not providing care. As a doctor will tell you, there is a \nhuge difference between coverage and care.\n  This whole thing was predicated on printing up and giving out to \npeople Medicaid cards. Medicaid is a broken system. States will tell \nyou, Governors will tell you, that in many States Medicaid is the No. 1 \ncost driver of the State. In our home State, it was No. 1 when I was in \nthe State senate. What it meant is that money that went to that then \nwas not able to be used for teachers or schools or students or roads or \npublic safety officers. It is a huge cost driver.\n  So the issue is we needed to deal with the cost of care. The \nPresident says: Put them all in this Medicaid system. What is it? Forty \npercent--some high number of physicians do not want to take patients on \nMedicaid because in a sense the reimbursement to doctors who take care \nof those patients is low enough that you could not even afford to keep \nthe doors of the clinic open if all you saw were Medicaid patients all \nday.\n  So doctors want to see and take care of everyone. The idea was to put \nall these additional people on Medicaid, give them Medicaid cards. But \nthis whole health care law did nothing adequately to address the need \nfor more health care providers. So now you have more people with so-\ncalled coverage, but it is empty coverage, it is not quality care \nbecause there are not enough people to actually take care of the \npatients who are now being covered. It is like giving people a bus \nticket when there is no bus coming. They can just stand there, but it \ndoes not mean they can actually get care. But the President continued \nto focus on coverage, and coverage does not equal care.\n  So you take a look at the problems families face with cost and \naccess, and what the President is trying to provide is coverage, but we \nhave seen higher premiums, coverage canceled, which is coverage that \nworked for many people. Some of these are now being forced into trying \nto find something. People are losing their doctor and have higher out-\nof-pocket costs, higher copays, higher deductibles.\n  You read some of these stories of somebody saying: If I have to pay \nall this every month, why should I even sign up? Why don't I just pay \nthe fine? Why should I pay all this every month and then have such a \nhigh deductible when I am never going to use that much care. Maybe they \nnever will use that much.\n  So the logic behind this whole thing is baffling to many who have \nkind of ignored it, I think until now, until October 1 when the Web \nsite went live and subsequently crashed repeatedly. But now they are \nsaying: Hey, I have lost my insurance. That has been the real fracture \npoint, when people see they have lost their insurance that has worked \nfor them. To replace it is going to be something that does not work as \nwell for them and their families and is going to be more expensive.\n  So we see the public reaction to the law. It is a reaction related to \nthe premiums, related to trying to use the exchanges, and related to \nwhether employers stop hiring, which we have seen from my friend in \nCody, WY. We have seen the issues of reduced work hours because there \nis the regulation, if you are working more than 30 hours a week you get \ncounted toward that 50 employees. So many businesses have lowered the \nwork hours for people, which affects their take-home pay.\n  The President had some thoughts on that. He said we will just delay \nthe employer mandate for 1 year. That is the mandate in the law that \neveryone has to--at work they have to supply insurance to the \nemployees. The President may have had some idea that things were going \nto get sticky for him and he was going to become a little more \nunpopular with the individual mandate. So he pushed off the employer \nmandate for 1 year, unilaterally. When is the law the law and when is \nthe law something that the President can take a page out, throw it away \nand say: Well, we will move that back a year. It has happened about 14 \ntimes in this law.\n  Even when the House tried to give the President authority to do what \nhe did, the Democrats blocked that. It is astonishing. What about the \nindividual mandate? We are going to be fining people--the government. \nThe President is going to be fining people; whether it is a fine, a \ntax, a penalty, depending on how the Supreme Court states. That is \ngoing to go into effect January 1.\n  The people may not even be able to buy the product they are being \nfined for not having come January 1. So is the President going to delay \nthe individual mandate as well? There was a vote in the House, a number \nof people voted with bipartisan support for that. I think it is going \nto be challenging in the days ahead for the President to get ahead of \nthe situation the country is facing.\n  The newest numbers were out yesterday with the signup. The Associated \nPress reported on that:\n\n       Health care signups pick up the pace in November playing \n     catchup with a long way to go. President Obama's new health \n     insurance market last month picked up the dismal pace of \n     signups, the administration reported Wednesday. Employment \n     statistics showed 364,000 people had signed up as of November \n     30 under the health care law. Although that is more than \n     three times the October total, it is less than one-third of \n     the 1.2 million people officials had originally projected \n     would enroll nationwide by the end of November.\n\n  So crunch time is coming. Consumers who are afraid they do not have \ninsurance, they have until December 23, if they want to keep their \ncoverage January 1. But as I said earlier, that is why we are seeing so \nmany people across the country who do have insurance going to doctors \nnow--the doctor they know, the doctor they like--to take\n\n[[Page S8699]]\n\ncare of problems that may have been kind of put on the back burner but \nthat they would like to have taken care of now because they are not \nsure what is going to happen January 1: not sure if they are going to \nbe able to go to the same doctor, not sure if they are going to be able \nto go to the same hospital, not sure if they are going to be able to \nhave insurance, even though they think they may have insurance. Those \nare the things the American people are facing.\n  So as we come to the floor to discuss this nominee, the number of \nquestions I have are those related to what she would think about \nemployers changing things, people not signing up, others being forced \nto sign up; should she have to live under the law of the land as a \ngovernment employee, when the Senate majority leader says, well, his \npeople--some of his people do, some do not. These are questions one \nwould expect to have answered. I know we are going to vote on that \nnominee in a couple of hours. But I think this is something the nominee \nshould be thinking about as we take a look at this health care law and \nthe devastating impacts it is having on people all across the country.\n  Take a look at what is happening for consumers, people who do not \nwork in Washington, people who do not live in Washington. What you see \nis that the costs are going to be crippling to them. I stand here \namazed that that gentleman from Cody, WY, tripled the cost. I do not \nknow that everybody is going to face that. But the President promised \nthat costs would go down. He promised his health care reform would save \nAmerican families I think he said $2,500 per year by the end of his \nfirst term.\n  I remember--and I have seen the reel of him saying it--fifteen times \nhe said that. Your insurance premiums will go down by $2,500 by the end \nof the first term. Go down? They have gone up significantly, thousands \nof dollars. They have gone up. This is as he was a candidate running \nfor President. He promised his health care reform would save American \nfamilies $2,500 by the end of his first term.\n  But for many Americans it is driving the premiums way up; in some \ncases doubling them, in some cases tripling them. It is happening on \nthe exchanges. It is happening for people who are trying to shop not on \nthe exchanges but if they have lost their policy and have to start \npaying for a lot of other things, whether it is pediatric dental care, \npediatric ophthalmology care. All of those things drive up the costs.\n  That is the sticker shock of the health care law. So as people \ncontinue to learn more about the law, they are going to continue to \nbecome more and more displeased, which is why I think we are going to \ngo back to this headline: ``Health care law hurts President \npolitically.'' I know for people in this body that is a big deal. For \nthe President that is a big deal, because the last time I had a chance \nto speak face to face with the President, he was taking a lot about \npolls.\n  But as a doctor, I am more concerned about how the health care law is \nhurting people's health, hurting their families, hurting their families \neconomically, hurting the help they need, the care they need, \ninterfering with life choices, impacting their quality of life, costing \nthem in terms of disposable income in terms of money they could use for \nother things, and it is all because of the health care law.\n\n  I am going to continue to come back to the floor on a regular basis \nto talk, not about the Web site failures because that is just the tip \nof the iceberg. I expect that the Web site is going to get fixed. It is \ngoing to take them a while. It is going to take them a lot longer than \nthey ever suspected, because the day it happened, they described the \nWeb site problem as being a result of heavy traffic. We know on that \nsame day, worldwide, many Web sites had much more traffic. The site \nbroke down with I think less than 1,000 people logging on.\n  But they said it would be fixed almost immediately. It was not. Here \nwe are. They said it would be fixed by the end of November. So they \ngave themselves 2 months. It was not. Somebody testified not too long \nago in the House to say the back end has not been built, there is 30 to \n40 percent of it which has not even been put together.\n  Ultimately the Web site will get fixed, but the higher premiums are \ngoing to continue, people trying to buy insurance for their family that \nmeets the criteria the President has set out which is not based on \ncriteria that works for families or necessary for families. It is just \nthese 10 things government has decided that they think they know what \nis best for families, when I think families know what is best for them \nand what they would look for with health insurance and health care.\n  So we are going to continue to face higher premiums. People are going \nto continue to have their coverage canceled. It is not just the \nindividuals. Next year when the employer mandate goes into effect, when \nbusinesses are forced to make a decision: Do I try to buy health \ninsurance that meets all of those high demands that government says has \nto be included? Do I meet all of that and face these double or triple \nhigher premiums or do I say just go to the exchanges?\n  People who work, will they lose their employer-based insurance? I \nthink we are going to see more and more of that. Even the Congressional \nBudget Office, which took a look at this health care law, said it will \nhappen. They said there are employers who will no longer provide \ninsurance who are providing it now. There are different numbers from \ndifferent assessments as to how many people are going to be forced off \ntheir employer-based insurance, how many folks will lose it. I do not \nknow. I have seen different ranges. But it starts in the low millions \nand it goes into the tens and twenties and thirties of millions and \neven higher than that.\n  So those are the folks who will be losing and having their coverage \ncanceled. Then will those people be able to keep their doctor? The \nanswer there is many will not. Many will not. Many of those who have \nlost their insurance now are not going to be able too keep their \ndoctor, even if they want to, and even if their doctor wants to keep \nthem.\n  Doctors do not even know if they are going to be included in a number \nof these exchanges. They cannot find out, when they go and look and try \nto see if they can get on the Web site, where are they covered, where \nare they not included? This has been so poorly thought out and so \npoorly executed. It has left patients in the lurch, it has left \nhospitals in the lurch, and it has left doctors in the lurch.\n  I am astonished that all of those people still have the faith and \nconfidence in the President, which is probably another reason why \npeople do not look to the President now as having either honesty or \nleadership ability to handle a crisis--to see such a precipitous drop \nin the view of the President's ability to handle a crisis. Because if \nthey cannot get this right, what happens in terms of a national \ndisaster? How could he respond quickly when he had 3\\1/2\\ years to put \ntogether a Web site that apparently he paid very little attention to?\n  So we are looking at the higher premiums, the canceled coverage, \ncannot keep your doctor, the higher copays and deductibles are going to \ncontinue to plague this country and people. I know people on both sides \nof the aisle are going to get letters to this effect.\n  I know the Presiding Officer, when he goes home every night to his \nhome State, hears from people. You stop and fill up with gas, you hear \nfrom people. I am hoping other colleagues of ours will actually read \ntheir mail, go home, listen to people, to see how devastating of an \nimpact this health care law is having on their lives, their individual \nlives.\n  Will there be some people who benefit from this health care law? Oh, \nyes. But the pain it is causing for millions and millions of Americans \nis not at all what the President promised them: You like what you have, \nyou can keep it with your insurance. Not true; insurance premiums drop \n$2,500. Not true; If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. \nNot true.\n  So I come to the floor to discuss a nominee who very likely is not \ngoing to ever have to be living under the President's health care law, \nis going to go under some other health program, paid for with taxpayer \ndollars that those taxpayers are not going to have in their own pockets \nto pay for their own premiums, while she enjoys a government insurance \nprogram paid for in a different way by their taxpayer dollars, where \nshe is likely to be able to\n\n[[Page S8700]]\n\nkeep her doctor, not be subjected to the higher premiums, not be \nsubjected to canceled coverage, not be subjected to losing her doctor, \nnot be subjected to the fraud and identity theft, and not be subjected \nto the higher copays and deductibles.\n  I would say, if it is good enough for the people of America--that is \nwhat President Obama wanted for them--if it is good enough for Members \nof this body, except for those the majority leader said, oh, no, they \nknow what is in it so they do not need to live under it, I think it \nought to be good enough for this nominee as well.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as we continue this week's vote-arama on \nexecutive branch nominations, I wish to remind the American people how \nwe got here today and what it means to the future of our great country \nand our system of government.\n  Over the last 5 years President Obama and his administration have \nrepeatedly bent the law to serve their own purposes in a way that I \nthink is unprecedented in my experience. We saw this when he gave \nspecial treatment to union pension funds during the Chrysler bankruptcy \nprocess. We saw it again during the Solyndra bankruptcy. We saw it when \nPresident Obama unilaterally announced a moratorium on the enforcement \nof certain immigration laws. We saw it when the administration \nunilaterally issued waivers from the 1996 Welfare Reform Act and the \n2002 No Child Left Behind law. And, of course, we have seen it multiple \ntimes with the President's signature legislative--accomplishment, if \nyou can call it that--ObamaCare, which effectively became a law that \nmeans whatever the President wants it to mean. Indeed, without any real \nlegal authority, the administration has unilaterally delayed the \nemployer mandate, unilaterally delayed the income verification required \nin the ObamaCare exchanges, unilaterally delayed the cap on out-of-\npocket expenses, and has unilaterally delayed other insurance \nregulations.\n  Meanwhile, the Internal Revenue Service has been hauled into court \nbecause it has said that it will flout the text of the law by issuing \nObamaCare tax subsidies in the Federal exchange even though the law \nthat Congress passed and the President signed made clear that those \nsubsidies may only be used in the State-based insurance exchanges.\n  I constantly get asked by my constituents back home whether Congress \ncan do something about it. My response ordinarily is, well, the \nCongress under our system of government passes the laws, but it is the \nexecutive branch's obligation to enforce those laws. Indeed, that is \nthe oath the President takes when he is inaugurated--to uphold and \ndefend the laws and to faithfully execute those laws.\n  I think we have seen the kind of havoc that can be wreaked when the \nexecutive decides to pick and choose which laws to enforce based on \nexpediency, political or otherwise. We used to say that we are a nation \nof laws and not of men. Indeed, that is one of our country's--indeed, \nour economy's--great strengths.\n  There is a great little book written by a Peruvian economist on the \nnature of capital, which, of course, is so important to our economic \ngrowth. The point he makes is there are a lot of entrepreneurial \nsocieties in the world, but one of the things that really distinguishes \nthe U.S. economy and our success relative to those other \nentrepreneurial societies is the rule of law. It is the things, for \nexample, that mean that when you invest money in a piece of real estate \nor in a contract or in some other investment, you know with reasonable \ncertainty that investment will be protected against arbitrary action by \neither government or some other person, which, if you think about it, \nreally is one of the unique characteristics of the U.S. system of laws \nbecause we know with reasonable certainty that if those rights are \nbreached, if that investment is stolen, if it is nationalized by the \nFederal Government, you can go to court and seek compensation for that \nlaw-breaking.\n  Well, if President Obama wanted to continue to legislate in this time \nand effect from the White House by changing the laws Congress passed, \nhe should have stayed in the Senate. But his responsibility--indeed, \nhis sacred oath--is to enforce the laws even if those laws prove \nawkward or inconvenient.\n  One of the other important aspects of being a nation of laws is that \nif, in fact, it turns out that those laws prove inconvenient or awkward \nor undesirable for some reason, we have the capacity through the \nlegislative process to change those laws. That is sometimes referred to \nas a conversation or a dialog that the branches of government have with \none another.\n  So Congress passes laws that the President signs, and then if they \nare being implemented either by the executive branch or by \nadministrative agencies that are part of the executive branch and they \nturn out not to have the result Congress thought they would have or the \nPresident thought they would have, the great thing about our system of \ngovernment is we have the capacity to change those laws when they prove \nto have resulted in unintended consequences or when they prove \ninconvenient or awkward or otherwise undesirable.\n  I believe that, notwithstanding the greatest hopes and, I would \ngrant, the good faith of those who actually thought ObamaCare was going \nto work--it sounded pretty good. The President said: If you like what \nyou have, you can keep it, and if you think your premiums are too high, \nthe average family of four is going to see their premiums go down by \n$2,500. And if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. Well, \nall of that sounded pretty good, especially when you looked at the \npublic opinion polling back in 2009 when the President first started \nsaying those kinds of things because 88 to 90 percent of the people \npolled said they liked what they had. So when the President said they \ncould keep it, they said: OK; that is fine. I guess this is all about \ndealing with that 10 or 12 percent of people who had no coverage or who \nhad what they viewed as inadequate or otherwise undesirable coverage.\n  So I understand that some people may have been lulled into this idea \nthat this is the best thing that has happened in terms of health care \ndelivery in a long time. As a matter of fact, we have talked about this \napproach for many years. Even before I got to Congress, during the \nClinton administration we had HillaryCare. That was another grand \nscheme to basically commandeer the health care delivery system in the \ncountry that, in a way--again, I would grant the good faith of those \nwho actually thought they could make it work, but it didn't work, at \nleast as manifested in ObamaCare. And now we are confronted not with \nthe grand theory and good intentions but with the hard facts and the \nreality that ObamaCare has proved to be an unmitigated disaster.\n  Whether you are one of ObamaCare's biggest cheerleaders or whether \nyou were a skeptic like me and voted against it because you did not \nthink it was going to work, I think it is incumbent upon us to try to \nfigure out how to come up with an alternative, to hit the reset button \nand to pivot to patient-centered health care reform that leaves the \nchoices not in the hands of bureaucrats and the Federal Government but \nleaves the choices in the hands of hard-working American families and \npatients, where doctors whom we choose and trust can work with us to \ncome up with the best solutions rather than having the Federal \nGovernment say: We have done a cost-benefit analysis, and you are out \nof luck. You're not worth it. The Federal Government, the bureaucracy \ndoesn't think you should get that kind of treatment.\n  Well, what I don't want is for any President, including this \nPresident, to unilaterally waive or change or refuse to enforce a law \nfor political reasons. And that is what has happened. We have watched \nthe President's poll numbers plummet as the American people, who by and \nlarge during his first term of office and now during the first year or \nso of his second term of office wanted this President to succeed--I \nthink the fact that President Obama's Presidency was historic in many \nways, as\n\n[[Page S8701]]\n\nthe first African-American President ever elected in this country, gave \nall of us a sense of pride that our country had come so far--over, \nadmittedly, a long period of time but so far that a person who back at \nthe beginning of our country might have been considered less than a \nfully human being would now be the President of the United States. That \ngave us all hope in the future and hope in this great experiment known \nas America, to have the first African-American President of the United \nStates.\n\n  So this President was elected in 2008 and reelected in 2012 with a \nhuge reservoir of good will and hope that he would be successful. \nIndeed, all of us, regardless of our political stripes--whether we are \nconservatives or liberals, whether we are Independents, Republicans, or \nDemocrats, we are Americans first and we want America to succeed. That \nis what we want more than anything.\n  It is also important to remember that our system of government is \nimportant to our success over these last couple of centuries and that \nwe haven't gotten here by accident. We have gotten here because of our \nConstitution, because of the genius of checks and balances between \ncoequal branches of government. That is a lesson this President seems \nto have forgotten; that too often he decides to go it alone or do an \nend run around Congress because he can't get what he wants.\n  Well, we are not guaranteed, any of us, in political life or in life \nin general, to get everything we want. We know that particularly when \nit comes to legislation--things like health care reform--nobody gets \neverything they want if, in fact, it is going to be a bipartisan \nproduct.\n  But rather than attempting a bipartisan product, this President and \nour friends across the aisle decided to jam the American people and to \njam the minority party in Congress and to pass a law which now they own \nlock, stock, and barrel.\n  Again, I am willing to concede the good faith and good intentions of \nthose who thought this would work, but now we have gone from theory to \nevidence and experience, and we know it hasn't worked.\n  Well, thankfully, in our three coequal branches of government, we \nhave not just the legislative branch that passes the laws and the \nexecutive branch that is supposed to enforce the laws, we have a third \nbranch of government; that is, the judiciary. And they have done their \npart--but they are not through yet--to stop executive overreach and \nuphold the rule of law.\n  I have heard some of our colleagues say: Well, the Supreme Court has \nupheld most of ObamaCare and it is the law of the land--as if it is \nsomehow sacrosanct and can never be changed. Well, that is just not \ntrue, at least not under our system of laws. As I said to begin with, \nif we find that the laws we passed result in consequences we did not \nintend or we find that the American people are dissatisfied with it and \nit leads to undesirable results, we can change it, and that is the way \nour system works.\n  We are not bound forever by any law. We can change them because that \nis the way our system works. So when people say it is the law of the \nland, get over it, move on down the road, that is not an American \nperspective, at least under our Constitution.\n  As I said, we have seen a number of times where this President and \nthis White House have simply ignored laws, refused to enforce laws, and \noverreached. For example, the District of Columbia Circuit Court has \ndemanded that this administration follow the law on issues related to \ncorporate governance, emissions requirements, recess appointments and \nthe disposal of nuclear waste. This is the same court that this \nmajority leader, Senator Reid, and his political party have decided to \nstack. They decided to break the rules of the U.S. Senate that have \nbeen in effect a long time in an overt power play in order to stack \nthis second most important court in the Nation, the DC Circuit Court, \nby breaking the Senate rules in order to deny the minority a voice in \nthe confirmation process and to confirm these nominees in what we are \nengaged in this week, which is another overt power play.\n  But the stated reason for doing that, and the supposed necessity of \ndoing that, is because the senior Senator from New York, the majority \nleader, and others say they are not happy with the way the DC Court of \nAppeals has ruled on cases involving the Obama administration. But as I \nsaid a moment ago, in at least four of these big areas, the DC Circuit \nCourt has upheld the administration's point of view in important \nappeals before the court.\n  At the same time, the DC Circuit Court has also ruled in favor of the \nadministration on some issues related to health care, embryonic stem \ncell research, and several other major environmental matters. But \nnotwithstanding those successes in terms of policy approval by the DC \nCircuit Court of this administration's policies and of the \nbureaucracy's interpretation of those policies, we know that the \nmajority leader was bound and determined, along with his allies in the \nother party--that they were bound and determined to make sure the DC \nCircuit Court of Appeals would issue no rulings which would undercut or \nfail to enforce this administration's policies. So they decided to pack \nthis court, which is what this process we are engaged in this week is \nall about, with ideological allies who would rubberstamp their agenda.\n  When the minority in the Senate--and, by the way, I am not just \ntalking about my rights or Senators' rights. We are just \nrepresentatives. I represent 26 million people. When the majority \nleader shuts me out of the amendment process or the opportunity to have \na say in the advice and consent over the nomination of judicial \nnominees or executive branch nominees, he is not affecting my rights \nper se but the rights of 26 million Texans, to have their voice heard \nin this process. That is something he ought to think about and \nreconsider.\n  We know the nature of the Senate has been fundamentally transformed \nunder the leadership of Senator Reid. When I first got to the Senate, \nwhich was a while ago--it doesn't seem like that long ago, but it has \ndramatically changed--we had an open amendment process. We would \nactually have bills come to the floor, legislation such as the national \ndefense authorization bill, and we would spend up to 3 weeks debating \nand offering amendments on that important piece of legislation. As we \nhave heard at different times, the national defense authorization bill \nis viewed as so important by both political parties and by the entire \nSenate that we have passed a Defense authorization bill for I think at \nleast 50 consecutive years. That is quite a tradition. But instead of \ndoing that, Majority Leader Reid decided to cut off the opportunity for \nthe minority to offer amendments to this important piece of national \nsecurity legislation.\n  When we were able to block cloture in order to protest that in order \nto provoke, hopefully, a negotiation which would result in a process \nwhereby minority rights would be respected and an opportunity to amend \nthis legislation provided, now we learn that as part of this end-of-\nthe-year sprint to Christmas, that in addition to jamming through these \nnominees, the majority leader's intention is to take a bill that was \nbasically negotiated among four Members of Congress, that would be the \nfour Members of the Armed Services Committee, both the chairman and \nranking members on both sides of the Capitol, to fill up the amendment \ntree, file for cloture, and pass it in the last week we are in session.\n  It is beyond outrageous, this transformation in the Senate. I think \nwhat shocks many of us the most is that Majority Leader Reid is an \ninstitutionalist, and by that I mean it as a compliment. He has been in \nthe Senate a long time. He understands how the Senate works and why the \nSenate rules are so important. Yet nobody in my memory has done more to \nundermine the institution of the Senate and its rules and traditions \nthan the current majority leader. For what purpose? For short-term \ngain.\n  Why do I say it is short-term gain? They can get away with it when \nthey are in the majority, but it is temporary, because during the time \nI have been in the Senate I have been in the majority and I have been \nin the minority. I have to admit, being in the majority is a lot more \nfun. But in other words, what I am saying is this short-term power play \nby the majority party in the Senate to break the Senate rules, to jam \nthrough legislation and to\n\n[[Page S8702]]\n\ndeny my 26 million constituents in Texas an opportunity for me, on \ntheir behalf, to offer amendments to important legislation affecting \nthe national security of the United States is an outrage. It is an \noutrage.\n  I will give just one example. Four years ago at Fort Hood, TX, Nidal \nHasan, a major in the U.S. Army, killed 11 people and wounded about 30 \nmore. This is about 4 years ago. You will remember it. The reason it \ntook so long for him to be brought to justice--I am not sure I \nunderstand exactly why--but there was some concern, and a concern I \nshared, that if we identified this for what it truly was, which is a \nterrorist attack on our own soil, it might undermine the fairness of \nhis trial and give him some grounds to appeal and perhaps escape the \njust punishment for what he did.\n  Major Hasan, when there was initial review of what he did and \nevidence that he had shown absolutely clear signs of being radicalized \nand joining the fight of Islamic extremists against the United States \nof America, against his own government, that those were completely \nignored by the military, by the Army, in an exercise of \npolitical correctness. Even though he stood up that day and he said \nAllahu Akbar, ``God is great,'' in the traditional cry of Al Qaeda and \nIslamic extremists and others who were bent on suicide and homicidal \nacts, initially when that was reviewed, the conclusion by the \npolitically correct police here when they reviewed it was this is \nworkplace violence. In other words, they refused to call it what it \nwas, which was a terrorist act on our own soil.\n\n  I do not fully understand the reticence to identify it for what it is \nbecause we all know we had at least one other major terrorist attack on \nour own soil on September 11, 2001, when approximately 3,000 Americans \nwere killed by one of the most horrific terrorist acts to occur in our \nlifetime and hopefully ever--hopefully it will never occur again.\n  After that, the Department of Defense decided to use its discretion \nto award the people who were injured or killed in that incident the \nrecognition and benefits they deserved under our laws--Purple Hearts \nand other death benefits. But when I and my colleagues on the other \nside of the Capitol, Congressmen John Carter and Roger Williams, \nsponsored legislation to recognize that this attack at Ford Hood that \ncost the lives of 11 Americans, including 10 members of the U.S. \nmilitary and 30 more people were shot and injured, many of whom bear \nthose wounds even today--when we filed legislation on the national \ndefense authorization bill in order to amend that bill in order to give \nthat same recognition to these 11 Americans who lost their lives and \nthe 30 more who were injured in that terrorist attack on that day at \nFort Hood, TX, in Killeen, TX, some 4 years ago, that amendment has \nbeen shut out of this process.\n  Do not be confused. This is not about denying me my rights as a \nSenator. This is about denying those 11 Americans who lost their lives \nthat day justice, and the 30 more who survived that attack, the \nbenefits they are entitled to by virtue of being a victim of a \nterrorist attack on our own soil--again.\n  There are real human consequences to the machinations of the majority \nleader and this revolutionary change in the nature of the Senate, \ndenying the rights of the minority to be heard and to offer legislation \non behalf of our constituents. That has such far-reaching impact.\n  In many ways I think what we are experiencing this week and what we \nhave experienced recently is an attempt to distract the American people \nfrom the train wreck known as ObamaCare. If I had voted for the \nPresident's signature legislative proposal and I was one of the \nDemocrats who voted for it, since no Republican voted for it, I would \nwant to change the subject too. As someone who served in this Chamber \nfor 11 years, it saddens me that our Democratic friends choose to \nobliterate the Senate rules and gravely weaken minority rights for \npetty partisan reasons. Again, it is so shortsighted it is just \nunimaginable. It is as if Members of this body have attention deficit \nsyndrome, where they are so focused on immediate gratification that \nthey forget or they ignore the long-term consequences of this \nrevolutionary change in what once was called the world's greatest \ndeliberative body, which is no more the world's greatest deliberative \nbody, at least under this majority leader and under his rule-breaking \nregime.\n  Over the years leading up to last month's showdown, the majority \nleader repeatedly promised not to use the nuclear option. Again, I know \nthis is about process. The eyes of the American people begin to glaze \nover when we talk about the internal processes and operation of the \nSenate. But as I attempted to demonstrate a moment ago, they have real-\nworld consequences. Tell that to the people back at Fort Hood who lost \ntheir family member in this terrible terrorist attack on our own soil, \ncommitted by an American citizen wearing the uniform of the U.S. Army, \nwhere he joined the enemy, Islamic extremists, was radicalized by the \nsame person who essentially tutored the Underwear Bomber who was \narrested in Detroit, who tried to blow up another airplane on that day. \nThose people are the ones who are suffering the negative impact of the \nundermining of this institution by the majority leader. Well, the \nmajority leader repeatedly promised not to use the nuclear option, but \nhe broke that promise.\n\n  My experience in public life is--again, we all have different ideas \nabout how to accomplish our goals and hopefully improve life for the \nAmerican people, but one of the things that are even more important is \nthe personal relationships between Members of the Senate.\n  There is a lot of good work that can get done when there is good \nfaith and trust between Members of the Senate, and, indeed, those are \nnot the kinds of things that typically make their way into the \nnewspapers or that people pay much attention to because they are done \nquietly behind the scenes, cooperatively and collaboratively. But when \nthe majority leader--the leader of this institution--breaks his word \nrepeatedly about undermining the Senate rules in a partisan power grab, \nit necessarily undermines the trust that has come to be the important \nglue to this institution, and because it is important to this \ninstitution, it is important to the country. When we learned that trust \nis unjustified and that his promise is hollow and meaningless--well, it \nreminds me of another American who has made extravagant promises to the \nAmerican people that were obviously false and could not and cannot be \nrelied upon. I am talking about the President's promise in ObamaCare \nthat if you like what you have, you can keep it. I saw a poll recently \nthat said 37 percent of the respondents in that poll believe the \nPresident is honest and trustworthy.\n  I didn't vote for this President, but he is still my President. The \nability of the President of the United States to actually govern and to \nbe respected--not only here in America but around the world--and viewed \nas a person of character and substance, well, it is completely \nundermined by the kinds of false promises this President has made in \nObamaCare.\n  It is not just limited to health care; it has broad ramifications and \na huge ripple effect. In terms of the way that, for example, Bashar al-\nAssad in Syria used the President's redline on the use of chemical \nweapons--if Bashar al-Assad thinks this President is not going to be \nhonest or trustworthy in terms of his statements, then his threats of a \nredline simply will not be believed.\n  It is the same thing in Tehran, where 19,000 centrifuges are spinning \nand enriching uranium in Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons--a goal \nwhich, if achieved, and which is not too far off in the distant future, \nwill destabilize the Middle East and will threaten not only a regional \nwar but a larger conflict because if Iran gets a nuclear weapon--Iran \nis not just any average nation state. It is a state sponsor of \ninternational terrorism in the form of Hezbollah and other support, \nparticularly directed at our ally and friend, the nation of Israel.\n  Iran has been killing American soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq for \nmany years through their training and support for our more obvious \nadversaries there, through the design and importation in Iraq, for \nexample, of explosively formed penetrators that will melt through the \nmetal of our vehicles and other protective armament that our\n\n[[Page S8703]]\n\nmilitary uses and, as I said, resulted in the deaths of multiple \nAmerican GIs. So Iran is not our friend.\n  So when the President says: This is another redline, well, our \nenemies can read our newspapers. They read the same polls we read. They \nsee a President making false statements that cannot be relied upon, and \nit undermines his credibility when it comes to our enemies--people who \nwant to wipe Israel off the face of the map. That can have very \ndangerous consequences, obviously, because when people don't believe \nwhat America says through the voice and in the person of our Commander \nin Chief, the leader of the free world, it emboldens our enemies.\n  They push the envelope in North Korea, Iran, Syria, and other places \naround the world. This is not a minor issue. When the President acts as \nif the law does not apply to him and if the law means just what he says \nit will--meaning at any given moment--it is as if the law doesn't \nreally matter and his word cannot be trusted.\n  Just a few other thoughts on how ObamaCare was passed. I remember \nbeing in this Chamber on Christmas Eve in 2009. I think it was 7 in the \nmorning. It may have been 7:30 in the morning when we had the vote on \nthe ObamaCare passage--at least the initial passage. It passed with 60 \nDemocratic votes and no Republican votes.\n  I often pointed out that before ObamaCare, every major domestic \nreform in modern U.S. history--from civil rights, to Medicare, to \nwelfare reform, to No Child Left Behind--enjoyed significant bipartisan \nsupport at the time of its passage. Why is that important? Well, \nbecause ObamaCare was a pure partisan power play. It was shoved through \non a party-line basis without a single Republican vote and despite high \nlevels of public opposition.\n  I remember people were told: Well, we just haven't done a very good \njob of messaging and explaining or when ObamaCare is implemented, \npeople will learn to love it. Well, we now know that jamming through \nlegislation which basically commandeers one-sixth of the American \neconomy is a recipe for disaster. It is a bad way to pass any \nmajor law, let alone a measure that affects everyone in the country \nbecause our health care delivery system affects every man, woman, and \nchild in our country.\n\n  ObamaCare is a part of a broader pattern that should be deeply \ndisturbing to anyone who cares about our Constitution and the checks \nand balances that the Framers of our Constitution knew would be so \nimportant to maintaining consensus and maintaining balance.\n  Today's Democratic leaders seem to believe that might makes right and \nthat inconvenient legislation can be swept aside by Executive fiat and \nthat when the Senate rules prove to be an obstacle to obtaining what \nthey want, such as stacking the second most important court in the \nNation in order to be a rubberstamp for the bureaucracy's ideological \nzeal, well, they can sweep aside those rules too.\n  This debate is about far more than policy differences. It is about \nthe respect for the rule of law and respect for our Constitution, it is \nabout preventing the executive branch from running roughshod over \nCongress, and it is about safeguarding the constitutional government.\n  If we need any more examples about the Obama administration's abuse \nof power, I am prepared to provide that. We know the Obama \nadministration showed contempt for the normal legislative process in a \nnumber of ways. When Congress refused to enforce card check for labor \nunions, the administration turned to unelected bureaucrats at the \nNational Labor Relations Board, the NLRB. When Congress refused to, on \na bipartisan basis, pass cap-and-trade energy taxes, the administration \nturned to unelected bureaucrats, the Environmental Protection Agency. \nIndeed, now President Obama has authorized the EPA to regulate \nvirtually every aspect of the American economy without congressional \napproval even though the EPA itself has acknowledged that its proposed \ngreenhouse gas rule would not have a notable impact on carbon dioxide \nemissions during the next decade.\n  The Obama administration is acting in a lawless manner in other ways \nas well. In early 2011, more than 2 years before the Supreme Court \nruled on the Defense of Marriage Act, President Obama ordered his \nJustice Department to stop defending the law even though it was passed \nwith an overwhelming bipartisan majority of Congress. It was signed \ninto law by President Bill Clinton and broadly supported by the \nAmerican people. The right way to deal with that is not for the \nexecutive branch to refuse to enforce the law, but it is to come back \nto Congress and say: You know what. We think things have changed. \nCongress ought to reconsider.\n  Rather than do that, the President decided to have the Justice \nDepartment refuse to enforce the very law Bill Clinton signed.\n  Then there is the Independent Payment Advisory Board. This is part of \nObamaCare--one that perhaps has one of the most pernicious impacts \nbecause what it does is it puts unelected bureaucrats in charge of \ndeciding health care for your mother, your father, your grandmother, or \nyour grandfather--in other words, whether Medicare beneficiaries can \nget the health care they need. How do they have an impact? Well, these \n15 bureaucrats, under this ObamaCare-created bureaucracy, will have the \nauthority to decide what sort of health care Medicare pays for. This is \njust a way to ration access to care. So if these 15 bureaucrats on \nIPAB--the Independent Payment Advisory Board--say: You know what. We \nthink you are too old; we don't think it is worth it for you to get a \nhip replacement so you can walk and be productive and mobile; we don't \nthink it is worth it for you to get bypass surgery; we are not going to \npay for it, the Federal Government will not pay for it, and so it will \nnot be delivered.\n  What is worse is that IPAB's recommended Medicare cuts automatically \ntake effect unless a congressional supermajority votes to cut health \ncare spending by an equivalent amount.\n  Columnist George Will said:\n\n       This is a travesty of constitutional lawmaking: An \n     executive branch agency makes laws unless Congress acts to \n     achieve the executive agency's aim.\n\n  This is the Constitution turned on its head. Indeed, IPAB makes a \nmockery of our constitutional system of separation of powers, and it \nshould be repealed immediately.\n  Not only has the administration used unelected bureaucrats to \nsidestep the normal legislative process and disregarded the rule of law \nfor transparently political or ideological reasons, it has also \nfostered a culture of deception and intimidation.\n  One example is Operation Fast and Furious. This has particular impact \nto my State, which is a big border State. My colleagues will recall \nthat Operation Fast and Furious was this boneheaded idea wherein the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives would actually \nallow weapons to go from American gunshops into the hands of the drug \ncartels without interdiction. I guess the idea was once they got in the \nhands of the cartels, we would somehow trace them and know who the bad \nguys are, but it broke down along the way. So many of these guns were \nsimply not recovered and no doubt have been used to kill many people in \nMexico, as well as an American citizen, Border Patrol agent Brian \nTerry, 3 years ago.\n  Attorney General Holder, who is administratively responsible for the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, repeatedly obstructed a \ncongressional investigation into Fast and Furious, and his sworn \ntestimony was repeatedly contradicted by the Justice Department itself, \nby their own memos. One DOJ official--a U.S. attorney in Arizona--tried \nto smear a whistleblower by leaking a private document. The Department \nof Justice's own inspector general called this behavior inappropriate \nfor a Department employee and wholly unbefitting a U.S. attorney. A \nseparate DOJ official was forced to resign her position after she was \ncaught collaborating with leftwing bloggers to slander both \nwhistleblowers and journalists.\n  Then there is the IRS scandal. It is almost hard to keep up with all \nof the scandals, but we can't let these get away from us because they \nare so important to get to the bottom of one of the most important \ngovernmental bodies in the U.S. Government, and that is the Internal \nRevenue Service that, again, touches all of our lives. We found out, of \ncourse, that IRS agents were deliberately targeting people\n\n[[Page S8704]]\n\nbased on their political views. At least one conservative activist, \nCatherine Engelbrecht from Houston, TX, was targeted by multiple \nagencies, including the IRS, the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \nand Firearms, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, \nOSHA.\n  We also know the administration--or at least the bureaucracy--has \ntargeted political donors. The 2012 Obama campaign bullied private \ncitizens who donated money to Gov. Mitt Romney, including a man named \nFrank VanderSloot whose experience was chronicled by Kimberley Strassel \nin the Wall Street Journal. In April of 2012, Mr. VanderSloot found \nhimself, along with seven other Romney donors, condemned by an Obama \ncampaign Web site for being ``less than reputable.'' The Web site \nsuggested that quite a few of the eight donors had placed themselves on \nthe wrong side of the law and had gotten rich at the expense of so many \nother Americans. Mr. VanderSloot was singled out because--or I should \nsay he was singled out as a ``bitter foe'' of the gay rights movement.\n  Mr. VanderSloot didn't run for public office. He didn't volunteer to \nbe treated like this. He is an American citizen who was engaging in a \nconstitutionally protected right to provide financial support to a \npolitical candidate of his choosing. Rather than keep the fight on the \npolitical opponent--Governor Romney--the Obama campaign went after the \ndonors. Mr. VanderSloot didn't have a criminal background, nor did any \nother of the Romney donors who were similarly targeted. But shortly \nafter he was denounced by the Obama campaign in this manner, a \nDemocratic opposition researcher began researching his divorce records. \nMeanwhile, the IRS decided to audit 2 years' worth of his tax filings, \nand the Labor Department announced a separate audit of the immigrant \nworkers employed at his cattle ranch.\n  As Kimberley Strassel wrote for the Wall Street Journal: ``Every \nthinking American must henceforth wonder if Mr. VanderSloot has been \ntargeted for inquiry because of his political leanings.''\n  We also know this administration has harassed journalists. Although \nPresident Obama said this administration would be the most transparent \nadministration in American history, it has proven not to be so. In the \ncase of FOX News correspondent James Rosen, the Obama Justice \nDepartment tracked him down like a common criminal simply for doing his \njob. The Department of Justice tracked Rosen's movements, got a search \nwarrant to examine his private emails, and even obtained his parents' \nphone records. This is a journalist. As a Washington correspondent for \nthe New Yorker magazine noted: ``It is unprecedented for the \ngovernment, in an official court document, to accuse a reporter of \nbreaking the law for conducting the routine business of reporting on \ngovernment secrets.''\n  We also know the Obama Justice Department has conducted a \ndisturbingly intrusive investigation into the phone records of \njournalists who work for the Associated Press, and, as I said, \ndisplayed an unprecedented level of contempt and obstruction for the \nFreedom of Information Act.\n  Washington lawyer Katherine Meyer has filed FOIA cases under six \ndifferent administrations dating back into the late 1970s. FOIA is the \nshorthand for the Freedom of Information Act, of course. Last year, she \ntold Politico that ``this administration is the worst on FOIA issues--\nthe worst.'' So much for the President's claim to be the most \ntransparent administration in this Nation's history.\n  In 2011, the Obama-Holder Justice Department received a mock award \nfrom the nonpartisan National Security Archive which said that the DOJ \nhad shown the ``worst open government performance'' of any Federal \nagency that year. This is the agency that is supposed to enforce the \nFreedom of Information laws, and it was recognized as demonstrating the \n``worst open government performance'' of any agency that year. Among \nother things, the Department of Justice was cited for its mistreatment \nof whistleblowers and its efforts to undermine the Freedom of \nInformation law.\n  Speaking of whistleblowers, we know the State Department has also \npunished U.S. diplomats for cooperating with congressional \ninvestigators looking into the September 2012 terrorist attack that \nkilled four Americans at Benghazi, Libya. This is so outrageous that it \nbears recall that Susan Rice, the President's U.N. Ambassador, showed \nup on five, I believe it was, Sunday morning talk shows and claimed the \nattack at the American consulate in Benghazi that took the life of four \nAmericans was precipitated by a video that was deemed to be \ndisrespectful of the religion of Islam. It turns out that wasn't true, \nand for a long time the administration denied this was even a terrorist \nattack--something which it now acknowledges. But when people come \nforward, such as the whistleblowers, diplomats who knew the Ambassador \nand those who lost their lives on that terrible night in September of \n2012, then they are punished, not welcomed as truth tellers, to get to \nthe bottom of this terrible incident in Benghazi, Libya.\n  Then we know that further intimidation continued with ObamaCare in \n2010. Actually, this preceded the Benghazi intimidation. In 2010, \nvarious health insurance companies began alerting their customers that \nObamaCare was going to force them to raise premiums. This is back in \n2010. Fast forward to 2012. That is what has happened. So first of all, \npeople saw the Web site was a problem and now that is getting fixed, \nand now they are experiencing cancellations, and then there is the \nsticker shock where their premiums have gone up. In 2010, when the \ninsurance industry tried to tell their own customers their premiums are \ngoing to go up because of this law, Kathleen Sebelius, the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, responded by threatening to punish these \ncompanies and bar them from participating in the ObamaCare exchanges.\n  It is quite remarkable. I think in any other context we could call \nthis thuggery, intimidation, abuse of power.\n  A few years later, we learned that Secretary Sebelius was shaking \ndown private companies to help fund the implementation of ObamaCare \nbecause Congress, believing it had been misled in so many instances \nregarding ObamaCare, had refused funding. It is very disturbing to \nlearn that the same IRS official who led the division that targeted \npeople because of their political beliefs is now in charge of \nadministering large portions of ObamaCare.\n  As I said a moment ago, one of the biggest casualties in all of \nthis--particularly as it relates to the false promises of ObamaCare--is \nthe President's own credibility. The other day I had a chance to speak \non this topic and I said, ``ObamaCare is the single biggest case of \nconsumer fraud in American history.'' Anybody else under any \ncircumstance would find themselves hauled into court and be called to \naccount. If a private citizen or a private company had spoken out, they \nwould be sued for money damages. They would likely be put out of \nbusiness because there would be an injunction granted or perhaps \npunitive damages.\n  When the President speaks on behalf of the United States, whether it \nis in domestic affairs such as ObamaCare or whether it is on \ninternational matters such as the red line on chemical weapons in Syria \nor the red line on Iranian nuclear aspirations, it should count for \nsomething. But according to a new NBC Wall Street Journal poll, only 37 \npercent of Americans give President Obama a ``very good'' rating for \n``being honest and straightforward''--37 percent. That compares with 63 \npercent in January of 2009. So the President's reputation for honesty \nwent from 63 percent in January 2009 to 37 percent on December 11, \n2013, or at least that is the date the Wall Street Journal and NBC \nreported the results.\n  We know when the President's approval rating--particularly his \napproval rating for honesty and truthfulness--is damaged, all of those \nwho trusted the President as he led them down the gangplank with the \nimplementation of ObamaCare are bound to get pretty nervous, because \nwhile the President was able to move the actual implementation of \nObamaCare past his own reelection in 2012--this law was passed back in \n2010. Yet the President himself was able to avoid accountability, by \nand large, by pushing the implementation past his election in November \n2010. But 2014 will be a midterm election. The President will not be on \nthe ballot, but his allies will be on the ballot--people who trusted \nhim,\n\n[[Page S8705]]\n\nas he told them and he told the American people that you are going to \nbe able to keep what you have if you like it, even though he knew it \nwasn't true. We know that from as far back as 2010.\n  Senator Mike Enzi led the effort to expand the grandfathering \nflexibility in the Health and Human Services rules, and that was \ndefeated on a party-line vote. All of our Democratic friends voted \nagainst expanding the flexibility of these grandfathering provisions \nback in 2010 when HHS and, indeed, the Congressional Budget Office \nestimated that as many as 78 million Americans on employer-provided \nplans would find they would no longer be able to keep their coverage \neither.\n  So there is going to be a day of accountability in November of 2014, \nas those who, perhaps unwisely, trusted the President, who believed in \nthis big government scheme that simply has not worked--and that many of \nus believed would never work--there will be a day of accountability.\n  My hour has come and gone, and I see the Senator from Oklahoma on the \nfloor. In conclusion, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of stories \nfrom Texans who have been affected by ObamaCare be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Stories From Texans Who Have Been Affected by Obamacare\n\n\n Texans continue to write in with painful stories of how Obamacare has \n                   affected them and their loved ones\n\n       My husband and I are self-employed. We have coverage \n     through BCBS of TX. Our current premium for us and our 2 \n     children is $854 per month. Our premium was raised to $854 \n     from $814 three months ago. We have a $6000 family \n     deductible, and an out of pocket amount of $12,000. We have \n     been very happy with our policy. However, I created an \n     account on healthcare.gov to see if we could get a cheaper \n     policy with similar coverage.\n       The cheapest insurance coverage offered on the website is a \n     Bronze package with 60% coverage and monthly premium of \n     $1189. This is the cheapest policy with less coverage than \n     what we currently have!\n                                                   Texas Resident,\n     Austin, Texas.\n                                  ____\n\n       ``I worked 34 years for AT/Lucent/Avaya and took an early \n     retirement in 2001 with pension and healthcare.

This month \n     we were notified that Avaya would stop providing all pre-65 \n     healthcare to retirees and their dependents.

The first is that it includes maternity and pediatric \n     care, which in our fifties my wife and I don't need. The \n     second difference is the ACA plan premium is 65% more per \n     month that my current plan.\n       The president said I could keep my plan, at 65% less for \n     the same high quality coverage offered by the ACA option I \n     want to keep it.

No one wants a hernia \n     surgery unless they need it. My husband switched jobs for a \n     pay raise. It ended up being a pay cut because of the \n     crippling cost of insurance.

I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I enjoyed listening to my colleague for \nTexas. I will just comment to him, we are just beginning to see the \nseries of untruths about what the President and his allies have said \nabout this bill. I practiced medicine for 25 years, I delivered over \n4,000 babies, I had a broad-ranging general practice, and I was \nbelittled on this floor for the statements that are now coming true by \nthe very colleagues who voted for the unaffordable care act.\n  Let me just outline for you four things that are going to be untrue.\n  You cannot keep your insurance. Whether you like it or not, you are \nnot going to be able to keep your insurance. You cannot keep anything. \nI am going to read a story in a minute about a young man who could not \nafford his employer-based plan but went shopping, had a vasectomy so he \ncould qualify for his insurance because it did not have maternal \ncoverage. They did not want more children. His wife wanted to stop \nworking. He had a wonderful plan. He cannot do it now. Now he cannot \nget insurance because he cannot afford it, and he makes about $500 too \nmuch to qualify for any subsidy.\n  So you cannot keep it.\n  The second thing is you cannot keep your doctor. I am experiencing \nthat right now. MD Anderson in the Senator's own State is not covered \nby any of the plans. I have had a recurrence of cancer. My doctors now \nare at MD Anderson. I cannot use them under the unaffordable care act, \nunless I want to go and spend $70,000 or $80,000 on my next procedure \nout of my own pocket. I will have to go somewhere where the care is not \nwhat I would deem it.\n  The third untruth is every family is going to save $2,500. It is \ngoing to be about the opposite. Because everybody is going to be \nspending about $2,500 more.\n  Then, finally, what I was belittled on, that the quality of care is \ngoing to go down when they said the quality of care is going to go up. \nAccess is going to be harder, not easier.\n  So when the American people really find out--the intention behind \ntrying to fix health care was a good one. The system was broken. We do \nneed to do things. But the untruths associated with this attempt to \nmicromanage people's lives in a market--that was not perfect--I want to \ntell you, this is going to be so much worse than what we had in terms \nof real care and real outcomes. When it comes to individuals, most \nimportant is the relationship between the doctor and the patient. It is \nnot just for the patient. The doctor having a relationship with the \npatient makes for much better judgments in terms of the quality of care \nthey give and the insight into caring for the whole of that person. We \nare wrecking that. We are going to wreck that.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I just ask my colleague, I am aware of his own experience \nthat he just recounted here with\n\n[[Page S8706]]\n\nthe fact that MD Anderson--the world class hospital located in Houston \nthat is really the premier cancer treatment facility in America and \nperhaps even in the world--they are not in the exchanges so the Senator \ncannot continue his treatment there.\n  Can the Senator explain how that happens because I think a lot of \npeople think if they like their current doctor and they like their \ncurrent hospital facility, they are expecting that when they sign up \nfor ObamaCare they are going to be able to continue to see that doctor \nand go to some same high-class health care facilities. How did that \nhappen?\n  Mr. COBURN. I have not researched it yet. I guarantee my colleague, I \nwill research it, and I will find out. But the fact is, the leading \ncancer centers--Sloan-Kettering, the same thing--the leading cancer \ncenters in this country probably could not reach an agreement at a \nprice low enough that would pay for their costs for this advanced \ncancer care, so they did not offer them a contract because they would \nnot cut their prices enough for the insurance.\n  So here is the main point. We promised to increase access. What you \nare really seeing is decreased access. I cannot go to Chris Logothetis. \nThe No. 1 urologic oncological specialist in the United States--I \ncannot go see him under my insurance. I can. I am fortunate enough. I \nhad a career before I was in the Senate. I will pay. But think about \nhow many people are not going to be able to see Chris Logothetis and go \nto MD Anderson and have their life saved through the latest advances in \npure biochemical and medical research put forward by a lot of people \nfrom Texas; some money from the NIH, there is no question; some from \nthe Milken Institute, private money that has gone into research. We all \nseem to think that NIH is the only one who funds research around this \ncountry. There are a lot of entrepreneurs who fund tons of it.\n  So as to this idea of access, we can say you are going to have \naccess. It is just like in Medicaid. Oklahoma chose not to expand \nMedicaid, and I agree with that. The reason is we are never going to \nsend the States the money. It is an impossibility, if you look at our \nbudget situation, for us to ever keep the promise that the unaffordable \ncare act said we would do for the States.\n  But here is what is happening: People who are going to be signed up \nfor Medicaid--and there is a whole other story about people who are put \nin Medicaid who are not eligible and will not be able to sign up who \nthe whole system has kicked wrongly into Medicaid--you can sign up for \nMedicaid. Where is your doctor? Seventy-five percent of the doctors in \nCalifornia are not even going to sign up for the Affordable Care Act.\n  In Oklahoma, a recent survey said, of the doctors over age 52, 60 \npercent are retiring in next year. Age 52--our best doctors, the ones \nwith the most experience, with the most gray hair. They have seen it \nall. They have the best differential diagnosis. They are hanging it up.\n  Now we have all these rules coming with the Affordable Care Act on \nwhat you have to do on electronic medical records. You have ICD-10--\n66,000 codes now versus 10,000 that the doctor is responsible for \npicking. What we have is a mess on our hands.\n  The final fifth lie is the denial of the problems that ObamaCare, the \nunaffordable care act, has caused and sticking our head in the ground \nand saying: Well, it is not causing any of those things.\n  It is going to be the most disruptive thing that has ever happened in \nthis country to one-fifth of our economy.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Will the Senator yield for one other question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. CORNYN. To the Senator's point about Medicaid, in Texas, I \nbelieve the number is basically only one out of every three doctors--\nabout a third of doctors--will see a new Medicaid patient because it \nreimburses at about 50 cents on the dollar of what a private insurance \nplan will. I know there is the problem of coverage versus access that \nthe Senator alluded to. But I wanted to just ask the Senator about that \nsometimes our friends who supported this legislation said: If you care \nabout getting people with preexisting conditions coverage or if you \ncare about young people being able to stay on their parents' health \ninsurance coverage, you have to take the whole enchilada; in other \nwords, you have to accept all 2,700 pages of ObamaCare, and that is the \nonly way you could address these concerns.\n  Are there ways to address some of these legitimate concerns, such as \npreexisting conditions, without embracing all of ObamaCare?\n  Mr. COBURN. Sure. One of those things is adverse selection, where \nsicker people raise the costs for everybody in the pool. But if, in \nfact, you looked at the Nation as a whole, and you had a law that said \nfor any insurance company that is cherry-picking only healthy people, a \nportion of their profits will go into a pool at the end of the year for \npeople with high-risk illnesses, that is what Switzerland does. It \nworks wonderfully. What it does is it changes the behavior of the \ninsurance company. They cover everybody.\n  So the whole idea behind insurance is to spread the risk. We did not \nhave good risk rating. There is no question we need to address it. The \nSenator was on a bill with me, the Patients' Choice Act, which actually \nwould not have created any of this mess and actually would have created \na market with some of the parameters that would have spread the risk \nand had real indemnification in the country, but also would have had \nmarket forces driving it and still let you choose what you want.\n  The biggest problem with the unaffordable care act is it takes any \ndiscretion away from you about what is best for you and your family. It \ndoes it two ways. One is in terms of the details of what you can and \ncannot buy. I have 63-year-olds who have to buy maternity coverage.\n  But the final point I would make in that regard is that it takes away \nyour ability to do what is your free and correct right to not buy \nhealth care if you do not want it. What is freedom about? You have to \nbuy health care? We say: It does not really do it. It just charges you \na tax, right? Even though we said it was not a tax, we somehow got it \ntwisted around, and the Supreme Court says this is now a tax. I have \nnot figured that one out yet. I hope the Senator has.\n  What does that have to do with freedom? If I choose to not buy a \nproduct--what if I choose not to buy high-definition cable? Is there a \npenalty for that? In other words, does Washington really know better? I \nthink we have seen in the last 10 years, in my experience in the \nSenate, we are really the last ones to know, and the common sense of \nthe American people is far greater than most of the ideas that were \never thought about coming out of here, other than some of the original \nfounding documents that our Founders had.\n  So I would make one other comment on Medicaid. There is a recent \nstudy out of Oregon, which has done a good job of expanding its \nMedicaid. But when they went to look at what the difference was of \nexpanded Medicaid, what they found out was that you were still, in \nOregon, better off if you did not have Medicaid. You were better off if \nyou had no insurance at all than if you had Medicaid. That is because \nwe downward select through Medicaid, because of its pricing, to not the \nbest of the health care system.\n  So when they looked at the control of diabetes, when they looked at \nhigh blood pressure, when they looked at the control of heart disease \nand congestive heart failure--when they looked at all those things--\nthey found one thing that was better: the treatment of anxiety.\n  That was it. So in Oregon, when they actually looked at the study--\nand part of that is because, even though you say you got Medicaid, if \nyou do not have a great doctor-patient relationship, where someone can \nget in your face who loves you and cares for you and cares about your \nhealth, and says: You have to do these things to change, you are going \nto change. So there is no impact.\n  So running it from Washington versus having real markets with a real \nsafety net like the Patient Choice Act, which had a real safety net so \nthat people are auto-enrolled who are irresponsible against \ncatastrophic illnesses, is not a much better answer.\n  The other thing that is going to happen--I predict in April--is that \nyou are going to see another uproar in this\n\n[[Page S8707]]\n\ncountry. That is when the seniors in this country pay their taxes and \nthey find out that the little meager interest income they got off their \nsavings because of what the Federal Reserve is doing, or the few \ndividends they got, 3.5 percent of that is going to now come to ``pay \nfor ObamaCare,'' because that is called investment income--3.5 percent.\n  So whatever your tax rate is, if you have any earnings on an \ninvestment, you are going to be paying that. You know, I will never \nforget Christmas Eve morning 2009--not having an opportunity to go over \nthe Patient's Choice Act or have it voted on through the raw, brute \npolitical force of this body and ignoring the rights of the minority. \nWe voted on the bill that many of us predicted--I am not worried about \nthe exchanges. They will get that fixed. That is just the incompetency \nof management. They will get it fixed. It will eventually work and work \nwell.\n  What will not work is the rest of it. It will not work. Just look at \ncentralized management everywhere else in the Federal Government. It is \ninefficient, most of the time ineffective, oftentimes complicated by \nfraud or incompetence. We are going to do that to one-sixth of our \neconomy. We are doing to it one-sixth of our economy.\n  The other thing that is going to happen in April of this year is \npeople who have a health insurance policy through their employment, not \nbuying through an exchange, are going to see their personal \ncontributions through their employer rise significantly. That is \nbecause the insurance industry is going to have to pay for all of this. \nThey are going to have adverse selection in what is being signed up on \nthe exchanges.\n  The insurance companies that sell to the medium-size businesses and \nthe smaller businesses who are not in a risk plan, they are going to be \nraising the costs for small businesses. So what is probably going to \nhappen is that those small businesses are either going to markedly \nincrease their employees' share or they are going to drop insurance all \ntogether and pay the fine--pay the tax or pay the fee, whatever it is. \nPay the penalty. But the individuals, the people who we said we were \nhelping, then will not be with the insurance that they had. They will \nbe back to an exchange with a price, even with subsidies that are \ngreater, 1. No. 2, with a copay that is greater--2. And, No. 3, with a \nmassive deductible which is at 6,000 or 7,000 bucks, and all you really \nhave is catastrophic coverage. Why did we not just do that? Why did we \nnot just write catastrophic coverage for everyone in the country and \nlet the market work on the rest of it?\n  That does not allow the elites in our society to make decisions for \nyou. That is what we have done.\n  Let me share another story. This is from Tina Wilkerson. Tina called \nin. She has been a school cafeteria worker for a long time. For the \nlast 14 years she has worked 40 hours a week for 10 months out of the \nyear. She works for a food contractor company.\n  She has now been changed to a seasonal employee because of ObamaCare, \nso that her employer can avoid the ObamaCare mandates. It was costing \nher about $400 a month for a health care premium, which included \nmedical, dental, vision, plus life insurance, plus a short-term \ndisability policy. She went to the Web site, looked at plans. With her \nsubsidy, she pays $645 a month premium, with a $12,000 deductible, does \nnot have vision care, does not have dental care, does not have life \ninsurance coverage, and does not have disability coverage.\n  That is middle income in Oklahoma. Here is someone who, because of \nwhat we have done, is now far worse off--far more exposed in her \nattempt to do good. I will give my colleagues credit. Their ambitions, \ntheir goals are worthy; they were worthy. But the results are a \ndisaster and will become much worse of a disaster.\n  I want to spend a little bit of time talking about the fact of what \nis really going to happen in the medical world. I have four former \npartners. I go by there sometimes on Friday and visit. You cannot \nbelieve the morale in the medical community today--unbelievably \nnegative. You talk about worried. Think about the average physician. \nThey have an undergraduate degree. They spend 4 years in medical \nschool. They then spend 3 or 4 years in specialty training. So they \nhave 12 years at a minimum of higher education.\n  They come out all excited about actually doing good, real good, \nmaking a difference in individual people's lives--whether it is holding \na hand when somebody is going through a rough time or diagnosing a very \nserious disease. The payment for being a physician is the relationship \nwith a patient. It does not have anything to do with money. It has to \ndo with helping your fellow man. I want to tell you, that is totally \nupside down right now. If you do not think that makes a difference when \nyou have a doctor walk into a clinic setting, and you are sitting there \non an exam table, and that doctor is focused on: How am I going to pay \nthe overhead? How am I going to buy the next piece of equipment that I \nneed to care for you the way I need to care? How am I going to buy \ninsurance for my own employees? How am I going to pay for the necessary \nbills?\n  Oh, by the way, I have got the Independent Payment Advisory Board \ncoming that is going to tell me what I can and cannot do as a \nphysician, regardless of how I am trained, regardless of what I know, \nregardless of how much gray hair, regardless of how much experience I \nhave in terms of really caring for folks, I am going to have a group of \nunelected, appointed bureaucrats decide what I can and cannot do for \nyou.\n  Then on top of that, we have ICD-10. Most people do not know that. \nThat is a diagnostic code manual that has just been expanded from some \n10,000 diagnoses to over 66,000 with Federal penalties if you do not \nexplicitly get it down to the detail. It is not enough that you broke a \nmetacarpal in your hand, you now have to label which hand, which \nfinger, and describe in subsets the fracture. Your nurse cannot do that \nfor you. You have got to do it. So now we are taking more time, and the \npenalties are going to be severe if you do not do it right.\n\n  As a matter of fact, they will not pay you for Medicare or Medicaid \nif you have not done that. There is no significant benefit to the \nhealth care community, but certainly a mandated bureaucratic cost on \nevery physician practicing in this country that will offer no long-term \nbenefit to the individual patient.\n  So now you have a doctor walking in. He may have been up all night \nthe night before delivering a baby, carrying this added burden of all \nof this bureaucratic mess that the affordable/unaffordable care act \nplaced on physicians in this country. Think that has any impact on \ndiagnostic skills, on compassion, on empathy? Think it will impact \ncare? It certainly will. It is going to have a devastating impact.\n  I want my physician focused on me. I do not want him worried about \nthe Federal Government. I do not want him worried about IPAB. I do not \nwant him worried about ICD-10. I do not want him worried about whether \nor not they have met the requirements of electronic medical records. I \nwant him worried about me. I want him concentrating on me.\n  So we have put this big distraction out there because we know better \nthan the market, than the trained professionals, and the arrogant \nassumption that we know better than the average American about what \nthey need because we have already told them what they must buy. We have \ntold them, if you do not buy what you must buy, here is the penalty. \nThank goodness the young people of this country have figured that out.\n  Which brings us back to the integrity of the statements of the \nPresident. What did he say? We have seen all sorts of rationalization \nevidence: If you like your insurance now you have got, you can keep it. \nIs that right? Right now, for 5.8 million, and soon to be 15 million \nAmericans that is not true. They knew it was not true when they said \nit. But it sounded good.\n  Second deceitful thing: If you like your doctor, you can keep your \ndoctor, period. Oh, really? Can I if I did not have individual separate \nmeans to keep Chris Logothetis? No, no. You cannot keep your doctor. \nYou can have a new doctor, based on what your insurance company--based \non what the pricing mechanism has. You can have one of those doctors. \nBut if your doctor is not on that list, you cannot keep him.\n  So somebody may have delivered all of your babies, taken care of your \nparents, delivered your babys' babies, cared for your husband's heart \nattack, knows everything about your family,\n\n[[Page S8708]]\n\nknows your psychosocial profile, knows your emotional needs, someone \nwho has really been your ally in life--that is gone for millions and \nmillions and millions of Americans.\n  But oh, no: You like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. Every one \nof my colleagues voted against Mike Enzi's bill to allow you to keep \nyour insurance under the grandfather clause. Every one. Mike Enzi knew \nwhat was going to happen. He put a bill on the floor. All of my \ncolleagues said: No, we do not want you to be able to keep your \ninsurance. It does not work that way. What about the deceit of this? Is \nit significant? Sure it is. It is a matter of trust.\n  Third thing. The promise of President Obama, who said, on average, \nthat your health insurance costs will go down $2,500 a year. I do not \nknow who told him that, whether it was Dr. Emanuel or who. I do not \nknow what whiz-bang accountant or financial forecaster told him that. \nBut it is just the opposite of that. Probably the average American is \ngoing to spend about $2,500 more trying to get equivalent care to what \nthey had, not keeping their same insurance and not keeping their \ndoctor.\n  Then, finally, the deceit that is assumed but not spoken, is that \nyour doctor is going to make decisions for you and with you about your \nhealth care.\n  When the independent advisory board gets going, it will be not only \nabout Medicare, it will be about everybody. If a group of unelected \nbureaucrats thinks I shouldn't run a non-stress test on a pregnant \nwoman whom I am watching closely and they say I can't do that, I won't \nbe able to do that.\n  We are going to be having a group of people practicing medicine in \nthis country who don't know the patient, don't know the situation, \ndon't have their hands on the patient, haven't ever touched the \npatient, making decisions about what kind of care that patient will \nget.\n  When we try to unwind the unaffordable care act, we have a routine \nchorus of noes. So the consequence is, who is going to be held \naccountable?\n  A total disruption of the indemnification market in this country is \nnow occurring in terms of health care insurance. When the insurance \ncompanies look at what their ratios are in terms of young to old, in \nterms of higher risk patients who cost more versus younger patients who \ncost less, they will make a calculation this spring about what their \nfees will be for next year.\n  The ObamaCare administration did something else deceitful--\nintentionally deceitful. Before the election next fall, they don't want \nyou to know how much the health care costs are going to rise, and so \nthey changed the date on which you will make a selection for next year \nand on which those prices will go through until after the November \nelections next year because they know that if you know the significant \nincrease in costs that are going to come next year--not just this year \nbut next year--based on the adverse selection and the mix of all of the \ninsurance companies in this country--they know that the rise in your \ninsurance health cost is going to be significant. So what did they do? \nThey passed a little rule, and they changed the day to make the \nknowledge available to you, the purchaser, come after the election. So \nyou won't be a fully informed voter knowing that your insurance costs \nare going to rise 20 or 25 percent again next year under the \nunaffordable care act--the unaffordable care act.\n  We are in a mess in a lot of ways. We are going to continue to see \nsignificant disruptions in the health care in this country. We are \ngoing to see a continuous decline in the quality of health care in this \ncountry--just the opposite of what they promised--because we are \ndisrupting the doctor-patient relationship. I know this, having \npracticed for 25 years. I know what it takes to really care for \nsomeone. I know what it means to be in a room and spend the time that \nit takes to listen, to find out what is really going on, to find out \nwhy the patient is really there. We are going to drive down all of \nthat.\n  We have this payment system in Medicare which pays on the basis of \nprocedure--which is a dumb system--instead of paying on the basis of \ntime that is spent with a patient. What most people don't recognize is \nthat all reimbursements in this country for physicians--unless a doctor \nis in concierge medicine, which is another thing I will talk about in a \nminute--force doctors to spend less time with their patients because as \nwe crank down reimbursements, either through Medicaid or through the \ninsurance or through Medicare, and a doctor has fixed overhead which \nhas been markedly expanded under the mandates associated with the \nAffordable Care Act, less time means less quality care. Less time means \nless quality care.\n  There was an interesting study done recently about how long--after \nyour doctor comes into the room and asks ``why are you here today?'' \nhow long before you are interrupted because the doctor is in a hurry to \nget to the next patient. It is 6\\1/2\\ seconds.\n  So our reimbursement mechanism, mandated by the Federal Government--\nanother positive aspect of us meddling in the markets--is decreasing \nthe time, the quality, and the quantity of health care that patients \nrightly deserve when they are sitting in your office.\n  What is the market doing about this? There is this growing expanse of \nwhat are called concierge doctors where, for a certain fee, that doctor \nis yours no matter how many times per year you want to go to him or \nthem. No matter what your needs are, they are available to you 24 hours \na day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. How does it work? Well, most \npeople can't afford concierge medicine. It is about $1,000 a year that \nyou pay. Insurance doesn't reimburse you for it. You pay $1,000, and \nthey are available. You get a comprehensive, thorough health care \nscreening exam once a year. All of your tests are included in that as \nfar as blood tests and laboratory tests at a physician's office. Then \nif you have a need at any time during that year, you have access to \nthat physician.\n  What do we find? The first studies that have come out on that, where \nwe take the time pressure off the doctors and let them actually \npractice medicine the way they were trained, show that they order 40 \npercent fewer tests. Isn't that interesting?\n  The axiom in medicine that every doctor is trained with is if you \nwill listen to your patients, they will tell you what is wrong with \nthem, whether it is cancer or diabetes or heart disease or anxiety or \ndepression or hypertension. But it takes time, it takes interaction, \nand it takes a great differential diagnosis. The unaffordable care act \nis destroying that. This is why you are seeing this little blurb out in \nthe market where you see concierge medicine because now the reason they \nare ordering fewer tests is they spend about five times as long with a \npatient because they are not in a hurry to get to the next patient \nbecause they are not making their money by filling out a code and \nfiling it with an insurance company. There is a complete relationship \nbetween the physician and their patient.\n  I would like to return to this gentleman named Brian who is from \nOklahoma. He and his wife have two children under 5 years of age. They \nbelieved what the President said when he told them they would keep \ntheir health insurance plan and their doctors if they liked them. Brian \nrecently called my office and said: That isn't true. That was a lie to \nme. It was deceitful. It was untrue.\n  Brian works in Tulsa, and the company he works for, he felt the \ninsurance cost was too much, so he didn't take insurance from his \nemployer, and he went on the private market and bought, through \nCommunity Care in Tulsa, a plan he and his wife could afford. His wife \ndecided to quit working, stay home, and raise their two kids. He was \npaying a $330 premium, but it didn't cover maternity care, and they \ndidn't want any more children, so he underwent a vasectomy, which is an \nelective procedure, to make sure he wouldn't have more children.\n  On November 1, Brian received a letter in the mail stating that as of \nNovember 1 of this next year he would be terminated from his current \nplan and he would have to find a plan that satisfied the new mandates \nthat the wisdom of Washington said had to be in there--maternity care. \nHe spent hours on the ACA Web site, and what he found were plans that \nranged in costs from $800 to $1,100 per month--four times what he was \npaying. He can't afford that. He didn't qualify for a subsidy, but he \ncan't afford that.\n\n[[Page S8709]]\n\n  So now what does he do? He had plan for $330 a month that met his \nneeds and covered what he and his wife thought they needed covered. He \nis a young man. What is going to happen to Brian? Brian is going to get \ntaxed, not because he doesn't want to buy health care, not because he \ncan't afford the $330 or even $400 or $500 a month, but because he \ncan't afford $800 or $1,100 a month. So now Brian is going to be \nwithout health care--I am going to say it again: without health care--\nand then we are going to fine him, we are going to tax him because we \ndesigned a system that took him out of the market. It didn't put him in \nthe market; it took him out of the market.\n  What have we done? We had an opportunity to fix that with the Enzi \namendment, to grandfather all of these plans in, and all of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle said no.\n  So here is Brian with a wife at home and two small children under 5, \nand he is stuck in no man's land. Do you think he thinks President \nObama is truthful? No. Does he think those who touted the Affordable \nCare Act are truthful? No. He has lost confidence in his government.\n  That is really where we are in our country today. We are in a crisis \nof confidence with Washington. It was never meant to be. If you read \nthe enumerated powers--as a matter of fact, we have an Enumerated \nPowers Act. It has 36 cosponsors. It says simply that if you bring a \nbill to the floor, you have to state what section of the Constitution \ngives you authority to legislate in that area based on what article I, \nsection 8 of the Constitution has to say. Disappointingly, there is not \none of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who is a cosponsor \nof that bill. It doesn't stop you from offering the bill, it just says \nplease reference where in the Constitution you have the authority to \nlegislate in this way. None of our colleagues believe the Constitution \nhas any bearing on what we do by the fact they will not even cosponsor \nthat bill.\n\n  The very thing our Founders emphasized was our authority to make or \nchange law. That is fundamental, structural to this country. As we have \nignored--as does the affordable-unaffordable care act--the enumerated \npowers, the consequences to our country are monstrous.\n  This book contains, through the middle of November, all the emails my \noffice has gotten on the Affordable Care Act from a State of just 4 \nmillion people. We are just 4 million people. There is not much \npositive in here. As a matter of fact, there is not one positive story \nin here. They are all stories similar to Brian's and Tina's--identical. \nHad care; don't have care now. Had an affordable plan; don't have an \naffordable plan now. Had a doctor; don't have that doctor now.\n  As a matter of fact, one of the stories in here is from somebody who \nhad their doctor for 35 years and can't have that doctor anymore. It is \nnot because the doctor doesn't want the patient, and it is not because \nthe patient doesn't want the doctor. It is because the unaffordable \ncare act has decided that will not work in our system anymore.\n  We have heard through the press that we didn't have any ideas on \nhealth care. My colleagues know that isn't true. Senator Baucus stood \nright over there on December 8, when we tried to bring up the Patients' \nChoice Act. That did everything in terms of the goals which the \nAffordable Care Act did, without raising taxes, without disrupting the \nindemnification market in this country, creating a true safety net for \nthose who could not afford health care, and created auto-enrollment for \nthe irresponsible. We were never allowed to vote on that.\n  It was very similar to what we are seeing now with the Defense \nauthorization bill. We have to pass one, but you can't have your say. \nMy 4 million people don't count when it comes to the Defense \nauthorization bill because they do not like the amendments I might \noffer.\n  Under the Constitution, it is illegal for the Pentagon not to give a \nreport of how it is spending its money. It is a violation of the \nConstitution. We have an Audit the Pentagon Act. It has real teeth in \nit. There is somewhere between $50 billion and $100 billion worth of \nwaste a year in the Pentagon. We will never manage the Pentagon if we \ncan't measure what they are doing. Yet we don't get an opportunity to \noffer that. It is a smart good government amendment. But it is not in \nthere, and it is not ever going to get offered. Why? Because the \nmajority leader in this body has decided he will decide what amendments \nare offered and what amendments will not be.\n  This is no longer the greatest deliberative body. This is a mimic of \nthe House of Representatives--the exact opposite of what our Founders \nintended the Senate to be. Their genius was they created a House of \nRepresentatives to be responsive to the populace demands of our \ncountry. That is why elections are every 2 years for the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  When the Senate was first formed, it was an appointed body by the \nState legislature and it was for a 6-year term. Jefferson wrote the \nrules--the first rules under which the Senate would operate--and the \nSenate was designed to make sure there could never be a tyranny of the \nmajority, as we see today; that the minority rights of those in \nopposition would never be limited. For the first 130 years, it took \nabsolute unanimous consent to do anything in this body. The rules were \nalways changed--when the rules changes were made--with a two-thirds \nvote of those duly sworn and present, until November of this year.\n  Are things raw in the Senate right now? You bet. And they are going \nto stay that way because the very genius behind our Founders was to \nforce consensus and compromise in the Senate, something the majority \nleader doesn't believe in. We saw the raw, brute political power with \nthe unaffordable care act. Not a single Republican voted for that bill. \nIt was forced through with a 60-vote margin in December 2009 on \nChristmas Eve morning.\n  Now we see more raw, brute political force, not because it had to be \nthat way but because leadership is lacking, an understanding of the \ntraditions and history of the Senate. Carl Levin explained why he \ndidn't agree with that. We didn't listen to one of the senior Members \nwho has been here a long time, who understands the history of the \nSenate, and so consequently we find ourselves in a situation where \nconsensus is not derived, the mechanism to force consensus has been \ndiminished, long-term thought goes out the window, and bipartisanship \nwill as well.\n\n  I wish to spend another minute or two talking about the Defense \nAuthorization Act and the waste in the Pentagon. A little over 1 year \nago I put out a report on the Pentagon. In the Pentagon's budget is $67 \nbillion a year which the Pentagon spends on items that have nothing to \ndo with defending this country. I put out that report in the hopes the \nSenate Armed Services Committee would look at that report and say: We \nought to take all this out of the Defense Department.\n  Do my colleagues realize the Defense Department has 112 science, \ntechnology, engineering, and math programs--110 separate programs. That \ndoesn't have anything to do with defending the country. They have 138 \ngreen energy programs, spending billions of dollars every year on them. \nThat should be at the Department of Energy, not in the Pentagon. It \ncosts $50,000 a year to educate a child on a military base in this \ncountry--four and a half times what it costs to educate anybody \nanywhere else in this country. That doesn't have anything to do with \ndefending the country either. Why?\n  So we have $67 billion that not one aspect of was acted on in the \nDefense Authorization bill. That was not taken out. Let's have the \nmilitary defend this country and not do all these other things that \ndon't have anything to do with defending the country.\n  Oh, by the way, if we moved that $67 billion out, it is estimated we \ncould save about $15 billion in overhead absorption by moving medical \nresearch to the NIH, where it belongs, instead of the billions of \ndollars we send to the Pentagon for medical research that doesn't have \nanything to do with extraneous diseases that our combat forces might \nencounter in odd places around the world.\n  So $67 billion, and we could have saved $15 billion. That $15 billion \nis three-quarters of what the new ``agreement'' between the House and \nthe Senate on the budget for the next 2 years is. We could have saved \nthat. That is $15 billion that would have paid for training; $15 \nbillion that would have bought more ships; $15 billion that\n\n[[Page S8710]]\n\nwould have worked on missile defense, now that we are going to need it \nsince Iran is going to eventually be armed with a missile-based nuclear \nweapon. But we didn't do it.\n  We have the Government Accountability Office that in the last 3 years \nhas identified duplication throughout the Federal Government coming \nclose to the tune of $250 billion. One committee in the House has \nactually acted on their report. Of that $250 billion, perhaps $50 \nbillion or $40 billion could be saved by eliminating some duplication. \nYet not one committee in the Senate acted on the recommendations of the \nGovernment Accountability Office to eliminate duplication--not one. Not \none bill came to the floor.\n  We have tried to insert a lot of it, but we can't offer amendments \nanymore. We don't have the opportunity--the 4 million people in \nOklahoma--to have a say on what happens. They see what is not \nhappening, and they wonder why we don't fix these things.\n  Let me create a scenario for a minute. What do my colleagues think \nwould happen in the country if we actually did the things the \nGovernment Accountability Office recommends we do? What would the \npeople think if we eliminated the duplication, if we eliminated the \nfraud, if we eliminated the waste? The confidence of the American \npeople in this Congress would rise because we are actually addressing \nthe problems. We are actually addressing the key components that put us \nin deficit every year.\n  It is true--my colleagues all tell me--the biggest problem is our \nentitlements. That is true. But it doesn't mean we don't worry about \nthe smaller problems. As a matter of fact, I am reminded--as I see the \nPresiding Officer in the Chair--that I owe Senator King some \ninformation on some programs I forgot to give him that he asked me for \nin November. But if in fact we did all those things, if our committees \nwere charged, through the leadership of this body, to eliminate the \nduplication, consolidate the programs, and save the money because we \nneed the money right now, we need to not be charging it to our \nchildren, what would happen to the confidence in this country? It would \nrise. We would actually be doing what the people expect us to do. \nNobody in the real world gets to do what we do--ignore the real \nproblems, don't act on the real problems and say: It is too hard. It is \ntoo difficult.\n  I yearn for bipartisanship, for consensus. I yearn for a system that \nforces us into consensus--not all my way, not all somebody else's way \nbut somewhere in the middle. That requires using the rules of the \nSenate and a long-term vision of where our country needs to be going \nand not caring about what a political career looks like but caring \nabout what our country looks like.\n  We have lost focus on what is important. It is not my career, it is \nnot the career of the distinguished Senator from Iowa, it is what \nhappens to our country. We have our eye on the wrong ball. I do too. I \nadmit it. We degenerate to the easiest thing to be critical about.\n  I am human. I admit to that as well. It doesn't have to be that way.\n  Mr. President, I see that the majority leader and several others are \non the floor. I yield the floor in anticipation of our vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in enthusiastic support of the \nnomination of Chai Feldblum to serve a second term at the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission. Commissioner Feldblum has served \nwith distinction at the Commission since 2010. She is a respected \nprofessor of law, and one of America's premier experts on employment \ndiscrimination and civil rights laws.\n  I have had the pleasure of working personally with Commissioner \nFeldblum first on the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act in \n1990, and more recently in 2008 on the passage of the Americans with \nDisabilities Amendments Act. She was a tremendous help to me in both of \nthose efforts.\n  Chai Feldblum has a fierce intellect and a passionate commitment to \nensuring equal opportunity for all. Perhaps the most important quality \nin a Commissioner at this critical agency, Commissioner Feldblum has \nthe ability to listen to all sides and to make careful decisions about \nthe allocation of the scarce resources that Congress provides to the \nEEOC. That ability to listen carefully, to search for compromise, and \nto forge consensus are skills that I have observed during our work \ntogether, and that I know she brings those skills to the EEOC.\n  She has built close working relationships over the course of her \ncareer with both worker advocates and the business community. This \nexplains why her nomination has broad bipartisan support here in the \nSenate and in the employment community as a whole.\n  I have here letters of support from the Society of Human Resource \nManagers, the U.S. Business Leadership Network, and a letter signed by \nleading attorneys in the labor and employment bar. The signatories on \nthat letter include five former GOP Commissioners and officers of the \nEEOC and the Department of Labor. Speaking of Ms. Feldblum, these \nattorneys say, and I quote, ``Commissioner Feldblum has been one of the \nleading lights in the employment law field. She is a tireless \ncontributor to the employment law bar and to educating stakeholders on \nemployment law issues.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that these letters be made part of the \nRecord.\n  I would also like to note the critical role the EEOC plays in \nensuring that people with disabilities are protected from employment \ndiscrimination, and in interpreting and enforcing the employment \nprovisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA. My committee \nlast year issued a report, Unfinished Business: Making Employment of \nPeople with Disabilities a National Priority, that focused attention on \nthe fact that employment rates for people with disabilities remain far \nbelow the employment rates for any other group. The report noted that \npeople with disabilities participate in the workforce at less than one-\nthird the rate of the general population, and that workers with \ndisabilities dropped out of the labor force at a much higher rate \nduring our recent recession. Given these harsh realities, it is \ncritical to have a Commissioner at the EEOC who understands disability \nlaw and is committed to enforcing the employment rights of people with \ndisabilities. Given the role that Commissioner Feldblum played not only \nin passing the ADA and the ADA Amendments Act, but in the \nimplementation of those laws, it is invaluable to have someone with her \nexpertise at the EEOC.\n  I am not alone in that view. I have a letter here signed by 38 \nseparate disability organizations in support of her re-nomination. I \nask unanimous consent that this letter be included in the Record.\n  Commissioner Feldblum's confirmation will ensure that the EEOC has a \nfull complement of members, and that the agency is able to move forward \nwith the critical work of ensuring equality in the workplace. While \nmuch progress has been made in recent decades, discrimination in the \nworkplace persists. Today, too many employment decisions are based on \ninsidious stereotypes and prejudices rather than an employee's talent, \nability and qualifications. Too many hardworking Americans face hiring \ndiscrimination, harassment, unfair treatment or even termination, not \nbecause of lack of skills or poor performance but because of their age, \nrace, sex, disability or some other irrelevant factor.\n  Commissioner Feldblum brings to the EEOC a determination to work on a \nbipartisan basis to craft practical solutions, and to work to make \nAmerica's workplaces more fair and free from discrimination.\n  The EEOC's mission is simple: to promote equality of opportunity in \nthe workplace and enforce Federal laws prohibiting employment \ndiscrimination. Unfortunately, the agency must fulfill this broad \nmission without sufficient resources. The EEOC is constantly being \nasked to do more with less. Just in the past year, as the result of \nsequestration and across-the-board cuts, the EEOC has seen its budget \ndrop from $360 million to $343 million. Meanwhile, the EEOC continues \nto handle an increasing number of complaints--almost 100,000 each in \n2011 and 2012!\n  At least in part thanks to strong management and setting clear \npriorities, in 2011 the agency managed to reduce its backlog for the \nfirst time in almost 10 years. Together with Chairman Berrien and the \nother members of the Commission, Commissioner\n\n[[Page S8711]]\n\nFeldblum has played an important role in developing a strategic plan \nthat allows the EEOC to create a system that rewards effective \ninvestigations and conciliations, and does not incentivize the closure \nof charges simply to achieve closures.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the re-confirmation of this \nexcellent, highly qualified nominee. I look forward to her confirmation \nand to her continued service on the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). All time has expired. The question \nis on the Feldblum nomination.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Chai Rachel Feldblum, of the District of Columbia, to be a Member of \nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I appreciate the 3 minutes to be on \nthe floor in support of the nomination of\n\n[[Page S8712]]\n\nLandya McCafferty to the Federal district court for the District of New \nHampshire. If confirmed, Landya will be the first woman to serve on the \nFederal bench in New Hampshire. But it is not Landya's gender that \nmatters; it is her professional experience and her personal qualities \nthat make her stand out. She has widespread bipartisan support \nthroughout the New Hampshire legal community and she will make an \nexcellent addition to the Federal district court in New Hampshire.\n  She is currently the U.S. magistrate judge for the District of New \nHampshire. Her Federal court experience includes clerking for two \ndistrict court judges and at the First Circuit Court of Appeals. Landya \nhas also prosecuted professional misconduct cases for the New Hampshire \nSupreme Court Attorney Discipline Office, served as an appellate and \ntrial attorney in the highly regarded New Hampshire public defender \nprogram, and worked in private practice as a civil litigator.\n  Landya is an innovator. As a magistrate judge, she has become a \nnationally recognized expert and teacher on how to use technology to \nachieve a more efficient and paperless workflow in the Federal court \nsystem.\n  She was unanimously rated ``well qualified'' by the American Bar \nAssociation's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary--their \nhighest rating.\n  Landya is also active in the legal community outside the courtroom. \nFor the past decade she has lectured at continuing legal education \nseminars on various topics, primarily on legal ethics, and has also \npresented guest lectures on legal ethics and civil procedure at the \nUniversity of New Hampshire School of Law.\n  I am pleased that this morning, after several months, we are finally \ngoing to get a chance to vote on Landya McCafferty, who is a well-\nqualified, noncontroversial district court nominee. She has the support \nof Senator Ayotte, who also represents New Hampshire.\n  I have no doubt Landya McCafferty will be an outstanding Federal \ndistrict court judge, and I urge my colleagues to support her \nnomination when the vote comes up this morning.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I rise to discuss the nomination of \nElizabeth Wolford to be U.S. district judge for the District of New \nYork.\n  I am new here. I am just completing my first year in the Senate. But \nI believe this nomination gives us all an opportunity to discuss how \ngovernment is or is not working in Washington, DC.\n  I know when I travel the State of Nebraska--and I am back in the \nState most weekends and put on hundreds of miles; we are a big State, \nbut as I travel the State of Nebraska, people always ask me: How are \nthings going in Washington? How are you doing in Washington? I can't \nhelp but compare what we do in Nebraska to what we are doing now in \nWashington, DC, because in Nebraska we have a pretty unique system. We \nare unicameral, we have one house, we are nonpartisan, and we get \nthings done.\n  We have an agenda set up every day in the Nebraska legislature, and \nwe follow that agenda. We have bills listed. We go through those bills, \nand, most importantly, we take votes. As a State senator in the State \nof Nebraska, I have an opportunity to rise and debate with my \ncolleagues on the issues before us. I have the opportunity to sit at my \ndesk in the chamber in the Nebraska capitol and write out an amendment, \ntake it up to the desk, have it discussed, and then have it voted upon.\n  I believe the Nebraska way is a good example for what we could do \nhere in Washington because we have so many important issues before us \nthat are not being debated. I am speaking basically to an empty Chamber \nright now. We aren't debating the big issues before this country. We \nare not acting upon the big issues that are before this country. We \ncertainly are not voting on those issues.\n  We have a system in the Senate where amendments are not accepted. \nThat whole concept is very foreign to me, because, as I said, in \nNebraska we are able to file amendments and we are able to have those \namendments voted upon. We also respect the rights of the minority, for \nalthough we may be officially nonpartisan, we do belong to political \nparties. We have a right to express our views on an issue, to represent \nour constituents, and to express their concerns. Those rights are \nrespected, they are valued, and they are upheld.\n  I can tell my colleagues I had bills that were filibustered in the \nState, and those filibusters would last, in one case, 16 hours. But in \nthe end, after those views of the minority were expressed, we took a \nvote on the issue. In Nebraska, we take up those issues. We defend the \nrights of our constituents to be heard, and that is what this body \nshould do as well. We should honor the rights of all of our \nconstituents and have their views be heard.\n  Being from Nebraska, we don't have as many people as some of the \nother States. But within this body, every Senator is equal. Every \ncitizen has equal representation. That is a principle, and that is a \nvalue that must be respected.\n\n  I am sorry to say I believe we are at a point where that principle, \nthat value is no longer respected within the U.S. Senate.\n  I see my colleague from Nebraska is in the Chamber, Madam President. \nI ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Nebraska and I be able to \nenter into a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to enter \ninto this colloquy with my colleague from Nebraska.\n  We have a rather unique experience. For 6 years I was the Governor of \nNebraska, and when Senator Fischer was elected to the unicameral, I was \nactually coming to Washington to be the Secretary of Agriculture, so we \ndid not work together. But we both worked in the same system.\n  I would like to get a legislative perspective about how the Nebraska \nunicameral works. I saw it from the Governor's office, but, of course, \nI was not on the floor every day. That is not typically what a Governor \nwould do--to go to the floor every day. But Nebraska is a pretty \nRepublican State. I think we all recognize that. We know that. It is a \nnonpartisan unicameral. So not only is it a one-house system, but the \nsenators do not run as Republicans or Democrats. They run on a \nnonpartisan ticket.\n  I would also say that our voter registration in Nebraska is public \nrecord. So, of course, the media, when we would run for office, would \nalways look up how we were registered or they would ask us. I do not \nremember a time--maybe there was a time, but I do not remember a time--\nwhen Democrats had the majority in the unicameral by their voter \nregistration.\n  I would like the Senator from Nebraska to explain how the majority \nparty, Republicans, worked with the minority party in terms of \ncommittee assignments, how they would work with the minority party in \nterms of chairs. Would a member of the minority ever get a chance to be \na chair of a committee? How does that work? And I would like the \nSenator to talk a little bit, if she would, about how this system works \non a day-to-day basis in terms of the relationship between the majority \nand the minority. Maybe it will be instructive today.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I am so very fortunate to have Senator \nJohanns as the senior Senator from Nebraska. He has a wealth of \nexperience as a former Governor, as a former Secretary of Agriculture, \nand as a U.S. Senator. So he has definitely been a mentor to me. I \nbelieve, perhaps, Nebraska can mentor the Senate through the trying \ntimes we are facing right now.\n  As Senator Johanns said, we are nonpartisan. We do not caucus. We do \nnot have majority or minority leaders because we are nonpartisan. So we \ndo not have that leadership structure in our State that we have here in \nthe Senate.\n  In the State of Nebraska, if you want to be part of leadership, you \nstand on the first day of a legislative session, and you have to \nnominate yourself and run for that position. So you would nominate \nyourself for speaker and then we do a secret ballot. It is 25 votes, \nand you would be speaker because there are\n\n[[Page S8713]]\n\nonly 49 of us. Then we go through the committees, and we have 14 \nstanding committees. So as chair of the transportation and \ntelecommunications committee, I had to stand on the floor of the \nlegislature and nominate myself, which is hard to do, but you nominate \nyourself, and then your colleagues, your peers, decide who the chairman \nwill be.\n  We had Republicans and Democrats who were committee chairs. In fact, \nthis past year in the legislature, even though officially there is a \nmajority of Republicans, many of our chairmen--in fact, I think it was \nthe majority--were Democrats because you are rewarded for the hard work \nyou do, for your integrity, for your honesty, for being willing to \nlisten to all sides and work with everyone to reach consensus.\n  So it is a unique system, it works for our State, and it is that \nability to work with each other to try and build those coalitions so \nyou can get your 25 votes on an issue, on a bill that you have, that \nmakes us so very special with regard to other States and also with \nregard to the U.S. Senate, because we do work together.\n  The coalitions change. The coalitions change depending on the issue. \nYou can find allies all across the spectrum--from more liberal members \nto more conservative members. If you have a good idea that is going to \nbenefit the people of the State, your peers are willing to come forward \nand work with you.\n  I know Senator Johanns as Governor had to draw up budgets and send \nthose budgets, then, to the legislature and have our appropriations \ncommittee go through that process dealing with his agency heads. Then \nthe appropriations committee would bring that package to the floor. \nHere again, we would debate it. I do not know if the legislature always \nagreed with Senator Johanns during his time as Governor, but perhaps he \ncould give us some insight into how we came together on budgets and \nwere able to work through that as well.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I would love to be able to stand here \ntoday and say to my colleague from Nebraska that every time I submitted \nsomething to the legislature they loved it, blessed it, and passed it. \nBut that did not happen. There was a give-and-take process that would \noccur. The budget is actually a perfect example. Like this system, the \nGovernor of Nebraska gets the first shot. The Governor, soon after the \nlegislature would go into session in January of each year, would submit \na budget. We have a long session. It is a 90-day session 1 year, and \nthen next year it is followed by a 60-day session. In the 90-day \nsession we would do the full budget exercise. Typically, in the 60-day \nsession we would do the fine tuning. It was a biennial budget that \nwould be passed.\n  I quickly learned if I was going to have any success, whether it was \nthe budget or any other initiative, I had to reach out on an individual \nbasis and convince each senator of the merits of my idea I was \nproposing. This was not a situation where I had the ability to go to \nthe majority leader and say: Get your people in line. Crush the \nminority and pass my budget. That would never happen in Nebraska. It \nwould not happen with the majority--typically that would be Republican \nin Nebraska--and it would not happen with the minority, which is \ntypically Democratic in Nebraska.\n\n  I always said as Governor that most days the one thing that the \nunicameral could almost unanimously agree upon is that they were mad \nabout something when it came to the Governor. But the reality is we \nworked through these things. There was give-and-take. There were things \nthat I wanted that I did not get. There were things that I did want \nthat they would have to give in and compromise on. It never failed, we \nwould pass a budget by the end of the legislative session.\n  I have said many times looking back on my time as Governor that at \nthe start of the legislative session--the 90-day session--there was one \nthing I could guarantee to Nebraskans. That was that by the end of the \nsession a budget would be passed. The second thing I could guarantee \nis, without gimmicks, that budget would balance. We had a simple \nphilosophy. We would not spend money that we did not have. No. 3, I \ncould promise Nebraskans that we would not borrow money to make that \nbudget balance because, you see, in Nebraska we are limited by our \nconstitution. We are only allowed to borrow $100,000, which I am sure \nwhen the constitution was written many, many decades ago that was a \nvery handsome sum of money. Today it does not get you very far. So at \nthe end of day we had to balance the budget.\n  Some of my greatest allies as Governor were Democrats. Some people \nwho fought me the hardest on certain issues were Republicans. But we \nhad to work through that.\n  I would ask my colleague from Nebraska, does she ever remember a time \nin the 8 years she was a Nebraska senator where she was in a meeting \nwhere her Republican colleagues said to her: Let's figure out a way to \nsilence the minority and get our way on every vote because we have the \nmajority. We could win every vote if we do that. Let's figure out a way \nto break the rules so we can change the rules so this minority means \nnothing anymore in this legislative body when it comes to these issues.\n  I ask my colleague from Nebraska, did that ever happen?\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, the people of Nebraska would never \nstand for that to happen in our State. As I said, we are very proud of \nour unicameral system and how we are able to work together. Of course, \nwe know who is a Republican and who is a Democrat in the Nebraska \nlegislature. But as I said, we are able to cross that aisle, which does \nnot exist in Nebraska, by the way. We do not sit separate from each \nother. We are able to reach out and work together. We have this system \nthat is so open and so transparent. We work with the Governor--or \nperhaps in Senator Johanns' case not work with the Governor--on the \nissues. But we are able to have that dialog with our chief executive. \nWe are able to have that dialog with each other.\n  We have a committee process where every bill that is introduced has a \npublic hearing. Any person can walk into the hearing room and come \nforward and testify before a legislative committee in the State of \nNebraska. Senators then have the opportunity to ask questions to be \nable to gain more information, not just from people who are invited to \ncome and sit on a panel before a legislative hearing but from citizens \nwho step forward and are willing to take that time away from their \njobs, their families. Some may have to travel a great distance since we \nare a very big State in order to get to the capital to be at a hearing \nand express their views. I believe in most cases--at least in my \nexperience--every individual who would come before a legislative \nhearing in the State of Nebraska was treated with respect, whether they \nagreed with a majority of the members on the committee or they had a \ndisagreement.\n  It is a respect for those views that are different from your own that \nI believe is so very valuable as a legislator, to be able to hear, to \nbe able to question.\n  That is why it truly saddens me that we are seeing a rules change \nhere in the Senate, where I believe the views of the minority will no \nlonger be considered.\n  It has been my experience here so far that I have been able to have \nmeetings with nominees, nominees who are coming before the committees \nthat I sit on to be confirmed. They come to my office. I am able to ask \nthem questions. I am able to express to them the concerns I have heard \nfrom the people in my State and hopefully get answers from them. It \ndoes give us an opportunity to establish a relationship where we are \ngoing to be able to work together in the future but, more importantly, \nit gives me the opportunity, as the Senator from Nebraska who happens \nto be in the minority, to have that chance to question the nominee for \nCommerce Secretary. With the rules change, now that requires 51 votes, \nand even as a committee member, those nominees do not even have to come \nand introduce themselves to me.\n  That is not fair. It is not fair to the people of my State because \nevery State citizen needs to be represented here in the Senate. That is \nwhat is so very--or what used to be so very special about this body.\n  You look through history--I know Senator Johanns is a great student \nof history--you look through history and you read about the debates \nthat happened on the Senate floor. I remember\n\n[[Page S8714]]\n\nearlier this year when we were all in the Old Senate Chamber and we got \nto experience that feeling of being open and honest with our \ncolleagues, without the cameras going, and truly being able to air some \ngrievances. I thought that was helpful. It was a very moving experience \nfor me as a new Senator to be there. But I think perhaps the Senator \nwould agree with me that we have lost that spirit of the Old Senate \nChamber and of the Senate Chamber in which we are standing.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I remember that night well. It occurred \njust some months ago. The nuclear option was being threatened. Many had \nworked very hard to avoid that.\n  Keep in mind that the nuclear option was not just discovered this \nyear or last year; Senators have known of the nuclear option for a long \ntime. We have been down this road before when Republicans were in the \nmajority. Fortunately and wisely, they backed off. A group of I think \n14 Senators got together and said: You know, we have to figure out a \nway to deal with this. And they did. They got a lot of criticism. I \nremember that. I remember the criticism was that they caved in, they \ngave in, they compromised, and that they should not have compromised \nand all of the things that you hear. But at the end of the day, \nleadership backed off of doing exactly what happened here right before \nThanksgiving.\n  Well, that night we went into the Old Senate Chamber. Anybody who has \never visited that room, you walk in and you feel the history of that \nplace immediately. Some of the great Senators in our Nation's history \nhave spent time in that room arguing for the great causes of the day. \nIt is a remarkable place. The doors were closed. There was no staff in \nthe room. There was no media in the room. There were no cameras \nrecording everything we were saying. This was a meeting of the Senators \nwho were there to try to figure out whether there was a way forward.\n  I will not talk about the specifics of who said what to whom on this, \nthat, and the other, but I will tell you about the atmosphere. I felt \nthe atmosphere was extremely tense and uncomfortable, especially at the \nstart of the meeting. We were really hopelessly divided on the issues \nwe were facing. But the conversation began. People started making \npoints on all sides of these issues.\n  In the context of that meeting and some things that had happened \npreviously, a picture started to come together. The picture was that we \nhad agreed as Senators--most of us, not all of us; some had \ndisagreement with what we were doing--that there were certain executive \nbranch appointees that, if there was no objection from any Senator, \ncould move forward through the process really unimpeded. If a single \nSenator had an objection and said: Wait a second, I have had a dealing \nwith this person, or whatever, that is very problematic, well then they \nhave to go through the whole process. But we set aside hundreds of \nexecutive branch appointees. We said: Look, there is no good reason to \nforce them through this process when there is no objection. Democrats, \nRepublicans, and Independents shook hands on that, and that became the \nway we operate today.\n  Another piece of the context was that there was discussion about some \nthings we could do with the rules. At this very lengthy night meeting, \nlike gentlemen and gentlewomen, we shook hands and we had a way \nforward. It took a while to develop it. It took a while after the \nmeeting to flesh it out. There was give-and-take. Some were concerned \nthat it did not embody what we agreed upon. I personally thought we \ngave too much on our side, but at the end of the day I thought it made \nsense as a way forward to avoid the nuclear option. We reached an \nagreement. As I said, we shook hands. That put the issue to bed.\n  As I would talk to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, we \nwould say to each other: You know, that was a good meeting. It has only \nhappened twice since I have been here--once on the START treaty and \nonce on this. We congratulated each other for finding that way forward.\n  But then we started to hear just a couple of weeks ago that the \nagreement was not holding, not because either side had violated it but \nbecause all of a sudden the majority, led by Senator Reid, decided they \nwanted to revisit this whole issue. I felt we had put the nuclear \noption in a lockbox, locked it up, and thrown away the key. I felt we \nhad come to an agreement as a Senate that the damage to our Nation and \nits citizens in employing the nuclear option was too great a price to \npay. That is what I came out of that meeting believing. That is what I \ncontinued to believe as I talked to my colleagues on the Democratic \nside of the aisle.\n  So what happened? If the agreement was not violated, if people were \nliving by the agreement and a whole host of nominees had gone through \nthe process, some of whom I did not like a bit but they got the votes \nnecessary--they were confirmed, they had gone through the process. So \nwhat was different about a couple of weeks ago versus when we walked \nout of that meeting that evening? Well, I would ask my colleague's \nthought on that, but I think I know what that was about. I am going to \ncontinue to talk about this in the days ahead as we talk about this \nnuclear option and what it is doing to our country.\n  What happened is this: ObamaCare started to roll out. I remember the \nday ObamaCare passed. As I said last night, I was sitting in a chair \nright in front of Senator Fischer. It was my first couple of years here \nin the Senate. What happened before Thanksgiving in the breaking of the \nrules to change the rules reminded me exactly of what happened with \nObamaCare. The Democrats had the votes. It was a very unusual time in \nour Nation's history. They had 60 Senators and they had the majority in \nthe House and they had the Presidency. Under the rules, they could stop \ndebate and pass anything they wanted to pass. That Christmas Eve day, I \nremember feeling, as a member of the minority, I was told to sit down \nand shut up because my viewpoint on ObamaCare meant nothing. What \nmattered that day was raw, sheer political power. They had the 60 \nvotes. I sat there during the rollcall vote. I heard every Democrat \nvote for one of the worst pieces of policy ever passed by this body. I \nfelt that day as though I was told to sit down and shut up.\n  Then a couple of weeks ago, when ObamaCare was literally melting down \nbefore our eyes, people were being thrown off their insurance plan, \nthey were beginning to realize what the cost of this was going to be, \nand they were beginning to realize that the promise that ``if you like \nyour plan, you can keep your plan, period'' was a political gimmick. It \nwas a lie. They were being thrown off their plans, and they could not \neven get on the Web site. All of a sudden, our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle began to realize their jobs were at stake. Their \nnumbers were crashing. All of a sudden, after we shook hands like \ngentlemen and gentlewomen after a very tense meeting and we implemented \nwhat people agreed would be implemented, we came back to revisit the \nnuclear option.\n  I would like to offer one additional thought about what this means. \nThe rules of the Senate have been changed on occasion. It is not \nsomething we do very often around here, but on occasion they have been \nchanged. The rules contemplate a way to change the rules: Two-thirds of \nthe Senators have to agree to the rules change.\n  How did this come about? Let me explain that. The majority leader \nasked for a ruling of the Chair. Basically, the ruling got to the \nquestion of how many votes it takes to confirm somebody. That ruling \nwas properly decided. The majority leader announced: I want to appeal \nthat ruling.\n  That ruling was, in fact, appealed. How does one successfully appeal \na ruling of the Chair with the majority vote, and that is exactly what \nhappened. The Democrats fell in line, and I had the same feeling that \nday before Thanksgiving that I had on that Christmas Eve Day when \nObamaCare was passed. The feeling I had, as a Member of the minority, \nwas that every single Member sitting in those chairs, the majority, the \nDemocrats, were saying to my colleagues and me: Sit down and shut up.\n  I said last night that I have a tremendous amount of respect for a \nman who served here for many years with great distinction, admired by \neverybody. I got to know him a little bit as he had not passed when I \ncame to the Senate. Senator Robert Byrd was probably the finest \nhistorian of the Senate,\n\n[[Page S8715]]\n\nmaybe ever. He would come to the floor and talk about the beautiful \nhistory of the Senate, this institution, and the sacred rights of every \nsingle Senator to come to the floor, argue, make their point, and offer \nan amendment.\n  Under the rules, the amendment doesn't even have to be germane to get \na vote on it.\n  This beautiful institution worked for over 200 years under that rule, \nunder that philosophy. Unbelievable.\n  It worked through wars, it worked through the 1918 flu pandemic. It \nworked through attacks on our Nation, 9/11, and Pearl Harbor.\n  Somehow, some way, great men and women came into this Chamber and \nfigured out a way to make this body work until 2 weeks ago, when by \nsheer political force the majority pulled out of Pandora's box the \nnuclear option.\n  I ask my colleague from Nebraska to offer her thoughts as a new \nMember. I look forward, as the senior Senator from Nebraska, to \nwatching the junior Senator from Nebraska.\n  I am not running again. What impact is this going to have? How does \nthe Senator implement the desires, wishes, and dreams of Nebraskans who \nelected the Senator and sent her to Washington under circumstances such \nas this?\n  Does the Senator worry that what is going to happen will not just \nstop; that it will be Supreme Court appointments at some point and it \nwill be legislative activity. I wish to hear those thoughts.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. In watching the Senate before I arrived and in studying \nthe Senate throughout history, the beauty of this body has been the \nindividual rights of every single Senator.\n  With the change we have seen, I believe those rights are diminished, \nwhich translates into the people who live in States that are \nrepresented by the minority will not be heard in this body.\n  I have been surprised, I have been shocked, and I have been hurt by \ncomments from the majority, where I am referred to as an \nobstructionist, where my colleagues on this side of the aisle are \nreferred to as extremists, anarchists.\n  I don't even know how to respond to the question of the Senator \nbecause nothing could be further from the truth. How I view this body \nis as one that should have an agenda. We should have Members on the \nfloor participating in debates on bills following an agenda and taking \nvotes, but we don't see that.\n  Instead, we see the two of us and our friend and colleague, the \nPresiding Officer, speaking to an empty Chamber, speaking to the TV \ncameras. That is not the way the Senate is supposed to operate. We are \nsupposed to be doing the people's work.\n  I say to the Senator I don't know what we are obstructing, because as \na member of the Armed Services Committee, we passed the National \nDefense Authorization Act out of committee in May. We passed that out \nof committee in May. We could have taken it up in June. We could have \ntaken it up in July, September, and October. Instead, we seem to be in \nthis crisis management mode in one of the greatest bodies in the world. \nThat makes no sense.\n  I am ready to do the work, but until these bills appear on the \nagenda, how do we do the work? Why do we wait until we have a few days \nleft in the year to take on what I believe is our most sacred \nresponsibility, the defense of this country, our national security, our \nmilitary men and women, our veterans.\n  The committee passed out a great bill in a bipartisan vote. It has \npassed in the Senate for the past 50 or 51 years. Yet we are against a \ntime limit that was manufactured.\n  As I said, the bill came out in May. Why wasn't it on the agenda? Why \ncan't we have amendments to it--very important amendments.\n  I happen to have a good amendment with Senator Claire McCaskill, a \nDemocrat from Missouri, and Senator Kelly Ayotte, a Republican from New \nHampshire, that we believe makes the provisions in our committee bill \ndealing with sexual assault even better, even stronger, that will \nprotect victims. We are not allowed to have that amendment.\n  Again, that is a foreign concept to me, as a Senator, not being \nallowed to have an amendment on a bill that should have been brought up \non the floor months ago so we could have had a debate on this truly No. \n1 priority of our country. Instead we have crisis management.\n\n  I don't know about the Senator from Nebraska, but I don't respond \nwell to crisis management. I like to have time to make wise decisions, \nto have major discussions, to gather information, to represent our \nconstituents, to represent the American people.\n  The American people demand more. They demand us to be better. I can't \neven imagine what folks think when they know we are speaking to an \nempty Chamber, when we should be talking about the big issues of the \nday, when we should be talking about the National Defense Authorization \nAct, when we should be talking about sexual assault in the military, \nwhen we should be talking about how are we going to make sure our \nmilitary men and women have the resources they need to keep them safe \nso they can return to their families and return to their families \nwhole.\n  We should be talking about Iran. We should be talking about Benghazi, \nbut we are not because we are not allowed to have that legislation \nbefore us.\n  As a new Senator, I can tell the Senator I am very frustrated. I know \nwhen the Senator is back in the State he hears, as I do, that the \npeople of Nebraska are frustrated as well. I believe they reflect the \nviews of the people of this country. They expect more from us. They \nexpect us to be better. They expect us to do our job.\n  How can we do our job when we are not allowed to vote on legislation \nthat addresses the truly pressing issues of our day?\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, yes, I am \nfrustrated. I am upset. I am angry that I am not able to represent the \npeople of my State by taking a vote, by taking a vote on amendments \nthat all Senators feel are important as well. It is not only \nRepublicans offering amendments that don't get heard, it is Democrats \nas well.\n  I would imagine the Presiding Officer is very frustrated. This has to \nchange. I don't know how long it has been going on, but we can change \nthis. We can change this by having an agenda that works, an agenda that \nbrings bills up by a leader who is going to have an open amendment \nprocess.\n  Instead of us coming to the floor and addressing a camera, we need to \nbe able to debate each other and have our voices heard because we are \nrepresenting those voices back home. They expect that.\n  We need to do this. Maybe I am naive, but I think we can do it. I \nthink we can still come together and be able to work together. \nSometimes we hear the terms ``obstructionist,'' ``extremist,'' and \n``anarchist.'' Enough of that.\n  It is not only Republicans who are demanding their rights and who are \nexercising their rights. I know we have Democratic colleagues who have \nput holds on nominations. They are not obstructionist. They are not \nextremist. They are exercising their rights as Members of the Senate. \nThey are exercising their rights to have questions from their \nconstituents answered.\n  I will defend their rights to put holds on nominations until they get \nthose questions answered.\n  We don't always hear about that though. We don't hear that it is all \nof us in the Senate who have that duty to make sure we can have our \nconstituents' concerns answered; so we can have a project in our State \nthat is being held up for one reason or another addressed; so we can \nbring forward a question--from our Governor or our State or our State \nlegislature--that an agency has not addressed in a timely manner, and \nwhere we as Senators can push a little harder to get an answer from a \nnominee or an agency. That is checks and balances. That is a balanced \ngovernment. That is transparency. That is accountability.\n  It is not allowing the executive branch to get everything they want. \nNone of us gets everything we want.\n  Senator Johanns made the comment that as Governor it is give and \ntake. As a State senator I can tell you I had to compromise on bills \nthat I thought were great the way I had them drafted, but you need to \ncompromise with your colleagues, with the Governor, and with the \nPresident, in order to truly represent all the people in this country.\n  I am sorry to say this country is polarized. This country is \npolarized and\n\n[[Page S8716]]\n\nthe Senate is polarized. If we could show some leadership here--if we \ncan take on these hard issues, make tough decisions, and make hard \nchoices--then we would be good examples to our country and we would \nhave a brighter future. We need to show some leadership. We were \nelected to make these hard choices for the American people so that we \ncan go forward.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor so that my colleague has \ntime to address issues before us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I thank my colleague for being with me for this \ncolloquy. I appreciate so much the legislative experience Senator \nFischer brings to this body. It is very extensive. She was regarded as \nthe leader in the Nebraska unicameral and chaired an extremely \nimportant committee. She would be too modest to point this out, but at \nthe time when our road system needed funding, she figured out a way not \nonly to identify funding--and not by raising taxes but by better \nefficiency and better management, and it was a significant amount of \nfunding--but she then built the coalitions necessary to actually get \nthat passed. Back home, today, that is getting rave reviews. So I thank \nher for that because I drive on those roads and I know she does too.\n  My colleague mentioned the Defense bill, and nothing could be a \nbetter example of what we are dealing with here. This bill came out of \nthe Armed Services Committee, which has a reputation for being one of \nthe most bipartisan committees in the whole Senate system. It is not \nabout Republicans and Democrats on that committee, for a whole host of \nreasons. One is there is just great leadership on that committee, and \nthere has been great leadership in the past, but the focus is on the \nnational defense of our United States and our allies.\n  For 50-some years we have passed a Defense authorization bill. It is \none of the things, even when nothing else could get done, that we would \nget done. The hallmark of that is that it is a very open process. The \nbill comes out of committee--this one came out in May--and the \namendment process starts, and we might go days working our way through \nthat bill. It is very normal. It is very much a part of the process. At \nthe end of it, typically that bill is passed with very strong \nbipartisan support.\n  What has happened that we would get a bill in May that has bipartisan \nsupport in this committee, it comes out of the committee ready for \nfloor action, and we can't get to that bill except right before the \nholidays? We all know who controls the floor. Democrats control the \nfloor. They are in the majority. The majority leader, through the \nelection by Democrats, controls the floor. So it feels to me as though \nwe are saying to our United States military: You are not important \nenough that we would give you 2 or 3 weeks in June or July, September \nor October to work through this huge package of spending. In fact, we \nare going to relegate you to the last hours before the Christmas break. \nThen the majority leader is going to say to those of us in the \nminority: By the way, I will pick your amendments. I think some of \nthese amendments are pretty tough amendments for my people to vote on, \nso I will pick the amendments.\n  So what has happened to the right of every individual Senator to come \nto the floor of the Senate and offer their idea on a piece of \nlegislation or, for that matter, any other important issue facing our \nUnited States?\n  This is like sending a message to the military from the Democrat \nmajority that says: Look, you are important enough to get a few hours \nbefore we break, and we all go back and enjoy a big ham dinner for \nChristmas, and we open our presents while you are off fighting in \nAfghanistan or wherever you have been ordered to serve.\n  I don't think that is right. There isn't any reason why this bill \ncan't get done. It has been done for 50-some years. What is so tough \nabout it? There isn't any reason why this bill can't get called up in \nthe summer. There isn't any reason why we can't deal with this bill in \nJune. It came out of committee in May. There isn't any reason why we \ncan't use these months leading up to now--the end of the year--to pass \nthis bill.\n  There are few guarantees in the Senate these days, but one guarantee \nI can make is that if you allow this Defense authorization bill to go \nthrough the regular process, allow Senators to offer their amendments, \ncome to the floor, debate their amendments, and pass or not pass those \namendments, at the end of the day that bill will pass.\n  Instead, what has happened is the bill is put on the floor right \nbefore a holiday break and the majority leader says: I will decide \nwhose amendments are going to get heard. I will be the one picking the \namendments, and we have to get this done. If you don't agree with the \nway I want to do things around here, then you are an obstructionist, \nyou are an anarchist.\n  Wait a second. I should have a say about that bill. It authorizes \nbillions and billions of dollars. I should be able to go home to \nNebraskans and say that I gave my best effort with an amendment that I \nsupported or sponsored or whatever, and at the end of the day I won or \nI lost. After all, that is what they elected me to do.\n  It is not just what happened with the nuclear option, it is the way \nthis Senate is being operated by those who are in the majority--\nDemocrats. Never in the history of this institution has a leader filled \nthe amendment tree, which is a fancy Washington way of saying I'm \ntaking away the amendments from the minority, more times far and away \nthan any other majority leader. When he does that, when he takes away \nthe right to amend, he silences the minority because we don't control \nwhat comes to the floor. We are not in the majority. We don't control \nwhen a bill is going to be heard. We are not in the majority. So the \nonly thing we can do as a minority is offer an amendment and plead our \ncase.\n  Senator Fischer mentioned a perfect example of the point I am trying \nto make. She says that she and others, on a bipartisan basis, have an \namendment on sexual assaults, which we know is a very serious problem. \nNow, some might find this surprising, but I want her amendment to go \nfurther. I don't think it goes far enough. I don't think she would mind \nme saying that. I signed on to an amendment offered by Senator \nGillibrand. I was one of the early ones to sign on. It is a bipartisan \namendment, and it has over 50 cosponsors. That is the amendment I want.\n  I think this is an important issue. I see these young men and women \ncome to my office, and they are proud as proud can be. They have just \nsigned up or they want to go to the military academy, and it breaks my \nheart to think they may be subjected to sexual assault in the military. \nI believe we can't be tough enough. I believe we can't work hard enough \nto create an atmosphere that is so inhospitable to the sexual offender \nthat they would never think of being in the military. I want to go as \nfar as we can and I want to argue that point. I believe there will be \nNebraskans that will agree with me and perhaps disagree with me. Why \nshouldn't we have that bill on the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All postcloture time has expired.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Elizabeth A.

Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleagues, in the \nChristmas spirit, despite these contentious times, for letting this \nbill move forward. Let me just briefly explain.\n  On Christmas Eve, 2012, nearly one year ago today, the 125-member \nWest Webster Volunteer Fire Association--a volunteer fire department \noutside of Rochester--faced an unimaginable tragedy when four of their \nbrave members were wounded, two fatally, when they responded to a fire \nbut in instead faced an ambush of unspeakable proportions.\n  While many of our families across our Nation were waking up last \nChristmas Eve morning preparing Christmas dinner, shopping, wrapping \npresents or picking up family from the airport, four families in \nWebster, NY, were instead confronting a heart-wrenching tragedy.\n  The call of a house on fire came in to the West Webster Fire \nDepartment at 5:30 a.m. that morning, December 24. It was a cold, snowy \nmorning, still dark, but the everyday heroes from the West Webster Fire \nDepartment courageously did what they volunteered to do on behalf of \ntheir neighbors and on behalf of their hometowns. They left their homes \nand their families to put out a fire.\n  Instead, this routine call turned into a tragedy which shocked this \ncommunity and people throughout the country and even the world. What \nthey didn't know was that the fire was intentionally set by the home's \nowner in order to lure these innocent firefighters into a senseless \nsniper ambush. The sniper was hiding behind a berm amid the chaos of \nthe fire and began shooting at the responding firefighters.\n  The firefighters were confused at first to hear popping sounds; they \nthought it might be the fire, but Lieutenant Mike Chiapperini, who was \nalso a Webster police officer, knew better and shouted to his fellow \nvolunteers to take cover, but it was too late.\n\n[[Page S8718]]\n\n  Firefighter Hofstetter was shot in the pelvis while trying to alert \ndispatchers on the radio to the situation.\n  Ted Scardino was shot in the shoulder, and 5 minutes later shot in \nthe leg. A 16-year volunteer lay there bleeding for an hour, enduring \nthe December cold while sustaining second-degree burns on his head.\n  Lieutenant Chiapperini and firefighter Kaczowka both died in the \nambush.\n  As news of this horrific senseless Christmas Eve tragedy spread, well \nmeaning people from Rochester, New York State, the Nation, and the \nworld reached out to the West Webster Fire Association to offer their \nsupport and prayers.\n  Not realizing that collecting and distributing the funds to the \nfamily would jeopardize the association's tax exempt status with the \nIRS, the association accepted donations from generous people all around \nthe Nation wanting to help the poor families who suffered so on that \nday. They collected these donations for the victims and their families. \nThey wanted to give these donations to the victims and their families. \nIt defies reason that they would be unable to do so because of a \ntechnicality in the Tax Code.\n  Just as we did after 9/11 and again after a similar fire department \ntragedy in California, it is our obligation to make sure the West \nWebster Volunteer Firemen's Association can now distribute to these \nfamilies the contributions their neighbors and unknown countless \ngenerous others wanted them to have. With the passage of this \nlegislation, that will happen.\n  I thank my colleagues, particularly on the other side of the aisle. I \nknow these are contentious times, and this was done truly in the \nChristmas spirit, and I thank them.\n\n\n                          Wolford Confirmation\n\n  One more brief moment. We just confirmed to the U.S. district court \nthe first woman to serve on the Federal bench in the Western District \nof New York, Elizabeth Wolford. She is going to be a great judge. Ms. \nWolford is right out of central casting for the role of a Federal \njudge. Not only will the legal community of Western New York be well \nserved by her ascension on the bench, the entire community will benefit \nfrom her leadership, wisdom, and judgment.\n  It is an honor to have nominated and to now confirm Elizabeth \nWolford, the first woman to represent the Western District of New York, \na very distinguished bench.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I wish to speak about where we are right \nnow. We are moving toward confirming a number of individuals with the \nmajority deciding that the majority could do that by themselves. \nApparently, they had the right to change the rules, which I guess means \nthere really are no rules and the majority can change the rules any day \nthey want.\n  What we are seeing now with the health care implementation is what \nhappens, frankly, when one side decides they don't want to make any \neffort necessary to get even one other person from the other side to \nagree with them on moving forward with something as big as the health \ncare legislation. That should have been an example to us, but \napparently the example was the example that they, the majority, can do \nwhatever the majority wants to do.\n  Let me share for a few minutes some of the things I am hearing in our \noffice from people who are contacting us to tell us the problems they \nare having that they didn't anticipate.\n  This is a letter from Pam from Chesterfield, MO. She says: My husband \nand I have always played by the rules and carried insurance. I had no \nidea we were going to have to change plans and go to the exchange, but \nour provider apparently doesn't want to have individual plans any \nlonger because it is too costly to figure out the complexities that \nwould apply to individual plans.\n  Then Pam says: At least for now, my husband and I are not getting \nhealth insurance, and I guess we have to hope for the best. What a \nmess, she says. So much for playing by the rules. I never expected the \ntwo of us to be uninsured. But, now, she thinks that is what is likely \nto happen.\n  Jennifer, a college student from St. Louis said that she initially \nsupported the Affordable Care Act. She worked part-time at a Home Goods \nstore where she had what she thought were great health benefits--or at \nleast the health benefits she wanted--and where she could work as many \nhours as she wanted. But, she says, because of the health care plan, \nher employer reduced the maximum number of hours she could work to 24 \nhours.\n  So, she says:\n\n       My name is Jennifer, a hard-working student from St. Louis, \n     MO, and I would like to share my emerging problems. At first \n     I was supportive of the Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Health Care Act. Insurance for everyone--that sounds so \n     appealing, but now that it has affected my life in a negative \n     way, I am not so sure I can be supportive anymore. I have \n     worked for my employer for almost 3 years while going to \n     school. It has been an excellent place to work until now, and \n     now not only do I not have the health care benefits I had \n     before, but I am not able to work as much as I was able to \n     work before.\n\n  Carla and her husband are farmers from Oreck, MO. They farm full-\ntime; neither of them is employed off the farm. They have two sons, one \njust graduated from college and just went to work; another is a junior \nin college. They have one full-time employee on the farm. Her family \nprovides their own insurance. In order for them to have insurance they \nhave had a health savings account through Humana. Their deductible is \n$10,000, and they still pay a little over $500 a month or $6,057 a year \nfor their family insurance. But she tells me beginning January 1, 2014, \ntheir deductible goes to $12,600. Their premium goes to $11,422, an 89-\npercent increase in a family that provides their own insurance. By the \nway, they provide insurance with dollars they earned and they pay taxes \non, so we can add another premium to that and find out how this family, \nthat has done all they could to have insurance for their family, now \nhas an 89-percent increase in their insurance and a deductible they \nhope they never use. But if they do, it is a big problem if they use \nthat deductible. The deductible is going to be over $12,000.\n  If a family is paying $11,000 for premiums and then they develop \nhealth care needs, they pay another $12,000 before their insurance \nhelps them, that is $23,000 a year before their insurance benefits them \nin any way for a family that had insurance coverage that, until right \nnow, they thought was working for them while doing all they could to \nhave it.\n  Catherine from Springfield, MO, says a few weeks ago she was informed \nshe was going to lose her health coverage because of the President's \nhealth care plan. She has been concerned that she might not be able to \nsign up because the Web site wasn't working. Whether the insurance \ncosts more or not wasn't as big of a concern to her as having \ninsurance. She says: The nightmare that is ObamaCare is going to affect \nus in a major way, and the stress of what is coming is affecting many \npeople. Not only are we losing health insurance plans we liked, and \npossibly the doctors we trust, but the new coverage is not as good and \nit costs us more. This is--to paraphrase the Vice President, ``a big \ndeal'', she says.\n  Ken writes:\n\n       Dear Senator Blunt. I am writing to inform you of my recent \n     experience with health insurance and the ACA. My wife and I \n     make a decent income but are far from wealthy. On September \n     30 I received a notice that due to the ACA, my employer-\n     sponsored health insurance plan would no longer be available. \n     Yesterday--after worrying about this since September 30, \n     apparently--yesterday, he continues--I discovered that my \n     employer was able to renegotiate an early renewal and our \n     monthly premium will only increase by 12.5 percent. However--\n     by the way, 12.5 percent is a pretty good increase by my \n     books except the ones that compare what is happening right \n     now. However,\n\nhe continues,\n\n     I have been made aware that next year my plan premiums will \n     increase by a minimum of 39 percent.\n\n  So it increased 12.5 percent this year, and they have already \nnotified this family that their increase will be a minimum of 39 \npercent next year, and his deductible, according to him, will double. \nSo reading his letter further, he says: So I guess I will not be able \nto keep my insurance and my costs will not decrease as the President \nsaid they would.\n  Carol from Republic, MO, says her monthly premiums have gone from \n$600\n\n[[Page S8719]]\n\nto $800, and the part-time jobs she and her husband both had at the \nlocal community college have actually gone down because they are not \nable to teach as much as they were able to teach before, because the \ncommunity college has decided they can't let any of their part-time \nfaculty work more than 30 hours. So their income went down, their \nexpenses went up, in both cases because of the President's decisions on \nhealth care and the legislative decisions on health care in both cases. \nWe know this has impacted the workplace, part-time workers, people \nholding their workforce down so they wouldn't be covered, holding their \nworker hours down so they wouldn't have to pay the penalty if they \ndidn't offer insurance or offer the insurance for the first time at \nlevels they hadn't had before.\n  Now we are also seeing--not only did the hours of work go down, but \nthe cost of health insurance goes up. Surely, we can come up with a \nbetter plan than that.\n  Christian from St. Peter's, MO, just learned that his wife's employer \nwill start excluding him from their family coverage and that he now has \nto receive insurance in some different way. It looks like he is going \nto be able to do that with his employer for $1,300 more per year. This \nis actually the best story I have told so far--only $1,300 that this \nfamily used to have to spend for something else, and they are now \nspending for health care. He says: I am not sure who ObamaCare \nbenefits, but it sure isn't my family.\n  These stories are just examples of some of the things we are hearing.\n  Last weekend I noticed that one of the architects of the President's \nhealth care bill, Dr. Zeke Emanuel, on Fox News to Chris Wallace, said \nthat what the President really should have said--and this is his exact \nquote: ``If you want to pay more for your insurance company that covers \nyour doctor, you can do that.''\n  I don't know what he is looking at, and some may be able to find \ntheir doctor for more money, but in our State some of the health care \nproviders aren't on the exchange.\n  I read the other day that more than half of the hospitals in New \nHampshire aren't on the exchange. So if your doctor happened to work \nfor more than half of the hospitals in New Hampshire, there is no \namount of money you can pay on the exchange and keep your doctor, \nbecause your doctor is no longer available through the way that you are \ntold by the health care act that you can get insurance as an \nindividual.\n  The President promised that. He said: My plan begins by covering \nevery American. If you already like your health insurance, the only \nthing that will change for you under this part is the amount of money \nyou will spend on premiums, and that will be less.\n  I think we are going to quickly see not only are people losing \ninsurance, but for most people the premiums are not going to be less \nand the deductibles are going to be higher, not lower.\n  This is going to be a story that is going to affect American families \nas nothing the Federal Government has done in a long time, and maybe \nnothing the Federal Government has done ever.\n  If you truly want to impact the lives of families, impact their \nhealth care. Somebody told me one time: When everybody in your family \nis well, you have lots of problems. When somebody in your family is \nsick, you have one problem.\n  We are dealing with the one focusing problem for American families: \ntheir access to health care that they can afford with decisions they \nlike.\n  I yield back.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/11/senate-section/article/S8719-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8719-S8723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n                                 prayer\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to the order of February 29, 1960, \nthe hour of 12 noon having arrived, the Senate having been in \ncontinuous session since yesterday, the Senate will suspend for a \nprayer by the Senate Chaplain.\n  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:\n  Let us pray.\n  Eternal God, who gives us so much more than we deserve, when the days \nare dreary and the long nights weary, we are still indebted to You for \nYour generous mercies. May Your blessings provide our lawmakers with \nthe willingness to see and do Your will. Living by the principles of \nYour sacred revelation, may they do nothing to cause them shame. Give \nthem respect for diverse viewpoints, open their hearts to Your love, \ntheir minds to Your truth, and their wills to Your service.\n  We pray in Your gracious Name. Amen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to continue the discourse my \nesteemed colleague, the good Senator from Missouri, was engaged in on \nthe Senate floor just a minute ago, talking about the importance--the \nimportance--of bipartisanship as we work to craft policy for this \ncountry, policy that all Americans can support and policy that truly \nmoves our country forward.\n  So whether we are considering nominations or whether we are \nconsidering legislation, we need to find ways to come together and come \nup with solutions that the American people support across the board in \na bipartisan way. So as we consider these nominations, we have to \nconsider the fact that now the Senate will be approving these \nnominations with essentially a 1-party vote, 51 votes.\n  Right now, the Democratic Party has the majority in the Senate, so \nthey can put judges on the bench, confirm other nominations without any \nRepublican support whatsoever. Of course, under that approach, at some \npoint the reverse may very well be true, that nominees may be \nconfirmed--whether it is judicial nominees or other types of \nappointments--with only Republican votes if the Republicans are in the \nmajority without any Democratic votes. Why does that matter?\n  Why it matters is because, again, I go back to my earlier statement \nthat in crafting policy, crafting laws and making appointments, \nnominations to the bench, we need to do it in a way where we garner \nbroad support across the country.\n  More than 300 million people's lives are affected dramatically by all \nof these things, by who those appointees are, the offices they hold, \nwhat they do with the laws we pass. So if we are going to impact \neverybody in the Nation with these laws, with these appointments, we \nhave to make sure there is input, consideration by and, if you will, \nfrom both sides of the aisle.\n  That is how we get the kinds of policies and we get the kinds of \nnominees and we get the kinds of judges and Justices that truly will \nhave the support of people across this great country. I believe that is \nwhat we need to truly build the kind of future we want for ourselves \nand for our prosperity.\n  As we talk about nominees, we consider also implementation of the \nAffordable Care Act. This is a huge topic of discussion in our country \nright now, and it is going to continue to be a huge topic of \ndiscussion. You are talking about one-fifth to one-sixth of our economy \nengaged in health care. So this is something that touches every single \nAmerican in their daily life in a big way. It is so important we get it \nright.\n  As was the case with my esteemed colleague from the State of \nMissouri, he was presenting anecdotes, presenting stories, real \nstories, real-life stories, of people who are impacted by the \nAffordable Care Act and how they are impacted. It is very important we \ndo that because we need to know how people's lives are affected by the \nAffordable Care Act and what we can do to make sure they have the best \nhealth care possible.\n  By the way, I think of hopefully building bipartisan support to get \nthe kind of health care reform we truly need. I am going to present \nsome of these real-life cases, as my colleague from Missouri just did, \nand I am going to start with one that talks about the marriage penalty \ncreated by ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act. This is from someone in \nGrand Forks, ND, who writes in about the marriage penalty created by \nthe Affordable Care Act. This citizen writes:\n\n       My husband and I met with the primary health insurance \n     carrier in ND and were told that our current coverage, under \n     the guidelines of the Affordable Care Act, will cost us at \n     least another $400 more a month, and our deductible will \n     increase from $2,000.00 to $12,000.00, and because we are \n     married, we cannot choose individual plans, which would be a \n     much lower deductible. In essence, we are being punished for \n     being married. We are\n\n[[Page S8720]]\n\n     looking at paying more than $1500.00/month in health care, \n     because we are only 61 years old and not eligible for \n     Medicare for another 4 years--[that is] $18,000 a year for \n     health care!\n       We were told that part of the problem is the provisions in \n     the law require us to choose a plan that has maternity \n     benefits. How does this make sense for seniors to be forced \n     to buy coverage that does not apply to them? We agree that \n     benefits shouldn't be denied to people but it is not fair to \n     be forced to buy coverage that does not apply.\n\n  Well, let's delve a little deeper into exactly what this individual \nis writing about. What is the marriage penalty that is, in fact, \ncreated by ObamaCare? Let's talk about that.\n  The ObamaCare tax subsidies actually create a marriage penalty. They \ncreate a disincentive for individuals who are cohabiting to become \nlegally married. From the standpoint of marriage, the subsidies \nrepresent a hidden tax on marriage whereby married couples purchasing \ntheir coverage on the exchanges will be subsidizing similarly situated \nbut cohabiting single adults who earn the same or more income.\n  In 2011, the House Oversight and Reform Committee held a hearing on \nthe topic of ObamaCare's penalty against marriage. But since then \nlittle has been devoted to this topic in the House or the Senate.\n  So how does it work? It works through the requirement of household \nincome when calculating the ObamaCare tax subsidy.\n  For those persons not eligible for Medicare earning up to 400 percent \nof the Federal poverty level, the law entitles them to a tax subsidy in \nthe form of a refundable credit so long as they purchase their coverage \non the ObamaCare exchanges.\n  To calculate income, however, the law requires the reporting of \nhousehold income rather than individual income. Household income \nincludes the income of any family member residing in the household, \nsuch as a spouse, but not that of a cohabiting unmarried partner.\n  So when a person shops on the exchange's Web site for a plan, he or \nshe must first provide the financial information and identity of all \nfamily members in the household, even if none of those persons intend \nto purchase their insurance on the exchange because that information is \nrequired to calculate subsidy eligibility.\n  Subsidy eligibility is then calculated using a complicated formula \ninvolving household income in relation to the poverty line, family \nsize, and the price of plans offered through a State's marketplace.\n  The value of the subsidy awarded to an eligible person adjusts on a \nsliding scale in proportion to household income, up to 400 percent--up \nto 400 percent--of the Federal poverty level. Above 400 percent of the \nFederal poverty level, no tax credit. Right.\n  The marriage penalty results when a spouse's income causes an \notherwise eligible individual to no longer be eligible for the subsidy \nand could cost a married couple in their household in excess of $10,000 \na year in lost subsidies versus two individuals who are cohabiting but \nnot married.\n  So let's go through an example.\n  According to the Kaiser Family Foundation's health reform subsidy \ncalculator, a 62-year-old individual in a high-cost area who earns \n$46,000 a year, which is equivalent to 400 percent of the Federal \npoverty level, would be entitled to $7,836 in a government tax credit. \nHowever, if that same individual earns an additional $22 or $46,022 a \nyear--just over $46,000 a year--which is now 401 percent of the Federal \npoverty level, they lose the entire credit. They lose the entire $7,836 \ncredit.\n  Similarly, any married couple that earns more than $62,040--400 \npercent of the Federal poverty level for a family of two--earns too \nmuch to qualify for a subsidy. But that same couple if unmarried and \ncohabiting could earn up to $45,960 each--or $91,920 total--and they \nare still eligible for subsidies in a high-cost area such as New York \nState, for example.\n  So the limit for a married couple is just over $62,000. OK. So for a \nmarried couple, you can earn up to $62,040 before you lose the credit, \nbut it is almost $30,000 higher for two people living together who are \nnot married. They can earn $91,920 for an unmarried cohabiting couple. \nSo if you have two people living together, they each get the individual \nexemption, which is more than $45,000. So they can earn $91,000-plus \ntogether--they still get the credit--but for a married couple, just \nover $60,000. Mr. President, $62,000 is the limit. So you can earn \n$30,000 more if you are living together and still get the credit than \nyou can if you are married. That is the marriage penalty. So why would \nwe design a health care program that discourages or penalizes marriage?\n  Further, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the tax \nsubsidies are projected to be the biggest deficit-increasing component \nof ObamaCare, and CBO estimates they will add $100 billion to the \ndeficit by 2018 and grow even more thereafter. By 2019, CBO estimates \nthat about 19 million people will be receiving the subsidies to \npurchase their insurance through the exchanges.\n  As I say, I became aware of this problem when I was contacted by a \nNorth Dakota couple. I read that short vignette. We looked into it, and \nit is, in fact, true. This is just one of the many problems created by \nObamaCare, or the Affordable Care Act, which is why Republicans have \nsaid: Look. We need to replace this with a comprehensive, step-by-step, \nmarket-based approach that truly is focused on competition and choice, \nthat empowers individuals, empowers people across this great Nation to \nchoose their own health care insurance and their own health care plan.\n  We can absolutely do that. That is why I am here on the floor and \nothers are here on the floor continuing to talk about Americans and \ntheir everyday lives and the challenges they face because of ObamaCare.\n  I have more of these stories from North Dakotans, people in my State \nwho are facing real challenges because of ObamaCare.\n  So often we hear: Well, wait a minute, if we are not going to do the \nAffordable Care Act, if you do not like the Affordable Care Act, then \nwhat is your solution?\n  We continue to put solutions forward, solutions such as expanded \nhealth savings accounts, which, combined with high-deductible policies, \ncan create tremendous incentives for young people to purchase health \ncare; more competition across State lines, which can help give citizens \nmore choice and reduce costs; tort reform, which can help bring down \ncost; reforming Medicare to create the right incentives; giving States \nmore control over Medicaid. The list goes on. We will continue to \nadvocate for those types of solutions--real solutions that empower \nAmericans to choose their own health care insurance and their own \nhealth care providers.\n  Let me read some more letters from North Dakotans who talk about the \nchallenges they are facing because of ObamaCare, the Affordable Care \nAct.\n  This individual from Hankinson writes:\n\n       I am writing about the health care mess ObamaCare is \n     creating. I am a retired teacher running a daycare with my \n     wife. Hence, I am self-employed. I buy my own health care \n     through Medica. Under the new ObamaCare rules, my monthly \n     premium is going from $302 to over $500 per month.\n       I am 58 years old, not on any medications and have no \n     illnesses. Because of this forced health care, I am supposed \n     to pay a 60-percent increase in health care coverage. If I \n     drop my health care coverage, the government will hunt me \n     down and fine me. Please stop this ObamaCare boondoggle.\n\n  From Harvey, ND, a disgruntled grandpa who has to pay for maternity \ncare:\n\n       The Affordable Care Act is an excellent example of an \n     oxymoron. Since the Affordable Care Act was passed, my \n     insurance rate has escalated an additional $4,000 per year, \n     not the $2,500 reduction that President Obama speculated. I \n     have yet to find anyone whose health care costs have \n     declined. Oh, yes. I just received my cancellation notice \n     from Blue Cross Blue Shield. Thank you very much. I was happy \n     with my Blue Cross Blue Shield plan. I had a low deductible, \n     prescription and hospital coverage, everything that I needed.\n       Now, as a grandfather, I will be paying for maternity, \n     pediatric dentistry, contraception, drug, alcohol recovery, \n     et cetera. The government has bloated my policy with useless \n     fluff so my premiums will support others' subsidized \n     policies.\n       The President said, ``If you like your health care plan you \n     can keep it. Period.'' The truth is, if you can't afford \n     health insurance, you can afford ObamaCare if someone else \n     pays the premium for you. Also all of these years I have paid \n     taxes on things that I possess or purchase. Please explain \n     why I have to pay a tax if I choose not to purchase \n     ObamaCare.\n\n[[Page S8721]]\n\n  From Fargo, ND, a retired couple faced with canceling their own \nwellness center membership to pay for ObamaCare. This individual \nwrites:\n\n       Last week Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota sent my \n     wife and I a letter stating that the health insurance \n     coverage we carry is no longer acceptable or allowable under \n     the new health care law. It was a health insurance package \n     that we had selected after retiring from the field of \n     education 2 years ago. It was a great package for us since we \n     are both in good health. It offers us lower premiums, a \n     higher deductible, which, by the way, we wanted, and more \n     than adequate coverage for us.\n       Now, we have to look at other more expensive health care \n     packages which we do not want, some of which will include \n     wellness center coverage. Well, we go to a wellness center \n     here in Fargo, pay for it ourselves, and it costs us \n     considerably less than any of the new packages that include \n     it.\n       So if I have this right, the following needs to take place \n     for us. 1. We can no longer keep our present insurance that \n     we wanted to begin with. 2. We can, however, select another \n     package that will cost us, at the very least, an additional \n     $1,800 in premiums per year. Remember, this is being paid for \n     out of our retirement check. 3. The plans include a wellness \n     center option, which we currently have at our own expense at \n     a cost of $600 a year.\n       So based on the law's requirements, it will cost us another \n     $1,200 if we discount our current $600 wellness cost over and \n     above what we now pay. All of this for insurance we do not \n     want. There is an old saying from our neck of the woods: If \n     you want something screwed up, give it to the government. \n     Sorry, but this new law makes that old saying prophetic.\n\n  From Bottineau, ND, a couple faces cancer treatment and tripling \ncosts with ObamaCare. This individual writes:\n\n       Here is my story on ObamaCare. I have a Blue Cross Blue \n     Shield policy that I have had for many years.\n       In 2008 my wife was diagnosed with a very aggressive breast \n     cancer. We did all of the treatments, surgeries, et cetera. \n     The insurance paid all but the deductible and the \n     coinsurance, just as it was supposed to. We had no problems. \n     Our deductible has been $500, with an 80/20 copay up to an \n     out-of-pocket maximum of $5,000.\n       Now my wife's cancer has reoccurred and we are starting all \n     over. On the Affordable Care Act policy, to keep my premium \n     close to what we have had, our deductible will be $4,000 \n     each, and our out-of-pocket maximum will be $12,500 per year. \n     By the way, the premium will be over $1,200 per month, an \n     increase of over 140 percent. That is not affordable care.\n\n  So which policy is more substandard?\n  A retired couple from Fargo, ND, writes:\n\n       Upon visiting with my Blue Cross Blue Shield rep, he \n     informed me that our present affordable plans--we currently \n     have two single plans, one for each of us--will no longer \n     exist under the Affordable Care Act. We will have to switch \n     over to Blue Direct, which does not allow single plans, but \n     family plans only. This will then force us to pay $1,200 per \n     month, or $14,400 per year, compared to our present cost of \n     $6,000 per year.\n\n  Let me repeat that.\n\n       This will then force us to pay $1,200 a month or $14,400 \n     per year compared to our present cost of $6,000 per year. \n     What sense does that make? Why do I want to give up a plan \n     that is one I selected for us, and is very affordable, and \n     change it over for one that will cost us another $8,400 \n     per year? I can definitely see where this is headed. It \n     will send both my wife and I back to the workforce to be \n     able to pay for a health insurance policy that we do not \n     want.\n       So why can't I keep my health insurance policy that I \n     already have? I like it. I want to keep it. But Uncle Sam \n     says no. Why? I understand the need to take care of those who \n     do not have insurance and cannot get insurance for medical \n     reasons. But why take away from millions of us that do have \n     insurance and want to keep it?\n\n  You have seen that in the numbers, right? I believe Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius testified in front of the \nHouse either yesterday or the day before and indicated that there are \nsomething like 360-some-thousand signups for ObamaCare. But the \nstatistics are in the range of 4 to 5 million as far as the number of \npolicies that have been reported as canceled so far since ObamaCare \ncame into effect. These are the real stories behind those statistics. \nThese are the real-life stories of people who have been impacted behind \nthese statistics.\n  From Bismarck, ND, a young working family has seen their costs \nskyrocket.\n\n       Dear Senator Hoeven, I am a young pharmacist in Bismarck \n     who graduated from North Dakota State University in 2011. I \n     have the job I have always wanted, although it is with a \n     small pharmacy, so my employer cannot afford health insurance \n     for the seven employees who work there. So my family and I \n     went out and did the responsible thing: Qualified medically, \n     back when you had to, and bought what I thought was the \n     perfect health insurance plan.\n       For the whole family, it was this easy. High deductible. No \n     coverage except preventative, until we paid $2,500 per person \n     or $5,000 per family. My premium started out at an amazing \n     $666 a month in 2011, went up a few dollars in 2012, and \n     increased by 12 percent in 2013 to $762.30 a month. Still \n     quite affordable.\n       This year we had our third child, along with experiencing \n     some health issues with one of our other children. My wife \n     obviously met her $2,500 maximum and ended up needing surgery \n     and nearly died from complications, and spent a couple of \n     nights in the hospital. My insurance worked just like it was \n     meant to. That meant that $7,000 was paid 100 percent. As of \n     now, we have only paid $4,100 in out-of-pocket costs. I think \n     that is pretty darn good coverage for that premium.\n       My policy does not qualify for the new Affordable Care Act \n     regulations. So it will end at the end of April, according to \n     Blue Cross Blue Shield. Fine. Whatever. But what really \n     upsets me is that my current coverage, which assumes a lot of \n     responsibility on myself, falls into the ``gold'' category on \n     the ObamaCare exchange based on the maximum out-of-pocket \n     limits.\n       We are a young, generally healthy family. I do not need to \n     save nickels and dimes throughout the year to cover copays \n     and whatnot. I need a responsible limit that I know I am not \n     going to spend over. On the exchange, if I match my same \n     premium, then I end up with a maximum out-of-pocket limit of \n     $12,700--$12,700. How affordable is that?\n       If I want a plan similar to the plan I have now, then I \n     have to spend over $900 a month, or $150 a month more. That \n     is $2,000 per year more for coverage I do not like. This is \n     very frustrating. Please fix this mess.\n\n  From Kensal, ND, this is from a family who is unable to afford the \nrising premiums.\n\n       I just got an insurance letter that said my family's \n     monthly premium was going from $385 to $840 per month. I \n     cannot afford that and keep the heat on this winter. That \n     represents over half of my take-home pay. I am now thinking \n     that I will have to get divorced just to keep my health \n     insurance for my three children and my wife. Keep the \n     government shut down forever if this is how you want to treat \n     the hard-working class.\n\n  From Donnybrook, ND, self-employed family business owners see rising \ncosts. They write:\n\n       My husband and I farm and have three children, ages 4, 2, \n     and 7 months old. Because we are self-employed, we carry our \n     own health insurance. Last week we received notice that our \n     premium will be increasing by 43% due to the Affordable Care \n     Act. We will also be losing the freedom to cater our health \n     plan to meet our individual needs. We are very healthy non-\n     smokers, and our children have yet to see a physician for \n     anything more than a well-child check-up. Our health history \n     is spotless. Our previous premiums were anything but \n     ``cheap,'' making this 43% premium increase unbelievable [to \n     us, and unaffordable].\n\n  From Argusville, ND, self-employed face canceled policy. They state:\n\n       About a year ago, my husband left his job and started his \n     own computer software consulting company. Contrary to what we \n     have been led to believe, we were able to find affordable \n     insurance for our family. We have three children under 18. We \n     found a family policy for about $480/month. This past year \n     (2013), it was moderately increased to about $520/month, \n     which we thought was a reasonable increase. We were very \n     happy with the insurance.\n       However, today, I received a letter stating that due to the \n     new healthcare law, our insurance premium for the next year \n     would go up to $918.21.\n\n  They are going from $520 a month to $918.21 a month.\n  Continuing:\n\n       This means we are facing a $400/month increase in our \n     insurance premium. This amounts to a $4,800 tax increase for \n     our family. We are a middle income/small business-owning \n     family. This is an outrageous intrusion by the Federal \n     Government into an area that it had no business going. It WAS \n     possible for the self-employed to get their own insurance. \n     There WAS a safety net through state and Federal programs for \n     people who couldn't get insurance. The Affordable Care Act is \n     not affordable, and was not ever necessary.\n\n  What we are seeing is people in all different walks of life in \ndifferent situations, some working for themselves, some working for \nsmall businesses, some working for large companies, some retired, some \nwith kids, and some elderly, but what is the consistent theme? What is \nthe consistent theme? Higher costs, less choice, and not being able to \nget policies that fit their needs because of this standardization.\n  From Enderlin, ND, small business loses employee coverage. This \nconstituent writes:\n\n       My husband is a Veterinarian who has been in practice for \n     over 40 years. We have 5 employees for which we provide the \n     best health\n\n[[Page S8722]]\n\n     coverage that money can buy. We pay all their premiums. Last \n     week, we received a cancellation letter from the insurance \n     company. We believed President Obama when he said that \n     because we had insurance for our employees, and because we \n     have less than 50 employees, we could keep our insurance. At \n     no time did we receive information by letter or email or on \n     the Internet about the fact that if you changed anything in \n     your policy you would not be grandfathered in. We had one \n     person retire, hired a new employee, and an employee's \n     husband came onto the policy, changing the deductible, which \n     has meant that we have now lost our insurance. This will mean \n     a much larger premium! We work! We are not happy about this \n     situation. The President lied! This will mean no raises and \n     we will not be able to hire anyone.\n\n  Park River, ND, rising costs for the young invincibles.\n\n       Our family has had health insurance all of our adult lives. \n     My son, aged 28, also had his own health insurance with Blue \n     Cross Blue Shield of ND. He is single. His policy was \n     cancelled because of ObamaCare. His premiums are now tripled \n     and his deductible will be over $6,400.00. That is \n     unacceptable. No person can afford to pay a $6,400 \n     deductible. If he fell into the poverty level to be eligible \n     for the tax subsidy, then he could get better coverage for \n     less money under this law. That is also unacceptable. We all \n     have worked to afford health insurance on our own . . . and \n     now it is not affordable, nor are the deductibles affordable. \n     He was happy with his own policy, one that he could afford, \n     and with better coverage for him. And now the government is \n     mandating what he can afford. How is this acceptable?\n\n  I have one more I am going to read from a young family in Thompson, \nND. In this case, the family's policy was canceled just before their \nbaby was to be born.\n  They write:\n\n       My daughter and her husband are expecting their first child \n     in January, and on Friday they received a letter from their \n     insurance carrier stating that due to the new health law \n     reform they would no longer be covered. So, in January, when \n     the baby is to be born, they may have no health insurance. \n     Our president stated on more than 28 different occasions that \n     if you liked your health insurance, you could keep it. My \n     question to you is: What are you going to do about it? Will \n     you hold him accountable to his word?\n\n  We listen to all these real-life stories from people in my State--and \nthey reflect stories from people across this country--and that is why \nit is so important that we do get the kind of health care reform that \nthis country needs and that these citizens so very much want. It truly \nmakes a difference. As we debate this important issue, I think it makes \nan incredible difference.\n  This isn't me saying ``OK, we need to do it'' or any one of us saying \n``OK, this is what we need to do.'' We are hearing from Americans--in \nthis case, from my State of North Dakota. But as Members come down and \nspeak on the floor on this issue, we are hearing from 300 million \nAmericans across this free country. We are hearing real stories about \nreal hardship and what they are going through.\n  I go back to where I started this discussion; that is, why it is so \nimportant that as we approach these issues we take a hard look at \nObamaCare and the Affordable Care Act. It was passed with only \nDemocratic votes, no Republican votes whatsoever.\n  It is as I said before: If we are going to get the kinds of policies \nthat truly work for the American people, we have to come up with \npolicies that can garner bipartisan support, support from both sides of \nthe aisle. I truly believe they have to be the kinds of policies that \nempower our people, that empower our people to choose their own health \ncare provider, that empower them to choose their own health care \ninsurance.\n\n  I go back to the types of solutions I talked about earlier. These are \nthe kinds of solutions that we have put forward in legislation, that we \nwill continue to put forward in legislation, and we ask for Members of \nthis body and the House to join us on a bipartisan basis and pass \nmarket-based solutions that truly empower people. These are such things \nas expanded health savings accounts combined with high-deductible \npolicies.\n  Think about young people going out into that market and buying health \ncare insurance, maybe for the very first time. Maybe they have been \noperating without health care insurance and they say: You know what. I \nhave to get health care insurance.\n  Think about it. Think about what works for them. If we take a health \nsavings account, a high-deductible policy, low premium--they are \nhealthy, don't think they are going to get sick--that is the kind of \nthing that will encourage them to buy health insurance. If they have \nmore choice and more competition, not only are they going to get it at \na more affordable price, but they are going to have more options from \nwhich to choose. Likewise, let's make sure we provide for more \ncompetition across State lines so they are not only then looking at \ncompanies in their State but companies from across the country. More \nchoice and more competition brings down prices.\n  As we look at health care costs, let's look at tort reform. There is \nno question that lawsuits are driving the cost of health care higher. \nWe can do something about that.\n  Affordability is a huge issue we have to address as part of the right \nkinds of reforms for health care. When we talk about reforms, we have \nto reform Medicare to create the right incentives.\n  What do I mean by that? Now, under Medicare, if someone lives in a \nState where they have high costs, regardless of outcome, the Federal \nGovernment provides more reimbursement under Medicare in that State \nthan they do in a State that has lower costs even though they may have \nbetter outcomes. Does that make sense? Think about it. Think about that \nfor a minute.\n  A person has Medicare--and it is vitally important health care for \nseniors across this Nation, but the incentive is not to reduce costs. \nThe way the program works, it actually increases cost because States \nwith higher costs, regardless of outcome, get more reimbursement under \nMedicare than States with lower costs even if the States with the lower \ncosts have better outcomes.\n  Let's reform Medicare to have the right kinds of incentives, to \nencourage savings, to encourage better outcomes, and to encourage \npreventive care. We can do that. That is a win-win. We get better care \nat a more affordable price, and we help address the debt and deficit of \nthis Nation. Those are the kinds of reforms that work for Americans.\n  For Medicaid, Medicaid provided for individuals with low income, \nlet's empower the States. Let's give the States more flexibility, more \ncontrol. Rather than a Federal one-size-fits-all, give those States \nmore control to truly not only improve health care outcomes but to do \nso at affordable costs, and reward them for controlling costs.\n  These are the kinds of solutions that will not only produce better \nhealth care that I believe our providers can get behind and support \nbecause it rewards them for managing costs and good outcomes, which is \nwhat we want, but it also truly is how we address the deficit and make \nsure we save these programs--Medicare and Medicaid--and keep them sound \nfor the future so that we not only can rely on them today but for years \nto come. We make sure that we save and protect those programs by \ncreating the right kinds of reforms. Those are the kinds of reforms \nthat truly empower people and give them the opportunity--which I think \nwe all want--to choose their own health care providers and their own \nhealth care insurance.\n  As we go through these issues, again, I want to emphasize the need--\nand I come back to the reason I am on the floor--not only to talk about \nthe right kind of health care reform but to go back to the issue before \nthe Senate today: the nominations that we face and determining how we \ncome together as a Senate, as a body, and we get Members on both sides \nof the aisle who come together and say: OK, how do we make sure that we \nhave bipartisan solutions, that we create a bipartisan Senate where we \nare making sure that, as we look at confirmation of these nominees, \nthere is an investment from both sides in getting it right and that \nthere is input, deliberation, consideration, and debate on getting it \nright for the American people?\n  Whether it is health care, whether it is energy, whether it is good \nag policy, whether it is law enforcement, whether it is support for our \nmilitary, whether it is anything else, how do we make sure that all of \nus--because it is incumbent upon all of us--how do we make sure we have \nprotected what this institution has provided for since the inception of \nour country; that is, bipartisan consideration, deliberation, and \ndebate that produces the best outcome for the American people.\n\n[[Page S8723]]\n\n  We have nominations that we are going through now and that we will \ncontinue to go through. We have important policy matters we need to get \ndone now for the American people, such as a budget, Defense \nreauthorization for the defense of our Nation, a farm bill that needs \nto be passed, and an energy policy that we need to address--all things \nthat can truly move our country forward. As we do that, we need to come \nforward with solutions that will truly be bipartisan. To do that, we \nneed to have a very sincere and direct dialog as a body and Member to \nMember to come up with solutions to determine how we are going to make \nsure we are doing the very best job for the American people. That is \nwhat this is all about. We are here to do the work of the American \npeople.\n  And you know, we look across this vast, wonderful Nation, and there \nare people who are Democrats and people who are Republicans and people \nwho are Independents, and we serve that whole spectrum. We serve them \nall. We are faced with a real challenge right now to make sure that \nbipartisanship continues in this Senate and in this Congress.\n  I am going to turn to another matter before us that is incredibly \nimportant. It is a matter that is truly bipartisan. It is bipartisan, \nand I am going to use this as an example of how bipartisanship can and \ndoes work in this body and in the House. It is a matter we should be \nvoting on right now, and I sincerely hope we will be voting on it in a \nfew short weeks when we return, and that is the farm bill.\n  I am a member of the Agriculture Committee, a member of the \nagriculture appropriations subcommittee, and I am also a member of the \nconference committee that is working to reconcile the differences \nbetween the farm bill that has been passed in the House and the farm \nbill that has been passed in the Senate. I bring up this example \npurposely, because we are focused on how we operate in a bipartisan \nmanner to meet the challenges this Nation faces, and we are at a point \nwhere we need to redo the farm bill. We need to put a new long-term, 5-\nyear farm bill in place. Right now we are operating under an extension. \nI use this as an example of a truly bipartisan approach.\n  I use the farm bill for another reason too. As we go through this \nprocess, where confirmation of nominations are now being done \nessentially on a partisan basis--not a bipartisan basis but on a \npartisan basis--and as we talk about ObamaCare, which was passed on a \npartisan basis--not a bipartisan basis--I want to bring up an example \nof how things should work on a bipartisan basis.\n  When we look at the farm bill, the breakdown in terms of how the \nvotes have gone, it hasn't been Republican and Democrat. We have had \nboth. We have had some Republicans and Democrats voting against it and \nsome Republicans and some Democrats voting for it. It really is focused \non what is the policy and what best serves this great Nation.\n  Here is the other reason I bring it up right now. We are trying to \naddress the deficit and the debt this country faces; right? This year \nCBO says the deficit is going to be somewhere between $650 billion and \n$700 billion--the deficit. The debt is $17.3 trillion. We must address \nthe deficit and the debt. So as we work on a new farm bill, we are not \nonly reforming the current farm bill, which is operating under an \nextension, we not only make reforms that make for a better farm \nprogram, but we are going to save on the order of $25 billion to $30 \nbillion to help reduce the deficit and the debt.\n  Isn't that what we should be doing across government on a bipartisan \nbasis--coming up with better policy that actually reduces the deficit \nand the debt, controls spending, reduces spending and helps our economy \ngrow? That is what we are doing with the farm bill, and that is what we \nshould be doing in these other areas as well.\n  So as we continue to work on the farm program, I had hoped we could \nbe to the point where we would be voting this week or next on the \nSenate floor and in the House as well. It doesn't look like that is \ngoing to happen, but we are very close. We can have a framework in \nplace this week or next so that we can vote on it as soon as we return \nin January, and that is what we need to do.\n  The current farm bill, the current extension, expires at the end of \nthe year, meaning we need to get a new farm bill in place--not an \nextension but a new farm bill. We have put the framework in place. We \nare there. We now just need to get people to agree and we need to get \nthe bill to the House and to the Senate floor. I believe we are \nabsolutely there. We just have to have the will to make it happen and \nto make it happen on a bipartisan basis. Not only is it vitally \nimportant we pass this farm bill, but it truly can be an example in \nterms of how we approach other policy as well on a bipartisan basis.\n  At this point, Mr. President, I see the leader is here and I would \nask of the Chair as to my time allotment and also the time for the next \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has now expired.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Landya B. McCafferty, of New Hampshire, to be United States District \nJudge for the District of New Hampshire.\n  Mr. WICKER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

WALD TO BE A MEMBER OF THE PRIVACY AND CIVIL \n                       LIBERTIES OVERSIGHT BOARD\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \nnomination.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Patricia M. Wald, of the \nDistrict of Columbia, to be a Member of the Privacy and Civil Liberties \nBoard for a term expiring January 29, 2019.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Pursuant to the provisions of S. \nRes. 15 of the 113th Congress, there will now be up to 8 hours of \npostcloture consideration of the nomination equally divided in the \nusual form.\n  The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield back the majority's time on this \nnomination.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time is yielded back.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I would like to speak on the nomination.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am glad to have this opportunity to \ncome to the floor of this great body to talk about issues that are of \ngreat concern to the people of Ohio whom I represent and to the \ncountry. We are facing a lot of challenges right now. Certainly health \ncare costs are on the rise, as we have seen, but jobs are also hard to \ncome by.\n  There is a middle-class squeeze going on out there where paychecks \nare down and health care costs are up, and belief in the American \ndream, as a result, is on the decline. Some say for the first time \nsince polling has begun people think that future generations are not \ngoing to be as well off as we are. This is sad, and there is work we \ncan and should do to address this.\n  It starts with dealing with some of the gridlock in Washington and \ngetting some things done. One of my concerns about what the majority \nhas done in terms of taking away the rights of the minority to be heard \non nominations is creating a very tough environment to break through \nthat gridlock and get things done.\n  I think about the judiciary. Today we are talking about a court judge \nwho is up for a nomination and the question is whether she is going to \nbe confirmed. Right now, under the current rules that exist, \nRepublicans have no voice, in essence, because the 50 votes from \nDemocrats--and there are 55 Democrats--can put up a judge and get the \nvotes and put anybody through they want.\n  Under the system that has prevailed in this body for decades, and one \nconsistent with the intention of the Founders, you have to get 60 \nvotes. In other words, the minority would have some voice, and \nspecifically Republicans, in that there are 45 of us and we would have \nto supply about 5 votes. That makes a big difference in terms of the \nkinds of judges who are nominated and ultimately confirmed.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about what is going on here on the \nfloor in terms of ending the ability of the minority to have their \nvoice heard. I think we also need to focus a little on what impact this \nwill have on the judiciary.\n  When someone is appointed to the DC Circuit Court--somebody was \nrecently confirmed yesterday and the day before for that body--these \nare lifetime appointments. Instead of having to go through a process \nwhere you have to figure out how to get some Members of the other party \nto support you, right now--under the new rules that were done by \nbreaking the rules, and again, inconsistent with the intent of the \nFounders who allowed their voices to be heard--they don't have to get \nthe minority. They can do it with just 50 votes. Again, with 55 \nDemocrats, there is no need to consult with Republicans or to get any \nsupport. In fact, they can allow five Democrats to vote the other way.\n  I worry this will polarize the judiciary. I think we are polarized \nenough in this place. I think Washington is becoming dysfunctional for \na lot of reasons, but one is this increased polarization. Now to have \nthis rule change only creates a difficult environment to get work done, \nbut it will also put judges on the judiciary with lifetime \nappointments; these judges who, frankly, are more liberal under the \nDemocrats and more conservative under the Republicans than they would \notherwise be.\n  In States such as mine where there is a Republican Senator and a \nDemocratic Senator, we work together to try to put judges forward. \nDemocrats realize in the majority they have now, they have to get some \nRepublican support, so they work with us. You tend to get center-left \njudges nominated and confirmed right now.\n  Again, under the new rules that Leader Reid and the Democrats have \ninsisted on, that will not be required. Why would you have to consult \nand work with your counterpart in your State or Republicans on the \nother side of the Chamber?\n  When there are 50 votes, you can put forward any judge you want. I do \nthink this will result in judges who are not center left but left and \nnot center right but right. This will polarize the judiciary more, and \nthat concerns me.\n  I hope, as we are thinking about how we deal with our own \nprocedures--and I know this is an issue that has been debated a lot in \nthe last few weeks because of the decision the Democratic leadership \nmade to take away this right--we also think about what impact this will \nhave on the judiciary. Do we want a more polarized judiciary where some \nof these ideological differences make it difficult for them to operate \njust as it makes it difficult for the Congress to operate? I don't \nthink so.\n  I don't think that is what the American people want, and I know it is \nnot\n\n[[Page S8725]]\n\nwhat the Founders intended when they gave the minority a voice in this \nbody, and I hope we can get back to a regular order where we have a \nlimitation on amendments that is reasonable with reasonable time limits \nso we can get our work done.\n  Let's allow amendments to be offered. Let's allow the voices to be \nheard. Let's allow--in the case of these nominations--input from the \nother side.\n  I am very concerned about where this is headed. The logical extension \nof what the Democrats have done, of course, is to extend this to \nlegislation as well, which I think creates more of a problem than we \nhave already in terms of legislation being passed here that is not \nreflective of the will of the people, that is not subject to the checks \nand balances we would have under a rule where we have to get 60, not \n50, votes in order to pass legislation.\n\n  A prime example is ObamaCare. Let's be honest. The reason it got \nthrough the Senate was because a special provision was used called \nreconciliation, which is supposed to be used for budget matters, \nrevenues, and spending.\n  I believe that was an inappropriate use of reconciliation as do many \nother observers who are objective observers and have followed this \nplace for a long time.\n  ObamaCare was pushed through, not with 60 votes--because after the \nelection of Scott Brown in Massachusetts, they didn't have 60 votes to \nget ObamaCare through because not a single Republican would support it \nbecause Republicans supported an alternative plan. So without a single \nRepublican supporting it, Democrats chose to ram it through with 50 \nvotes. That is all they needed because they used this so-called \nreconciliation provision that, again, is supposed to be for budget \nissues, not health care.\n  I think the results are now plain to see. We have law in place that \nis affecting my constituents and affecting the constituents of every \nSenator, that has very negative consequences. Did we need to do \nsomething to reform the health care system? Yes. Was the status quo \nacceptable? No. Is it acceptable now? No.\n  There are smart reforms to reduce costs, smart reforms add more \nchoice, to allow markets to work better in health care, to not only \nprovide for better quality and better choice but also lower costs. \nThose were not pursued. We still have the opportunity now to do that.\n  I talked earlier about the fact that health care is a big concern to \nthe American people. It certainly is among my constituents in Ohio. We \ndo a tele-townhall meeting periodically. We had a couple of them last \nmonth where I will get maybe 25,000 Ohioans on the phone at any one \ntime and talk to them about the issues of the day and hear their \nquestions and concerns.\n  During the tele-townhall meeting, we ask a poll question, such as \nwhat is the most important issue you think is facing the country? We \nask whether it is national security and terrorism, energy policy and \ncosts at the pump, health care and health care costs, jobs and the \neconomy, or some other issue.\n  It is interesting in that every single tele-townhall meeting I have \nhad over the past few years has always been that jobs and the economy \nis the No. 1 issue. Again, there may be 25,000 people at any one time. \nWhen we asked the poll question, that has been the No. 1 question. \nUsually the No. 2 issue is debt and deficit and spending.\n  The last two tele-townhalls we did last month--guess what the No. 1 \nissue was. It was not jobs and the economy or debt and deficit. It was \nabout health care because people are so concerned about what ObamaCare \nis doing to them and their families.\n  I will let them speak for themselves. Some of us were on the floor a \nfew weeks ago talking about this, but since that time I have received a \nlot of stories from people I represent.\n  Here is one from Susan from Batavia which is in Clermont County in \nsouthern Ohio. She says:\n\n       I am a single mom. I pay for my own health insurance. I am \n     active and fit. I have cycled over 4,000 miles this year. I \n     am seldom sick. In the 3 years I have paid for my own \n     insurance, I went to the doctor once for illness. My rate was \n     $146 a month. In September I received a letter from Anthem \n     saying that my plan does not meet the requirements of the \n     Affordable Care Act and will be discontinued as of January 1, \n     2014. I was offered the same coverage I had--not for $146 a \n     month but for $350 a month.\n\n  To Susan from Batavia, thanks for your story and letting us know what \nis happening and how this is affecting you as a single mom who is \ntaking care of herself, doing the right things, and had a plan that \nworked for her and was told, no, the government knows best. You can't \nhave your plan. Here is the plan you have to have, and in order to have \ncomparable coverage we are going to raise your rates by over double.\n  This is from Mike from Westlake in northeast Ohio. Mike says:\n\n       I own a small business. Our health insurance rates for \n     single employees under 30 went from $198 per month last year \n     to $650 per month this year. That is a 260-percent increase \n     thanks to ObamaCare. This bill is going to put small \n     businesses out of business.\n\n  Here is one from William from Columbus, OH:\n\n       We were paying $540 per month but received a letter from \n     Anthem stating that the rates would increase to $662 per \n     month beginning September 2013 and then $1,014 per month in \n     September 2014 as a result of the requirements per ObamaCare. \n     If that wasn't bad enough, our family doctor of 25 years \n     informed us that he will end his practice on January 1, \n     2014. The reason being is the government requirements of \n     ObamaCare just made it too difficult to continue.\n\n  That is William from Columbus, talking about an issue of price, \nobviously, going from $540 a month to $1,014 per month. But it is also \nabout choice because his doctor is stepping out because of ObamaCare.\n  Rachel from Solon says:\n\n       My family owns a small business. We were notified that our \n     current health care plan is substandard at $860 per month. To \n     comply, we now must pay $1,880 a month. This is beyond \n     outrageous.\n\n  That is what Rachel says. I agree with her: $860 to $1,880 per \nmonth--more than double--in order for her to have health care as a \nsmall business owner for her and her husband.\n  Jon from Dublin:\n\n       We currently have a high-deductible plan from Anthem and \n     pay $331 per month. We are perfectly happy with our plan. It \n     provides wellness visits for free, which is what we really \n     need, and then catastrophic coverage in case of something \n     very unpleasant. When I recently reviewed our coverage and \n     tried to renew it, I asked what an equivalent plan would cost \n     under the exchange. The quote I received was for $833 per \n     month.\n\n  Remember, he was paying $331 per month. He likes his plan with \nwellness visits and catastrophic coverage. It goes from $331 per month \nto $833 per month.\n  Back to his letter:\n\n       The deductible even went up from $11,000 to $12,700.\n\n  So this notion that people have to get out of these plans because \ntheir deductible is too high--the one that is acceptable based on \nObamaCare and this top-down approach is now a higher deductible.\n  He says:\n\n       My family simply cannot afford this plan.\n\n  Here is Sarah from Raymond, OH. Sarah writes--and this is painful. \nThese are painful. But Sarah writes:\n\n       I am literally crying right now because of our insurance. \n     My family's new monthly cost starting January 1 is $323.82 \n     biweekly and $647.64 a month, a difference of $420 in what we \n     currently pay, and the new plan offers less with more out-of-\n     pocket expenses. The ACA has failed and it is hurting my \n     family, not helping.\n\n  Here is Chuck from West Chester:\n\n       I tried to give this health care thing the benefit of the \n     doubt. I went to the Web site and all the estimates are more \n     expensive than my canceled policy. My canceled policy was not \n     only cheaper; it was better, and I don't qualify for any \n     subsidies. Do I have any choice besides paying more money?\n\n  Chuck, I am probably not qualified to give advice, but I will anyway. \nYour choice is to pay a penalty or pay more. That is what the \ngovernment is telling you. That is what ObamaCare is telling you.\n  Cynthia from Canton, OH:\n\n       I am a substitute teacher. Recently I received notice that \n     I was not getting jobs every day like I have been for most of \n     the past 13 years. I am a good, dependable sub, and I work \n     for $70 a day before taxes. I contacted the school system and \n     was told that they are watching any sub to prevent over 30 \n     hours a week because of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n  Cynthia's letter to me, unfortunately, is something that I am hearing \nall over the State of Ohio. It is that people are being told: We need \nto keep you under 30 hours. She is finding out\n\n[[Page S8726]]\n\nas a substitute teacher in Canton, OH, that she can't get the jobs she \nused to get because they are telling her they want to watch the subs to \nprevent anybody getting more than 30 hours a week because of the \nAffordable Care Act. My colleagues probably know this: Under the act, \nif a person works over 30 hours a week, that person is considered full-\ntime; therefore, the company has to provide the health care insurance \nthat, again, this top-down approach insists on; not the health \ninsurance you may want or your employer may think is appropriate, but \nthe health care insurance that the Affordable Care Act thinks is \nappropriate. So companies are telling folks, as in the case of this \nsubstitute teacher--private and public sector--we need to keep you \nunder 30 hours because we simply can't afford that kind of health care.\n  Here is Mark from Urbana, OH:\n\n       My wife and I are farmers. We have our own private health \n     insurance, which is not cheap. We just learned that our \n     insurer is canceling our plan and that the ObamaCare plan \n     will double our premiums to more than $1,000 per month. My \n     wife is 55 years old. We do not need maternity coverage or \n     free birth control or so much other coverage mandated by \n     ObamaCare. We are modest, middle income people. What we need \n     in this country is a policy to make health care more \n     affordable. We can do this if we let Americans determine \n     their own health care needs and shop for the best and most \n     affordable care. Why not medical savings accounts for \n     everyone? They would be privately owned so that no one is \n     chained to their employer-sponsored plan. Why not require \n     that health care providers post prices of their services? We \n     can come up with much better alternatives to ObamaCare. \n     Please help us.\n\n  I agree with him. We can come up with much better alternatives, \nincluding letting people save money for their own health care. Why \nshould we want to discourage that? By the way, those HSA savings \naccounts that Mark is talking about that he would like to see for \neveryone, those are made less attractive because they take away some of \nthe health care tax benefit.\n\n  So we are moving the wrong way. We are moving away from people taking \ncare of their own health needs and encouraging them again to focus on \nwellness and prevention, understanding that it is their dollar that is \nat stake and allowing them to build up a little nest egg if they are \nhealthy and if they are able to avoid a health problem, and if they do \nhave a problem, they have coverage, with a high deductible, and they \nhave coverage to take care of it. People should be able to make that \ndecision on their own if that is what is best for them and their \nfamily.\n  Here is Brian from Mentor:\n\n       My family's Aetna plan has been canceled due to ObamaCare. \n     My old plan was $454 per month with a $5,000 per person \n     deductible. The same deductible policy to buy a new plan is \n     $1,038 per month--\n\nmore than double for Bryan.\n  Dean from Sandusky:\n\n       Ever since I lost my job in 2009, I have been purchasing my \n     own health insurance. Last month, I received a letter in the \n     mail stating that my plan is being canceled due to the ACA. I \n     was told to look at plans on the exchange, which I did, and \n     found a comparable plan that is over twice the cost of what I \n     now have. In addition, this is over half of my monthly \n     pension. I simply cannot afford this.\n       I have always been a responsible, hard-working, self-\n     dependent person. Now, because of the actions of our \n     government, for the first time in my life I will not have \n     health care coverage. I am 59 years old now and I need this \n     coverage. I am outraged, to say the least. How can our \n     government do this to us? I will remember this come election \n     time.\n\n  That is Dean from Sandusky. He lost his job and picked up a plan on \nthe individual market that worked for him. He is now going to have to \npay twice as much. He can't afford it. He is not covered. He is on a \nfixed income. It sounds as though he is going to go without coverage.\n  By the way, new polling data is out showing that a lot of young \npeople are going to go without coverage. One number is 28 percent of \nthem are; another number is closer to half. I don't know how many. But \na lot of young people I talk to say they would rather pay the penalty \nand take the risk than be covered. That is a problem for them, but it \nis also a problem for the Affordable Care Act because it is based on \nthose people coming into the system and, frankly, providing the ability \nfor others to get coverage under the risk pools that are set up under \nObamaCare.\n  So the stories I have told are real people facing real problems and \nthey are problems that Washington created for them and their families. \nThey were fine with their coverage. They liked their coverage. I know \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle have their own stories \nabout people who are getting coverage and benefiting from it, \nparticularly those with preexisting conditions. I understand that. But \nthese stories really obscure the question we should be debating on the \nfloor. I agree we should cover people with preexisting conditions, and \nso do most Republicans. The question is how do we do it.\n  So when Democrats come to the floor and tell me, Rob, you have all of \nthese stories about people who cannot afford health insurance anymore \nand are having a really hard time on the individual market, but we will \ntell our stories of folks with preexisting conditions, my answer is \nthat I also believe we ought to cover those people. I don't dispute \nthat. We want to get coverage for more Americans. That is not the \nquestion we are debating. The real question is whether ObamaCare, with \nits mandates, its top-down, centralized controls is the way to \naccomplish those goals.\n  If the President and my friends on the other side of the aisle \nbelieve that the only way to increase coverage is to make everyone to \npay more, to force millions of Americans to give up their insurance, to \nmake people lose their doctors, then they should say that is what their \nplan is because that is what is happening.\n  A lack of honesty and transparency, in my view, is one of the great \nfailures of the Affordable Care Act. I believe ObamaCare was sold to \nthe American people under false pretenses. President Obama famously \nsaid, ``If you like your health care, you can keep it.'' He said, ``If \nyou like your health care, you can keep it, period.'' But the one thing \nhe could not do then was keep his word. He had to have known it then. \nAll of the information coming out indicates that was knowledge he \nshould have had, yet he kept saying it. What began as a broken Web site \nand cancellation notices has turned into sticker shock for millions of \nAmericans who are seeing their health care costs soar under ObamaCare. \nBy the way, as I said earlier, these rising costs are not a mistake in \nObamaCare; they were intended in ObamaCare. Under ObamaCare, millions \nof Americans have to pay more for insurance in order for the program to \nwork. The Web site can be fixed. I assume it will be at some point, \nalthough they are certainly having a tough time with it. But this basic \npremise that is the heart of ObamaCare that other people's costs have \nto go up, and pretty dramatically, cannot be fixed.\n  The reason goes back to a critical choice made at the beginning of \nthe health care debate. There are different approaches to covering the \nuninsured, covering those with preexisting conditions. The approach \nfavored by Republicans, at least many Republicans, including me, would \ncreate real economic incentives to bring the uninsured into covered \naccess to health care while taking critical steps to reduce the costs \nof health care. One of the reasons people aren't covered is cost. The \nbest way to lower the number of the uninsured is to make it easier and \nless expensive for people to get insurance in the first place.\n  The President chose to take a very different approach. He chose not \nto focus on the costs, which have gone up; not to focus on providing \nincentives for people to get coverage, but instead a top-down, \ncentralized approach. He turned to mandates. ObamaCare requires that \nall Americans purchase insurance. It mandates what type of insurance \nthat coverage includes, and it requires that private insurers accept \nall comers, including those with preexisting conditions.\n  Again, we all want to ensure that those with chronic conditions \nreceive health care, but it also changes the way health insurance \nunderwriting works. Normally, insurance works by pooling resources for \nsome future harm. So for those who have preexisting conditions, \nobviously the harm is already present and their premiums are not going \nto be able to pay for their care, for the most part. That is why these \nhigh-risk pools in States are something I support and others support, \nproviding tax incentives for that. But the offset is these often have \nastronomical costs. That is how ObamaCare was designed.\n\n[[Page S8727]]\n\n  So this notion of these costs are going up and we didn't intend \nthat--of course they intended it. It is exactly the way they intended \nit. ObamaCare needs more money than these policies would provide, so \nthese private plans we talked about earlier--people in the individual \nmarket--many of which are high deductibles, low cost, catastrophic \nplans, many of the people who have these plans are young people who are \nrelatively healthy. These folks were forced to buy insurance they \ndidn't need because ObamaCare needed the money. The plans they had met \nthe needs of those people--met the customers' needs--but, frankly, \ndidn't meet the government's needs. So those plans were regulated out \nof existence, padded with extra benefits and consumer protections that \nmany of those who chose this policy didn't want, as Mark from Urbana \nsaid, and will never use. Sometimes these policies are double or \ntriple, and we have heard cases where they are five, 10 times more.\n  What we have seen in the individual market is only the beginning. \nNext year, the same mandates and government outreach that have hit the \nindividual market will come to effect for the employer-based market as \nwell, where the vast majority of us get our health care, through our \nemployer. So at some point 80 million Americans will likely see their \nhealth plans canceled or sold and replaced by--when the employer-based \nmarket comes under the ObamaCare mandates, which, as we recall, is \ngoing to happen about a year from now, because it was put off for a \nyear--that was the delay the President put in effect--we are going to \nsee much more of this.\n  Again, there is a better way. There is a way to put this partisanship \nbehind us and do this together. We talked earlier about the fact when \nyou cram something through with all votes on one side of the aisle and \nignore the other, we tend to get a policy that doesn't work for the \nAmerican people.\n  That is exactly what we are seeing here. There is a better way, and \nwe still need to pursue it. Instead of having less choices and higher \ncosts for all Americans, there is a way to put together a plan that \nactually helps people.\n  This is something that Republicans and Democrats alike need to focus \non. Instead of a top-down, centralized, government-knows-best solution, \nwe need to go to solutions that actually reduce the costs of health \ncare and provide more choice in health care. It can be done.\n  ObamaCare should be repealed and replaced, in my view, but it should \nbe replaced. The status quo is not acceptable. I think the failures of \nObamaCare point the way as to what we should do--reduce the costs. \nThere are steps we could take today; for instance, remove the shackles \nof government regulations from the market. Let health care insurance \nand health care be less expensive. Let health care insurance be sold \nacross State lines. That is something you can do with Federal \nlegislation that will provide more competition. It will lower the cost. \nThere are some areas in my State where there are only a couple plans. I \nam told under ObamaCare, in some States there are only a couple plans. \nYou want to have more competition, not less.\n  We should give people the ability to get health care on their own. We \ntalked about health savings accounts. We should help create a healthy, \nvibrant individual health care market by giving people a tax incentive \nto purchase health insurance comparable to incentives they would \nreceive with employer-provided coverage where there now are tax \nincentives to provide health care coverage. Let's deal with these \nfrivolous lawsuits. That reduces the costs.\n  So I appreciate the fact that one of my colleagues has joined me on \nthe floor and is going to continue this discussion. But I wish to go \nback to where we started. It does not have to be this way. What we are \ndoing in the Senate by taking away the rights of the minority is not \ngoing to help us with regard to getting better judges. It did not help \nus in terms of cramming ObamaCare through with 51 votes rather than the \nnormal 60 that should have been required. It does not help for us to \nnow continue down this track of a government, one-size-fits-all \napproach to health care. We have heard the stories. We see what is \nhappening and have not even hit most Americans yet because they get \ncoverage from their employer.\n  Instead, let's work to together. Let's provide more choice. Let's \nreduce the costs. Let's ensure that everybody has access to health care \nthat works for them and their families. If we do that, the American \npeople might regain a little bit of trust in this institution and in \nthis town.\n  Madam President, I would like to yield the floor, if I could, for my \ncolleague and your colleague from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I thank the esteemed Senator from Ohio \nfor his remarks and express my support for his remarks as well.\n  Myself and other colleagues have been on the floor today talking \nabout the need to work in a bipartisan way. Obviously, the business \nbefore the Senate right now is nominations, and we want to emphasize \nagain the importance of advice and consent in the nomination process \nbut that it needs to be on a bipartisan basis.\n  The change that, of course, has been made is that now the majority \nparty can vote through, confirm a nomination without any input, any \nconsent, any debate from the minority party. That is an issue not only \nin terms of the nomination process, the confirmation process of advise \nand consent, but that is also very much an issue in legislation.\n  The importance of bipartisanship, whether it is in advise and consent \nin the confirmation process or whether it is in passing legislation, is \nseen because we have a country of more than 300 million people--\nRepublicans, Democrats, Independents--but at the end of the day, if we \nare going to have broad-based public support for the work we do, for \nthe legislation we pass, it has to be done in a bipartisan way.\n  My colleagues have been pointing that out in terms of the \nconfirmation process. Also, they have been pointing that out in the \ncontext of the Affordable Care Act and ObamaCare. That is legislation \nthat was passed on a partisan basis. One party, and one party only, \nvoted for that legislation. What we have seen is that does not work.\n  To get broad-based support for any legislation--let alone something \nas important as reform of health care--both parties have to be part of \nthat work product. That is the only way we are going to get broad-based \nsupport across this great Nation on the important issues we face.\n  Earlier today I read story after story from people from our great \nState expressing real challenges, real difficulties--the higher costs, \nhigher deductibles, higher premiums, higher copays--they are facing as \na result of the Affordable Care Act. I talked about the need to engage \nin the right kind of health care reform, the kind of health care reform \nthat truly empowers individuals to pick their own health care insurance \nand their own health care provider; the need to pass the kind of \nlegislation that will help us provide expanded health savings accounts \ntied with higher deductible policies that will encourage our young \npeople to purchase health care insurance because they will be able to \ndo so with lower premiums; the need for tort reform to help bring down \nhealth care costs; the need to increase competition across State lines \nso people have more choice, and with that competition, lower prices \nwhen it comes to choosing their health care insurance; and I talked \nabout the need to reform Medicare, as the Presiding Officer knows, to \nprovide the right incentives.\n  Look at our great State of North Dakota. We have lower health care \ncosts than most other States, and we have very good outcomes. For that \nwe get not more Medicare reimbursement but less. That is exactly the \nwrong incentive--providing more reimbursement to States that have high \ncosts regardless of outcome and lower reimbursement for States even \nwith lower costs and better outcomes; in essence, getting less \nreimbursement, getting penalized for good performance. That is exactly \nthe wrong approach and why we so desperately need to make reforms that \ncreate the right approach.\n  These are the kinds of solutions we are advocating that we will \ncontinue to advocate to put in place for the American people. We need \nMembers on both sides of the aisle to come together with\n\n[[Page S8728]]\n\na step-by-step, comprehensive approach, market-based approach, that \nwill truly create more choice, more competition, and empower people--\nempower people--the great citizens of this country to take control of \ntheir health care decisions and make the decisions that best suit them \nand their families.\n  I see that my colleague from the great State of South Dakota is in \nthe Chamber. As always, I am very pleased to see him, and at this time \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Thank you, Madam President. I thank my colleague from \nNorth Dakota--both colleagues from North Dakota who are here in the \nChamber--and I appreciate his leadership as a former Governor, \nunderstanding these issues such as health care, which do profoundly \nimpact the people whom we all represent in the Dakotas. There are some \nunique challenges, obviously, of meeting the health care needs of \npeople in our States because we have a big geography, lots of wide open \nspace. We do not have the big population centers that are in other \nplaces in the country, and so health care delivery and coverage of \nhealth care, health care insurance and access to it are enormously \nimportant to the people we all represent.\n  I would say it has become abundantly clear that the American people \nare rejecting ObamaCare, which is the law that was passed several years \nago in the Senate, in the house, signed into law by the President. I \nremember being here at the time and voting on that on Christmas Eve. We \nwere actually here. It was December 24, 4 years ago, I think now, in \n2009. We were right up here until the end, and this was, I would say, \njammed through the Senate.\n  The majority had the votes. They were not all that concerned about \nhaving participation or input from those of us who served in the other \nparty--as a consequence of that just shoved this thing through right on \nChristmas Eve. I think that was an unfortunate way in which to conduct \nthe business of the Senate, to enact major legislation. It is very rare \naround here that legislation of that consequence that literally impacts \none-sixth of the American economy is shoved through on a partisan \nparty-line basis.\n  So that is the way it was done. We said at the time--many of us were \ndown here on the floor over and over predicting that because of the way \nthis was structured it was going to lead to higher insurance premiums, \nit was going to lead to fewer jobs in our economy, a lot of stress on \nemployers that were trying to create those jobs. All of that is coming \nto fruition as we hear now reports day after day after day across this \ncountry--from my State of South Dakota, other States across the \ncountry--from people who are feeling the very real and harmful impacts \nof the ObamaCare legislation, both in terms of higher premiums but also \ncanceled coverages, higher deductibles, things that affect the \npocketbooks of millions of Americans and issues that are discussed and \ndebated at kitchen tables, but they are profoundly important to the \neconomic well-being of people in this country.\n  When you are seeing the dramatic increases in premiums, the dramatic \nincreases in deductibles, the loss of coverage, the canceled coverages \nwe are seeing across the country right now, it is very disturbing to \npeople. That is why I think you have seen this widespread rejection of \nObamaCare.\n  Interestingly enough, yesterday Health and Human Services released \nnew enrollment numbers for the exchanges for October and November. Over \nthe course of those 2 months, in my State of South Dakota, just 372 \nSouth Dakotans--or less than one-half of one-tenth of 1 percent of my \nState's residents--signed up for health care on the exchanges.\n  Ten other States also had fewer than 1,000 people sign up.\n  Oregon, which embraced ObamaCare very early on, had just 44 \nenrollments. Think about that--44 enrollments to show for 2 months \nthanks to their Web site, which suffered an even more catastrophic \nfailure than the Federal Web site.\n  In all, there were 364,682 enrolled in the exchanges during the \nmonths of October and November--not even one-quarter of the number the \nadministration had projected after 2 months. To meet its goal of 3.3 \nmillion signups by December 31, the administration would have to sign \nup almost 3 million people in the next 3 weeks or more than 145,000 \nevery single day.\n  Considering that the administration has averaged fewer than 6,000 \nenrollments a day over the past 2 months, I would not want to put a lot \nof money on them being able to meet that goal. It is obvious from the \nsluggish enrollment numbers that the American people are rejecting \nObamaCare. But if anyone needs more proof, three new polls came out \nlast week, all reporting strong opposition to the law among the \nAmerican people.\n  The Pew Research Center poll reports that 54 percent of the American \npeople disapprove of the President's health care law.\n  According to Pew's most recent survey, the percentage of Americans \nwho think the health care law has ``had a negative effect on the \ncountry'' rose 11 percent just since September of this year.\n  In the Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released yesterday, the \nPresident's disapproval rating reached an alltime high of 54 percent. \nWhen asked what issue shaped their view of the President this year, 60 \npercent cited ObamaCare.\n  The same Wall Street Journal poll also found the number of Americans \nwho think the President's health care law was ``a bad idea'' reached an \nalltime high.\n  Quinnipiac University also released a poll yesterday that found that \n57 percent of the American people oppose ObamaCare.\n  The President's health care law has never enjoyed strong popular \nsupport. But Democrats and the President argued that public support for \nthe law should not be judged until the law's benefits were in effect.\n  The law is now in effect. People can buy insurance on the exchanges. \nYet opposition to the law is not declining; it is the opposite that is \nhappening. It is actually rising. Opposition to the law is increasing \nover time as more and more people become aware of the impact on their \npersonal economic well-being.\n  Quinnipiac reported a 10-point jump in opposition to the law between \nOctober 1 of this year and December 11.\n  Meanwhile, support for the law, already low, dropped a further six \npoints over the same time period.\n  Even worse for the President, it is not just Republicans and \nIndependents who are fleeing the President's signature law. Many of the \nPresident's strongest supporters, those who initially supported his \nhealth care law and helped reelect him last year, are deserting the \nPresident.\n  The Pew Research Center found a 10-point drop in support among \nAfrican Americans since September and a 9-point drop in support among \nHispanic Americans--both groups who strongly supported the President in \nthe last election.\n  The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll also found ``faith in Mr. Obama \nhas dropped noticeably in recent months among young voters and \nHispanics, two groups that had been among his steadiest supporters.''\n  So the question, I guess, is why are the American people and even the \nPresident's strongest supporters rejecting ObamaCare? Why, now that the \nlaw is mostly in effect, is opposition growing rather than declining?\n  Well, I think the answer is very simple. It is because the law has \nfailed to deliver on the President's promises. From rising premiums, to \ncanceled health plans, to lost doctors, ObamaCare is doing the exact \nopposite of what the President promised it would do. The President said \nhis new law would reduce the cost of health care. In fact, he claimed \nfamilies would see their premiums fall by an average of $2,500 a year. \nBut that promise fell apart almost immediately after ObamaCare was \nenacted. In fact, what we are seeing out there is that the average \nfamily has seen its health care premiums rise by more than $2,500 since \nthe law's passage. Now that the law is being implemented, those numbers \nare only going higher. Those families who are lucky enough to keep \ntheir plans have been receiving insurance renewal notices with \nstaggering premium increases. Premiums are doubling or\n\n[[Page S8729]]\n\neven tripling for many families, and deductibles are increasing as \nwell. Imagine getting a $600-a-month increase in premiums. That is \n$7,200 a year. How on Earth is a working family, a middle-class family \nin this country supposed to be able to afford that?\n  The President would like you to believe that these Americans' \nupdated, more expensive health plans are far superior to what they had \nbefore. But, in fact, many of these plans were as good or better than \nwhat these families are getting now. Many of these plans are falling \nshort of people's expectations because they have higher deductibles. Of \ncourse, with all of the mandated coverages that are in many of these \nplans, there are all kinds of things that people who are subscribing, \ntrying to get on the exchanges, are finding they do not need. I have \nhad people in my State of South Dakota who are in their fifties and \nsixties who are asking why they need to have things such as maternity \ncoverage.\n  You see that as these letters and emails and phone calls are coming \ninto your office and people are finding out about the specifics--the \ndetails, if you will--of these various plans, they are rejecting them \nnot only because they have higher premiums, but they are also plans \nthat are not sufficient or adequate compared to what they are currently \nexperiencing with the plans they had before. Now thousands of families \naround the country are going to be struggling to pay huge premium \nincreases without receiving any additional benefit.\n  The situation is no better on the exchanges. While there are \ncertainly plans with low premiums on the exchanges, many of those plans \nhave deductibles that are so high that, barring some catastrophic \nillness or injury, the family might as well not have insurance at all. \nA family without insurance who typically pays $8,000 a year in health \ncare costs may see no benefit at all from an insurance plan with a \n$12,000 deductible. In fact, they may spend more on health care because \nnow they have to pay high insurance premiums as well. So you have \nhigher insurance premiums, higher deductibles, meaning in many cases \nthat they are not going to reach the threshold that would trigger a \npayment from their plan, and so they are getting no additional benefit, \nbut they are paying way more for the same or worse coverage.\n  In addition to promising a new era of affordable health care, the \nPresident also promised that nothing would change for people who liked \nthe health care they had. He repeated many times--we have all seen the \nvideos of this--that if you like your health care plan, you can keep \nit. He even went so far as to say ``You can keep it, period'' to make \nit even more emphatic. ``If you like your doctors, you can keep your \ndoctor, period.'' But Americans are now finding out that was not even \nclose to being true. Millions of Americans have seen the health care \nplans that they liked canceled by insurance companies in response to \nnew ObamaCare regulations. So far, more than 5 million Americans have \nlost their health care plans as a direct result of ObamaCare. In fact, \ntoday, millions more Americans have lost health care than have gained \nit under the President's signature law.\n  Millions of Americans are also realizing that they cannot keep their \ndoctors or their hospitals. ObamaCare put in place scores of new \nregulations on insurance companies and the plans they offer. To meet \nall of the ObamaCare requirements while still getting their plans \napproved, insurance companies have been forced to drastically shrink \ntheir networks of doctors and hospitals. As a consequence, many \nfamilies are finding that their new health care plans force them to \ngive up doctors they have been seeing literally for years.\n  That may not sound so terrible to some of us if we do not have a \nclose relationship with our doctors, but what if you are a cancer \npatient who relies on your network of doctors and oncologists to \ncoordinate your lifesaving care?\n  More than one cancer patient has spoken openly in the press about the \nstruggle to find a replacement health care plan after having their \noriginal plan canceled as a result of ObamaCare, a plan that covers all \nof the doctors and the medicines they are currently using.\n  Joan Carrico, a nurse from Michigan and a cancer patient, published a \nheartbreaking column on CNBC yesterday updating readers on her \nstruggles to find a health care plan that covers all of her care. I \nwill let her words speak for her and the other Americans in her \nposition:\n\n       I can't begin to describe how devastated I am. Many people \n     like me, who are in a difficult health crisis and fighting to \n     regain good health, are finding it very difficult--if not \n     impossible--to make sure that we can keep our doctors and \n     receive the chemotherapy and other treatments and medicines \n     that are keeping us alive. . . . I'm scared and wondering \n     what surprises are around the corner.\n\n  Well, Ms. Carrico brings up another thing people may lose under \nObamaCare besides their doctors and their health care plans; that is, \ntheir medications.\n  Forbes published an article this week outlining the reasons ObamaCare \nmay cause millions of Americans to lose access to the medications they \nare currently taking. The author points out that many exchange plans \nhave steep cost-sharing requirements for prescription drugs. Purchasing \na bronze plan, for example, the article points out, means you will \nlikely be responsible for 40 percent of a drug's cost. That may not be \nso bad if we are talking about a common antibiotic, but that gets very \nexpensive when we are talking about more sophisticated drugs, such as \ncancer drugs and other lifesaving treatments.\n  The second reason patients may lose access to their medications, \naccording to Forbes, is that some plans simply may not cover the \nprescription drugs that person has been taking. Out-of-pocket limits, \nthe article notes, do not apply if the drug you are taking is not on \nyour new insurance company's ``approved'' list of drugs. You may find \nyourself paying for a very expensive drug without any benefit at all \nfrom your new insurance plan.\n  In addition to higher costs and the loss of their doctor and health \ncare plans, there is another reason Americans are rejecting ObamaCare. \nObamaCare is not just bad for health care, it is bad for the economy. \nNew health care regulations are discouraging businesses from hiring and \nexpanding their businesses.\n  Earlier this week a CBS News article reported that ``nearly half of \nU.S. companies said they are reluctant to hire full-time employees \nbecause of the law.'' The Hill reported on a recent survey by the \nNational Association of Manufacturers that found that 77 percent of \nmanufacturers cite soaring health care costs as the biggest issue \nfacing their business. The title of the Washington Post article on the \nhealth care law's impact on small businesses says it all: ``Health care \nlaw's aggregation rules pose a compliance nightmare for small \nbusinesses.'' That is the headline of the Washington Post.\n  Small businesses are responsible for a majority of the job creation \nin this country. If we look at some States around the country, my State \nof South Dakota being a good example, most of the jobs, a huge \nproportion of the jobs created in States like mine are created by small \nbusinesses, but the health care law is discouraging them from hiring, \ndrowning them in regulations, and promising stiff new requirements if \nthey have 50 or more employees. I can't tell you how many times, when I \nam traveling in my State of South Dakota--or, for that matter, \ntraveling outside my State but specifically in my State of South \nDakota--when I am talking to businesses, to people who are creating \njobs, investors, the uncertainty associated with this health care law \nand the new costs because of its mandates and its requirements are \nmaking it more difficult and more expensive for them to create jobs.\n  So what are we seeing as a result of that? We are seeing a slower, \nmuch more sluggish economy; chronic high unemployment; and fewer jobs, \nparticularly for people who are coming out of college. Younger \nAmericans in particular are paying a dear price because of the slow \neconomy. When businesses do not hire, the economy suffers. Every \nAmerican who has spent weeks, months, or years struggling to find a job \nsuffers too.\n  I know my Democratic colleagues here in the Senate know all of this. \nThat is why some of them are starting to run away from ObamaCare too. \nDemocrats in Congress may have supported the law, but now that they \nhave\n\n[[Page S8730]]\n\nseen how it looks in reality, some of them--particularly those running \nfor reelection--are eager to distance themselves from it. No one \nrunning for reelection wants to be too closely associated with the law \nthat is raising Americans' health care costs, taking away their health \ncare choices, and hurting an already struggling economy.\n  The American people have spoken. They do not like ObamaCare. They do \nnot want ObamaCare. They cannot afford ObamaCare. It is time for \nDemocrats in Congress to start listening. I always think it is never \ntoo late to do the right thing. I hope that as more Americans start to \nweigh in and start to engage in the discussion about how this is \nimpacting them personally, that will have such a profound impact on \nMembers of Congress here in Washington, DC, that they will come to the \nconclusion that many of us reached a long time ago; that is, this is a \nbad, flawed bill, built upon a faulty foundation that is destined to \nfail, and that the best thing we can do is pull it out by the roots and \nstart over in a way that makes sense for the American people, that \naddresses the challenges we have in our health care system in America \ntoday but does it in a way that does not require the government to take \nover literally one-sixth of the American economy and create political \ncontrol--command and control from here in Washington, DC, over \nliterally one-sixth of the American economy.\n  One out of every six dollars in our economy today is spent on health \ncare. Think about that. There are very few areas where you can say that \ncomplete, total government intervention impacts that big of a swath of \nour economy. Unfortunately, government intervention is impacting way \ntoo much of our economy. As a consequence, we are paying a price in the \nform of fewer jobs, chronic high unemployment, and a slower, sluggish, \nanemic economy, which is making it more difficult for people to find \njobs and more difficult for us to get ourselves out of what is a very \ndifficult economy.\n  My hope would be that before this is all said and done--and I do not \nknow when this will happen; hopefully sooner rather than later because \nI think the sooner we make that adjustment and decide this was the \nwrong course and reverse course and go in a different direction, the \nless damage we will do to people's livelihoods, to their personal \neconomic circumstances, and the less damage we will do to the overall \neconomy in this country. I hope that realization comes sooner rather \nthan later. But I think what will drive it--I have maintained all along \nthat ultimately the only thing that can really change this is the \nAmerican people because clearly we have a President of the United \nStates for whom this is his signature achievement. Unless he starts \nhearing from the American people, he is unlikely to change.\n  We have a lot of people here in the Senate--every Democrat here today \nwho was here in 2009 voted for this. Not a single Republican who was \nhere in 2009 voted for it. That is probably one of the reasons this is \nsuch a failed policy. It did not have input or buy-in from the other \nside. It did not get some of the best ideas coming to the forefront.\n  There was a much better way to do this. Many of us who have been \naround here for very long have been proposing solutions to address \nhealth care challenges that have been rejected by Democrats here in \nCongress.\n  We have talked a lot over the years about allowing people to buy \ninsurance across State lines. Why wouldn't we create interstate \ncompetition? Competition in a free market economy generally, as a \nmatter of principle and as a matter of practice, drives down price. If \nwe create more competition and give people more choices, that tends to \ndrive down prices. That is a fairly basic economic principle.\n  Why wouldn't we allow small businesses to join larger groups where \nthey can get the benefit of group purchasing power and thereby put \ndownward pressure on the cost of health care in this country?\n  Why wouldn't we allow for expanded opportunities for people to take \ncare of their own health care circumstances by allowing for expanded, \nlarger health savings accounts, opportunities for people to put money \naside in an account, perhaps buy a catastrophic policy with a high \ndeductible but tax free. They can put money aside that allows them to \ncover some of those health care costs that don't reach that \ncatastrophic level.\n  What about finally doing something to reduce the cost of defensive \nmedicine, which means we would have to reform our medical malpractice \nlaws in this country and weed out a lot of the junk lawsuits that clog \nour legal system and make it so much more expensive to deliver health \ncare. I talk to physicians all the time for whom concern about \nliability is a major issue. It creates overutilization. You take all \nthis great technology we have in America today, and you have physicians \nwho are worried about being sued. Of course, they are probably going to \nrun duplicative tests. Anybody who is involved in the delivery of \nhealth care in this country knows very well about the cost of \npracticing defensive medicine. There have been many studies done on it, \nall of which conclude that it adds significantly to the cost of \ndelivering health care in this country. There are differences of \nopinion about how much that is, but there is no question that it is a \nfactor in the high cost of health care.\n  There have been proposals. There are a number of my colleagues on \nthis side of the aisle who have suggested allowing people to have their \nown personal, refundable tax credit for the purchase of health \ninsurance and to create equity between the tax treatment of health care \nthat people can get through their employer with that which they would \nbe able to get in the individual marketplace.\n  Again, the principle is greater choice, greater competition, and \ntherefore lower prices. It is a fairly straightforward and simple \nformula when it comes to a market-based approach to how we deal with \nthe health care crisis we have in this country.\n  Clearly, we have programs such as Medicare and Medicaid where the \ngovernment is fairly heavily involved in the delivery of health care in \nthis country. That too is an area where we need to be looking at how we \ncan reform and make those programs work more efficiently, more \neffectively, in a way that hopefully maximizes the return the taxpayers \nget on those particular programs.\n  If we look at programs such as Medicare, there was a good example a \nfew years ago, which was Medicare Part D, which is the only program I \ncan think of since I have been here--or, for that matter, since I have \nbeen following policies that have been put in place over time--that has \nactually cost less than what it was projected to cost. Why? Because it \nallowed for competition. It created a private component where private \ninsurance companies would vie for, would bid for the business of senior \ncitizens across this country when it comes to their medications. As a \nconsequence of that, we have seen those costs come down to a reasonable \nlevel. It actually has cost less than what was anticipated.\n  That is a principle we could start to apply in other areas. There are \na number of things that could be done to reduce the cost of delivery of \nhealth care when it comes to the component of it that the government is \nheavily involved with.\n  But the point, very simply, is that whenever we create more choices, \nwhen we create more competition, it has a downward impact on costs. It \ndrives costs down. So why weren't a lot of these things considered or \nincorporated into ObamaCare when it was passed? Well, we all know the \nanswer to that. It is because the majority party, which had the votes, \ndecided to do it their way. They decided to go their own way, and as a \nconsequence we ended up with a bill, a piece of legislation, and now a \nhuge new program that has been an utter disaster.\n  I think any objective observer would come to that conclusion based \nupon the rollout of the Web site and everything subsequent to that that \nimpacts costs; that impacts people's ability to keep the plan they have \nand the doctor they have; that impacts to the economy, which is \noverburdened with the cost of regulation in the new law; as well as the \nmany--and I say ``many''--taxes that were included in the new law. \nThere were many new taxes included, not to mention lots of cuts to \nMedicare, which, interestingly enough, were double-counted. That was \nallowed to be used as ``savings'' put in the Medicare\n\n[[Page S8731]]\n\ntrust fund, therefore extending the lifespan of Medicare. At the same \ntime, that was going to be spent on the new health care proposal.\n  Only in Washington, DC, could someone get away with an accounting \nconvention that would allow someone to double-count revenue, which is \nessentially what happened. We raised that question many times, and \neventually we had a letter from the Congressional Budget Office that \nsaid: Yes, this is double-counting revenue. You are spending the same \nmoney twice.\n  Yet the majority party had the votes. Around here, it is a function \nof math: If you have the votes, you can do pretty much whatever you \nwant. And that is what they did. We are paying a dear price for that, \nbut the people who are really paying the biggest price are the American \npeople, who are seeing these increased premium costs, increased \ndeductibles, fewer jobs, slower economy, and lower take-home pay. That \nis the bottom line.\n  It boils down to basic economic terms. What we are talking about is a \nslower, more sluggish, anemic economy, chronic high unemployment, and \nlower take-home pay for middle-class America. In fact, if we look at \naverage household income, which is something we use as a metric to \nmeasure people's overall economic situations, the average household \nincome in this country, since 2009 when the President took office, has \ndecreased by about $3,700 per family. There are a lot of things, \nobviously, that contribute to that, but I don't think it is any \nsurprise that when you drive up the costs of something that everybody \nneeds in this country--and by that, I mean health care--in the form of \nhigher premiums and higher deductibles, it is inevitable that you are \ngoing to see a lot of people's household incomes impacted by that. Then \nyou couple and layer on top of that the impact it has on the economy. \nWhen you have a sluggish economy creating fewer jobs, that, too, has a \nvery devastating impact on people's personal economic circumstances and \nlivelihood. So average household income, since the President took \noffice, has gone down by about $3,700--lower take-home pay. That is \nanother of the results and the outcomes and the ultimate impacts, if \nyou will, of policies created in Washington, DC, that make it more \nexpensive and more difficult to create jobs in this country.\n  As I said earlier, I think ultimately what will get us to where we \nreally can change this, change course, change direction, take this \nthing which is headed for the cliff and turn it around and move it in \nthe other direction, is going to be the American people. If every \nSenator, every Member of Congress, if the White House is hearing what I \nam hearing from people in South Dakota, perhaps there is some hope that \nwe can persuade enough people in Congress that we have to change the \ndirection we are heading.\n  I would like to share a few things that I heard from people in my \nState of South Dakota.\n  A male constituent from Sioux Falls, SD, wrote and said:\n\n       I just received notice that our health insurance will go up \n     almost 60 percent due to the ACA, from $718 per month to \n     $1146 per month. We will also lose our prescription drug \n     benefit and office co-pay benefit until each of us reaches a \n     $5,000 deductible. We have maternity benefits now and \n     pediatric dental and vision care, although I am 64 and my \n     wife is 59. This will cost us an additional $5,000 per year.\n\n  For somebody who is trying to make ends meet in this country, trying \nto get the mortgage paid, trying to put a little aside for their kids' \neducation, $5,000 is real money. That is a tangible impact of this law \non the economic circumstances, the standard of living, the quality of \nlife this particular couple is experiencing in America today.\n  ObamaCare is sticking hard-working Americans with higher costs for \nunnecessary coverage. Families were denied the ability to keep their \nplans--the plans that best fit their needs, lifestyles, and budgets.\n  The following is a letter we received from a female constituent from \nWilmot, SD:\n\n       My husband and I have four small children and purchase our \n     own health care. My husband runs his own small business and I \n     am privileged to stay at home. We are very healthy, so we \n     have always purchased a plan with a large deductible, so we \n     can afford a reasonable premium.\n       Today we received our letter from our health insurance \n     provider letting us know that next month our premium will be \n     jumping 232 percent! That's over $500 more a month--and we \n     barely use our health insurance.\n       We currently live in an 1,800 square foot house and have \n     been trying to find something bigger. This jump in our \n     monthly health care premium could prevent us from being able \n     to afford any kind of monthly house payment.\n\n  ObamaCare is cutting into the carefully planned budgets of American \nfamilies, holding them back from the futures for which they have \ncarefully budgeted. This is an example of a family who is trying to get \nby--four small kids--and they buy their own health care in the \nindividual marketplace. The husband is self-employed, runs his own \nbusiness, and the mom has been able to stay home and care for those \nfour kids. They work very hard staying healthy and very rarely use \ntheir health insurance policy. They are going to see a 232-percent \nincrease, over $500 more a month. They live in a 1,800-square-foot \nhouse. They had hoped to be able to find something a little bit bigger, \nand they aren't going to be able to because of the consequences of \nObamaCare.\n  A female constituent from Spencer, SD, writes:\n\n       Thanks to ObamaCare, my monthly premium will increase over \n     100 percent, which equals 45 percent of my monthly income. My \n     daughter lost her insurance, as well. The ACA is not \n     affordable, and if I could tell the President so, I would. My \n     private insurance did change.\n\n  The Obama administration has broken its promise that Americans who \nwanted to keep their plans could. We are also learning that this law \nsimply isn't affordable for many middle-class families, such as this \nlady from Spencer, SD, whom the Obama administration said it would \nprotect when they said: ``If you like your insurance plan, you can keep \nit, period.'' A lot of Americans took that to the bank. Clearly, they \nshould have known better. The double talk coming out of Washington, DC, \nis not only frustrating a lot of Americans, it is creating cynicism and \na lack of trust and confidence, which is going to make it difficult to \ndo big things in the future.\n  A male constituent from Rapid City, SD, wrote:\n\n       I know you did not vote for this--\n\n  Thank you--\n\n     but I wanted to tell you. My health care premium went from \n     $640 a month to $1080 a month. My deductible went from $3600 \n     to $5000. I feel like the federal government has stolen over \n     $5000 a year from me.\n\n  Americans feel betrayed by this law, likening the increased rates to \ntheft by their own government. That is the level of frustration people \nacross this country are feeling. They are frustrated, they are \ndiscouraged, they are despondent, and they want something to give. They \nwant something to change. They know we can't continue down this path \nand expect that any of these families are going to be able to provide a \nbetter standard of living and a better quality of life for their \nchildren and grandchildren. The family has over a $400 increase in \ntheir monthly premium and a $l,400 increase in their deductible. That \nis the effect on this constituent in Rapid City, SD.\n  A constituent family from Watertown, SD, writes:\n\n       You need to know how ObamaCare is harming my life and \n     health care. We were one of the families that lost their \n     health care plan. We heard President Obama say, ``if you \n     like your health care, you can keep it.'' That was a lie. \n     Our new health care plan is going to cost our family \n     $21,600 a year compared to the health care plan of 2013 \n     which cost us $7,335.96. That is a 300-plus percent \n     increase. We are a healthy family of six people. We are \n     outraged and upset.\n\n  Madam President, these letters and calls to my office echo similar \ncomplaints from American families back home in my State of South Dakota \nand all across the country. ObamaCare is costing this family more money \nand denying them the plan they want. That is the real life, real world \nimpact.\n  If you think about it, this is really pretty staggering. This new \nhealth care plan is going to cost this family over $21,000 a year \ncompared to $7,335 today. A 300-plus percent increase for a healthy \nfamily of six. You can't blame them when they say they are upset and \noutraged. Who wouldn't be. Who wouldn't be.\n  This is from a small business owner from Brookings, SD, who writes:\n\n       In the mail today was a letter from my health care \n     insurance provider . . . and, well,\n\n[[Page S8732]]\n\n     guess what? Thanks to the great ObamaCare plan, my monthly \n     premium almost doubled, and my deductible doubled. I'm a \n     small business owner, and I would like to hire an employee \n     next spring. . . . Well, that's not going to happen. When \n     will those we elect to Washington ever do something to help \n     people and small businesses?\n\n  Madam President, ObamaCare is not only slamming individuals, it is \nhitting the small businesses, the job creators that Washington needs to \nbe protecting. ObamaCare is stopping employers from expanding their \nworkforce.\n  In a bigger place, in a big city, this may not have the same domino \neffect or the ripple effect that it does in a small State such as South \nDakota where you have a small business owner, such as this gentleman \nfrom Brookings, SD, who wants to expand his business, wants to hire \nanother employee but is saying that is not going to happen, and the \nreason it is not going to happen is because of this huge increase in \ntheir monthly premiums--almost doubling the monthly premium, and \ndoubling the deductible.\n  I don't know how an employer in this country today, who is trying to \ngrow a business, expand the business and provide for themselves and \ntheir families, perhaps put a little aside to use for the kids' college \neducation or perhaps put a little aside for retirement, deals with the \ndoubling of probably one of their biggest costs of doing business, and \nthat is the cost of health care. You double your premiums; you double \nyour deductible.\n  This is from a mother in Garretson, SD, who writes:\n\n       Next year, our insurance is changing, and I will lose my \n     family practice doctor of 22 years--the doctor that delivered \n     all my children and that has cared for our teenage children \n     all their lives. We will also lose all the backup doctors our \n     family has seen when we couldn't see our regular doctor. I \n     was happy with my insurance, and now I have to lose my \n     doctor.\n\n  This is more testimony from people losing their plans and doctors, \nwhich the Obama administration--President Obama himself--repeatedly, \nover and over, told the American people they could keep. Families are \nlosing their trusted doctors.\n  Whether it is a doctor, a hospital, or prescription drug coverage, \nthese are all real life examples, real world examples of the impacts of \nObamaCare that point to just one thing, and that is this law, No. 1, \ndoesn't work, and No. 2, it can't be fixed. There is no way we will be \nable to address what most people care about when it comes to their \nhealth care--and that is the cost--when we require the people who \nprovide that health care coverage to deal with more mandates, more \nrequirements, higher taxes, all of which are going to get passed on and \npaid for by the very people in this country who are just trying to make \nends meet and make a living and provide for their families.\n  Those are seven examples from my State of South Dakota. I could go \non, because there are many more examples. There are examples from \npeople all across the country. But I think the point that needs to be \nmade here--and can't be made often enough--is that these are real world \neconomic impacts that are affecting every day Americans in a way that \nis making it more difficult for them, making their economic \ncircumstances more complicated and more difficult.\n  What, if anything, should we here in Washington take away from this? \nFirst off, as I said earlier, this doesn't work. Let's start over. \nLet's do this the right way. It is not too late to do that. It is never \ntoo late to do the right thing. We could, if we decided to pull this \nthing out by the roots and start over, come up with a whole series of \nreforms that would move us in a step-by-step direction toward the \nultimate goal, and that is to address the health care challenge we face \nin America today; that is, the cost.\n  I don't think there is any American family, any individual, as they \nthink about having to purchase health care--and particularly if you are \na young healthy person, obviously, you don't want to pay a lot for it \nbecause you are probably not going to use a lot. Yet those are the \npeople who will get hit the hardest. I can't tell you, if you are in \nyour 20s, how much more you are going to have to pay to get health care \ncoverage in this country, simply because the law requires what they \ncall the community rating band be narrow so that people who are \nhealthier and younger are going to pay much more to cover people who \nare less healthy. That is a reality in the legislation and it is a \nreality now in terms of the way it is being applied and being \nimplemented.\n  So we are looking at a lot of people in this country--for sure \nyounger Americans, but Americans of all ages as well--who are looking \nat higher cost because of these regulations and mandates and \nrequirements that are being imposed upon the insurance companies and \nhealth care providers in this country. The new taxes, which I mentioned \na little bit earlier, are also something that ultimately get passed on.\n  When we were debating this, the Democrats argued that we would have \n$\\1/2\\ trillion in tax increases and $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts \nand that was how this was to be financed. It turns out when it is fully \nimplemented the cost is much higher. What they did is they front-end \nloaded some of the revenues and back-end loaded the costs. When the \nCongressional Budget Office looked at it, in a 10-year window, they \nsaid there will be about a $1 trillion cost.\n  When it is fully implemented, and we see the full impact of the cost \nand the revenues together, the 10-year cost is more like $2\\1/2\\ \ntrillion. So it was a massive expansion of the Federal Government--\nliterally the largest expansion of the government in 50 years. It was \nliterally a takeover of one-sixth of the American economy. That is what \nhealth care represents in this country.\n  So if we think about that in those terms, how much this thing is \ngoing to cost--and at the time they said: Don't worry, it is all paid \nfor. It will not add to the deficit--we are finding out now more and \nmore information, with more and more analysis being done, and it is \ncoming to light that, in fact, it is going to cost way more than what \nwas initially expected. I think this is the tip of the iceberg, the tip \nof the iceberg in terms of the cost to the American taxpayers. Again, \nthis is financed by higher taxes, all of which get passed on to the \nvery people in this country this is supposed to help.\n\n  The Medicare cuts that were proposed to help pay for this, many of us \nsaid at the time were cutting hospitals, cutting home health agencies, \ncutting nursing homes, cutting hospices--which is what this did. This \nwas all designed to take $\\1/2\\ trillion. But again, when it is fully \nimplemented, it isn't $\\1/2\\ trillion, it is $1 trillion, when you look \nat the full 10-year implementation. But taking this out of Medicare \nwas, No. 1, going to help pay for all the new benefits that would \nhappen under ObamaCare; and No. 2, somehow--somehow, don't ask me how--\nit was going to be credited to the Medicare trust fund, thereby \nextending the life of Medicare.\n  How do you do that? How do you, with a straight face, say we are \ngoing to take--let's just use the conservative number used by the \nDemocrats on the floor--$\\1/2\\ trillion out of Medicare, use it to \nfinance a new entitlement benefit and somehow be able to say we are \ngoing to credit the Medicare trust fund and that this is actually going \nto prolong the lifespan of Medicare? It was absolutely stunning at the \ntime that we were having this debate and we raised these issues. But \npeople would say: The CBO says this, the CBO says this. That is because \nCBO uses some pretty strange accounting conventions that aren't used \nanywhere else in the world. Anyplace else in the world you would be in \njail for doing something like that, for double counting revenue--\nspending the same money twice. But that is essentially what happened.\n  Many of us at the time, as I said, raised this issue on the floor and \ntried to point out we are spending the same money twice. At that time \nit fell on deaf ears. To me, that is again a symptom of a process that \nis geared to get a result with a majority vote driven through here, \njammed through here, forced through here on Christmas Eve. We all had \nthat vote Christmas Eve morning, and all I can say, as someone who was \nhere and observed that entire process, we tried our best to warn the \nAmerican people about what was going to happen.\n  It is too bad we didn't at the time decide, as we usually do when we \ndo major legislation--major legislation that has enormous consequence \nfor the American people--to do it in a bipartisan way that incorporates \nthe best\n\n[[Page S8733]]\n\nideas of both sides of the aisle and perhaps gets a big bipartisan \nvote. Usually, when you pass major legislation around here, you are \nsort of hoping for 70 to 75 votes, perhaps even more, because you have \nthe buy-in, everybody has been involved in helping shape and formulate \nthat legislation. But that wasn't the case when this passed.\n  Again, I understand. This becomes a function of math. You have the \nvotes or you don't. That is the way this place operates. At that \nparticular time, 60 votes was something the majority had the luxury of \nand didn't seem to care a whole lot about what Republicans had to say. \nThe President was bent on getting his initiative through and getting it \nhis way. Today, that is the reason, in my view at least, we are where \nwe are, with a piece of legislation the impacts of which are now being \nfully felt by the American people, and their conclusion is what I think \ntheir conclusion should be: This is a really raw deal.\n  I can't tell you, as I think about the broader context, beyond just \nthe world and the space of health care when it comes to public policy, \nhow these decisions that are made here, major policy decisions, impact \nthe broader economy. There is no question, there is no debate about the \nimpact this is having on the economy.\n  If you talk to any small business person in this country, anybody who \nhas the responsibility of providing health insurance for their \nemployees, who has the responsibility for hiring and employing people \nand, hopefully, paying them a living wage and benefits that go with it, \nthere is no question this is having a detrimental impact on the overall \neconomy, which continues to sputter along at a 1 to 2 percent growth \nrate. The best thing we could do, if we want to really help the \nAmerican people and really improve the standard of living and the \nquality of life for people in this country, is to first get people \nunemployed back to work; but, secondly, get the economy expanding at a \nfaster rate.\n  We are growing at 1 to 2 percent a year instead of 3 to 4 percent, \nand that has a profound impact in not only the number of jobs created \nbut also the wealth that is created. When we think about an economy \nthat is growing at 3 to 4 percent versus an economy that is growing at \n1 to 2 percent, the difference in the gross domestic product, the \ndifference in the total economic output is substantial. In fact, it is \ndramatic.\n  What does that mean? It means a lot, not the least of which is that \ngovernment revenues are a lot lower than they otherwise would be. If \nyou had a more robust economy, growing at a faster rate, people are \nworking, people are investing, they are making money and they are \npaying taxes.\n  We have this debate around here like it occurs in some sort of vacuum \nor static environment. Republicans come in here, those of us who \nbelieve in limited government, and we talk about doing what we can to \nmake government more efficient and make it cost less.\n  Democrats believe that we ought to have more revenue, more taxes; and \nthe problem isn't that we spend too much, it is that we tax too little. \nThat is a fundamental philosophical debate that we have here on a \nregular basis. One of the reasons, by the way, why it is so hard to \nreach a significant budget agreement: There is a profound difference in \nthe way we view the world and how we get our country on a more \nsustainable fiscal path.\n  There are those of us who believe in spending reforms, lower \nspending, a more limited role for the government and think that is what \nwe ought to be doing. Democrats by and large believe that we just need \na little more tax revenue. If we just raise taxes a little bit more, we \ncould do more here in Washington for the American people. I happen to \nbe of the view that the American people can do just fine for themselves \nif you allow them to keep more of what they earn.\n  The reality is that there is a third way, and that is to grow the \neconomy. We can reduce spending, we can raise taxes. We ought to reduce \nspending. We ought to reform spending in a way that changes this fiscal \ntrajectory which we are on today, which becomes increasingly \nproblematic the farther we get down the road in the future.\n  But in addition to reducing and reforming our spending programs in \nthis country, we also ought to be looking at growing the economy and \nactually making the pie bigger. Because that is a surefire way, a \ncertain way of getting the kind of growth in the economy which would \nallow Federal revenues to go up rather than down.\n  We have seen this over time historically. If history is any sort of \nguide and we go back to the 1920s under Coolidge or to the 1960s under \nKennedy, a Democratic President who understood the importance of \nreducing marginal income tax rates or Reagan in the 1980s or more \nrecently in the last decade President George W. Bush, when you reduce \ntaxes on income and investment, you don't get less revenue. You get \nmore because it changes the behavior of the American people. People \nhave an incentive then to invest, to go to work. That generates not \nless revenue but more and puts us in a situation where we are much \nbetter off, not only in terms of our economy and the opportunities it \nprovides the American people but also to the fiscal track we are on as \na Nation.\n  I see my colleague from Kentucky is here. I know he has some \nobservations on this issue of ObamaCare, the economy generally, and \nother matters before us. But certainly one of the reasons we are here \nis because we have this rush to approve all of these nominees to these \nvarious agencies of government--many agencies which are guilty of the \nvery overreach which has contributed to where we are with regard to \nObamaCare. We have too many regulatory agencies with way too much power \nand are circumventing the will in many cases of the Congress to \naccomplish an agenda that is very contrary to the very things I just \ntalked about, which are economic growth and job creation.\n  But through the Chair, I yield the floor for the Senator from \nKentucky. I believe Senator Paul is here to take up the measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, as we enter into the Christmas season, I \nthink it is a good time to talk about stories to describe sort of \npastorally where the Senate is. So I have a story today I would like to \ntell about how the Senate works--or doesn't work.\n  So it came to pass that the filibuster was dismembered, dishonored, \nand indefinitely detained.\n  With the end of the filibuster came the end of any semblance of \ncomity and compromise on Capitol Hill. The party that never cared much \nfor the rule of law broke the rules of the Senate to change the rules.\n  Senate rules for nearly 2 centuries allowed the filibuster. The \nfilibuster was simply a requirement that 60 percent of Senators must \napprove nominations and legislation. This super majority requirement \nactually fostered more centrist solutions and compromises.\n  In order to change the rules, though, and kill the filibuster, it \nrequired a two-thirds majority to change the rules. However, the party \nwhich doesn't and hasn't concerned themselves with the rule of law \nsimply broke the rules.\n  When the Chair said: That is against the rules, they said: We don't \ncare if it's against the rules. The rules are whatever we say the rules \nare.\n  The best way to put this in perspective: You are watching a tennis \nmatch. The ball is clearly a foot out of bounds. The umpire says, ``Out \nof bounds.'' Instead of going by the rules, you have everyone vote. So \nthe audience at Wimbledon votes that it was in bounds when it was \nreally out of bounds.\n  That is what we have here: We have no more rules and we have no more \ncomity. We have no more compromise. What we have is poison--poison that \nhas been given to us by people who have no concern for the rules.\n  Historically, it has always required two thirds of the Senate to \nchange the rules. But, for the first time, we break the rules to change \nthe rules. So when the parliamentarian rules to Senate Democrats that: \nYou're breaking the rules, they say: No, it really wasn't out of \nbounds. It was in bounds or we don't care that it was out of bounds. We \ndon't care what the rules say. We want our way. We are impatient. We \nwant our nominations, and we want them now. We don't care about the \nhistory of the Senate. We don't care about the history of the Congress. \nWe want our way or we will pick up our toys and we\n\n[[Page S8734]]\n\nwill go home. We want it now. We want it now. We want all of it. We \ndon't want to talk with the other side. We don't want compromise. We \ndon't want discussion. We don't want negotiation. We want our way or \nthe highway.\n  The rules, it seems, aren't binding upon the Senate Democrats. To \nthem, the rules are living, breathing, evolving, and apparently \noptional.\n  We shouldn't be surprised, though. We shouldn't be surprised that a \nparty that believes in a living, breathing, ever-evolving, whatever-\nyou-want-it-to-be Constitution, might not think the rules of the Senate \nare important.\n  We shouldn't be surprised that the party that believes that morality \nis unfixed, unhinged, unchanged, unchained to any constants, that all \nethics are a situation that this party might break the rules--we \nshouldn't be surprised.\n  Is anyone really surprised that such a party with no apparent concern \nfor the burden of debt they are placing on every American family would \nbreak the rules to get their way?\n  We are told they are upset because the Senate just takes too long. \nThey want their way, and they want it now. They want their people \nconfirmed. They don't want to talk to the other side. They won the \nelection. They want their way.\n\n  So now they have it. They have bullied and brayed, and they have won \nthe day. The iron-fisted rule of the rule-breakers has now begun.\n  There will be no return. Are they going to return to the rules \nhalfway, partway? No. I predict they will only go further. If they \ndon't get their way, if they don't get it quickly enough, I predict \nthey will break the rules further.\n  What passed for gridlock before this will pale in comparison to the \npoison that seeps from the hands of those who are careless and reckless \nwith the law.\n  Where the filibuster once created conversation, the iron-fisted rule \nof the rule-breakers will stifle it. For you see, contrary to popular \nbelief, the filibuster actually fostered compromise, dialogue, and \noften results. In exchange for the release of nominations, in exchange \nfor the cooperation of the minority party with the majority party, \noften there were votes on legislation that not everybody wanted. There \nwere discussions, there were amendments, there was dialogue, because we \nwere forced to talk to each other because one side couldn't always get \nwhat they wanted. They couldn't slam their fists down in angry tantrum \nand say: My way or the highway. We want what we want. We don't care \nwhat 50 percent of America wants or what 47 percent of America wants. \nWe want our way, and we want it now.\n  The tantrum used to not work. But now we will live in an era where \nthe iron-fisted rule-breakers will throw their tantrum and they will \nget whatever they want.\n  Contrary to popular belief, the filibuster led to dialogue. Every \nweek, the majority party talked to the minority party. There was a \nmeeting each week in which the agenda for the week was set through \ndialogue and discussion and compromise, behind the scenes, not always \nout in public. But there was discussion and compromise every week, \nbecause the majority party could not rule with an iron fist.\n  But now, in the era of the iron fist, in the era of the iron-fisted \nrule-breakers, why will there be any discussion? Why not just roll over \nthe opposition? Why allow debate? Why have debate? Why have discussion? \nWhy have dialogue? Why have votes? It has been getting less and less--\nas the grip gets tighter and tighter, there is less debate. There is \nless voting. There are less amendments. I don't think the American \npublic likes that. I think the American public disavows this place and \nis unhappy with Congress in general because of a lack of dialogue. But \nthat is where we are headed. We are headed towards less dialogue, not \nmore.\n  In the past, Republicans and Democrats would come together. They \nwould agree to votes. They would schedule them for the week. They would \nagree to dialogue; they would agree to nominations; and they would \nagree to quick and easy votes for noncontroversial nominees.\n  But if there is to be no rules, what incentive is there for \ncooperation? If it is to be my way or the highway--if the majority \nparty is simply to roll over, if they are to beat their iron fists upon \nthe table and say: My way or the highway; we don't need you; we don't \ncare that half the country disagrees with our policy, it is our way or \nthe highway; that is the way it is going to be, then I think there will \nbe less dialogue and less compromise.\n  Historically, the filibuster encouraged a reluctant President to \ncooperate with oversight from the Congress. This isn't a Republican or \nDemocrat thing. This is about the separation of powers. This is about \nthe checks and balances to power. This is about a President who might \nsay--or not say--whether or not he would kill Americans with a drone.\n  This is about using the filibuster to get information from a \nreluctant President. This is about a filibuster that allowed Congress \nto get information and to force a President to say: I will not kill \nAmericans with drones.\n  This is about a reluctant President being asked: Will you detain \nAmericans? Can you put an American in jail without a trial? Can you \nsend an American to Guantanamo Bay?\n  How do we get those answers from a President who is reluctant to \nanswer? Through the filibuster.\n  The filibuster is an empowerment of Congress. It really isn't \nRepublican versus Democrat. The filibuster is about Congress having \npower to counterbalance a Presidency. Information about malfeasance or \ntransparency can be pried from a President in exchange for nominations.\n  Quite typically, holds on nominations were used to get information, \nwere used to force people to testify. Recently, I had questions for the \nnominee for Homeland Security. I asked him: Does the Fourth Amendment \napply to third-party records? This is a big constitutional question, \nand there are answers. I might not have agreed with his answer. He said \nhe had no legal opinion on the Fourth Amendment.\n  I asked him: Can one warrant from a secret court apply to all \ntelephone records? Can every American who has their records with a \nphone company have their records looked at through one warrant? Is that \nconsistent with the Fourth Amendment?\n  And this nominee said: I really don't have an opinion on the Fourth \nAmendment. I really haven't thought that much about the Constitution. \nBut he is going to lead one of the largest agencies in our government \nthat may well have to do with spying on Americans, and yet has no \nopinion on the Fourth Amendment.\n  So what would the filibuster do? Historically, the filibuster would \nstop his nomination. What would a hold do? Would it be petulant? Maybe \nat times. But for the most part, holds were placed on nominees who \nwouldn't answer questions. So if you wanted answers from nominees and \nyou didn't want them to get up there and say I don't recall, 49 times, \nI can't remember, I don't have an opinion today, sir, on the \nConstitution; then you would hold their nomination. You would hold \ntheir feet to the fire.\n  The filibuster, holds, about slowing things down--this is about the \nseparation of powers. This is about the checks and balances. Currently \nwe have a President who apparently thinks he is more than a President. \nHe thinks he has a few monarchial powers. He believes more he is a \nmonarch than he is a President because he thinks he can amend \nlegislation. More than 20 times ObamaCare has been amended after the \nfact. They do not come back to Congress. So what would the filibuster \ndo? What would a hold do? It would say to that President: You will obey \nthe Constitution. We have no way to get him in court on these matters. \nIt is very difficult to prove or disprove the constitutionality by a \nchallenge. The beauty of our Founding Fathers is they separated the \npowers. One of the powers of Congress is the filibuster. It is placing \nholds. By doing that we check a rebellious or an adventurous President \nwho thinks he can take this power upon himself.\n  Montesquieu, who is one of the people we look to about the separation \nof powers, once wrote: When you allow the legislative power to \ngravitate to the President, when you allow the President to take this \npower and he can legislate or do whatever he wants, you are allowing a \ntyranny. That is why Montesquieu wrote you have to separate these \npowers so no one body of people, no one grouping within government \nwould assume or absorb too much power. That is what is happening here,\n\n[[Page S8735]]\n\nby giving up our power for petty partisan reasons.\n  Let's be very frank with each other. The Senate Democrats have, for \npetty partisan reasons, taken away the power of Congress, taken away \none of the checks and balances on a rogue Presidency. These checks and \nbalances are not something we should stoop to the level of petty \npartisanship over. By allowing us to do so, what has happened is we \nhave allowed ourselves to give up one of the great checks and balances \nthat was one of the beauties of our Constitution.\n  The loss of the filibuster truly weakens Congress and it makes the \nexecutive, regardless of party, more powerful and less likely to be \ntransparent and less likely to compromise. In short, when you give \npower to the party in the minority, when you have that power in the \nparty that is in the minority, it works to coax compromise out of \npeople.\n  In the era of filibusters and holds, someone such as myself who is \nnew to the Senate could place a hold on the Federal Reserve Chairman \nand release it in exchange for a vote auditing the Fed. Auditing the \nFed passed through years ago in the House. It is a transparency bill. \nWe should know what decision happened. Congress created the Fed. People \nare getting personally wealthy off the policies of the Fed. There is a \nrevolving door between the Fed and the Treasury and the people who sell \nthe Treasury bonds. There are Treasury Secretaries who leave employment \nin government and make $160 million a year buying and selling the \nsecurities that are bought from a bank that we are not overseeing \nproperly.\n  There are all kinds of reasons why we should audit the Fed. Every \nRepublican in the House voted for it, 100 Democrats voted for it. You \nrarely have a bill that 350 out of 435 Representatives voted to audit \nthe Fed. It has been over here for 3 years. It has been held hostage by \nthe Senate majority. The only way the minority party ever gets any \nvotes on anything is by using their leverage, by using the leverage of \nthe filibuster, by using the leverage of a hold--I think often to get \nsomething good. There are a lot of things that need to be discussed \nthat are never discussed in this body.\n  Whether your phone calls, the records of your phone calls, the \nrecords of your e-mail should be looked at by your government without a \nwarrant, without an individualized warrant, is something that should \nhave a debate here. We are, in the next week, supposed to go back on \nthe Defense authorization bill. The Defense authorization bill, in \n2011, allowed for the first time in our history an American citizen to \nbe held indefinitely. It allowed for the first time an American citizen \nto be sent from America to Guantanamo Bay and held in a foreign prison \nin a foreign land, forever, without charge, without trial, without \nlawyer, without accusation.\n  When I had the debate on the floor with another Senator over this in \n2011, I said, incredulously, you mean an American citizen could be sent \nto Guantanamo Bay without a jury trial, without a trial by a jury of \nhis peers? He said, yes, if they are dangerous.\n  Who gets to decide who is dangerous and who is not? Are these \nquestions we would want debated on the floor? One year ago we voted to \nget rid of indefinite detention; 67 Senators voted to get rid of \nindefinite detention. Then, secretly in conference committee, it was \nstripped out by a minority of one or two Senators. So this year we have \nbeen prepared for 6 months to have a vote on whether an American can be \ndetained in prison without a trial. We will get no vote because of the \niron-fisted rule of the rule breakers. The rule breakers have decided \nno debate, no dialog, no compromise, no discussion of questions until \nwe tell you it is time--and it never seems to be time.\n  You have to think about this because there have been times in our \nhistory when we have detained Americans unjustly. You have to think \nabout how important a jury trial is for everyone and you do not have to \ngo far back in our history to see times when we made mistakes. Remember \nRichard Jewel, falsely accused, unfairly accused of being the Olympic \nbomber in Atlanta about a decade ago. If he had been a Black man in \n1920 in the South, he might not have survived a day. Fortunately, he \nlived in an era when we believed in trial by jury, when we believed \nthat no one should be detained without a trial by jury, no one should \nbe kept in prison without a trial. For goodness' sake, can there be \nanything more American than that? Yet the law of the land says that is \nno longer true.\n  Anybody in our society who ever thinks they have been treated \nunfairly, whether one is an African American or Japanese American who \ncan remember what happened to the Japanese Americans in World War II, \nshould be horrified that our current law says an individual, an \nAmerican citizen, can be detained.\n  The President says: I am a good man and I will never use it. He signs \ninto law the authority for all Presidents for all time to indefinitely \ndetain American citizens without a trial. Yet he says: I am not going \nto do it. That is not a lot of comfort to those of us who believe in \nthe law. I believe the appropriateness or the ability for us to get to \ndialog and discussion is important; that the American people want it \nand that the filibuster actually aided that. I think it aided it. It \nforced us to have discussion. Without the filibuster, I do not think \nthere will be discussion. I do not think compromise will occur. It was \ninfrequent before. I don't think it is going to occur without the \nthreat of filibuster. The Senate will now be run with an iron fist, a \nfist clenched so tightly, a power wound so closely that dissent will no \nlonger be heard. Debate will be stifled and amendments to legislation \nwill become nonexistent. They are already rare.\n\n  Washington described the Senate as the saucer that cools the tea that \nboils over from the cup of the House of Representatives. The Senate was \nthat saucer that cooled the tea, deliberating, gave review and time for \ncalmer minds to prevail. The Senate was one of those items that our \nFounders established to separate our Republic from the whims of an \nunrestrained majority, from the headlong dash of an unrestrained \nmobocracy. I think the public will be burned more often as the Senate \nbecomes less saucer and more boiling caldron. The loss of the \nfilibuster will lead to more enmity and less compromise. The death of \nthe filibuster is the death of negotiation. Why negotiate if you do not \nhave to? Through brute force and a disregard for the rule of law, \nSenate Democrats have found temporary victory--but at what cost?\n  We will now become the other House of Representatives. Will debate \nand amendment then become a thing of the past? Will an iron fist smash \nthe saucer that once cooled the tea? Make no mistake about it, the \ndeath of the filibuster is the death of dialog. All power that is taken \nfrom the minority party is a leverage that is taken from possible \ncompromise. One day I believe those who have seen fit to break the \nrules to change the rules will regret their actions. The question is, \nWhen cooler heads prevail, will there be anybody left with the spirit \nof compromise?\n  All one has to do, to see what happens when there is no debate, when \nthere is no dialog, when there is no compromise--all one has to do is \nlook at the health care fiasco. It was passed without any discussion \nwith Republicans--no input, zero input from Republicans. Why? Because \nat the time, even though we still had the filibuster, Senate Democrats \nwere 60 and Republicans were 40. They did not have to talk to us.\n  When the majority party does not have to talk to the minority party, \nthey will not. So with ObamaCare, with the unaffordable health care \nplan he has given us, there was no discussion, no debate--60 Democrats, \n40 Republicans. We got a bill that is completely and entirely their \nbaby--no compromise.\n  The same thing in the House. It passed by brute force by a majority \nof Democrats and no Republicans.\n  What we have now is something that is completely unworkable and does \nnot represent the American people. I will be the first to admit we are \ndivided. Not everybody is Republican, not everybody is a Democrat. But \nthe interesting thing is it is about 50-50. It is not 80-20. It is not \nthat everybody or the vast majority in the country want it one way or \nthe other, it is almost 50-50. But instead of having 50-50 solutions \ncome out of here, what is coming out of here is my way or the highway.\n  You look back, about 1 month ago when the government was shut down,\n\n[[Page S8736]]\n\nwe were trying to open the government. Every day we tried to open the \ngovernment. We said what about just delaying ObamaCare a little bit? \nWhat about delaying just the individual mandate? No way. We will not \nnegotiate with a gun to our head, the President said. The President \nbellowed: I will not negotiate. You can't make me negotiate. I will not \ncompromise.\n  Immediately after the government opened back up he did exactly the \nsame thing we were asking for, he delayed the individual mandate. Of \ncourse he did it unconstitutionally and illegally because he did it \nwithout the approval of Congress. That is the way it has been from the \nbeginning. This is something that we as Americans should be extremely \nworried about. This is the stuff of kings, this is the stuff of \nmonarchs, and this is the stuff of tyrants because he thinks he can do \nthe legislation by himself.\n  But if there is no recourse to come back to Congress, what happens? \nObamaCare is a story of favoritism, it is a story of dispensing favors \nto your contributors, your friends. Should not we have a government \nwhere your campaign contribution buys you a different sort of scrutiny? \nIt is no longer equal protection under the law, it is protection based \non contribution history.\n  We have given waiver after waiver to special interest groups. You can \nsee them with a big smile plastered on their face when they come out of \nthe White House. There are special interest groups that have been to \nthe White House hundreds of times. Meanwhile, the Secretary in charge \nof putting up ObamaCare and getting it started was there once. But \nhundreds of times special interests came. They paid first. They gave \ntheir campaign contributions. They paid, they got access to the White \nHouse, and they got a waiver.\n  Why would McDonald's get a waiver and not Burger King? Why would one \nbusiness get a waiver and not another? Why would a union get a waiver \nand not another business that is not union? Is that equal protection \nunder the law? Is that the way we are going to live? That is the way \nyou will live if you allow all the power to gravitate to one person who \nhas no checks and balances.\n  That is why we are supposed to have a separation of powers. That is \nwhy we are supposed to live under a rule of law. Legislation is messy \nand it takes a while. They no longer have the 60 votes to have his way \nor the highway. They cannot get everything they want so they do it by \nexecutive fiat. But realize that an executive can dictate for good and \nfor harm or does one person always know what is best for the country? \nSo we have been dictated to, all of these changes with ObamaCare, but \nthe bottom line is more people are now losing their health insurance \nthan are gaining it. Those who are gaining it, those who have been \nforced into ObamaCare, will recognize a few things. They are losing \ntheir freedom of choice and they are being forced to pay more.\n  There are two things that are irrefutable about ObamaCare: You have \nlost your freedom of choice and you are being dictated four plans. \nWhere there was once hundreds of plans you could purchase for \ninsurance, there are four plans left in America you can choose from, \nand they are more expensive. Why? Because you are told your kids have \nto have pediatric dental coverage. What if you don't have any kids? You \nare being told you have to have infertility coverage. What if you are \nnot married? You are told you have to have pregnancy coverage. What if \nyou are not married? The thing is that what has been outlawed is \ncheaper insurance policies.\n  Let's think back to the original problem. Eighty-five percent of \nAmericans had health insurance, right? Fifteen percent of Americans \ndidn't. Of the 15 percent who didn't have health insurance, one-third \nof them were eligible for Medicaid, and we could have helped them by \nfixing some eligibility with Medicaid or actually trying to help people \nsign up. One-third of the 15 percent who were uninsured, some reports \nsaid, were not here in the country legally, and then one-third of the \n15 percent made between $50,000 and $75,000, but they did not buy \ninsurance because they were young and healthy and decided to roll the \ndice and they perceived health insurance as being too expensive.\n  The main impediment to the body of people we could have gotten \ninsured was expense. What have we done to help them? We made health \ninsurance more expensive for them. If you are young and healthy, you \nshould want a high deductible with few mandates. That is very cheap. \nWhat does ObamaCare give you? It gives you a high deductible and gives \nyou a million and one things you don't need or don't want and it is \nvery expensive. Really what we have done is taken away freedom of \nchoice and given you something you don't want and made it more \nexpensive.\n  This is the danger of having one-sided, one-party rule. There is no \ndebate and no discussion. And that is what happened with ObamaCare--a \nlopsided result, a misbegotten legislation that doesn't work, can't \nwork, and is leading to disaster.\n  Some have said: How can we fix it? Can we make ObamaCare less bad? I \nam not positive we can. Some are saying--and the President came back \nunilaterally and said: OK, I will give you another year. Look at it \nfrom the perspective of the insurance company. They can offer the \ncheaper policies for 1 more year. What incentive do they have? You are \nbeing told that within a year you have to buy more expensive insurance. \nDoes the insurance company have any incentive to sell insurance that is \nless expensive again? If you are mandated to buy something more \nexpensive, why would they do something less expensive? Now everybody in \nthe country will be forced to buy something more expensive.\n  A lot of young people will say: Well, it is more expensive, and the \npenalty is not that bad for my income. Maybe I would be better off \nwithout insurance. Besides, now I can buy it anytime I get sick.\n  Other than the penalty--there is no incentive to buy health insurance \nwhen you are healthy other than the penalty.\n  Many people may say: I will just wait until I have chest pain, when I \nam rolling into the emergency room, or until I get in an auto accident, \nand then I will buy my insurance.\n  This is about choice versus coercion. We have one party that has \ndecided they know what is best for you. They feel you are not smart \nenough to take care of yourself. They feel they should be--in a \nbenevolent way--your parents. So you have a party that has decided they \nwill take care of you from cradle to grave, but don't worry, it is \nfree. No big deal. It is free. We are going to give you free health \ncare.\n  Mark my words. There is nothing free about this. You will pay for \nthis. If you had insurance before, you will pay for this with more \nexpensive insurance premiums. If you didn't have insurance before, you \nwill pay for this with more expensive insurance than you could have \nbought before.\n  The question is, How do you make it work? It only works now--if it is \ngoing to work at all--through coercion. You are forced to buy \nsomething. To me, that is antithetical to what the American Republic \nwas founded upon. We were founded upon freedom of choice. You have \nfreedom of choice every day in the things you purchase. Why is the one \nthing you are not allowed to have is the freedom of choosing your \nhealth insurance?\n  Realize what this stems from. This stems from allowing government to \nget so completely in one hand that there are no checks and balances. \nThere are checks and balances between the branches of government, and \nthere are checks and balances between the parties. If you let one party \nget too strong of a hold in Congress, you will get something that is \nnot the product of compromise and not the product of discussion.\n  Also, if you weaken the body of the Senate--which was intended to \nslow down legislation--by taking away the ability to filibuster or to \nplace holds on nominees, once you do that, you are going to get away \nfrom compromise.\n  I think it is important that people know, when they look at this and \nsay: Well, that is just obstruction; Republicans with their filibusters \nand holds are just obstructing the process, if the process is to run \nheadlong away from the Constitution or to run head over heels and \ntrample the Bill of Rights, you would want things to cool off. You \nwould want that saucer the Senate was that allowed the tea to boil over \nand cool off.\n  So the question we really have is, Do we want checks and balances? \nThat is a\n\n[[Page S8737]]\n\nbig question. We have gotten to the point in our history where so much \npower has gravitated to the President--not just this President; \nRepublican Presidents also. This is not a 4- or 8-year evolution; this \nis a 100-year evolution toward a stronger Presidency. We have now \nallowed Presidents to go to war without congressional authority. We \nhave allowed them to trample over civil liberties without congressional \nauthority.\n  We now allow regulatory regimes to write so many rules that your \nelected officials have little to say over what laws you live under. For \nexample, we complained that ObamaCare was 2,000 pages. The Democratic \nleader in the House of Representatives said: Don't worry; you can read \nabout it after we pass it. That was a mistake, and that is why so many \npeople still don't understand this piece of legislation.\n  To top it off, this was a 2,000-page bill, but then 20,000 pages of \nrules were written. Unelected bureaucrats are writing most of the \nrules. For example, when ObamaCare passed, believe it or not, I think \nthe original legislation would have let you keep your doctor, period. \nThere was a regulation written 3 months after the bill was passed that \nchanged it and said: You can keep your doctor, but you have to pay \nmore, and it has to obey this rule.\n  Let's just say you can maybe keep your doctor if President Obama \nlikes your doctor. This rule was not written by Congress. It wasn't \npart of the legislation. This is a rule that was written afterward.\n  About 3 months later, as they are writing 20,000 pages of rules, a \nrule comes up that says: If your insurance ever changes, it is not \ngrandfathered in and you will lose your insurance. It will be canceled. \nYou will be forced to be canceled.\n  The reason millions of people are having their insurance canceled is \nbecause the President authorized this through his bureaucracy without \nthe permission of the Senate.\n  However, it gets more interesting. Occasionally, when a regulation is \npassed, we can try to stop it. So 3 months after ObamaCare was passed, \nthey passed this regulation that says: You will be canceled. Millions \nof people were being canceled because President Obama and his team \nwrote this regulation.\n  One Republican Senator, Mr. Enzi from Wyoming, stood up and said: No, \nwe will vote on this. We will vote on whether your policy can be \ncanceled. So what happened? It came back. And guess what. The \nregulation that says your policy can be canceled if it ever changed--\nthe regulation that is allowing millions of people to be canceled--\nevery Democrat in the body voted for it, including a few of them who \nare running headlong away from the President. They can't get away from \nthe President fast enough. They are running headlong away from the \nPresident and saying: Oh, I didn't know that rule was going to be \nthere. I really thought you could keep your doctor.\n  Bunk. They all knew it. They all voted directly on it. Not only did \nthey vote for ObamaCare, 3 months later they voted for the rule that is \nallowing millions of people to have their insurance canceled.\n  So these Senators who are saying: Mr. President, we might need to fix \nthis, and I have a solution, all voted for the rule. We had a direct \nvote in the Senate on the rule that says: If you like your doctor, you \ncan't keep your doctor. The whole idea when the President said: If you \nlike your doctor, you can keep him, period--which we have now found to \nbe false--we had a chance to fix it. We had a vote in this body. Every \nSenate Democrat voted to allow your insurance to be canceled. So if you \nare one of the millions of Americans who have had your insurance \ncanceled, you can thank the Senate Democrats. Every Senate Republican \nvoted to say you should not have your insurance canceled. Every Senate \nDemocrat voted to allow your insurance to be canceled if it ever \nchanges.\n  While some people have been wondering how many people are going to \nlose their insurance because of ObamaCare, the answer is everyone \nbecause insurance changes gradually over time. So within a few years \neverybody's insurance policy will change and you will be canceled. \nEveryone in America will lose their insurance. They will be canceled \neventually, and they will have to buy ObamaCare. So people went from \nhaving hundreds of choices for insurance to having four choices in \nAmerica.\n  Really what this debate is about is whether you believe in freedom of \nchoice, whether you think you are smart enough to rule over your own \ndestiny or whether you want a paternalistic government that makes these \ndecisions for you. Are we so insecure as a people that we need the \nnanny state? Do we need the nanny state to take care of us? Do we not \nwant choice? Why don't we extend it to all things? Health care is \nimportant, but so is food. Why don't we have the government decide what \ntype of food we eat? Why don't we have the government decide how much \nwe can charge? God forbid we charge too much for food. Shouldn't food \nbe cheap and economical and affordable?\n  Maybe the government should own the farms. If the government can \ndistribute health care and health care is so important, so is food and \nwater. How can we let anybody in the private marketplace determine \nwater? How can we let private people control water? Shouldn't we let \nthe government be in charge of everything?\n  The bottom line is this: We shouldn't let the government be in charge \nof anything that can't be handled by the private marketplace, which \nmeans very little should be handled by the government. The reason you \nwant minimal government is that government is not very good at stuff. I \ntell people that it is not that government is inherently stupid--\nalthough that is a debatable point--it is that the government doesn't \nget the same signals we get.\n  In the private marketplace, you get signals. You have to make a \nprofit or you have to meet a payroll. So there are different signals \nthat come. As far as health care and the government running it, there \nis no signal. They get no feedback. Right now they have a Web site that \nwould have sent any private business into bankruptcy. This would have \nbeen a failed initiation, and the company would have gone bankrupt. No \ncompany could roll out something as bad as this, but no private company \nwould. The private company is influenced by the marketplace, and they \nhave to make good decisions. The government doesn't make good decisions \nbecause it is not required to. That is why when you have a choice on \nwhether something should be done by government or the private \nmarketplace, you want the private marketplace.\n  Milton Friedman often talked about this. This is a truism of all \ngovernment: Nobody spends somebody else's money as wisely as they spend \ntheir own. The private marketplace will inevitably make better \ndecisions because it is a cruel master. In the marketplace, you have to \nplease consumers all the time, every day. They vote. You have heard the \nterm ``democratic capitalism.'' There is nothing more democratic than \nconsumer and capitalism voting every day, and the people who are \nrewarded are those who give a product that people want to buy, and they \ndo it in an efficient manner, so people are forced to be efficient. \nThey are forced to have good consumer service.\n  The consumer is king only in the private marketplace. The consumer is \ntreated as a stepchild if it is government. You are treated with \nreckless abandon by government. As a physician, I dealt with the \ngovernment for decades and decades. You know what. It takes at least an \nhour to get someone on the phone. When you get them on the phone, they \ntell you they can only answer two questions. If they are not in a good \nmood, you have to call again. You have to get on the phone again and \nwait an hour to talk to another bureaucrat who may be surly and may \nhave had a bad day and will probably get a bonus anyway.\n  If you want government to take over your health care, think of the \ncase of Jonathan Beal. He worked for the EPA for 11 years. He told his \nboss that he was a spy and that he worked for the CIA. He took 6 months \noff at a time for years and years. He always got bonuses for good \nemployment, good behavior, and good productivity for 11 years. This is \nwhat goes in government. Would that happen for a week or 2 weeks in a \nprivate industry? No way would that happen. The government is so big \nand vast, they have no idea who all is even working in government. We \nare going to turn that over, our health care system. The bottom line is \nit will\n\n[[Page S8738]]\n\nnot be efficient, it will not try to save money; it will try to spend \nmoney, and it will not lead to us having lower premiums, it will lead \nto having higher premiums.\n\n  Thomas Payne said that government is a necessary evil, and he was \nright. That sounds kind of harsh, but the thing is we need to have \ngovernment, but because government is inefficient, we should keep what \ngovernment does to a minimum. There are certain things we probably \ncan't have private industry do, including a national defense, an Army, \na Navy, an Air Force. Government needs to be in place for that. We have \ndecided with most of our infrastructure to have government involved. We \nhave some private entities involved as well. But do we want government \ninvolved in every one of our affairs? Do we think government is going \nto be distributing goods very well?\n  Think of it this way: Tomorrow we nationalize grocery shopping. We \nnationalize and everybody gets insurance and it will be subsidized. \nWhen people go to Walmart, they will just pay a $20 copay. Do my \ncolleagues think they will buy less or more there? People will empty \nthe shelves.\n  The other day--my colleagues may have heard that food stamp cards \nstopped working and they didn't have any limits; people just kept \nloading up thousands and thousands of dollars' worth of stuff. They \ntrashed the whole place, carts were everywhere, and then someone turned \nthe cards back on and there were limits and people had to leave the \nstore. When there are no limits, people will spend without limit. The \nsame goes with health care. So when government gives us something for \nfree, the tendency is to use it. So what we find, for example, with \nMedicaid--a big part of ObamaCare is the expansion of Medicaid. I wish \nto help people who can't help themselves. There are a lot of people who \nare missing both legs and on dialysis and they have $10,000-a-month \ninsurance. I think we can find a way to help these people. But we have \nnow added able-bodied people to this, generation after generation of \nable-bodied people, so instead of a temporary hand up, a helping hand, \nwe have turned it into something permanent.\n  But it is also the most rapidly rising cost in State governments, so \nState governments, I believe, will ultimately succumb to this burden. \nIn our State it will be a 50-percent increase in Medicaid. In fact, for \nmost of the people signing up around the country, three-fourths of them \nin my State are signing up for prehealth care. It is not truly free. We \nare going to pay for it. Anybody who is working will pay for it. But \nthe thing is that what they are signing up for is free.\n  I think if we expand our safety net beyond sort of those who are not \nable-bodied or we expand it to make it permanent for people, what it \nbecomes is a drag on the economy and a drag on everything and it \ndisallows or prevents us from growing as an economy.\n  We have been having this debate for a while. The President has \ndecided that people who are working just have too much money and he has \nto take from those who are working to give to those who aren't working. \nThat is not how we get more jobs; that is how we make the pie smaller. \nIf we keep dividing up the pie and shifting the pie from those working \nto those nonworking, it doesn't help anybody. It divides the pie \nsmaller. There have been times in our country where we have greatly \ngrown the pie, but we have to get beyond these petty things.\n  The President preaches fear and envy, class warfare. He preaches that \nif your neighbor has three cars, send me and I will take one of their \ncars. I will get some of your neighbor's stuff and I will give it to \nyou. The problem is it doesn't make us rich as a nation.\n  There has been a discussion for thousands of years about whether it \nis good or bad to spend time coveting your neighbor's wealth. It isn't \nhealthy personally or spiritually for our country. If I labor my whole \nday saying my neighbor has a Mercedes and I don't--I should instead be \nsaying maybe my son or daughter will be working at the Mercedes dealer \nselling to somebody who is buying a Mercedes. Instead of feeling \njealous and envious of others, I should be saying we are all \ninterconnected and we want more people to rise and be part of the top 1 \npercent. Instead of taking a meat-ax to those who are successful in our \nsociety and trying to drive them down, we should try--in the 1920s, \nCoolidge took the top rate from 70 percent down to 23 percent. We had a \nboom. Employment thrived. He balanced the budget. We did it again under \nKennedy in the 1960s. Unemployment was once again cut in half. By the \ntime we get to Reagan, the rates had risen to 70 percent again, and \nReagan said our economy will boom if we lower rates on everybody, and \nhe did. He lowered rates from 70 percent at the top rate--the top 1 \npercent. He lowered their rates. He didn't raise their rates. He didn't \nsay covet thy neighbor. He didn't say I will get you one of your \nneighbor's cars. He said lower the rates and the economy will boom, and \nit did. We lowered the rates from 70 on the wealthy to 50 to 28 and we \nhad a decade-long boom with millions of jobs created.\n  We have to have this debate as a country. We can't say the debate is \nover. If we say the debate is over and that what we need to do is just \ndivide it up, pass the money around, we are going to be talking about a \nshrinking pie that we pass around.\n  We also have a pie right now that has millions of people unemployed. \nSo how are we going to grow this economy? Are we going to grow our \neconomy by saying let's tax people more? It is exactly the opposite.\n  I was in Detroit last week talking about how we could help Detroit. \nWe can't send money from Houston to Detroit and bail them out. It \ndoesn't work. One, because it is just like when the President did his \ngovernment stimulus. When the President chose to pick winners and \nlosers, he wound up with a bunch of losers because no central planner \nknows who is going to win and who is going to lose. Nine out of ten \nbusinesses fail. That is why we don't want government choosing the \nwinners and losers.\n  When they do that, they choose people such as Solyndra. One, it was a \nlittle bit unfair on the face of it. The guy who ran the company was \nthe 20th richest man in the country. What business does the middle \nclass--that the President says he is so proud of--what business does \nthe middle class have giving money to the 20th richest man in the \ncountry? It turned out people didn't want his solar panels.\n  But that is the government picking winners and losers, many times \nbased on campaign history and based on environmental politics. It is \npicking winners and losers and it doesn't work. Why? Because the \nmarketplace, when it winnows out and finds who will be successful in \nbusiness, who is a harsh task master, but it asks all of you--it asks \n300 million Americans every day to vote on which businesses will \nsucceed. So you get to vote every day. So there is a big difference \nbetween reducing taxes for those who are in business and trying to \nstimulate the economy and taxing people in Houston, bringing it up \nhere, and then passing it out to people I think might be good at \nbusiness in Detroit. No one knows that. No one has that knowledge. Only \nthe marketplace can decide who is a good risk and who is a bad risk.\n\n  Banks are part of that, but the consumer votes every day on which \nbusinesses are good and should receive more money.\n  So my plan is basically economic freedom zones. Let's lower the taxes \nin impoverished areas. Let's don't tax Houston and bring a bunch of \nmoney up to Detroit and say: Here, you are going to succeed. The same \nthing will happen to that money that happened to the last 50 years' \nworth of money; that is, it was stolen, some of it was misappropriated, \nsome of it was given to the wrong people.\n  But if we are to lower the taxes for the people in Detroit, I think \nwe could truly help them. My plan would lower the personal income tax \nto 5 percent for everybody in Detroit. It would lower the corporate tax \nto 5 percent. We might find people in the suburbs who want to move back \ninto Detroit if their income tax is 5 percent. That is a good thing. \nPeople would pay those taxes. Instead of being envious of these people, \ninstead of saying they might buy another car, I might be saying they \nmight buy that car from somebody selling it in Detroit.\n  The thing is that economic freedom zones and reducing taxes I think \nwould help spur the economy.\n\n[[Page S8739]]\n\n  There are 20 counties in eastern Kentucky that have unemployment 1.5 \ntimes the national rate. A large degree of our unemployment is due to \nthe President and his war on coal. He always talks about a balanced \nsolution, but he doesn't balance his hatred for the coal industry with \njobs. He doesn't balance his so-called like for the environment with \njobs. When we look at regulations, we should preserve the environment, \nand we have many Federal regulations that I do agree with on the \nenvironment. We shouldn't be able to dump chemicals in a stream. I \nagree completely with that. The Clean Water Act says you cannot \ndischarge pollutants into navigable waters of the United States. I \nagree completely. But do we know what they have done over the last 30 \nyears? They have taken that commonsense regulation, which we can \nprobably all agree to, and they now say dirt is a pollutant and your \nbackyard is a navigable stream.\n  So we have actually put people in prison for putting clean dirt on \ndry land. As a consequence, I think we spend less time protecting the \nOhio River and more time meddling with some property owner. We have \ngone crazy with regulations because they are now written by unelected \nbureaucrats. They are not written by people we can unelect; they are \nwritten by bureaucrats.\n  We have to get back to some common sense with these issues. We have \nto look at how injurious this is. Even things that are well-intended, \nwe think, well, gosh we have to protect the bald eagle and we have to \nhave endangered species protected. I agree. I have two bald eagles in \nmy backyard. They have come for the second year and they are \nfascinating. They live on the pond behind my house and it is \nfascinating to see them. But what we have done in the name of \nprotection for the environment and protection for certain species is we \nhave gone nuts with it.\n  In my State, we are protecting the Indiana bat. I had a guy come up \nto me and he said: The Indiana bat? They came up to my property and \nthey took a survey and they found one bat. It was already tagged as a \nbrown bat. The scientists had a big fight. Two of them said it was an \nIndiana bat and the other two said a brown bat, but did they tell me I \nhad to do anything to help the bat? No. They just charged me money to \ncut down trees on my own land. So it isn't about the bat; it is about \nmoney. They charge $2,400 per acre to chop down your own trees.\n  Another city in my State, Grand Rivers, when it rained, the sewage \nwas flowing into the river overflowing and they were overcapacity and \nwanted to have a new sewage plant. They couldn't do it because the EPA \nwas saying we need to know how many pocketbook muscles there are. Are \nwe going to stop the building on the planet? No. What it does is cause \nhundreds of thousands of dollars to be spent looking at this.\n  The bottom line is, remember, separation of powers is important, and \nthe loss of the filibuster I think is leading toward a one-sided party \nrule and leaning toward less power here and more power in the executive \nbranch, I think all to the detriment of the voter.\n  At this point, I see my colleague from Oklahoma has arrived, and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank my good friend from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Since he was talking about the EPA, the overregulations \nthere, I happen to have been privileged when we were in the majority to \nbe the chairman of the committee called the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. It does a lot of very important things in terms of \nhighways and roads and infrastructure. What the Senator from Kentucky \nwas talking about is all the overregulations that come from that. I am \nvery sensitive to that.\n  That is not why I am here tonight. In fact, I wish to talk a little \nbit about the nuclear option, about how this has changed things around \nhere, and it is somewhat of a crisis level we have arrived at. Before I \ndo, I wish to share something on ObamaCare. A lot of things have been \nsaid on this floor about the problems with ObamaCare. I wish to \nelaborate a little bit about that in a minute but not right now. I only \nwish to say that 2 months ago, when my good friend from Texas, Senator \nCruz, and 11 of us were concerned about trying to do something to stop \nObamaCare and we took some pretty drastic steps--he actually stayed up \nand spoke all night--I did not, but I spoke during the evening and \nagain in the morning. But I told a story at that time. It puts it into \na context that people don't understand.\n  The story was this: Keep in mind this was 2 months ago. I said it has \nbeen admitted by Obama and by many of the leaders--even the leader of \nthe Senate--that the ultimate goal of ObamaCare would be the single-\npayer health care system, very much like what was talked about back in \nthe early 1990s when Bill Clinton was President and Hillary had her \nHillary health care and at that time I think it was ultimately going to \nbe a single-payer system. As my colleagues well know, a single-payer \nsystem by definition is socialized medicine, and that was what it was \ngoing to be at that time. I remember talking--and we ultimately did \ndefeat it, but at that time I asked the question, I said: Wait a \nminute. You are talking about socialized medicine. It doesn't work in \nDenmark or Sweden or Canada or in the UK. Why do you think it would \nwork if you were doing it? They never tell us this, but they say it may \nnot work somewhere else, but if I were running it, it would work. We \ndefeated that back in the 1990s.\n  Now, some time has gone by, and we have very much the same situation. \nWe have a system that is edging into socialized medicine, a single-\npayer system. This is what they want. This is what liberals normally do \nwant. They somehow think that government can run things better than \npeople can.\n  So I told this story, I say to my good friend in the Chair. Keep in \nmind, this was 2 months ago. It had been less than a year before that \nwhen something happened to my wife--and my wife is just a year younger \nthan I am--something happened, and all of a sudden she found out she \nhad to have emergency open-heart surgery. It was a valve that was the \nproblem at that time. We did some research. She immediately had open-\nheart surgery. It was successful. She is great now. They replaced the \nvalve, and she is in really good shape.\n  But the point I am making is that if this had happened and we had \nbeen citizens of Canada--we went and checked--someone that age with \nthat kind of an emergency would have to wait 6 months before they could \ndetermine whether they were going to allow them to have that operation. \nIf it were in the UK, it would be 2 months. She would not have lasted \nthat long.\n  That was to let people know that when it hits close to home, it \nreally means lot more, instead of just talking about how many people \nare not happy with the enrollment and all this stuff.\n  Well, ironically, what happened to me 5 weeks ago was exactly the \nsame thing. I ended up having to have emergency surgery. I had four \nheart bypasses. I got to thinking. Just a few weeks before, I had been \ntalking about my wife. I would not be here now. That is how serious \nthis is. Because those individuals who are talking about ObamaCare, \nthey really want a system that the government is running, and it has \nnot worked anywhere else in the world. In cases like mine, I would be \non the waiting list and I probably would not have made it this far and \nwould not have been here today.\n  I only say that--and I want to elaborate a little bit on that \nshortly, but I need to get in something very significant that is going \nto take place.\n  First of all, I do not like the idea of what is going on right now. I \nam very much upset that we had the nuclear option. I think most \npeople--and it has been said over and over on the floor--\nconstitutionally, we have a system that is set up that puts the Senate \nin a position where there has to be a supermajority that will ratify \nthe various treaties and will confirm nominees. Well, the nominees who \nare confirmed are confirmed with a supermajority. Consequently, that \nwould preclude one party from being able to control the confirmation of \nnominees.\n  Well, the makeup of the Senate today and for the next year is going \nto be 53 Democrats dominating, which means, of course, they can always \nget the 53 votes for confirmation but not any more, not enough to reach \n60. So they changed all that, and that is wrong. They should not have \ndone it.\n  So now we are going through this operation, and I decided that rather \nthan to stay here during this Christmas season for the next few days \njust voting no\n\n[[Page S8740]]\n\non judges, I am going to say right now that I am going to vote against \nall the judges, but I am not going to be around here to do it. I will \nsay this though.\n\n\n                            James Nomination\n\n  There is one vote that is coming up, and I am going to appeal to the \nleadership that I hope the confirmation of Deborah Lee James to be \nSecretary of the Air Force does not come up until this next week \nbecause I want to be here for that, and I would hope it could be \npostponed until Monday. The reason for that is I think that is a great \nappointment. I do not remember in the years I have been here--and I am \nthe ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee--I do not \nremember anytime when we have had someone who is as qualified at the \noutset as she is. She has an incredible background for this position. I \nhave met her. I have talked to her. I have talked to her about the \nconcerns about the readiness, which is very serious right now. Our \nreadiness capabilities are lower than they have ever been since World \nWar II. I know she is the right person to be at the helm to take care \nof that.\n  It was not long ago that through the sequestration or preparing for \nsequestration they made a decision to ground one-third of the combat-\ncoded Active squadrons. Now, let's keep in mind that she is nominated \nto be Secretary of the Air Force, so this is something she would \ndirectly be interested in and concerned about.\n  What they did was, in order to--I suppose at that time the motivation \nwas to try to save money. They grounded one-third of the combat-coded \nActive squadrons. That was in April of this year. It was not until 3 \nmonths later that they decided this is not good because you have the \nidle airplanes, the idle pilots. Pilots were resigning; they were upset \nbecause they were not being used. So they reinstated the squadrons that \nhad been closed.\n  General Welsh, a great general, the commander of the Air Force, made \nthe statement, and made it in a very articulate way, that it is going \nto cost us more to reinstate and to requalify the pilots and to make \nsure the planes are back in flying order than just the amount of money \nthat was saved during that 3-month period.\n  That is really quite a statement. It is very serious. He said it \ncould cut the flying hours by 15 percent in the months to come--and it \nhas--as a result of that closure.\n  Well, I have to say to Ms. James that I am convinced you are going to \nbe confirmed as Secretary of the Air Force. I will do all I can to make \nsure you are confirmed. But you are walking into a hornet's nest. It is \na real serious problem there. The things that are happening to our \nmilitary, which I am going to talk about in just a minute, are very \nserious.\n  She has a background. She served with a technical defense contractor \nin Virginia. It was the SAIC Technical and Engineering Sector. She was \nthe executive vice president for communications and government affairs \nand the senior vice president for homeland security. Prior to that, she \nserved as vice president for international operations marketing at \nUnited Technologies. That was all the way from 1998 to 2000. She served \nas Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs from 1993 to \n1998, overseeing all matters pertaining to the Guard and Reserve \nforces. So she has probably as much preparation, background, expertise, \neducation, and knowledge as anyone who has ever been nominated to be \nSecretary of the Air Force.\n\n  I hope we will be able to have that vote maybe on Monday as opposed \nto some time in the next few hours since I want to be here. I want to \nbe one of the first to congratulate her.\n  (Mr. COONS assumed the Chair.)\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me say something about the budget. I try to think of \nthings other people have not talked about. I do not even know right now \nwhether I am going to be for or against this budget, but I had looked, \nand I was very alarmed. The minority staff on Armed Services did some \nresearch, and it came out that there are some parts of this act that we \ndid not know were there. It would include an annual adjustment for \nretired pay and retainer pay for retired members of the Armed Forces \nunder age 62. This penalizes current and future military members who \nhave served our Nation for over 20 years.\n  Now, keep in mind, people go into the military quite young sometimes, \nknowing that the time they would serve would be for 20 years--many of \nthem longer but most of the time 20 years. That is kind of a given. \nThey do this predicated on the assumption that retirement benefits and \nall these things are going to be there. They are making a career \ndecision, I say to the Chair, and that is very significant.\n  To come along with a bill that supposedly saves $6.2 billion--there \nare about 2 million retirees. Of those, just under half are under the \nage of 62. They would see a steady erosion of their retired pay, \napproaching 20 percent of their retirement pay by the time they reach \nage 62.\n  The 1-percent annual reduction to uniformed service retired pay cost-\nof-living adjustment--those are the COLAs--for those under age 62 will \nhave a devastating, long-term impact for those who retire at the 20-\nyear point. It implements an annual adjustment to retired pay of the \n``Consumer Price Index -1%'' beginning in December of 2015. What that \nmeans in summary is that you could have a gunnery sergeant retiring at \nage 42, and by the time he is 62, this bill would cause him to receive \nin his retirement pay approximately $72,000 less than he would \notherwise. So it is a big deal.\n  This has not been discussed on the floor, and I think that as we get \ninto the discussion we are going to have on the budget, we have to keep \nthese things in mind. Again, I have not decided yet because I know it \nis not an easy job. I know we had a Democrat and a Republican working \nvery hard on it. But that is one thing that I believe can be changed. \nIn fact, it would have to be changed before I would support it.\n\n\n                   National Defense Authorization Act\n\n  Well, we went through something, and I want to talk a little bit \nabout the National Defense Authorization Act. Every year we have a \nNational Defense Authorization Act. That act is more important than \nanything else we do around here, in my opinion.\n  If you read the Constitution, it will say that providing for the \nNation's defense is our major concern. This is what we are supposed to \nbe doing. So we have always had--in fact, for 51 consecutive years we \nhave passed an NDAA bill prior to January. It has always been that way. \nThis is a budget that must take place.\n  This is very disturbing to me because the House passed an NDAA bill \nsome time ago. We in the Senate Armed Services Committee, way back--was \nit May or June--we passed the NDAA out of our committee, not \nunanimously but almost unanimously, and it was bipartisan, had strong \nbipartisan support to come to the floor. Well, it never came up. And \nwhy it never came up is not that important right now. The fact is that \nwe are now in a position where we have to do it and have to have one \ncome up, and it has to be this coming week.\n  So, anyway, we put together a bill. There is something a lot of \npeople do not understand because it is not very often used, but when \nthe House and the Senate are not able to put something together, they \ngo to the big four. They get the committee of jurisdiction--in this \ncase, the Senate Armed Services Committee. So they had the chairman and \nthe ranking member--the ranking member is the one who has the most rank \nfrom the minority, and that is me in the case of the Senate--and then \nthe chairman of the House and the ranking member of the House. Four \npeople. We sat together 10 days ago here in Washington and put together \na bill, taking the best parts out of the House bill, the best parts out \nof the Senate bill, and put together this thing, and it is one that I \nthink--when people understand it--it is one for which I do not know of \nanyone who would really oppose it.\n  The problem we are having is that the way it was done was not the way \nit should have been done. It should have been done as it has been done \nin the past; that is, to take about--in the last 10 years, it has taken \n9 days on average to pass this bill, where we have all of the \namendments processed and people come forth with amendments. Well, that \ndid not happen this time. So what we did in this bill is we took 79 of \nthe amendments that people had in the House and the Senate--Republicans \nand Democrats--we did 79; that is, 41\n\n[[Page S8741]]\n\nRepublican amendments and 38 Democrat amendments. These are ones that \nhad been submitted on the Senate floor, and we were able to go ahead \nand put these into the bill.\n  So we have a good bill. It is out there. We really need to do it. \nPeople are concerned about the process. I am concerned. We are going to \nget busy to make sure this does not happen in future years. We do not \nwant it to happen. But we do not want our service people, who are in \nharm's way today, to be paying for the fact that we had a procedure \nthat was wrong. We have a vehicle here. We have a bill. It will come up \nfor consideration. It will come over from the House, and I anticipate \nin the first part of the week we will have this bill.\n  What does it do? First, it authorizes 37 special and incentive pays, \nincluding reenlistment bonuses and certain health bonuses. Here, we are \ntalking about people who are considering reenlisting. Right now they \nare in the service.\n  I mentioned a minute ago some of the aviators. Well, this is mostly \nthe Army and the Marines and the Navy. These people are making career \ndecisions. They make career decisions predicated on what they \nanticipate is going to be out there, and what is going to be out there \nis what kind of a bonus they will get at the time. Of course, in the \nevent this does not happen, they would not be entitled to these \nbonuses, if we do not pass this bill. That is how significant it is.\n  When you talk about certain health professional bonuses, they would \nexpire also.\n  These health benefit bonuses are very significant, because these are \nthe people who are the health providers for our Wounded Warriors, not \njust the ones that are in our hospitals today but also in hospice care. \nWe cannot do that to them.\n  However, if we do not pass this bill, that is going to be a real \nserious problem. There has been a lot of talk about sexual assaults. We \nhave two Senators, both Democrats, Senator Gillibrand and Senator \nMcCaskill, who disagree with each other but who have amendments. So \nwhat we did is take parts of each one of those amendments--27 specific \nreforms to support victims and to encourage sexual assault reporting \nand an additional nine enhancements to the military justice system.\n  Arguably the one on the floor who knows most about this would be our \nfriend Senator Graham. I think he has looked at these and agrees that \nthese provisions are really very significant, and things that are not \ngoing to be there otherwise. These would have been in the House bill \nand in the Senate bill in the regular procedure to pass these bills, \nbut they will not be there if we do not pass this one bill. They are \nthere.\n  Gitmo. I look around the Chamber, and it seems like there is such a \ndiverse attitude toward what we have done in the past and will do in \nthe future with Gitmo. That is Guantanamo Bay down in Cuba. I have \noften said from this podium that is one of the few good deals that we \nhave. We have had Gitmo since the year 1904. It costs $4,000 a year. \nHalf the time Castro does not collect it. So it is a pretty good deal \nwhich you do not often get in the government.\n  It is very expensive to house people there. But it does perform a \nfunction that cannot be performed anywhere else. So last year in the \nNational Defense Authorization bill, we put a provision in there, \nfortunately at that time, that would restore the 1-year prohibition on \ntransferring Gitmo detainees to the United States and to prohibit \nconstructing any type of facility to house them if they are successful \nin doing that.\n  That was not good. It should have been forever. But it expires now. \nThat means if we do not have this bill, we will cede that to the \nPresident. The President will have total control. If he wanted to take \nevery one of these terrorists out of Gitmo and send them to Yemen or \nput them in the United States, he could do it. So that is probably one \nof the most significant parts of this bill.\n  So this restores the 1-year prohibition on transferring Gitmo \ndetainees to the United States, and it prohibits the construction or \nmodification of facilities in the United States to house Gitmo \ndetainees.\n  Our training ranges. This bill provides DOD with access to millions \nof acres of Federal land. Keep in mind, it does not cost anything; it \nis Federal land--for military tests and training ranges that are really \nabsolutely necessary for the readiness of our combat forces.\n  We have all heard about end strength. The Obama administration I have \noften said I think will go down in history as the most antidefense \nPresident ever. One of the things that we know is going to happen is \nthe end strength will continue to reduce. This bill allows the Army and \nthe Marine Corps' top people to make the decisions as to where this end \nstrength is going to be reduced and by what amount. By doing this, they \ncan accelerate the strength reduction and save a considerable amount of \nmoney. So they will have the flexibility to draw down faster, save \nmoney, do it quicker and do it better. Without this bill, they cannot \ndo that.\n  Military construction. You know, no other military construction can \ntake place. But what is worse than that is, on military construction \nthat has already been started, that is new construction, they would \nhave to stop that military construction. When you do that then you come \nback later and start it again, it costs millions and millions of \ndollars more, a lot more money.\n  Here is another good example of another area that would be a huge \nsavings. Right now we are working on several aircraft carriers. One is \nCVN-78, the USS Ford. It is a huge project. It is 75 percent completed. \nWe have already spent $12 billion on it. In the absence of this bill, \nthat construction would have to stop. Now, I know that we would come to \nour senses and maybe in a few months come up with a CR that might have \nmoney that would go toward this.\n  But that is still--when you stop and then start up again, it would be \nmillions, hundreds of millions of dollars of cost. That is corrected in \nthis bill. Not to say anything about the number of people who would be \nimmediately released: 4,300 ship builders who work directly on the \nships, and about 1,500 who work indirectly. So it is an economic issue \nfor a lot of people. That is important but not as important as the fact \nthat it is going to cost hundreds of millions of dollars if we do not \npass this bill.\n  The LCS. This allows the littoral combat ship construction to \ncontinue in the shipyards. That is in Alabama and Wisconsin. Again, it \ndoes not happen if this bill is not passed. That is not going to \nhappen.\n  Special operations. I think we are all familiar with the special ops \nguys. I know the chair is very familiar with that. These are the ones \nwho go out there in harm's way and take the risk and are specially \ntrained. The commander there is Admiral McRaven. That is his No. 1 \npriority--the preservation of special operations forces and families \nafter the 12 years of sustained combat by authorizing various human, \nresiliency and family care programs. In other words, these people, many \nof them have families. The families are cared for in a way that has \nbeen certainly well deserved by the fighter that they represent. Yet \nthose programs would stop in the absence of this.\n  So I think that is very important. Just looking at the human end of \nit, the families, the mothers and the kids that are back there. They \nhave special needs because of the sustained deployments that these \ngreat troops have. I would mention also, that in addition to some of \nthe things that we have talked about in using some of the Federal land, \nthis includes land use agreements to ensure special operations. That is \nwhat we were just talking about, so the special operations forces have \nsufficient access to training ranges, including the Chocolate Mountain \nAerial Gunnery Range in California, which serves an indispensable role \nin training Navy seals.\n\n  In fact, when you go and you watch them, you see that you cannot \ntrain our Navy seals without this facility. So this takes care of that.\n  Lastly--I could mention a whole lot more--one of the significant \nthings people are taking about is waste in the Pentagon. This provides \nfor an audit of the Department of Defense. It requires a full audit of \nDOD no later than March 31, 2019. It will take a long time to do this. \nIt has never been done before. This bill will call for the beginning of \nthis process.\n\n[[Page S8742]]\n\n  We all know about the nuclear triad. The nuclear triad gives us that \nnuclear capability in our bombers, ICBMs and our submarine-launched \nballistic missiles. This bill prohibits the elimination of one of those \nthree legs. We have seen a lot of programs. You could save so much \nmoney if you eliminate the submarine element of that.\n  But in order to adequately protect America, it is important that we \nhave all three legs. So that nuclear triad--and remember that phrase. \nThat is the one where one leg would be eliminated in the absence of \nthis bill.\n  The prohibition on tech transfers with Russia. This would prohibit \nthe transfer of some missile defense technology to Russia and \nstrengthen the Congressional oversight of the administration's efforts \nwith regard to the United States and Russia's missile defense \ncooperation.\n  You know, if we do not do it, the President is going to do it. I \nwould hope that anyone who would be voting in this Chamber knows that \nis a key issue, and it should be a key issue. We recognize, if we do \nnot continue to take control of that in the Congress, then that would \nautomatically go to the President. I do not think we want that to \nhappen. We all saw what happened in the first budget that the President \nhad. I would never forget that, because I went over--I knew that he was \ngoing to be antimilitary, antidefense. So I went over to Afghanistan to \nrespond to it, knowing full well that we were going to have to do \nsomething to let the American people know how bad that budget was on \nthe military.\n  In that first budget of President Obama's, it was 4\\1/2\\ years ago, \nalmost 5 years ago, he did away with our only 5th generation fighter, \nthe F-22; did away with our new lift capacity, the C-17; did away with \nthe Future Combat System, which is the only advancement we have had in \nabout 30 years in our ground capability.\n  He did away with the ground-based interceptor in Poland. Now, let's \nkeep in mind, the ground-based interceptor in Poland is one that we \nwere putting there because we have currently 33 ground-based \ninterceptors here in America, but they are on the west coast. That is \nwhere the threat was at that time. Now things have changed. We found \nout in the year 2007--it was not even classified. Our intelligence said \nthat Iran is going to have the nuclear capability and a delivery system \nby 2015, and 2015 is just a little over a year away from right now.\n  So we knew that way back in 2007. We started building a ground-based \ninterceptor in Poland, with a radar in the Czech Republic. I thought we \nwere doing very well. We had to give them the assurance that we would \nnot pull the rug out from under them if they would cooperate. Then that \nwent out. That was withdrawn in the President's first budget 4\\1/2\\ \nyears ago.\n  Now we are faced with that threat. Because if something comes into \nthis country from Iran, it is going to come from the East. If there is \na lucky shot from the west coast, that is fine. But I do not have that \nconfidence that could happen. So I say that because it fits in with the \nmissile defense. It directs the administration in this bill to make \nimprovements and modernize the ground-based midcourse defense system. \nThat is what we are talking about here.\n  Without this, that could probably--not probably, possibly--be the \nmost significant thing that we have been talking about here, because \nnow we are talking about an incoming missile to the United States.\n  The BRAC process, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission. We \nhave had five of them since 1987. Whether you are for a base closure or \nnot, that is not as significant as it is that we are at a time in \nhistory where we have the greatest need to put back some of the money \nthat has been taken out by this administration into our defense system. \nAs good as a lot of BRAC systems are, the fact is that the first 3 to 5 \nyears of the BRAC, it costs money, it does not save money. That is what \nwe cannot let happen. So we restrict the use of funds to conduct a \nround of base realignment and closures for the coming year, because \npeople are talking about that.\n  Here is a big one too that means a lot. It means a lot to my son, \nJimmy, who is real big time into Second Amendment rights. We are from \nOklahoma. We actually believe that stuff. We believe in the Second \nAmendment to the Constitution, I say to my friend in the chair.\n  There is a treaty called the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty that the U.N. \nhas. I am the wrong one to talk about this, because I have never seen \nanything good come out of the United Nations. But in this case it is \nworse than usual. The UN Arms Trade Treaty is one that our Secretary of \nState has already signed onto. But it has to be ratified by the Senate.\n  Well, in this bill, it restricts the funding to implement the U.N. \nArms Trade Treaty without the Senate's advise and consent on the \ntreaty. Well, that is important. In fact, it reminds me a little bit of \nwhat happened when we had the budget vote a few months ago. At that \ntime, I am trying to remember now, but I think it was 5 o'clock in the \nmorning. You would be surprised the kind of amendments you can get \npassed at 5 o'clock in the morning.\n  So at 5 o'clock in the morning, I had an amendment that said that we \nwould not allow the United States to join--to be a part of the U.N. \nArms Trade Treaty. That was good. But this reinforces that and says \nthat--it restricts it. So if we were to do it, even if the Senate were \nto do it, it would restrict the funding so it cannot happen.\n  So I would say to all of my friends out there who believe in Second \nAmendment rights, who have been concerned that through a U.N. treaty \nyou could lose the Second Amendment rights, do not worry about it \nbecause we would have it. If we pass this bill, you are going to be \nwell taken care of.\n  So I feel very good about the provisions in this bill, I really \nbelieve that, when you stop and think about the fact that we actually \nhad 79 amendments that were agreed to in this bill that we tried to \npass before.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted its version of the NDAA \nby an overwhelming bipartisan majority in June, and yet we know what \nhas happened. We know why it is necessary because this is the last shot \nwe actually have at a bill.\n  The House, at 11 o'clock Friday morning, will go out of session. They \nwill be adjourned for this year. The week after that the Senate will. \nThat shows the time we have to get all of this done. That is why there \nare those individuals who say: You don't have to adopt a bill that the \nfour of you put together. Even though it may be good, we want to have a \nlot of amendments and go through that process. Unfortunately, there is \nnot time because if we did that it would have to go over to the House. \nThey are already adjourned as of 11 o'clock Friday morning.\n  We are out of time and the only choice we have now is either to adopt \nthis or not have a bill at all. As frustrated as I am about the \nprocess, we have a commitment to provide our military men and women the \nsupport that they require, and we have a bill that will do that. If we \nfail to pass the NDAA, it would send a terrible signal to all of our \ntroops over there.\n  I have a card of some of the things that we would lose that I \nmentioned on that rather lengthy list may not happen until next year, \nmay not happen until the first part of the year. Some of them would \ntake place in February and some in March. What would happen is a \nquestion that was asked by our fine Senator Fischer from Nebraska.\n  She said: What would happen at the end of this year on December 31. \nWhat provisions would we lose if we don't pass this bill?\n  The answer is there are several of them, and I will highlight a few \nof them. One would be the bonus for new officers in critical skills, \nthe incentive bonus for conversion to military occupational specialty \nto ease personnel shortages. For those of us who have been in the \nmilitary, that is called the MOSs.\n  The incentive bonuses for transfer between armed forces. Someone who \nis transferred from one area to the other, we have the obligation to \npay his expenses and without those bonuses, we wouldn't be able to do \nit.\n  Aviator officer retention. I mentioned a minute ago that one-third of \nthe combat squadrons were deactivated, they were grounded and the \npilots with them. I talked about that and how General Welch gave us a \ngood documentation. That endured for 3 months. At the end of the 3 \nmonths the\n\n[[Page S8743]]\n\namount of that money that was saved by grounding that equipment was far \noffset by the amount to get people back up to the correct \nqualifications.\n  One of the things that would happen is the aviation officer retention \nbonus. This is to keep these pilots in the service, because it costs \nmuch less to retain a pilot than it does to retrain one and start from \nscratch. I know that. We have a couple of the Rangers in my State of \nOklahoma in Vance Air Force Base where I will be tomorrow. That is one \nof the largest centers that we have training pilots.\n  Our problem is a pilot shortage. One of the reasons is because, as I \njust said, if they are grounding these airplanes these pilots finally \nsay: If I can't fly, I am getting out of here.\n  There have been a lot of them who have left. The only thing that \nwould hold them would be the existing aviation officer retention bonus. \nThis gives a bonus for someone to re-up.\n  If anyone has been in the services, they will remember--as I do from \nthe U.S. Army--that when they are trying to get people, to encourage \npeople to re-up, it is a lot cheaper to retain someone than it is to \nretrain them. We give them bonuses. We did that when I was in the \nservice. That is a bonus they would not get.\n  With already a serious problem with a shortage of pilots, we have to \ndo something about that. That would abruptly stop December 31. That \nmeans the pilots making this decision may not even know this. They may \ndecide they are going to do it and then they find out they don't have a \nretention bonus.\n  The assignment pay or special duty pay, this would be for transfers. \nThis would be something you would not be able to do, as well as the \nhardship that would have to be borne by the military.\n  Healthcare professionals bonus. This is important. If we go out to \nWalter Reed and see the great job that is done by the professionals \nwith our wounded warriors, it does impress people to see what is going \non. I am very excited to see that program has been good. But these \nhealth care professionals operate on a bonus or special pay. That would \nstop December 31.\n  I know they are committed, they would stay as long as they could, but \nsome of them couldn't afford to do that. This would stop on the January \n31.\n  Reenlistment bonus for active members, that would stop also.\n  What I am saying is we are going to have to do this bill. It is \nabsolutely necessary. I am not the only one who says that.\n  If we look at General Dempsey--talk about the deteriorating condition \nof our military now--keeping in mind that with this President over 4\\1/\n2\\ years ago, over this 10-year budget, he has taken over $487 billion \nout of the military, if we have Obama sequestration as it is designed \nnow, that will be another $500 billion. That is a total of $1 trillion.\n  General Dempsey is the top military person in the military. He is the \nchairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  He said:\n\n       But I will tell you personally, if ever the force is so \n     degraded and so unready, and then we're asked to use it, it \n     would be immoral to use the force unless it's well-trained, \n     well-led and well-equipped.\n\n  Admiral Winnefeld, the second in charge, the vice-chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, said: ``There could be for the first time in my \ncareer instances where we may be asked to respond to a crisis and we \nwill have to say that we cannot.''\n  Secretary Hagel, I opposed his confirmation when he was in. Actually, \nI think he has improved so much more than I thought he would since that \ntime. He is not afraid to talk about these things. He said: ``If these \nabrupt cuts remain, we risk fielding a force that over the next few \nyears is unprepared due to a lack of training, maintenance, and the \nlatest equipment.''\n  It is America he is talking about. This is the Secretary of Defense.\n  Another thing General Dempsey said--in fact, I carry a card around \nwith me because a lot of people don't believe this. General Dempsey at \none time in February 2013, this year, told the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee that: We are putting our military on a path where the force \nis so degraded and so unready that it would be immoral to use force.\n  General Odierno, the Commander of the Army, said: Additionally, it is \nunlikely that the Army would be able to defeat an adversary quickly and \ndecisively should they be called upon to engage in a single, sustained \nmajor combat operation.\n  When we talk about a major combat operation, we are talking about one \nthey used to call the combat operations where major contingencies are \non a regional basis.\n  Our policy, since World War II, has been able to do this to defend \nAmerica on two regional fronts. That has gone out the window and we are \nnot able to do that anymore.\n  Secretary Hagel also said: ``If sequester-level cuts persist''--which \nis what we are talking about, the second half trillion that Obama would \nbe taking out of the military--``we risk fielding a force that is \nunprepared.''\n  I can't imagine hearing that from our own Secretary of Defense, but \nit is there.\n  I wish to show us why our choices are down to only one choice.\n  On this chart if we look at December, today is the 12th. The House \nleaves at 11 o'clock Friday morning. They are gone, they are gone for \nthe rest of the year. Anything we do that has to go to the House, they \nwon't be there. It can't be done. We work for 1 more week starting the \nDecember 16, this coming Monday, and we go all the way through the week \nwhere we will be in session. Anything we would do or pass or amend \ncould not go to the House, and that means we would go into December 31 \nwithout any kind of advance authorization. On that basis it is \nsignificant and that shows we actually have to do it.\n  I think I mentioned this. I have a chart, but I don't have it in \nfront of me--show since 1970 we always have had our Defense \nauthorization done before January. The only two exceptions to that were \nwhen they were vetoed by the President on two occasions and we had to \noverride the veto. Nonetheless, that is why this month is the last \nchance we have to do it.\n  I would mention that there is such popular support for this around \nthe country that we have extremes--not really extremes--but \npublications generally considered to be on the progressive or moderate \nside and some conservative.\n  This is one where both the Heritage Foundation and the Washington \nPost say let's pass the defense deal. It has to pass.\n  The Heritage Foundation has an extra paper that if there is time \nlater on I may make some quotes from that.\n  The Washington Post says:\n\n       With the end of 2013 rapidly approaching, Congress has an \n     opportunity to rise above a year of massive dysfunction and \n     prevent major disruptions in U.S. defense operations. The \n     leaders of the Senate and the House armed services committees \n     have managed to fashion a bipartisan version.\n\n  That is what we are talking about when I say the big four, so this is \nwhat we are talking about.\n  Continuing:\n\n       It's a decent compromise that the leaders of both chambers \n     ought to embrace and bring to a vote in the coming days.\n       A failure to do so would be a new political low for this \n     Congress. The NDAA has been passed 51 consecutive years, even \n     when much of the rest of government had to make do with \n     temporary authorities. But much more than political symbolism \n     is at issue. Though defense funding ultimately must be \n     provided by appropriators, the authorization bill extends \n     vital Pentagon authorities and ultimately sanctions new \n     operations.\n       If no bill is approved by Jan. 1, combat pay and bonuses \n     for U.S. troops in Afghanistan and elsewhere would be \n     suspended; work on major weapons systems, including a new \n     aircraft carrier, would be halted at considerable cost; and \n     support for the Afghan army and the disposal of Syria's \n     chemical weapons would be interrupted at a critical moment.\n       The bill also contains important measures to combat sexual \n     crimes in the military.\n\n  We talked about that, but this is being editorialized, not by me on \nthe floor of the Senate, but by the Washington Post.\n  They talk about Guantanamo Bay and they say:\n\n       . . . advance the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison--\n\n  It could take place in the absence of this legislation.\n  Continuing:\n\n       Though a proposal was favored by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand \n     (D-N.Y.), providing for the prosecution of sex crimes outside \n     the military chain of command, it was not included--did not \n     receive a Senate vote--some three dozen other reforms in \n     legislation would make the punishment of these crimes\n\n[[Page S8744]]\n\n     more likely while providing more protections to victims.\n\n  Let me conclude this editorial by reading the next-to-the-last \nparagraph.\n  It says:\n\n       Other measures in the bill ought to attract broad \n     bipartisan support. The effects on defense of the so-called \n     sequester would be eased by transferring money to operations \n     and training from less essential accounts, such as \n     construction and staffing in office headquarters. The \n     Pentagon is still vulnerable to a $50 billion sequester cut \n     in January unless a separate budget deal can head it off. But \n     passage of the authorization act would prevent the worst \n     disruptions of ongoing operations.\n\n  It goes on to say that this is in the House and the House, very \nlikely, is going to pass it, and send it over to the Senate, and they \nstrongly support it.\n  We have letters from all of the Armed Services to us and to the \nleader, Senator Harry Reid. This one is from Martin Dempsey. He is \nurging us to pass this. It is not only me and a handful of Senators, \nthis is the military speaking. He is the top military personnel.\n  He said:\n\n       I write to urge you to complete the National Defense \n     Authorization Act this year. The authorities contained \n     therein are critical to the Nation's defense and urgently \n     needed to ensure we all keep faith with the men and women, \n     military and civilian, selflessly serving in our Armed \n     Forces.\n\n  He goes on to say, ``This is the most significant concern we have \nright now,'' that we may not be able to pass this bill.\n  We have a letter from General Welsh. General Welsh, if you remember, \nis the chief of the Air Force. He is the one who is so upset with the \nfact we had grounded some of our combat squadrons. He says:\n\n       The FY14 NDAA contains critical authorities that enable us \n     to protect the American people while keeping promises to our \n     active duty, Guard, Reserve and civilian Airmen. If this \n     important legislation is not enacted I worry about \n     significant impacts to Air Force operations that could \n     jeopardize the missions we are tasked to perform.\n\n  He goes on to say how important that is; that it is a matter of life \nand death to many of the airmen who are out there.\n  We have the same thing from General Amos of the Marine Corps, who \nsays:\n\n       . . . our hard-won gains on the Twenty-nine Palms land \n     expansion will be threatened, and the construction of the \n     next generation aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, \n     will stop. Passage of the this vital legislation will prove \n     to our Marines and Sailors our unwavering support.\n\n  That is what we are talking about because those are the guys who are \nout there.\n  I see my good friend from Arizona Senator McCain, and I would say I \nhave been talking about the degraded condition of our military right \nnow and how much worse it is going to be if we are not able to do this \nbill that I have outlined in some detail. Hopefully, we will be \nsuccessful in doing that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with my \nfriend from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. First, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his \nleadership and his dedication to getting this authorization bill \npassed. I think my friend from Oklahoma would agree with me there is no \nreason we are where we are today.\n  Is it not true this bill was passed out of the Armed Services \nCommittee in May and here we are now in December just now contemplating \nbringing it to the floor of the Senate?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would say to my friend that is true, but also, over in \nthe House they did it the way it should be done. They passed it out of \ncommittee, they got it to the floor and passed it. Ours was passed by a \nhuge bipartisan margin. We only had three or four vote against it, and \nthat was way back in--I think it was the last of May or 1st of June. It \nshould have been done back then instead of waiting until 1 week before \nwe are out of here.\n  Mr. McCAIN. With all due respect, one has to wonder about the \npriorities of the group and the leader who sets the agenda for the \nSenate. One of the real advantages of being in the majority is you set \nthe agenda. So rather than take the bill to the floor, as we have for \n51 years--for 51 years the Congress of the United States has taken up \nand passed a Defense authorization bill--we are now here in December, \nwith the House of Representatives going out of session tomorrow, and we \nare faced with an unsavory parliamentary situation where we are having \nto maneuver in a way that a ``message''--and my friend from Oklahoma \ncan correct me if I am wrong--a message that cannot be amended, \notherwise it would have to go back to the other body, which is going \nout of session, which would then take us into January.\n  I ask my friend from Oklahoma: Isn't that where we are, and isn't \nthat a commentary on the concern my friends on the other side of the \naisle, the majority leader, has about the men and women who are serving \nin the military?\n  We will talk a little about what a failure to pass a Defense \nauthorization bill is. But we are now in a situation which is a \ndisservice not only to the men and women who are serving but to all of \nus--to every one of the 100 Senators--because every one of these \nSenators would want to have an amendment to make this bill better and \nthat will impart to the rest of the body their knowledge, their \nexpertise, and their priorities. So what are we doing? We are asking \nMembers on this side of the aisle and the other side of the aisle to \naccept a piece of legislation without a single amendment to it. That, \nmy friends, when we are talking about the defense of this Nation, is \nabsolutely outrageous.\n  Would my friend from Oklahoma agree?\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is right up here. It shows the House, on Friday, at 11 \no'clock, is out of here. They are gone. They are adjourned. If \nsomething should happen--we were to amend something--they are not \nthere. So it can't be done. This is where we are now. We only have \nthese 5 days that are left.\n  A lot of people have said--and I would ask my friend from Arizona if \nhe agrees with this--well, we can come back in January and do this. But \nthen look at this. We come back on the 6th of January, and the CR--the \ncontinuing resolution--is here. I can assure you, from past experience, \nthat will dominate the floor. They are certainly not going to have time \nto do it. So the only shot we have is up here.\n  But also important, I read a list of things before my good friend \ncame in, that expire on December 31, and those are things that are \nhappening right now to all of our pilots. My colleague certainly knows \nabout that. They have bailed out. They are gone now. They are so upset \nwith what is happening with the grounding of our squadrons. If we take \naway their reenlistment incentive, are we going to have any pilots \nleft?\n  Mr. McCAIN. So we have established, by the calendar and by what has \nhappened since May, that, obviously, the majority and the majority \nleader had a higher priority for whatever the hell it is we did rather \nthan the defense of this Nation. That is a fact. I would challenge \nanyone on the other side of the aisle to come and argue differently. It \nis outrageous.\n  Now that we have established that, could I ask my friend what \nhappens--and I know he has gone through it--what happens to the men and \nwomen in our military if we do wait until January, if we do wait until \nFebruary or March or don't act at all?\n  For example, one of the best examples I have seen is that right now a \nmarried sergeant in the U.S. military who is serving as a helicopter \ncrew chief in Afghanistan, beginning on the 1st of January--\nplease correct me if I am wrong--will lose $890 a month; is that \ncorrect?\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So we send people into combat, and while we dither around \nhere we are going to keep the men and women who are serving in harm's \nway from getting the benefits they have earned and deserve and are \ntheirs by law. But we are not going to act, at least until January, \nperhaps.\n  I know the Senator from Oklahoma has gone on with a very long list \nabout the completion of ships, about the health programs, and about a \nnumber of other issues, but I wish to focus for 1 minute on one area \nwith my friend from Oklahoma.\n  I think all my colleagues are aware, and the American people are \naware, there is a serious issue in the U.S. military. It is a very \nserious issue and it is the issue of sexual assaults. It is the\n\n[[Page S8745]]\n\nissue the Senator from Oklahoma has spent untold hours in discussions \nand debate and learning about this issue because it is a terrible thing \nthat is going on in our military today.\n  Under the leadership of the Senator from Oklahoma and the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, Senator Levin, we have--and \nwith the participation of every member of the committee, under their \nleadership--come up with a way to, at least to a significant degree, \naddress this problem in the military.\n  There are still some controversial aspects of it that are not \nnecessarily either side of the aisle but just a different viewpoint. \nBut I would argue and ask my friend from Oklahoma, is it not true that \nwe have made significant improvements in the Defense authorization bill \non the issue of sexual assaults?\n  These changes, after hearings, after debate, after discussion were \nput into law and they were agreed to as being very necessary measures \nto try to bring this terrible situation of sexual assaults in the \nmilitary under control. I ask my colleague from Oklahoma if this isn't, \namong many others, an issue that needs to be addressed.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I respond to my friend that it was addressed in the House \nbill and in the Senate bill, but the Senate bill didn't pass, so this \nis all that is left. Specifically, 10 days ago, we were meeting and \nputting this together--the big four, as they call it. It had 27 \nspecific reforms in this area to support victims, to encourage sexual \nassault reporting, and, in addition, nine enhancements to the military \njustice system.\n  I mentioned our good friend from South Carolina, who is probably the \nexpert in this area, and we consulted him, along with a lot of the \nother people, both Senator Gillibrand and Senator McCaskill had \namendments and we have bits out of each one of those amendments they \nhad. They are both better off than they were before. But without this, \nwe got nothing--no changes at all.\n  So we have made great progress in this bill in the sexual assaults, \nas well as I mentioned Gitmo too which is a very controversial issue.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Would the Senator agree that even though there is \nsignificant difference between Senator Gillibrand and Senator \nMcCaskill, they were in agreement with the many provisions my colleague \njust pointed out, which, whether we address their disagreements or not, \nthey were both agreed these are very important measures they both agree \non, that the entire committee agreed on in addressing this issue of \nsexual assaults in the military.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is exactly right. As you point out, they were apart \non a lot of issues, but what we did was to take those areas that will \nimprove the situation and adopted them, and they are a part of this \nbill. So the whole issue of sexual harassment will not be addressed at \nall in the absence of this legislation. Of two of the very significant \nprovisions that are here, certainly that is one of them.\n  I mentioned a minute ago the other one. I know we have had \ndifferences of opinion between us on the whole Gitmo thing. Yet we have \na provision in there now that I think satisfies us both until we all \nhave time to sit down and work these things out.\n  The bottom line is this: We have things where it would cost huge \namounts of money. If you just take the CVN-78, they would have to stop \nconstruction, after we have already spent $12 billion, and after it is \n75 percent done. That cost would be tremendous, especially when we all \nknow we will go back and reinstate it. But this wouldn't be just \nmillions, it would be hundreds of millions of dollars. That is what is \ngoing to happen if we don't pass this bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I know long ago both the Senator from Oklahoma and I \nserved in the military, which is not too relevant anymore, but both of \nus keep track of the military. We visit our military installations, and \nwe spend time with the men and women who are serving both here and \noverseas. We are in communication with them. It is part of our \nprivileges as their representatives, whether they happen to be in our \nhome State or serving overseas in harm's way. When you talk to these \nyoung people--and they are the bravest of the brave and we all know the \nbest of America--they do not understand why, when they are serving in \ncombat and they are entitled to some additional pay because of being in \ndanger, that will not happen. They do not understand why the bonus of \nspecial duty and incentive pay will lapse. They don't understand why \nthat should happen. They do not understand why we are not addressing \nthe issue of sexual assaults in the military. Many of them are deeply \nconcerned about that.\n  By the way, I would also add--and I think my friend from Oklahoma \nwill agree--this issue impacts on recruiting the most highly qualified \nyoung Americans.\n  So here we are on December 12 and we have still not completed our \nduty, our obligation to the men and women who are serving. They rely on \nus. They rely on us to take care of them. They rely on us to provide \nthem with the weapons and the capabilities and the pay and benefits and \nto take care of their families. They rely on us. I am getting feedback \nfrom them that they are now beginning to believe we don't care that \nmuch. Frankly, I can't argue with that because why are we here in \nDecember? Why are we here in December? The fiscal year ended on 1 \nOctober. They ask: Why is it that you in Congress can't act to provide \nus with the tools we need to carry out our mission of defending the \nNation?\n  Frankly, I don't have a very good answer, but maybe the Senator from \nOklahoma does.\n  Mr. INHOFE. My colleague is fully aware, because no one has spent \nmore time over in these areas of hostility than my good friend from \nArizona, that when you talk to these guys, and you sit in the mess hall \nwith them, one of the things--and we know this is true because we have \nboth had experience in the military--they are talking about is their \ncareers.\n  They are talking about their careers. Right now our retention is as \ngood as it has ever been. What is going to happen to our retention if \nall of a sudden we renege on the reenlistment bonuses that they all \ndepend upon? They all talk to each other. About the time that stops on \nDecember 31, I have great fear over what is going to happen to our \nretention rate.\n  I talked about in the very beginning about what has happened in the \nmilitary in the last 4\\1/2\\ years, and I read all of the statements \nfrom our commanders, from Dempsey, and actually even the Secretary of \nDefense, talking about what a crisis it is. They all said it is much \nmore of a crisis if we don't pass this bill. This isn't going to help \nus like it should. We should be in much better shape than this even if \nwe pass it. But we have to pass this or all those things we talked \nabout which are going to be affecting our troops directly are going to \ntake place.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I finally say to my friend, I thank him for his \nleadership. I thank him for his willingness to really short circuit \nwhat should have been a 2- or 3-week exercise, where every Member of \nthe Senate would have had the opportunity to propose amendments, to \ndebate those amendments.\n  My colleague just mentioned the issue of detainees which is still \nsomething that deserves great scrutiny by this body. The issue of \nsurveillance is clearly one that needs debate and discussion on the \nfloor of the Senate. There are so many issues that we are not \ndiscussing in the slightest because we are now entrapped by a process \nwhich doesn't allow us to pass a single amendment to this absolutely \nvital piece of legislation.\n  I thank my friend from Oklahoma for understanding that even though we \nare placed in this incredibly unsavory situation where we are not able, \nevery Member of the Senate who chooses to--and as the Senator from \nOklahoma knows well, when we consider the Defense authorization bill, \nthere are literally hundreds of amendments that we consider because of \nthe interest and the commitment that all of our colleagues have. We are \nnot going to be able to do that this time. But it seems to me too, at \nleast we ought to get the bill passed so we can get our Defense \nDepartment and the men and women who are serving in it in the kind of \ncondition they deserve.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank my friend from Arizona for coming down and \nshowing what a traumatic situation we have right now. I hope two things \ncome from this. First of all, that we go ahead and\n\n[[Page S8746]]\n\npass the NDA bill and then make sure that next year we are there to \nmake sure this doesn't happen again in the same way it has happened.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have some testimonials printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Oklahomans Are Hit Hard by ObamaCare\n\n       It took me three days to sign up for ObamaCare due to \n     website glitches. When I finally got through, I saw my own \n     premium rise 20% and my out of pocket costs go up. But this \n     is nothing compared to what Oklahomans are experiencing. In \n     just a week's time, I received more than 400 stories from my \n     constituents impacted by ObamaCare.\n       Julia in Broken Arrow said that to keep her family's \n     current plan, they will pay an additional $1,400 in premiums \n     and another $4,000 out-of-pocket.\n       Lloyd, from Tecumseh, says he is dropping his current \n     insurance and choosing to pay the penalty after learning his \n     monthly premium will jump from $592 to $1,952.\n       Stacy, a mother of three in Oklahoma City, shared with me \n     that her family's health insurance premiums will increase \n     20%, with an additional $6,000 in out of pocket costs per \n     person, up to $18,000.\n       Joy of Oklahoma City said her family's deductible is \n     increasing by $2,000 and they will have to pay out of pocket \n     for prescriptions. This will create significant financial \n     difficulties for them as her husband is battling cancer.\n       Greg and his family, who live in Oklahoma City, are worried \n     about having to choose between making a monthly mortgage \n     payment of $1,100 or an insurance payment of $1,197.\n       Jim, with employer coverage in Choctaw, is facing a \n     deductible increase of $4,000.\n       Janice is currently on a COBRA plan in Sapulpa. On a new \n     exchange plan, she will be paying $240 more each month.\n       Paul, who says he is in good health and rarely requires a \n     visit to the doctor's office, will be paying $70 per month.\n       Ralph, who has employer-based insurance in Durant, will pay \n     $80 more each month.\n       David from Owasso let me know his family's premium and \n     deductible will increase by $318 a month and $500, \n     respectively.\n       Linda in Pryor says ObamaCare has doubled her deductible \n     and increased her out of pocket costs by 30%.\n       Darrell, who has a group plan in Cashion, is expecting his \n     premiums to go up 40% and his deductible to double.\n       Ed, a widow in Oklahoma City, will be paying $250 more in \n     premiums every month.\n       Linda, from Chelsea, says her family's deductible has \n     increased $700.\n       Roger, who is on a fixed income in Comanche, says his \n     premiums have doubled.\n       Peggy in Boise City said her deductible has increased 250%.\n       An employer in Tulsa says he must choose between a 128% \n     premium increase or a 500% increase in deductible for his \n     staff.\n       A small business owner in Oklahoma City reports that the \n     cost of the insurance he provides to his employees has gone \n     up 41% and will cost him $1,000 per month more. Because of \n     the mandate to have insurance, more of his employees are now \n     electing coverage, which will drive his costs up even more.\n       A family of four in Shawnee is facing a 20% increase in \n     premiums and a $1,500 increase in deductible.\n       A single father of two and small business owner in Lawton \n     says he will be paying 24% more in monthly premiums.\n       A family of three in Miami is choosing to go without \n     insurance and pay the penalty rather than see their premium \n     double and deductible increase by $3,200.\n       Nancy from Oklahoma City said she probably should be one to \n     support Obamacare due to her income, but can't because ``it \n     is not the right answer''. She believes the government \n     doesn't have the right to tell her how to live or define what \n     is ``affordable'' for her.\n       Sharon from Oklahoma City went onto the website. Despite \n     entering in her full name, social security number and \n     address, her identity was not able to be verified. She said \n     she spent 5 weeks trying to get someone to assist her and at \n     this rate she is ready to give up and pay the fine.\n       Erin from Beggs is a wife and a mother of three. She was \n     dropped from her insurance company and instructed to enroll \n     in Obamacare. She has tried to access the website since it \n     was ``fixed'' and has not been able to get past the first \n     step. She is repeatedly kicked off and has to re-enter her \n     information every time she goes on the site.\n       Janice from Sapulpa spent over 40 hours attempting \n     unsuccessfully to apply for insurance on Healthcare.gov. She \n     finally asked for them to send her a paper application and \n     when it arrived, it was in Spanish.\n       The OKC Chamber of Commerce can no longer offer insurance \n     plans to its members since the plans don't meet mandated \n     requirements, impacting 1,400 businesses.\n       A 50-year-old female from Chandler said she and her husband \n     were dropped from their insurance plan. The plan offered to \n     her now includes maternity care and pediatric dental care--\n     neither of which she needs--and will cost over 200% more per \n     month.\n       Cyndee of Suphur lost her family's insurance plan while she \n     was still in a critical time frame for treating her cancer. \n     She called this a ``scary'' experience. She had this plan for \n     10 years until ObamaCare deemed it unworthy. Cyndee wrote to \n     me about her new plan under ObamaCare and said: ``No one \n     wants affordable insurance more than me, but at $1,100 a \n     month, just for me--one person--it's certainly not \n     affordable.''\n       A married father of two from Muskogee was also dropped from \n     his insurance plan. The plan offered to him as comparable in \n     coverage would cost him and his family 46% more than what \n     they used to pay.\n       Another male, from Edmond, was dropped from his employer \n     sponsored health care. The plan he had through his employer \n     provided him with a 75% employer subsidy on his deductible \n     and covered 100% of his medical bills.\n       Rockey from Enid said he and his wife's hours were cut at \n     work to 25 hours a week because of the employer mandate. Now \n     that they work part time, they are no longer eligible for \n     coverage through their employer and Obamacare is not \n     affordable for them.\n       Jessie from Moore said her husband's employer is \n     considering dropping spouse and dependent coverage due to the \n     rising costs of health insurance.\n       Debbie of Frederick said she is fortunate enough to still \n     have insurance through her employers, but because of mandates \n     in the Act, their family doctor of 30 years has had to \n     eliminate hospital visits from his services. Any time Debbie \n     is in the hospital, the doctor who knows her health the best \n     can no longer be on the front lines of helping make health \n     decisions with her in the most crucial circumstances.\n       Donna from Elgin said not only have her insurance costs \n     gone up, but two of her doctors have left their practice. She \n     cannot afford the new health insurance, and is having \n     troubling finding new doctors.\n       Roderick from Shawnee said within a three-month period, \n     three of his doctors have chosen to retire. He is worried \n     about finding new doctors his insurance will cover.\n       This is devastating. We absolutely need to bring the cost \n     of healthcare down, but ObamaCare is clearly doing the \n     opposite. My colleagues and I have supported common-sense \n     ideas like purchasing insurances across state lines or \n     enacting tort reform. We could have started here, but \n     instead, President Obama forced America down a destructive \n     path that will likely end in a single-payer option. We must \n     repeal ObamaCare and put common sense healthcare reform in \n     its place. I'll continue this fight to ensure Oklahomans have \n     quality, affordable health care options.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, as we consider some of the nominations \nbefore us, we are reminded that one of the reasons we have all these \nproblems around the country associated with ObamaCare and all our \nconstituents are being impacted in such a negative way by higher \npremiums, higher deductibles, higher taxes, and fewer jobs is because \nof the overreach of government.\n  This is a perfect opportunity for us to discuss the fact that \noverreaching government--in this case, government which has literally \ntaken over one-sixth of our economy--is causing great harm to the \nAmerican people and that there is a much better approach most of us \nhere advocated when this was debated. Of course, at the time we didn't \nhave the votes. This was passed in a party-line, partisan way and, as a \nconsequence, we are seeing now the results and the impact on the \nAmerican people, all of which are very harmful to their own economic \ncircumstances.\n  I have a personal example from the emails and letters coming into my \noffice of the adverse impact of ObamaCare. This comes from a female \nconstituent of mine in Wilmot, SD. She writes:\n\n       My husband and I have four small children and purchase our \n     own health care.\n       My husband runs his own business and I am privileged to \n     stay at home.\n       We are very healthy, so we have always purchased a plan \n     with a large deductible, so we can afford a reasonable \n     premium.\n       Today we received our letter from our health insurance \n     provider letting us know that next month our premium will be \n     jumping 232 percent! That's over $500 more a month--and we \n     barely use our health insurance.\n       We currently live in an 1,800 square foot house and have \n     been trying to find something bigger. This jump in our \n     monthly health care premium could prevent us from being able \n     to afford any kind of monthly house payment.\n       . . . ObamaCare is cutting into the carefully-planned \n     budgets of American families, holding them back from the \n     futures for which they have carefully budgeted.\n\n  This is just one example of the harmful economic impact ObamaCare is \nhaving on countless Americans from my State of South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I realize Democrats want to deflect \nattention of the impact of ObamaCare from our constituents. That is one \nof\n\n[[Page S8747]]\n\nthe reasons we are having these nominee votes. But our constituents \nhave the right to be heard, so I wish to share some thoughts from a \nconstituent of mine in Owensboro, Cheryl Russell. Here is what she \nwrote:\n\n       We got a letter from our insurance company saying our \n     current policy will not meet the affordable care act, which \n     means it will go away.\n       According to our insurance company, we will have to take \n     pediatric dental and vision insurance, [even though] we don't \n     have kids.\n       They said it was because of ObamaCare. . . .\n\n  She goes on:\n\n       Another plan . . . will cost us over $150.00 more a month \n     plus our deductible goes up to $5700.\n       Please keep taking a stand against Obama Care . . . not \n     only are we going to lose our insurance, but when we go to a \n     different policy we have to pay more. . . .\n       We are 58 & 56 years old. We will have to work the rest of \n     our lives just to pay for our insurance. . . .\n       This isn't fair and it isn't right.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I wish to share a couple letters I received \njust today.\n  I was talking earlier in the day on some of these situations and \nagain what happens when one side thinks they can do whatever they want \nto do and the consequences of that.\n  This letter is from Paul from East Prairie, MO, in the Missouri \nbootheel:\n\n       Upon hearing the potential changes coming January 1st, I \n     decided to investigate the stories I heard. I learned that in \n     2014 my family's premium would go from $597/mo with two $5000 \n     deductibles to $1119/mo with two $4300 deductibles. My \n     cheapest option is $1,085.00/mo with a $12,700 deductible.\n       Not only was this unaffordable, it was pointless to have \n     insurance.\n\n  Certainly, I agree with that. If your deductible is $12,700 and you \nare paying over $1,000 every month to get insurance, what is that? It \nis certainly not affordable health care.\n  Here is a letter from Tom in St. Louis, who said:\n\n       My company is a great company to work for, but \n     unfortunately our health insurance policy went from $490 to \n     $690/month. That is $200/month that I can't put towards my \n     kids' education. That is a lot of money for a working guy to \n     come up with every month. My co-workers are struggling with \n     this increase too. I will look into all the options available \n     and hope we do not have doctor changes. We are familiar with \n     the plan we had and we liked it.\n\n  A third one from Sherri in Holts Summit, MO. She had a preexisting \ncondition and was in the high-risk pool. She said:\n\n       I saw the price, the co-pays and the deductibles and I \n     can't afford it.\n       So it looks like I will suffer on and have even less money \n     while having a policy I won't be able to afford to use.\n\n  We are getting those letters every hour of every day. I think it is \nnot what the American people thought they were going to get.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there is more wrong with the Affordable \nCare Act than just the Web site not working. In fact, the Web site is \njust a symptom of bigger problems.\n  Similar to my colleagues, I wish to share the problems Iowans have \nwith the Affordable Care Act. So I come to the floor today to share \njust one of hundreds of emails, letters, and phone calls from my \nconstituents in Iowa expressing sticker shock about the Affordable Care \nAct.\n  A working mother in Decorah, IA, who lost her employer-sponsored \ncoverage for her family because of rising costs, wrote to me and said \nthe following:\n\n       . . . comparable plans do not seem to exist on the \n     healthcare exchange. The closest we can come (and still see \n     our own doctors) cost almost $1050 per month. This represents \n     a 247% increase in cost over our prior employer provided \n     plan--and with much higher deductibles!\n       My husband is a self-employed small business owner. We \n     covered our family of 4 on my group health plan, which \n     includes a 21 year old adult daughter in college, who is not \n     a legal tax dependent. If we receive any `subsidy', it will \n     be insignificant in relation to the total jump in our out of \n     pocket costs related to the so called ``Affordable Care \n     Act''.\n       The general public seems to believe that anyone who does \n     not qualify for premium subsidies can easily afford a premium \n     increase--no matter how outrageous. Yet an increase of almost \n     250% in our personal cost of providing an inferior policy for \n     our family--which represents an increase in costs of roughly \n     20% of our gross income--can only be described as an absolute \n     disaster.\n\n  I think this email from a real person who is really living this train \nwreck of a health care law speaks for itself.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, part of our job as Members of the U.S. \nSenate is to help people who have problems. This has been a very \ndifficult time for many Americans and difficult for me as somebody who \nwants to be able to help people with a problem.\n  As my colleagues have indicated, the letters, the phone calls, the \nconversations, the emails continue to come. The one I wish to highlight \nto my colleagues is from a person who describes herself as a 62-year-\nold female retired teacher from Wichita. She says she considers herself \na middle-class American.\n  She indicates in her letter that her current health policy expires at \nthe end of this year, less than a month away. Here is what she says in \nher letter:\n\n       When I inquired why, I was told the policy no longer meets \n     the guidelines under ObamaCare.\n       Yet, in the previous 2 years, my premiums have increased \n     25% and 28% respectively to which the answer from [my \n     insurer] was that it was to help pay for ObamaCare.\n       Now I can't even have that plan any longer.\n       It had a $500 deductible and $1,500 Max out of pocket \n     expense per year, with a $300 premium per month.\n       After over 20 hours online, and multiple calls and online \n     chats, I finally was able to see some numbers for healthcare \n     costs from the Obamacare Marketplace, only to learn that the \n     premium is 1.5 times what I currently pay, and the deductible \n     is 4.5 times higher (and it's a different insurer).\n       A plan [from my current insurer] was double the premium.\n       I will not qualify for tax credits, as my projected income \n     for 2014, which includes some tax free interest income and \n     social security, places this middle class retired American, \n     over the threshold of any kind of subsidy.\n       I'm sad that my well laid plan for retirement, now will \n     redirect my earnings to pay for healthcare, much of which I \n     will never use.\n       At 62 and having had a hysterectomy, prenatal care is NOT \n     an issue I will face, nor will I ever need female \n     reproductive disorder treatment, as those parts are gone, but \n     I will have no discount for not needing those coverages.\n       So I'm paying a higher premium for other women to have \n     them?\n       I'm very frustrated at these changes.\n       It's the middle class that will be hit the worst by this \n     mandate, and I fear that many will opt for the government \n     fine because now they truly won't be able to afford the cost \n     of healthcare.\n       One more question, how will folks who can't even make the \n     premium payment, ever be able to pay the outrageous \n     deductible?\n       Honestly, $6,500 out of pocket expenses per person per \n     year?\n       That's crazy, who will be able to pay that? And then who \n     will end up paying it? This is NOT a solution for the Middle \n     Class Americans!\n\n  Surely we can develop a policy, a program of caring for Americans \nwithout doing damage to people who already had insurance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I am pleased to take the floor today and \njoin my colleagues in opening the mailbag. All of us have received a \nlot of mail and email and faxes and texts from individuals who are \nbeing harmed by this law.\n  For example, Steve from Peoria, AZ, is looking at the premium for his \npolicy through his employer going up in response to ObamaCare nearly 20 \npercent. In addition, his employers have told him to brace for more \nimpacts like rising prices--all customers are going to get this--and \nfalling salaries for new hires as well.\n  Leanne from Eager, AZ, is facing what she calls ``sky high'' rates \nnow thanks to ObamaCare. If this is not bad enough, it looks as if she \nand her husband will have to put off buying their parents out of their \nfamily business. It looks likely that Leanne's parents are going to \nhave to keep working for a while.\n  Cristian from Flagstaff, a young husband and father who has a young \nboy, says he might see his premiums actually decrease marginally. \nHowever, thanks to ObamaCare and thanks to changes his employer is \nmaking in response to ObamaCare, he is looking at higher copays, higher \ndeductibles, and a decrease in the level of coverage. He is looking at \n``a large increase in my\n\n[[Page S8748]]\n\nresponsible portion of my medical bills.''\n  ObamaCare is far from ideal for those in the workplace, those looking \nto retire, and for new families.\n  With story after story like these, we clearly see that the Affordable \nCare Act is a misnomer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of \nnearly 7,000 Nebraskans who have contacted my office with concerns \nabout ObamaCare. The sticker shock has hit Nebraskans hard.\n  A woman from Palmyra writes:\n\n       This is the first time I have ever written my Senators. We \n     just received our insurance letter telling us that they no \n     longer would have our health insurance policy and the closest \n     policy under the ACA would up our monthly premium from \n     $590.14 to $932.24 for our family of 6. How is this \n     affordable?\n\n  A constituent from Holdrege writes:\n\n       I cannot believe the letter I got from Blue Cross today. It \n     informs me that I have to switch my coverage, and my new \n     selected plan will cost me $1,116.74, per month. That's a \n     $571.58 per month increase than what I have now. That's \n     almost double my mortgage payment.\n       Also, why am I forced to carry coverage that I don't need \n     or want? At 58, my wife and I are not going to have any more \n     kids. I don't believe I'm going to qualify for any government \n     subsidies. Our planned budget includes our current health \n     care policy. There is no way we can afford the suggested new \n     policies.\n\n  This law is anything but affordable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I join my colleagues as one who has \nreceived tweets and hits on the Web site, emails, phone calls ringing \nthe phone off the hook, written letters, responses that I hear as I \ntalk to people back in Indiana. These are not Republicans, Democrats, \nliberals, conservatives; they are all of the above. They are not \nwriting to say: Stand with the Republican Party. Stand with this. Stand \nwith that. They are writing to say: Wait a minute. The President \npromised that we would not have an increase in our premiums. He \npromised that if we liked our doctor, we could keep our doctor. He \npromised this would be affordable.\n  Tell that to Deborah from Logansport, who said that her increases in \npremiums will strain an already strained budget. I think she speaks for \nmillions of Americans, tens of millions of Americans--a lot of \nHoosiers, that is for sure.\n  Doug, a small business owner from Bloomington, told me that he \nexpects his company health insurance to increase over 30 percent next \nyear and, he said, ``this will preclude me from providing wage raises \nto our employees and will make hiring additional employees much less \nattractive, if not impossible.''\n  The President promised a lot. The worst thing you can do to your \nconstituents, the people you represent, the people who put their trust \nin you, is overpromise and underperform. This could be the biggest gap \nbetween overpromising and underperforming of anything any President has \nsaid in the history of the United States. And he punctuated his \nstatements with ``period,'' meaning ``take it to the bank. Count on it. \nTrust me. Your premiums won't increase.'' It is sad.\n  It is sad, but it can be corrected. We can work. We can repeal this \nnow. We can work together on a bipartisan basis. We can fashion a \nreasonable, affordable solution to providing Americans who are \nuninsured with insurance, creating the kinds of products through an \nopen market system, a competitive system that will deal with this \nproblem. We do not have to keep swallowing this so-called Affordable \nCare Act. It simply will not go down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Mr. President, last night I read a number \nof emails we received of the hundreds we received from constituents in \nWisconsin specifically talking about the problems they have had in \nlosing their coverage and certainly finding this law not being \naffordable.\n  They use words like ``scared,'' ``begging for help,'' feeling they \nwere just collateral damage in this scheme that simply is not \nprotecting patients or offering affordable care. They cannot fathom \nthat this is actually happening to them because they knew it was not \nsupposed to.\n  Today I rise to read an email received from Steve Walrath from \nBeloit. Steve writes: I am 54 years old, in good health and no prior \nconditions. I just received my health insurance renewal bill. I used to \nhave affordable and user-friendly health care that cost about $290 a \nmonth with no copay. According to my renewal letter from Dean health \ncare, my choices are now $854 a month with a 10-percent copay, up to \n$1,315 a month with a zero-percent copay.\n  Let me put that in perspective. He was paying $290 a month with no \ncopay, so if he wants a similar plan he will now experience a 440-\npercent increase, up to $1,315. If he wants to pay a 10-percent copay, \nit will be a 285-percent increase. This was not supposed to happen. \nThis is not what President Obama promised the American people, the \ncitizens of Wisconsin.\n  Steve goes on to write:\n\n       Where is the promise of reduced insurance rates under the \n     Affordable Care Act? What choices do you want me to make \n     after January 1? Dental care or health insurance? An \n     occasional night out or health care? Helping my kids get \n     settled into home ownership or health care? What choice do \n     you want me to make? This increase of over 300 percent is a \n     betrayal of the laws you passed and promises you made. \n     ``Can't be denied coverage'' doesn't mean we can afford it. \n     Not when it's more than my mortgage payment. Which of the \n     above choices do you want me to make after January 1?\n\n  That is just the sad fact. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct is not protecting patients, it is not providing affordable care, \nand it is not about choice. It is about coercion, and I am asking the \nPresident of the United States and I am asking our Democratic \ncolleagues here in the Senate and the House to work with Republicans to \nstart limiting the damage, to start repairing the harm that is being \ncaused to citizens of Wisconsin and America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, in Utah I have a program that I call the \nMobile Office. It is a way for many of my constituents, many of whom \nlive some distance from my two offices in the State, to meet with \nmembers of my staff in order to discuss various concerns they have with \nthe Federal Government, concerns that arise from their interaction with \nany of various Federal programs and agencies. It allows us to help \nthese constituents, and it provides vital information that I can use to \nbetter represent them back here in Washington.\n  At one meeting in Davis County, a man attended who wanted to tell us \nabout his experience with ObamaCare. He owns two small food stores and \na 7-Eleven. He is also an immigrant, having come to the United States \njust 12 years ago to seek a better life for himself and for his family. \nHe gives back to his community. He contributes to his economy and \nprovides jobs for people who live in his town. Now ObamaCare is \nthreatening all of that. His insurance premiums for his family are \ngoing to be rising by $200 a month. This cost will destabilize his \npersonal finances and may well force him to make cutbacks or to let \nsome of his employees go.\n  These are the real human costs of ObamaCare. It is not what the \nPresident promised, and it is turning out to be an absolute, \nunmitigated disaster for families all across this country. It is time \nto start over and develop a health care system that works for everyone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, the Affordable Care Act promised \naccessibility, affordability, and choice. As we heard from the stories \ntold here tonight, it delivered on none of the above.\n  I join Senator Lee, Senator Johnson, and the others to call on \nCongress to come together. Let's fix this flawed program before it is \ntoo late and before we destroy health care in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I get constant communication from my State about the problems that \nare there. This one that I want to read from Beth Hatfield demonstrates \nthe fear, confusion, and lack of accessibility the health care plan has \nat this time.\n\n       I have tried many times over the past few weeks to purchase \n     a health insurance plan\n\n[[Page S8749]]\n\n     for myself on the healthcare Web site. I finally was able to \n     complete an application, but have not been able to choose a \n     plan yet. Twice I asked questions on the ``live chat'' \n     option, but they were not able to answer my questions, \n     instead they [told me to make a long distance call to the \n     help desk. I did, but I couldn't get an answer there either]. \n     I was disappointed to find out that in order to ``compare \n     plans'' you first needed to enroll. In what other shopping \n     experience do you have to sign up before you actually shop?\n       Now I saw on the news that my personal information may be \n     compromised from the Web site. This makes me angry, \n     especially since it seems they knew all along [this problem \n     existed].\n       Is anyone going to be able to do anything about protecting \n     my information? I need health insurance. I am not working and \n     my COBRA policy is expensive [and runs out soon].\n       I need someone to help me, and I need them to help me now.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to be heard.\n\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I just found out PolitiFact, which is a \ngroup who takes a look at what politicians say each year, just came out \nwith what they are describing as the ``Lie of the Year.'' PolitiFact, \n``Lie of the Year.'' It is none other than that of President Barack \nObama, ``If you like your health care plan, you can keep it,'' called \nby PolitiFact the ``Lie of the Year.''\n  It is not surprising that those of us from around the country are \ngetting letters, emails, and calls from folks at home who are finding \nout they cannot keep it. They listened to the President, they believed \nthe President, who has now had his statement listed as being the ``Lie \nof the Year.''\n  I have a letter from Cody, WY, from a man who said:\n\n       Just got a quote from my insurance agent on a Obama care \n     insurance. From $860 that I currently spend per month for my \n     family of 4, to $2,400 per month.\n\n  He said:\n\n       All with the low deductible of $10,000 per person per year. \n     I'm not sure what planet they think I live on, but there is \n     no way I can spend more than \\1/2\\ of my monthly income on \n     insurance. For the first time in my adult life I will soon be \n     without insurance. What does it matter if my two 18-year-old \n     children can stay on an insurance plan if I can't afford to \n     keep one? Also, all the airtime to preexisting conditions is \n     meaningless if I can't afford to keep a plan.\n       I feel greatly blessed to have the good paying job that I \n     have. It puts me above the pay level that would allow me to \n     get any subsidies. By the way, with the system in place this \n     year I wouldn't have needed subsidies.\n\n  Because he was paying something he could afford.\n\n       I have never needed them in the past and would like to \n     continue to never get a hand out from my government.\n\n  This is what I expect to hear from the people of Wyoming--not looking \nfor a handout from the government and able to take care of themselves. \nThey are rugged individuals.\n  What this constituent has gotten from a Presidential promise turns \nout to be the lie of the year. He sees an increase in his health \ninsurance from $860 a month to over $2,000 a month.\n  He said:\n\n       I employ 35 people with my company. When we first opened \n     about a year and \\1/2\\ ago we were talking about getting some \n     sort of coverage. It became very clear that we will not be \n     able to do this, and have stopped any of our plans to provide \n     this in the future. We also know for sure that we can not \n     afford to ever employ more than 50 people, so as we continue \n     to grow, there is an upward limit on how many people we will \n     hire.\n\n  Here is an individual who has a business and has hired 35 people. He \nis not going to provide insurance because the costs are too high. He \nsays that he is never going to have more than 50 employees. The \nopportunities may be there--wanting to put people back to work--but, \nno, there is a cap at 50. Why? Because of the health care law that has \nbeen forced down the throats of the American people. It was voted along \nparty lines by Democrats in the House and in the Senate. So here we \nare, hurting the economy and hurting people's health.\n  He goes on:\n\n       Simple economics, Obamacare is a job killer in Wyoming.\n\n  ObamaCare is a job killer not just in Wyoming but all across the \ncountry.\n  He said:\n\n       It has never been easy to be in business, that is part of \n     the fun of being successful. It is discouraging when our \n     federal government limits the American dream for everyone.\n       I am thankful for your efforts, but from my chair in Cody, \n     it is already too late.\n\n  A failed Web site is just the tip of the iceberg. Web sites can be \nfixed, but what can't be fixed is the destruction this health care law \nis doing to the health of America in terms of canceled policies. We now \nhave over 5 million policies that have been canceled across the \ncountry. Five million people have letters saying: We are sorry, but \nyour policy is canceled. Why? Maybe they didn't have the type of \ninsurance the President deemed good enough for them.\n  I received a letter from a lady who lives in Newcastle, WY. She is a \nrancher. I talked to her at our Farm Bureau meeting in Wyoming. She \nsaid: I lost my insurance because the President didn't deem my policy \ngood enough because it didn't include maternity coverage. She knows me \nand knows I am a doctor. She said: Doc, I had a hysterectomy; I don't \nneed maternity coverage. She knows whether she needs maternity \ncoverage. The President of the United States doesn't have a clue. Yet \nhe is the one who determines what kind of coverage she needs because it \nis the President who decided that he will be the one who will decide \nwhat the American people need, not them. She knew what worked for her \nand her family and what they could afford as far as a deductible.\n  There are people across my State who have absolute levels of anger \nand anxiety, and it is reflected in the letters I continue to get.\n  The front page of yesterday's Wall Street Journal talked about the \namount of deductibles. The deductibles in the bronze policy are the \ncheapest and average over $5,000 per person. A husband and wife will \nhave a $10,000 deductible before they even get to the insurance. Yet \nthey have to buy expensive insurance with these huge deductibles in \norder to comply with the individual mandate the Democrats have forced \non the American people, that you have to buy it whether you call it a \nfee, a fine, or a charge. Call it what you will--a tax.\n  So we have the fact that the costs are too high and, of course, the \ndeductibles.\n  I am going to continue to come back. I will be back later this \nevening with more letters, but I appreciate your attention.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the Senate for confirming Judge \nPatricia M. Wald to be a member of the Privacy and Civil Liberties \nOversight Board, ``PCLOB''. The Senate previously confirmed Judge Wald \nto this post on August 2, 2012. The President renominated Judge Wald to \nthis position in March, and the Judiciary Committee favorably reported \nthe nomination without objection months ago. Like many other nominees, \nher confirmation has been held up on the floor for months by Senate \nRepublicans.\n  During her tenure on this important oversight board, Judge Wald has \nserved with great professionalism and dedication. And last month, she \nreceived the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor \nthat the President can bestow.\n  For the past several months, our Nation has been engaged in a \nnational debate about the ever-growing need for limits on the \ngovernment's surveillance powers. The House and the Senate are \nconsidering bipartisan legislation to rein in those expansive powers, \nin an effort to better protect Americans' privacy and to increase \ntransparency and oversight. The PCLOB is also expected to issue an \nimportant report on the government's surveillance programs to the \nPresident and Congress.\n  Today's confirmation vote will ensure that the Privacy and Civil \nLiberties Oversight Board remains at full strength as the board \ncontinues this work to safeguard our constitutional rights. Democrats, \nIndependents, and Republicans alike have supported the work of this \nnon-partisan board. I commend the Senate for confirming this well \nqualified nominee, so that the PCLOB can continue to carry out its \nimportant responsibilities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All postcloture time has expired.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Patricia M. Wald, of the District of Columbia, to be a Member of the \nPrivacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board for a term expiring January \n29, 2019?\n\n[[Page S8750]]\n\n  On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is my understanding there is 2 hours \nequally divided; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader is correct.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. \n3547, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3547) to extend the application of certain \n     space launch liability provisions through 2014.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, today, I am asking for unanimous consent \nto pass H.R. 3547, as amended, a bill to extend government liability, \nsubject to appropriation, for certain third-party claims arising from \ncommercial space launches. The bill supports the competitiveness of the \nUnited States commercial space industry.\n  This industry, which grew in part out of the successes of NASA, is \nvital both to the economy and to national security. Our U.S. space \ncompanies offer us new opportunities to send astronauts into space on \nU.S.-built vehicles and to continue launching communications satellites \nand conducting important scientific research on the International Space \nStation.\n  This bill helps to ensure the strength of the space industry by \ncontinuing to provide Federal launch liability protection from third-\nparty losses for commercial launches. Congress first established this \nindemnification regime in\n\n[[Page S8751]]\n\n1988 and has seen the need to extend the policy many times since then. \nIt is important to note that it has never cost the United States a \nsingle dime.\n  This indemnification helps domestic launch companies compete in the \nglobal launch market. Many international cornpetitors enjoy similar \nprotections in their various home nations.\n  However, indemnification protection is set to expire on December 31st \nof this year. Without indemnification, each company would ``bet the \ncompany'' every time they launch.\n  As chairman of the Science and Space Subcommittee, I have worked with \nother Senators to thoroughly consider this issue. In a hearing this \nMay, we discussed indemnification in detail. It was clear that \nextending indemnification was necessary.\n  This bill therefore extends the indemnification for 3 years, until \n2016, giving Congress the ability to continue to review this policy \nwhile providing the commercial space industry the stability it needs.\n  I would like to especially thank Senator Thune and his committee \nstaff for their work on this bill. I would also like to thank Senators \nCruz, Feinstein, Heinrich, Kaine, Rubio, Thune, Mark Udall, Tom Udall, \nWarner, and Wicker, all of whom worked with me on this effort.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Nelson \namendment which is at the desk be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time, the title amendment be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2544) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. LAUNCH LIABILITY EXTENSION.\n\n       Section 50915(f) of title 51, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking ``December 31, 2013'' and inserting \n     ``December 31, 2016''.\n\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The bill (H.R. 3547), as amended, was passed.\n  The amendment (No. 2545) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                     (Purpose: To amend the title)\n\n       Amend the title so as to read: ``A bill to extend \n     Government liability, subject to appropriation, for certain \n     third-party claims arising from commercial space launches.''.\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, what we have just passed is the \nindemnification bill on commercial space launches.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. NELSON. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I and my colleagues stand here holding the \nfloor in defense of fair and free debate, and the longstanding \ntraditions of the Senate that promote consensus.\n  We are here working on nominations because the majority leader has \ndetermined that is the agenda for today. But there are important issues \nwe need to move to: the Defense reauthorization bill, the Water \nResources Development Act, the farm bill, the budget, and other vitally \nimportant legislation. We need to move to these bills and we need to \ndeal with them in a bipartisan way. Instead, we continue to work on \nnominees. We are working on nominees without the discussion and the \ndebate and the consideration and, most importantly, without that \nbipartisan consensus which has always been a hallmark of the Senate. \nBecause of the unilateral change to the longstanding rules of the \nSenate, that consensus is no longer required for advice and consent; a \nsimple partisan majority will do.\n  I would use time today to talk about need for bipartisanship, \nbipartisanship in nominations, but also bipartisanship in the important \nlegislation that we need to address for the good of our country, \nlegislation such as the right kind of health care reform. I have \nprovided real-life stories from citizens from my State about the impact \nthat the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, is having on them and their \nlives and why we need to replace it with market-based reforms, a step-\nby-step comprehensive approach that fosters choice and competition. We \nhave put forward proposals to do that.\n  I have also used time today to talk about other important issues that \nwe need to advance on a bipartisan basis; for example, the farm bill. \nWe need a 5-year farm bill. We are currently operating under an \nextension. That extension expires at the end of the year. We need to \nget a farm bill in place, and a farm bill is a great example of how we \ndo things on a bipartisan basis, not only in the Senate but also in the \nHouse.\n  I wish to talk about another subject that is vitally important to our \ncountry, to our economy, to job creation, and to national security, \nthat also needs to be advanced and needs to be advanced in a bipartisan \nway, and that is energy.\n  I want to provide a specific example; that is, the Keystone XL \nPipeline. I know the Presiding Officer wishes to see that project \napproved. That is the point. This is a project that will create jobs, \ncreate economic activity, it will create greater energy security, it is \nsomething that we can work on with our closest friend and ally in the \nworld, Canada. It is something that goes to national security so we are \nno longer dependent on the Middle East for oil, and it is something \nthat is supported on a bipartisan basis and there is strong support \nfrom the American people.\n  The polls show somewhere between 70 and 80 percent of the American \npublic supports this project and wants to see it move forward.\n  It has now been more than 5 years since the permit applications were \nsubmitted to the State Department for the Keystone XL Pipeline \nproject--more than 5 years in the application process and still no \ndecision--an exhaustive review process, including five environmental \nimpact statements, showing no significant impact to the environment. \nThe most recently issued draft statement was only last spring. The \nconsent of every single State along the route of the pipeline is in \nplace. Every single State on the route supports and approves the \nproject, with the backing of a majority of Congress. Legislation to \napprove the project has passed in the House and we have passed it in \nthe Senate only to have the President turn it aside.\n  As I said a only minute ago, it has the support of the American \npeople. More than 70 percent--in the most recent poll--of the American \npeople support moving forward with this project. Despite all of this \nsupport, the Keystone XL Pipeline project is still awaiting decision \nfrom the President of the United States.\n  The long wait for approval is troubling enough, but it represents a \nlarger issue for our Nation and begs a bigger question for all of us \nwho serve our States and the American people in this institution: How \nwill America ever build an all-of-the-above energy policy if the \nPresident takes more than 5 years to approve only one piece of a \ncomprehensive plan?\n  The Presiding Officer has seen this issue before in his State when it \ncomes to the Alaska pipeline, how for years and years it was worked on \nuntil it was finally approved. Once approved, not only is it a vitally \nimportant piece of infrastructure for the State of Alaska, but contrary \nto all the concerns that were raised in regard to the Alaska pipeline, \nsuch as the environmental concerns, it has proven to work and work very \nwell.\n  They addressed the concerns and the project was approved. The same is \ntrue for the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  To recount briefly, this $7 billion, 1,700-mile high-tech pipeline \nwill carry oil not only from Alberta, Canada, to refineries in Oklahoma \nand the Texas Gulf Coast, but it will also carry growing quantities of \nsweet crude from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota, my State, and \nalso Montana--light, sweet, Bakken crude, the highest quality oil \nproduced.\n  Even by modest estimates it will create more than 40,000 jobs. There \nhave been a lot of estimates out there, some much higher. But the State \nDepartment itself, the administration's own State Department has come \nout after more than 5 years of study and said that this project will \ncreate more than 40,000 jobs. At a time when unemployment is still 7 \npercent, these are good jobs, jobs that put Americans back to work.\n\n[[Page S8752]]\n\n  It will create more than 40,000 jobs, boost the American economy, and \nraise much-needed revenues for States and the Federal Government. It is \nnot raising revenues by raising taxes, it is raising revenues through \neconomic growth. That is the way to do it--not higher taxes but through \neconomic growth.\n  Further, and perhaps most importantly, it will help put our country \nwithin striking range of a long-sought goal, a vitally important goal \nfor our country, true energy security. For the first time in \ngenerations, the United States--with its friend and ally Canada--will \nhave the capacity to produce more energy than we use, truly, North \nAmerican energy independence, eliminating our reliance on oil from the \nMiddle East, Venezuela, and other volatile parts of the world. This is \nsomething Americans very much want.\n  When we see in the polls they support this project by more than 70 \npercent, it is with a clear recognition of what are we doing getting \noil from the Middle East when we should be getting it from ourselves in \nthis country and from our closest friend and ally Canada. We absolutely \ncan do it, we can do it to an extent that is beyond our needs, and we \ncan do it in short order, easily within the next 5 years if we approve \nprojects such as this one.\n  Now we produce about 60 percent of our fuel domestically. We still \nimport 40 percent, much of it from the Middle East, and other areas of \nthe world that are hostile to our interests.\n  The question is why would we want to import oil from an unstable \nregion of the world when we can import it and when we can work with our \nclosest friend and ally Canada, as well as move it from parts of our \ncountry that produce that oil, such as my State and others, and \ntransport it to our refineries.\n  The 40 percent that we don't produce domestically has to come from \nsomeplace else. Why not from our closest friend and ally Canada. With a \ntrue all-of-the-above approach to energy development in this country, \nincluding projects such as the Keystone XL Pipeline project, I \nabsolutely believe we can be energy independent within 5 years.\n  The argument has been advanced that the oil sands will increase \ncarbon emissions and that failing to build the Keystone XL Pipeline \nwill somehow reduce emissions.\n  Let us look at the facts. Let us look at this claim more closely. \nToday an ever increasing percentage of new recovery in the oil sands is \nbeing accomplished in situ. That means with technology that makes the \noil sands carbon footprint comparable to conventional drilling.\n  In fact, the oil sands industry has reduced greenhouse gas emissions \nper barrel of oil produced by an average of 26 percent since 1990 and \nwith some facilities achieving reductions as high as 50 percent--a 50-\npercent reduction in carbon emissions. Today heavy crude from the \nMiddle East--and even from California--produces more carbon emissions \nover its life cycle than the Canadian oil sands.\n  Also, we need to factor in that if the pipeline is not built from \nAlberta to the United States, a similar pipeline will be built to \nCanada's Pacific coast.\n  What does that mean? That means from there the oil will be shipped on \ntankers across the Pacific Ocean, a much larger and more sensitive \necosystem than the Sandhills--which, of course, have been at issue in \nterms of the route of the pipeline. It will be shipped across the ocean \nto be refined in facilities in China with weaker environmental \nstandards and more emissions than our refineries in the United States.\n  The United States, moreover, will continue to import its oil from the \nMiddle East, again on tankers so that again has to be transported \nacross the ocean. Factor in the cost of trucking and railing the \nproduct to market overland, and the result, contrary to the claims of \nopponents, will be more emissions, more CO2 emissions, and a \nless secure distribution system without the Keystone XL Pipeline than \nwe will have if it is built.\n  In fact, the administration's own State Department has released three \ndraft Environmental Impact Statements finding ``no significant \nimpacts'' on the environment.\n  Let me read that again. In fact, the administration's own State \nDepartment has released three draft Environmental Impact Statements \nfinding ``no significant impacts'' on the environment.\n  What does the administration do? They delay and ask for another \nEnvironmental Impact Statement.\n  What is going on?\n  In its latest analysis in March, the State Department concluded that \n``there would be no substantive change in global greenhouse gas \nemissions'' associated with the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  That raises another important point. The White House has said \nrepeatedly they ``don't want to get ahead of the process,'' but the \nPresident effectively abandoned the process more than 2 years ago when \nhe halted the project by executive action. Had he not, the State \nDepartment, in keeping with the usual process, would have issued a \ndecision on the permit by December of 2011. That is according to a \nletter that was sent to me by Secretary Hillary Clinton, Secretary of \nState at that time, which she sent to me in August 2011.\n  I wish to point out that this body, the Senate, as well as the House \nof Representatives, has embraced the Keystone XL project with \nbipartisan majorities. Congress has expressed support for the Keystone \nXL with two majority votes in the Senate and several bipartisan letters \nto the President. The American people have also expressed overwhelming \nsupport for the project, as I have stated.\n  In a Harris poll released this summer, 82 percent of voting Americans \nvoiced support for the Keystone XL Pipeline project. I want to \nemphasize that and say it again. In a Harris poll released this summer, \n82 percent of voting Americans voiced support for the Keystone XL \nPipeline project. According to Harris, 9 in 10 Republicans and nearly \n80 percent of Democrats and independents believe the pipeline is in our \nnational interest.\n  In July, Senator Landrieu and I led a bipartisan group of our \ncolleagues to introduce a concurrent resolution declaring the Keystone \nXL Pipeline project in the national interest of the United States and \ncalling on President Obama to approve it.\n  The resolution notes that every study conducted by the State \nDepartment, including the Department's draft Environmental Impact \nStatement issued in May, has found no significant impacts to the \nenvironment.\n  This is the text of S. Con. Res. 21.\n\n       Expressing the sense of Congress that construction of the \n     Keystone XL Pipeline and the Federal approvals required for \n     the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline are in the \n     national interest of the United States.\n\n                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n                             July 31, 2013\n\n       Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Hoeven, Mr. Pryor, Mr. \n     Donnelly, Mr. Begich, Ms. Heitkamp, Mr. Thune, Mr. Risch, Mr. \n     Cornyn, Mr. Johanns and Mr. Barrasso) [a bipartisan group] \n     submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \n     referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION\n\n       Expressing the sense of the Congress that construction of \n     the Keystone XL Pipeline and the Federal approval required \n     for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline are in the \n     national interest of the United States.\n       Whereas safe and responsible production, transportation, \n     and use of oil and petroleum products provide the foundation \n     of the energy economy of the United States, helping to secure \n     and advance the economic prosperity, national security, and \n     overall quality of life in the United States;\n       Whereas the Keystone XL pipeline would provide short- and \n     long-term employment opportunities and related labor income \n     benefits, such as government revenues associated with taxes;\n       Whereas the State of Nebraska has thoroughly reviewed and \n     approved the proposed Keystone XL pipeline reroute, \n     concluding that the concerns of Nebraskans have had a major \n     influence on the pipeline reroute and that the reroute will \n     have minimal environmental impacts;\n       Whereas the Department of State and other Federal agencies \n     have conducted extensive studies and analysis over a long \n     period of time on the technical, environmental, social, and \n     economic impact of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline;\n       Whereas assessments by the Department of State found that \n     the Keystone XL pipeline is ``not likely to impact the amount \n     of crude oil produced from the oil sands'' and that \n     ``approval or denial of the proposed Project is unlikely to \n     have a substantial impact on the rate of development in the \n     oil sands'';\n       Whereas the Department of State found that the incremental \n     life cycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with the \n     Keystone XL project are estimated in the range of 0.07\n\n[[Page S8753]]\n\n     to 0.83 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, \n     with the upper end of this range representing 12/1,000 of 1 \n     percent of the 6,702,000,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide \n     emitted in the United States in 2011;\n       Whereas after extensive evaluation of potential impact to \n     land and water resources along the 875-mile proposed route of \n     the Keystone XL pipeline, the Department of State found, \n     ``The analyses of potential impacts associated with \n     construction and normal operation of the proposed Project \n     suggest that there would be no significant impacts to most \n     resources along the proposed Project route (assuming Keystone \n     complies with all laws and required conditions and \n     measures).'';\n       Whereas the Department of State found that ``[s]pills \n     associated with the proposed Project that enter the \n     environment are expected to be rare and relatively small'' \n     and that ``there is no evidence of increased corrosion or \n     other pipeline threat due to viscosity'' of diluted bitumen \n     oil that will be transported by the Keystone XL pipeline;\n       Whereas, the National Research Council convened a special \n     expert panel to review the risk of transporting diluted \n     bitumen by pipeline and issued a report in June 2013 to the \n     Department of Transportation in which the National Research \n     Council found that existing literature indicates that \n     transportation of diluted bitumen proposes no increased risk \n     of pipeline failure;\n       Whereas plans to incorporate 57 project-specific special \n     conditions relating to the design, construction, and \n     operations of the Keystone XL pipeline led the Department of \n     State to find that the pipeline will have ``a degree of \n     safety over any other typically constructed domestic \n     pipeline''; and\n       Whereas, the Department of State found that oil destined to \n     be shipped through the pipeline from the oil sands region of \n     Canada and oil shale deposits in the United States would \n     otherwise move by other modes of transportation if the \n     Keystone XL pipeline is not built: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) construction of the Keystone XL pipeline will promote \n     sound investment in the infrastructure of the United States;\n       (2) construction of the Keystone XL pipeline will promote \n     energy security in North America and will generate an \n     increase in private sector jobs that will benefit both the \n     regions surrounding the Keystone XL pipeline and the United \n     States as a whole; and\n       (3) completion of the Keystone XL pipeline is in the \n     national interest of the United States.\n\n  I have worked toward approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline--first as \nthe Governor of North Dakota and now as a Senator--because I believe it \nis just the kind of project that will grow our economy and create the \njobs our country so desperately needs, and it will do so with good \nenvironmental stewardship. At the same time, it will reduce our \ndependence on the Middle East for oil, which is what the American \npeople have sought for decades.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline project is long overdue. For the benefit of \nour economy, our environment, and our long-term energy security, this \nproject needs to be approved and it needs to be approved without delay.\n  As I say, we can do these things. We can do these things and so much \nmore, but it takes a bipartisan effort. It takes bipartisanship. We \nhave to find a way to tackle these tough issues for the benefit of the \nAmerican people and we have to do it in a way that has always been the \nhallmark of this institution--the Senate--and that is on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  Earlier today I read accounts I received from citizens of my State \nwho have been impacted adversely by ObamaCare. ObamaCare is an example \nof what I am talking about, an example of something that was passed on \na partisan basis rather than on a bipartisan basis. So when we look \nacross this great country, it is very understandable why the public \nsupport is not there. This was a policy passed solely with votes from \none side of the aisle, in the House and in the Senate. We need to pass \nlegislation in a bipartisan way. We need policies for this country, \nparticularly on these big issues, that can garner bipartisan support if \nwe expect the American people to truly support the policies as well.\n  I would like to read several more accounts, true stories, that I have \nreceived in my office from people from our State about the impact that \nObamaCare is having on their lives. The first one comes from Crystal, \nND. It is a frustrated senior, not eligible for Medicare, seeking ways \nto cut back to afford ObamaCare. This individual writes:\n\n       Just who is this health care reform law helping? My \n     insurance broker, American Family, is no longer carrying \n     medical insurance--so they lose. The average American that \n     goes out and earns a paycheck--he loses. Doctors don't like \n     it, so how many new doctors will there be? I just got off the \n     phone with the insurance brokerage company that has taken \n     over my former broker's customers. I learned that if I sign \n     up before the end of the year, I can save by NOT having \n     maternity coverage (what a laugh!). But, after 2014, I HAVE \n     to have maternity coverage! Can you see all of us senior \n     citizens walking around pregnant? So, with the cheapest \n     coverage I WILL be paying $473 MORE per month than my current \n     coverage, and my premium will be $1,288.00 per month! That's \n     a 37% increase per month! Next year, the rate will increase \n     to cover maternity. And, if you have children under 18, you \n     HAVE to have dental, and maybe vision too. I already try to \n     conserve on our monthly expenses, have heat set to 55--and \n     when guests are here, I set it to 65. I turn lights off, \n     don't smoke, don't drink (even quit drinking pop). I don't \n     eat out, don't even go out to drive to get the mail every \n     day, and don't buy new clothes, and don't go to visit \n     family like I used to. What should I cut out of our \n     monthly expenses? Take weekly showers? Get the mail once a \n     week? Eat once a day? Hibernate? Get a third job? Cut out \n     the grandkids' events? So, ``affordable health care''. . . \n     . I wonder how many heart attacks there will be after \n     Americans open up their health insurance bill in 2014, and \n     even more in 2015! Cause it will be a shocker.\n\n  Here is another story from an independent North Dakotan in \nMinnewaukan who suggests seceding from the Union over ObamaCare.\n\n       I would like you to know what the health care reform law is \n     doing for my family. The insurance company we have had since \n     1994 is no longer going to offer health insurance, starting \n     April 2014. When I called to get quotes to replace my current \n     health insurance policy, I learned I would have to pay $200 \n     more for a plan with a deductible that is twice the amount \n     that I currently have. Then, when I eventually have to go on \n     an ObamaCare policy, I will have to pay for maternity, which \n     I haven't had for 17 years and have not needed. Plus, I will \n     have to pay for children's dental and vision, which my family \n     won't be able to use because my children are 18 and 20 years \n     old. The health reform insurance policy will cost me twice as \n     much as I am paying now. So, please tell me how this is going \n     to help me! The only thing this is doing is giving another \n     freebee to those who choose not to work. This is very \n     frustrating, and I am starting to believe that seceding from \n     this Union and making our country much better for the \n     residents of North Dakota. We certainly have enough of our \n     own resources to take care of ourselves. I hope you are \n     trying to change the health care reform bill.\n\n  Here is one from a hardware store owner who is unable to grow his \nbusiness due to ObamaCare.\n\n       I just received my renewal from Blue Cross Blue Shield for \n     my 5 employees, and the premium for the same coverage went up \n     from $2,179.50 per month to $3,090.40 per month. I am a small \n     town hardware store owner. Where is this money to come from? \n     I am so frustrated by the lack of understanding that our \n     country's government officials have regarding the policies \n     they create. It appears we all need to go on welfare [to \n     survive]. Most people [who] work and generate the money are \n     feeling hopeless. I don't think you have a clue as to the \n     frustration that is out here. I was looking to expand and \n     grow my business, but the drain I believe ObamaCare will have \n     on the already strained economy will be much greater than in \n     the Great Depression.\n       So, as a small business owner, why should I invest in the \n     future? So our U.S. Government can continue its ``business as \n     usual?'' I think not.\n\n  I present these stories and others I presented earlier in the day, \nalong with those from my colleagues, because they are real stories from \nreal Americans across the country who are suffering because of \nObamaCare. We have put forward the kind of market-based solutions to \nreplace ObamaCare that empower people--empower them to choose their own \nhealth care insurance and their own health care provider--and we need \nto go to work to provide the right kind of health care reform. We need \nto do that on a bipartisan basis.\n  I think that by presenting these stories, it is not just a case of \nMembers of the Senate or Members of Congress saying: Hey, this is what \nI think is happening. These are real stories. These are people telling \nus what is happening to them in their lives and we need to take heed \nand we need to address the very real and very valid concerns they are \nraising and we can do it. We absolutely can do it.\n  I come back to where I started my comments after our last vote. We \nare here today voting on nominations. Due to the change in the Senate \nrules by the majority party, advise and consent no longer requires \nparticipation or any votes whatsoever from the minority party. That \ncreates a situation now where judges, other nominees can be\n\n[[Page S8754]]\n\napproved solely by one party. We have seen what happens when one party \nand one party alone can confirm appointees or can pass laws such as \nObamaCare. It doesn't work. It doesn't work for our country. That is \nwhy the Senate was set up to require bipartisanship, to require \nconsensus so as we pass the important policies and laws that will help \nlift our country and move it forward, we have the broad base of support \nfrom both sides of the aisle across this great Nation. That is what is \nrequired to make things work.\n  That is why it is incumbent on all of us in this institution to reach \nout and find ways to make sure we have that bipartisanship so we create \nthe kind of policies that will truly move our country forward. That is \nwhat the American people have sent us here to do.\n  I see my esteemed colleague from the great State of Utah is on the \nSenate floor and at this time I yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have certainly enjoyed the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota. He has done a terrific job in \nthe Senate and made a real difference, and I personally appreciate it \nvery much.\n  We all know we are here for one basic reason: I believe our friends \non the other side believe that by creating this kind of a fuss and \nproblem, they can get off of the issue of ObamaCare, which is a \ndisaster, and everybody knows it, including them.\n  The fact is that I think they have gone from one extreme debacle to \nanother in their desecration of this body by getting rid of a rule that \nis absolutely critical to this body--a rule of protection to the \nminority.\n  I can hardly wait for those on the other side of the aisle, who have \nnever been in the minority, to get in the minority and realize what \nthey have done is basically destroyed the thing which has made the \nSenate the greatest deliberative body in the world.\n  The cloture rule--rule XXII--was put in place to allow the majority \nto end filibusters. In the early part of the last century they couldn't \nget anything done, so they came up with rule XXII so they could invoke \ncloture, end the debate, and get back to whatever the Senate decided \nwas the appropriate business. It has worked amazingly well and it would \ncontinue to work amazingly well, except for the fact that our \ncolleagues on the other side have made the Senate no better than the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  The Senate was always supposed to be different from the House of \nRepresentatives. It was supposed to be the body that would be more \ndeliberative. It was Washington who said to Jefferson that the Senate \nis the saucer which cools the tea. They were right. The Senate is the \nsaucer which should cool the tea. It should cool debates around here. \nBut now it is just whatever the majority wants, and they vote in \nunison. They vote in unison because they are supported in unison by a \nnumber of very well-heeled groups, especially including the unions, \nwhich Democrats are basically afraid of crossing. It is a pitiful \nshame.\n  I would like to chat just a little bit about this filibuster because \nit is a time-honored instrument which both sides have used. But I think \nthere have been gross misrepresentations of what the filibuster is by \nthe leadership of the other side, and these gross misrepresentations \nshould never have been spoken on the floor. I don't know how they keep \na straight face when they do it.\n  On November 21, 2013, the majority used a premeditative parliamentary \ngimmick to change more than two centuries of Senate confirmation \npractice. As a result, for the first time since 1806, the minority \ncannot extend debate on any nominations except for those that go to the \nSupreme Court. Democrats accomplished this on a purely party-line vote \nand by a maneuver designed to avoid scrutiny.\n  It would be hard to imagine a crisis so grave, a conflict so \nintractable that the only option was to fundamentally alter the very \nnature of this institution and further politicize the very confirmation \nprocess. I am here to say that the crisis the majority said could only \nbe solved that way never existed.\n  The majority leader claimed on November 21 that this crisis was, as \nhe put it, caused by ``unprecedented obstruction'' of nominations to \nboth the judicial and the executive branches.\n  More specifically, he said there had been 163 filibusters of judicial \nand executive branch nominations, half of them during the Obama \nadministration.\n  By the way, that is totally false and they know it. I don't know how \nthey can stand on the floor and make these bald-faced assertions.\n  The only solution to the problem, the leader said, was simply to ban \nnomination filibusters.\n  I notice the majority leader made no attempt to either define the \nfilibusters he was counting or to identify the nominations on his \nfilibuster list. That was an odd omission because doing so would surely \nhave proved his point. Wouldn't it? No.\n  There was a very good reason the majority leader simply threw out a \nbig number and did identify the filibusters he claimed justified \nrigging the confirmation process. If he had simply listed those \nfilibusters, we all would have seen dozens and dozens of nominations \nthe Senate had confirmed, many without opposition at all.\n  Since I took my first oath of office on January 3, 1977, the Senate \nhas confirmed more than 1,700 nominations to the U.S. district courts, \nthe U.S. courts of appeal, and the U.S. Supreme Court, and they have \ndefeated two--two--in all of that time the last 37 years. We confirmed \n78 percent by unanimous consent without any rollcall vote at all. Two-\nthirds of the rollcall votes we did take were unanimous. Think about \nthat. Where is the problem?\n  No President gets every single appointment he or she wants, but every \nPresident gets the vast majority.\n  During his first term, for example, President Obama was 30 percent \nbehind his predecessor in nominations. They were sloppy in putting \nforth nominations. But he ended up only 10 percent behind in \nconfirmations. That could only mean the Senate handled his judicial \nnominations efficiently.\n  During his second term, so far the Senate has confirmed more than \ntwice--twice--as many judicial nominees as it had by this point in \nPresident Bush's second term.\n  The Congressional Research Service says the Senate is confirming \nPresident Obama's appeals court nominees faster than the Senate \nconfirmed President Bush's. In fact, President Obama has already \nappointed one-quarter of the entire Federal judiciary.\n  I can also comment on how executive branch nominations referred to \nthe Finance Committee have been handled. Nearly 80 percent of the \nnominations sent to the committee during the 112th Congress have so far \nbeen confirmed.\n  Looking at executive branch filibusters overall, the same Democratic \nleaders who last month voted to abolish nomination filibusters voted to \nfilibuster President Bush's nominees to be Assistant Secretary of \nDefense and EPA Administrators and twice voted to filibuster his \nnominees to be a U.N. Ambassador.\n\n  They must have thought very differently back then about whether the \nPresident deserves his team. We have heard a lot about that from \ncurrent Democrats. Their actions then spoke more loudly than their \nwords do today about whether they think all nominees do deserve an up-\nor-down vote. Look at the past. Look at what they have done. It is \nhypocritical.\n  However, the majority will not acknowledge those facts and others \nlike them because those facts do not fit the spin they are putting on \nthis.\n  It is hard, after all, to claim an obstruction crisis when so many \nnominees are confirmed and are being confirmed. So the majority instead \nmakes a claim about what they call filibusters because that sounds bad \nto most people, and most people will not know whether the claim is even \ntrue. Calling something a filibuster does not make it so.\n  A filibuster occurs when the Senate cannot vote on passage of \nlegislation or confirmation of a nomination because an attempt to end \ndebate on it fails. That is why filibuster reform always focuses on \nmaking it easier to end debate.\n  The filibuster rule XXII came about after the turn of the last \ncentury because they couldn't get anything done in the Senate and they \nneeded a way of bringing things to cloture so they could vote. We are \nheaded into the same kind of disaster without this important rule.\n  It takes two steps to detect a filibuster--a cloture motion and a \ncloture\n\n[[Page S8755]]\n\nvote. You can't have a filibuster without both. As we can see, a vast \nmajority of what our leader has claimed are filibusters are not because \nthey haven't had a cloture vote.\n  A cloture motion is a request to end debate and a cloture vote \nanswers that request. A filibuster occurs when a cloture vote fails and \ndebate cannot be ended. That is the definition of a filibuster.\n  Some people listening to this might already be wondering whether \nthese details matter, whether the difference between a cloture motion \nand a cloture vote or the definition of a filibuster are all that \nimportant after all. I am here today to say these details do matter \nbecause the truth matters.\n  The truth matters when Senators claim there is a crisis that needs a \nsolution when there isn't.\n  The truth matters when the majority prohibits the very tool they used \nso successfully in the past against Republican nominees.\n  The truth matters when the entire confirmation process is going to be \nrigged and the judiciary further politicized--such as the DC Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.\n  I have been on the Judiciary Committee 37 years. I chaired that \ncommittee. I was ranking on that committee. I can tell you never in the \nhistory of that committee has it been so brazenly ignored.\n  The truth matters because the American people need to know what their \nSenators are doing.\n  The truth was in short supply on November 21. The majority leader \nclaimed 168 filibusters, but he was not counting filibusters at all. \nThe majority leader was counting cloture motions, not filibusters. He \nhad the habit of calling up a bill and almost immediately filing \ncloture as though there was a filibuster, when nobody intended to \nfilibuster. Then, in prior years, he would fill the parliamentary tree \nso in the greatest deliberative body in the world we could not have \namendments. The minority could not have amendments.\n  There is a time to fill the tree, but it is only after there has been \na full and fair debate and amendments have had their opportunity to be \nbrought forward. They do it to cut off amendments--unless the majority \nleader approved of whatever the amendments were.\n  I think it is nice to protect your fellow Senators on the majority \nside with legitimate ways of doing it, but this isn't one of them. That \nalone is causing a lot of discontent on our side because the majority \nleader was counting cloture motions, not filibusters, and claiming they \nwere filibusters when they weren't. He was counting requests to end \ndebate, not the answers to those requests.\n  Most people probably do not know that the majority leader files \nnearly all cloture motions--as he did just a few days ago--by adding 10 \nmore to the list. So if the majority leader claims there are too many \ncloture motions filed on nominations, he has only himself to blame.\n  Under President Obama, half of the cloture motions filed on \nnominations do not result in a cloture vote at all. The rest just \nvanish into thin air, obviously, because they never should have been \nfiled in the first place. Yet that is a scheme used by the other side, \nand then they claim this side is being obstructionists.\n  Two-thirds of the cloture votes that do occur on nominations pass. \nThere has been no discussion of that by the other side. Two-thirds of \nthem pass, preventing filibusters altogether.\n  Here is the filibuster fraud: The majority leader has been using the \ncloture rule more effectively than in the past--or should I say more \nobnoxiously than in the past--to prevent filibusters of President \nObama's nominations while telling us about unprecedented obstruction. \nThe truth is exactly the opposite of what he has claimed and what other \nDemocrats on the other side of the aisle have claimed.\n\n  Perhaps the most astounding fact of all is that nearly 90 percent of \nObama nominees to the executive or the judicial branch on whom cloture \nmotions were filed have been confirmed. The majority told us that this \nwas about obstruction, about how the minority was using the filibuster \nto prevent President Obama from appointing people. It is no wonder that \nthe majority leader did not show the list of the nominations he claims \nhave been filibustered. The claims are a fraud.\n  The majority created this crisis and damaged this institution by \nclaiming that ending debate is really a filibuster and that confirming \nnominations is really obstructing them. Up is down, left is right, and \nconfirmations are filibusters.\n  All of this is more than a little ironic since the Democrats were the \nones who pioneered using the filibuster to defeat majority-supported \njudicial nominees. The first judicial nominee with clear majority \nsupport to be defeated by a filibuster was Miguel Estrada in 2003, one \nof the finest lawyers in the country. They didn't want him on the DC \nCircuit Court of Appeals because they knew getting on that court is a \nfast track to the U.S. Supreme Court. In fact, Democrats were so intent \non keeping him off the DC Circuit that they filibustered Miguel \nEstrada, this Latino man, seven times--a record that stands to this \nday. I know. I was there. I was fighting for Miguel Estrada, as were \nall Republicans.\n  As of November 21, when the majority said there was an unprecedented \nfilibuster crisis, there had been 12 cloture votes on Obama judicial \nnominations and 6 of them had failed. In other words, there was no \nobstruction. At that same point in the Bush administration, there had \nbeen 26 cloture votes on judicial nominations, and 20 of them had \nfailed. Democrats used the filibuster to defeat Republican nominees to \nthe Fifth Circuit, the Sixth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit.\n  Three-quarters of all votes for judicial nomination filibusters in \nAmerican history have been cast by Democrats, and they have the gall to \nstand on this floor and suggest that Republicans are using the \nfilibuster to stop nominees.\n  The majority leader alone--at least before complaining of too many \nfilibusters--voted no less than 26 times to filibuster Republican \njudicial nominees. As I said, the same Democratic leaders abolishing \nnomination filibusters today voted to filibuster President Bush's \nnominees to be Assistant Secretary of Defense and EPA Administrator and \ntwice voted to filibuster his nominee to be United Nations Ambassador. \nI do not know what the majority understands the word ``unprecedented'' \nto mean, but this certainly is not it. This is why the truth matters.\n  As of November 21, when the majority leader claimed that there had \nbeen 168 nominations filibusters, only 56 cloture votes on executive or \njudicial nominations had ever failed and only 17 of those filibustered \nnominees had not been confirmed. The crisis that the majority claimed \nturns out to be a myth, a tale for the fiction section of the library. \nThis is why the truth matters.\n  Let's not forget what the majority did on November 21. Rule XXII, the \none that provides a way to end debate, is a written rule, a time-\nhonored rule. It says what it says, and it says that ending debate on \nany matter before the Senate, with the exception of rules changes, \nrequires three-fifths of all Senators. It said that on November 21, and \nit says that today. The technical term for what the majority leader did \nthat day was to raise a point of order, but in practical terms, the \nmajority leader asked the Presiding Officer to say that three-fifths \nactually means a majority vote. He might just as well have asked the \nPresiding Officer to say that Christmas is on December 29 or that the \nNation's Capital is in Salt Lake City, UT. The Presiding Officer stated \nthe obvious, that three-fifths means three-fifths, because that is what \nthe rule says. That is what the Presiding Officer, advised by the \nParliamentarian of the Senate, said--three fifths means what it says: \nthree-fifths. That is what the rule says.\n  By a purely party-line vote, the majority said otherwise--that three-\nfifths is actually a majority--by overruling their own colleague in the \nChair. This sounds absurd because it is. Now we are forced to act as if \nwe cannot read, to suspend the most basic ability to understand the \nEnglish language and set aside our common sense. We are forced to \npretend that the rules of this body say what they do not mean and mean \nwhat they do not say. This, frankly, reminds me of ``The Wizard of \nOz,'' where Dorothy and her friends were before the image of what they \nthought was the great and powerful Oz. Her dog Toto pulls on the \ncurtain to reveal a\n\n[[Page S8756]]\n\nlittle man frantically operating dials and buttons and speaking into a \nmicrophone. The image commands: ``Pay no attention to that man behind \nthe curtain.''\n  On November 21 the majority told each of us to pay no attention to \nthe three-fifths in the cloture rule. That was quite a trick. The real \nquestion was why the majority would concoct such a fraud in order to \nrig the confirmation process. What could be so important that the \nmajority would go through such contortions, peddle such myths, and play \nsuch word games? It certainly was not to solve a filibuster crisis, \nthat is for sure. No, it was for a much more base political reason.\n  The President and the majority here in the Senate deliberately set up \nthis political confrontation in order to implement a political agenda \nthat could not get through Congress. That agenda requires actions and \ndecisions by the two groups of Federal officials who are not directly \naccountable to the American people: bureaucrats in the executive branch \nand judges in the judicial branch.\n  The President appoints those two categories of officials but only \nwith the consent of the Senate. For more than 200 years the process of \ndeciding whether to give that consent included the right of the \nminority to slow things down and, yes, even block the most \ncontroversial nominees.\n  I have given you the numbers. Only 17 executive or judicial nominees \nwho were filibustered were not eventually confirmed. But the majority \nwants it all. They want a clear path to stacking the executive branch \nwith officials who will issue the rules and stacking the judicial \nbranch with judges who will approve those rules.\n\n  The DC Circuit Court of Appeals is a perfect illustration of where \nmuch of the regulations are evaluated by the courts, and they want them \ndecided in favor of President Obama. They want the courts to legislate \nfrom the bench that which they could never get through the Senate or \nthe House of Representatives. This is a power grab--nothing more, \nnothing less. It appears that the ends justified the means, that short-\nterm political gains justified long-term institutional damage.\n  I urge my colleagues, from the freshmen to the senior Members, to \ntake some guidance from our own predecessors. Senator Mike Mansfield, a \nleading Democrat, majority leader in the Senate, had served in the \nminority and later became majority leader. In 1975, when Senators also \nproposed forcing a rules change by simple majority, he said that this \ntactic would ``destroy the very uniqueness of this body . . . and \ndiminish the Senate as an institution of this Government.'' It would, \nhe said, ``alter the concept of the Senate so drastically that I cannot \nunder any circumstances find any justification for it.'' That was the \nDemocratic leader in the Senate, a man of unquestionable integrity.\n  As I have explained here today, the majority has certainly not \nprovided any justification for doing away with the filibuster rule \neither. There is no filibuster crisis. I think I have made that case. \nThere is only a desire by the majority to win every time, to have \neverything they want when and how they want it. Most of the executive \nand judicial branch nominations the majority claims were filibustered \nwere actually confirmed. Even in this town, known famously for \nmasterful spin, that will surely go down as legendary. The majority \nabolished nomination filibusters by claiming nominations that were \nconfirmed were actually obstructed--when they were confirmed. This \namounts to filibuster fraud. That is why we are here today, because the \ntruth matters. The integrity of the Senate matters.\n  I can only hope there is time for those two concepts to still \nprevail. What the Democrats have done here is not only extremely \ndangerous, it is outrageous. They have taken one of the things that \nreally make the Senate the great body that it is and have desecrated \nit. They have done it because a number of the Democrats over here have \nnever been in the minority. They do not realize how awful that rule-\nchange is. They do not realize that the filibuster is a rule of freedom \nthat protects the minority and makes the Senate debate on these \nmatters.\n  I once said I would fight to my death for the filibuster rule because \nit is what makes the Senate different from the House of \nRepresentatives. The House of Representatives is the people's body. \nThey can do anything once they get a rule and get 50 percent plus one \nof the votes--anything. It was structured that way. The Senate was \nstructured another way. Our young new Senators on the other side don't \nseem to understand that.\n  I have chatted with a number of more senior Senators who have been \nthrough being in the minority, who have been through some of the \nbattles here. Let me tell you, they are as concerned as I am that this \nbody is totally damaged by this breaking of the rules, destroying the \nrules for purely partisan purposes. They can talk about how they just \nwant the Senate to work all they want to. The Senate is never going to \nwork as well without this rule. The minority will never be protected as \nwell without this rule.\n  I have to say that I hope we can get this rule put back in place. \nEven though it is a disadvantage to Republicans right now because they \nnow have three more liberal judges on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, \nwhich was divided four to four, Republicans appointees to Democrat \nappointees--four to four. Now they stack it, the most important court \nin the country as far as regulatory affairs are concerned and \nadministrative law is concerned, so they can pass through that court \nthe Obama administration's regulatory measures and desires without \nhaving to face real debate.\n  There was a reason why the Founding Fathers created the three \nseparate governmental powers, because each of those powers is to \nprotect our country. They are making it so that regulatory matters, \nadministrative matters, and so forth there is really only one-sixth who \nare Republicans.\n\n\n                          Order for Correction\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, if I yield back 1 hour of the majority's \ntime, what time would the next vote occur?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 9:15 p.m.\n  Mr. REID. I yield back 1 hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is yielded back.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, we are now on Calendar No. 349, Susan P. \nWatters of Montana to be U.S. district judge for the District of \nMontana. I note on the Executive Calendar this nomination came before \nthe Senate from the committee on September 19. It is my understanding \nthat this nominee was cleared by our side of the aisle and could have \nbeen brought up on any Monday afternoon by a voice vote.\n  I think Members might be wondering and certainly people within the \nsound of my voice tonight might be wondering why we are spending time \ntonight in a protracted debate on three district court nominees--Landya \nB. McCafferty of New Hampshire, Brian Morris or Montana, and now Susan \nWatters of Montana to be confirmed--when there has never been a \ndistrict court judge in the history of our Republic prevented from \nserving because of a filibuster.\n  To me, we have gotten to this point because of the heavyhanded \noverreach of the majority in trampling on the rights of folks on our \nside of the aisle. We find ourselves--temporarily, I hope--in the \nminority. That has a way of changing from time to time. But it is the \nsort of overreach that I am reminded of from 2009 when a supermajority \nin both Houses rammed through ObamaCare and caused all of the grief \nthat we currently are facing and that real, live Americans are having \nwith the so-called Affordable Care Act.\n  It actually might be in one way beneficial that we are spending this \ntime on something that could have been done so quickly because it gives \nus an opportunity to point out that we should be right now, at this \nmoment, working on the National Defense Authorization Act and also on \nthe budget--two matters that are pending that must be addressed by this \nSenate before we can go home and take a day or two with our \nconstituents and loved ones for the Christmas holiday. But it gives me \nan opportunity, as the budget comes over tonight from the House of \nRepresentatives, to point out one of the most onerous provisions in the \nbudget, which has just passed with sweeping bipartisan support in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I will stand before this body tonight and say that I cannot vote and \nwill not vote for this budget, and I hope that even yet Members of the \nCongress and the American public will listen to the broken promise that \nis contained in this budget that will be coming forward. We will \nperhaps get back to the nomination in a moment.\n  We should note two things about this budget. It asks for an \nadditional contribution for pensions for Federal employees, but it does \nnot do it to current Federal employees. As you enter the Federal \nservice after the beginning of the year, you pay an additional amount \nthat is withheld from your paycheck for your pension. That is hard to \ndo, it is distasteful to do, but at least it is fair to the people who \njoin the Federal service under one set of rules.\n  On the other hand, the budget that comes over to us from the House of \nRepresentatives and that I will oppose when it eventually does come up \nfor a vote hopefully next week does to retired servicemen what we were \npersuaded not to do to Federal employees: It breaks a promise to \nretired service people who have already served their time. This is what \nit does. It says to every retired servicemember under the age of 62: \nYou are not going to get your COLA anymore. Each year until you get to \nbe 62, you are going to get your COLA, less 1 percent. I can tell you\n\n[[Page S8758]]\n\nthat this is not a matter of nickels and dimes to the people who have \nstepped forward, joined the military, volunteered for a career in the \nmilitary, done their 20, and now are going to be told, if this budget \npasses next week: We are sorry. We are changing the rules way after the \ngame has begun.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter to me \nfrom VADM Norb Ryan, U.S. Navy, Retired, president of the Military \nOfficers Association of America.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator Wicker: On behalf of the over 380,000 members \n     of the Military Officers Association of America (MOAA), I am \n     writing to express our strong opposition to the proposal \n     within the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 which penalizes \n     future uniformed service retirees and current retirees under \n     the age of 62.\n       Even though the budget deal would help ease the harmful \n     effects of sequestration for two years for the Department of \n     Defense--something we support--doing so on the backs of \n     service members who serve our Nation for over 20 years is \n     just shameful.\n       Reducing working age retiree annual cost-of-living \n     adjustment by one percent until they reach the age of 62 is \n     simply a tax.\n       Service members who retire at the 20 year point would feel \n     the full negative financial effects of the proposal by \n     reducing their retired pay by nearly 20 percent by the time \n     they reach age 62.\n       For example, an Army Sergeant First Class (E-7) retiring \n     this year with 20 years of service would see an average loss \n     of over $3,700 per year by the time he or she reaches age \n     62--a cumulative loss of nearly $83,000. For a Lieutenant \n     Colonel (O-5), the average annual loss would be over $6,200--\n     a cumulative loss of over $124,000.\n       This proposal also flies in the face of the principles that \n     guide the ongoing congressionally-mandated review of military \n     compensation and retirement.\n       Congress wisely removed the BRAC-like, ``fast-track'' rule \n     so that the appropriate committees would have adequate time \n     to assess impacts that any recommended changes to the \n     retirement system would have on retention and readiness.\n       In addition, the guiding principles to the Military \n     Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC) \n     include a grandfather clause to protect current retirees and \n     service members from any changes to their retirement which \n     this proposal blatantly disregards.\n       Currently serving members look at how they, their families, \n     retirees, and survivors have been treated when making career \n     choices. If Congress arbitrarily cuts the retirement benefit \n     for those who have served their country for over 20 years, \n     there could be an unintended impact on uniformed service \n     career retention, and ultimately, national security.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                    VADM Norb Ryan, USN (Ret),\n\n                                                        President,\n                         Military Officers Association of America.\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Let me point out what the retired vice admiral says.\n\n       On behalf of the 380,000 members of the Military Officers \n     Association of America, I am writing to express our strong \n     opposition to the proposal within the Bipartisan Budget Act \n     of 2013 which penalizes future uniformed service retirees and \n     current retirees under the age of 62. Even though the budget \n     deal would help ease the harmful effects of sequestration for \n     2 years for the Department of Defense, something we support, \n     doing so on the backs of servicemembers who served our Nation \n     for over 20 years is just shameful.\n\n  I would interject at this point that I have to agree with that \nstatement.\n  The vice admiral goes on to say:\n\n       Reducing working age retiree annual cost of living \n     adjustment by 1 percent until they reach the age of 62 is \n     simply a tax. Servicemembers who retire at the 20-year point \n     would feel the full negative final effect of the proposal by \n     reducing their retired pay by nearly 20 percent by the time \n     they reach the age of 62.\n\n  This is the pertinent part of the letter I am having printed in the \nRecord, and my colleagues should hear me on this:\n\n       For example, an Army sergeant first class, E-7 retiring \n     this year with 20 years of service would see an average loss \n     of over $3,700 per year by the time he or she reaches age 62, \n     a cumulative loss of nearly $83,000.\n\n  That is what this bipartisan budget resolution does to the retired \nmilitary enlisted people who have volunteered to serve our country for \n20 years and who joined under one set of rules--$83,000 lifetime taken \nfrom this retired E-7.\n  For a lieutenant colonel, O-5, the average annual loss would be over \n$6,200 annually, a cumulative loss of over $124,000.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WICKER. I will yield on this, absolutely, to my friend.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I know the Senator from Mississippi was on Active Duty \nin the Air Force for several years and has stayed in contact with many \nmembers of the military not just as a result of his service on the \nArmed Services Committee but because he is very keenly interested in \nthe welfare of the men and women in our military.\n  If I am hearing the Senator from Mississippi correctly on this \nparticular issue, what he is saying is that an E-7 who served in Iraq, \nserved in Afghanistan, conceivably served multiple tours in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, maybe even was awarded major meritorious recognition, is \nnow going to have the promise that was made to him about his retirement \nreduced retroactively. Do I understand that correctly?\n  Mr. WICKER. The rules, if this budget passes and is signed into law \nby President Obama, will be changed on this individual retroactively. \nThe result will be that, instead of the retirement pay he signed up for \nand agreed to under the law when he did his duty, he will experience an \n$83,000 loss, lifetime.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, again if I may inquire of the Senator, \nyou, as I say, have been very close to any number of military personnel \nthrough the years you have served in this body as well as your service \nin the Mississippi Legislature. Just by virtue of the fact of \npracticing law in Tupelo, MS, what is the opinion of the Senator from \nMississippi as to the morale influence a provision such as this is \ngoing to have on our men and women in the military, not just those who \nare retired but Active-Duty military today?\n  Mr. WICKER. I can only imagine that it is a severe blow to morale. \nAlso, it has to make people who are willing to step forward and risk \ntheir lives, be separated for months and years from their loved ones, \nit has to make them wonder, what else is being promised to me that is \ngoing to be taken away?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. The Senator also mentioned the reduction in Federal \nretirement pay--and we have to figure out ways to save money. We all \nknow and understand that. There is a change in the pension for Federal \nretirees, but it is all prospective going forward.\n  Mr. WICKER. Right. We do not do anything to any other Federal \nemployee retroactively, only the military in this budget. I cannot \nimagine how the public could think that is fair.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I am very sympathetic, even though I never served on \nActive-Duty in the military as you did. But this is very strange. It is \nvery difficult to understand why we would penalize the men and women \nwho have worn or do wear the uniform of the United States versus a very \nsimilar provision for the men and women who serve the Government of the \nUnited States in a very honorable way, but we are treating them very \ndifferently, it seems like almost discriminatorily.\n  Mr. WICKER. I will tell you who else believes it is discriminatory. I \nhave a list of members of the military coalitions listed in a letter to \nthe Honorable Harry Reid and the Honorable Mitch McConnell dated \nDecember 11, 2013. I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        The Military Coalition\n\n                                Alexandria, VA, December 11, 2013.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority and Minority Leaders: The Military Coalition \n     (TMC), a consortium of uniformed services and veterans \n     associations representing more than 5.5 million current and \n     former servicemembers and their families and survivors, \n     appreciates the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 which helps to \n     ease the harmful effects of sequestration on the defense \n     budget; however, we wish to express our grave concern and \n     strong objection to the proposal within the Act that \n     specifically seeks to penalize current and future military \n     members who have served our nation for over twenty years.\n       The 1 percent annual reduction to uniformed service retired \n     pay Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) will have a devastating \n     financial impact for those who retire at the 20 year point by \n     reducing retired pay by nearly 20 percent at age 62.\n       While portrayed as a minor change, a 20 percent reduction \n     in retired pay and survivor benefit values is a massive cut \n     in military career benefits and an egregious breach of faith.\n       The Coalition believes that service in uniform is unlike \n     any other occupation. Roughly one percent of the nation's \n     population is\n\n[[Page S8759]]\n\n     currently serving and shouldering 100 percent of the \n     responsibility for our wartime and national security \n     requirements. The benefits connected with this service have \n     been earned through 20 or more years of arduous military \n     service.\n       Ending the harmful effects of sequestration is a top \n     priority for our nation's security and military readiness, \n     but to tax the very men and women who have sacrificed and \n     served more than others is simply a foul.\n       Congress mandated the Military Compensation and Retirement \n     Modernization Commission (MCRMC) in the FY 2013 National \n     Defense Authorization Act and wisely removed the \n     ``BRAClike'', fast-tracking rule so that the appropriate \n     committees would have adequate time to assess any \n     recommendations that could significantly impact retention and \n     readiness. Moreover, any changes that the MCRMC recommends \n     will grandfather the existing force and retirees to keep \n     promises that have been made by our nation's leadership.\n       This radical proposal basically kills the grandfather-\n     concern addressed by both Congress and the Administration and \n     actually eliminates the appropriate review process failing to \n     consider longterm readiness and retention outcomes in order \n     to meet an arbitrary deadline so that Congress can go home \n     for the holidays.\n       The Secretary of Defense succinctly warned on July 31, ``It \n     is the responsibility of our nation's leadership to work \n     together to replace the mindless and irresponsible policy of \n     sequestration. It is unworthy of the service and sacrifice of \n     our nation's men and women in uniform and their families.''\n       The Military Coalition shares the Secretary's concerns.\n       Currently serving members look at how they, their families, \n     retirees, and survivors are being treated when making career \n     decisions. If Congress arbitrarily cuts the retirement \n     benefit for those who have served their country for over 20 \n     years, there could be a lasting adverse impact on uniformed \n     service career retention, and ultimately, national security.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           The Military Coalition.\n  Mr. WICKER. I simply say, in answer to the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia, here are the groups who are expressing outrage, dismay, and \nstrong opposition to this provision:\n  The Air Force Sergeants Association; Air Force Women Officers \nAssociated; AMVETS; AMSUS; Association of the United States Navy; Chief \nWarrant Officer and Warrant Officer Association, U.S. Coast Guard; \nCommissioned Officers Association of the U.S. Public Health Service, \nInc.; Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States; \nFleet Reserve Association; Gold Star Wives; Iraq & Afghanistan Veterans \nof America; Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America; Marine \nCorps League; Marine Corps Reserve Association; Military Officers \nAssociation of America; Military Order of the Purple Heart; National \nAssociation for Uniformed Services; National Guard Association of the \nUnited States; National Military Family Association; Naval Enlisted \nReserve Association; Society of Medical Consultants to the Armed \nForces; the Military Chaplains Association of the United States of \nAmerica; the Retired Enlisted Association; United States Army Warrant \nOfficers Association; United States Coast Guard Chief Petty Officers \nAssociation; Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States; and Vietnam \nVeterans of America.\n  This distinguished list of organizations consisting of members and \nformer members of the U.S. military have registered their opposition.\n  I can only hope at this point that Members of the Senate will listen. \nThis is a so-called savings of $6 billion out of an $80 billion \npackage.\n  Surely we could find $6 billion without putting an $80,000 penalty on \nthe back of an E-7 retired enlisted person who is not rich, who served \nhonorably under one set of rules and who has been now told sorry.\n  I have to say when people see the government not keeping its \npromises, I think it is destructive to our system of government. It is \nexactly the sort of thing we are seeing with ObamaCare. It is not being \noverly repetitive to remind my colleagues that the President of the \nUnited States, Barack Obama, repeatedly, over and over, promised the \nAmerican people that they could keep their insurance.\n  For example, in a speech at the American Medical Association on June \n15, 2009, President Obama stated:\n\n       That means that no matter how we reform health care, we \n     will keep this promise to the American people: If you like \n     your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period. If \n     you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your \n     health care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter \n     what.\n\n  These are the words of the leader of the free world. Of course, we \nknow from story after story of real people who are being hurt by this \nlaw that time after time after time again, in thousands of homes across \nthe United States of America, that promise, just as the promise made to \nthe servicemen, is being broken.\n  If the Senator from Georgia will indulge me, let me give one example \nof a family of real individuals, honest, hardworking Americans who feel \nthat another promise is being broken in the form of the so-called \naffordable health care.\n  I received an email from a father in Greenville, MS, who is concerned \nabout his 27-year-old son. For the past 6 years his son was covered \nunder a policy provided by Humana. When the healthy 20-year-old first \nreceived coverage, the policy protected against a major medical \nemergency and the cost was only $70 a month.\n  The President told the American public: ``If you like your health \ncare plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan.''\n  According to this father in Greenville, MS, this policy is no longer \navailable, and the plan available for his son will now cost just under \n$350 per month as opposed to $70 a month--a broken promise. The healthy \n27-year-old who works in the automotive industry has been working since \nhe was 20. He now questions whether he can afford to insure himself at \nall because his cost has quadrupled. His discretionary income will now \ntaken a huge hit--as the discretionary income of these retired heroes \nwill take a huge hit--and the higher premiums will cause uncertainty in \nhis family.\n  I know my friend from Georgia may want to give some examples of some \npeople in his home State. Once again, in this instance, a promise has \nbeen made, a very explicit promise. In a very blatant way that promise \nturned out not to be the case at all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the Senator from Mississippi for giving me an \nopportunity to speak for a minute. I wish to get to some anecdotes, but \nfirst it has been nearly 4 years since the Democrats in the Senate and \nthe House forced the passage of the President's signature law, the \nAffordable Care Act or what is commonly known as ObamaCare.\n  It is a title the President has embraced during the promising times \nand distanced himself from during the very difficult times we are going \nthrough now. It has been kind of an interesting dynamic to watch.\n  Instead of working in a bipartisan fashion to enact a health care law \nthat would bring more competition into the private insurance market \nthrough market-based solutions, President Obama and the Democrats \nstructured a deal behind closed doors across this hall that we are \nlooking at on the west side of the Capitol. They structured that deal \nwithout any Republican input, giving the Federal Government more \ncontrol over Americans' health care decisions.\n  The Senator from Mississippi and I were here on the floor, and we \nboth fought tooth and nail to stop the passage of ObamaCare.\n  On Christmas Eve, 2009, we came to the floor of the Senate and voted \nagainst what I think is the worst piece of legislation that has passed \nin the Congress in the 19 years the Senator and I have been in \nCongress. I have been saying for years that ObamaCare caused more \nproblems than it solved, and with the passage of every single day, that \nis being shown as the painful truth.\n  Although the White House has stood behind this terrible piece of \nlegislation, some of my colleagues across the aisle have brought into \nquestion now the ability of it to stand on its own two feet.\n  Who can blame them. This has become a major political issue, not only \nexpensive, but it is a political issue. The law continues to be marked \nby red flags. We have heard a few of the Democrats go as far to say \neven that it is a train wreck, and they are exactly right.\n  We have heard from the American people as well. They are rightfully \nupset that they have been repeatedly lied to and misled about this law \nby the President of the United States. The\n\n[[Page S8760]]\n\nAmerican people don't deserve a law filled with broken promises marked \nby disaster after disaster. The law is fundamentally broken and \nAmericans deserve better.\n  I noticed yesterday, in a hearing, the Secretary of HHS reported that \nnearly 365,000 individuals have selected plans from the State and \nFederal marketplaces, a number that is far below the administration's \ngoal. I think their goal--and the Senator may correct me--is 7 million \nby the end of March.\n  I notice also that the State of Oregon has spent $300 million setting \nup their exchange. As of this morning there were 40 people, 40 citizens \nof Oregon had signed up. The fact is that this law is not working. It \nis becoming more and more expensive every day. As we talked about in \n2009, when we were debating this bill, it is going to be the largest \nmandatory expenditure that the U.S. taxpayer has ever seen.\n  The Senator is correct. I have a whole book of anecdotes and I wish \nto mention some.\n  First, Linda of Douglasville wrote to me about her dropped coverage. \nShe said:\n\n       We lost our Gold plan. All of our costs will go up next \n     year considerably. It is harder and harder for us to really \n     retire!\n       My husband, who is 71, still has to work part time to pay \n     for our rising costs.\n\n  Linda, from Hampton, GA, also writes:\n\n       In 1997 I retired from Motorola, Inc. after having a career \n     there for almost 30 years. One of my benefits was a retiree \n     secondary insurance plan, after Medicare, that provided \n     coverage for medical and prescriptions; my monthly premium \n     for that coverage was $127.\n       Effective January 1, 2013 Motorola withdrew their insurance \n     coverage for retirees.\n\n  Under ObamaCare they simply could not afford it. I could go on and \non. I know the Senator from Mississippi has some other anecdotes that \nhe would like to mention, and I will engage on some others on my side \nshortly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. I thank my colleague from Georgia. Let me mention a \nhusband and wife in Hernando, MS. They are small businesspeople. As the \nChair is aware, that is how we create jobs in the United States of \nAmerica. We love it when a big manufacturing plant moves in, but it is \nthe small businesses throughout this great land that create the bulk of \nthe jobs, and we appreciate it.\n  ObamaCare has hit the small businesses so hard and hurt their ability \nto create jobs.\n  This particular small business couple in Hernando, MS, tell me their \nprivate insurance plan that they have offered their employees in the \npast will not be grandfathered and the new plan they are forced to \noffer their employees will have a 7-percent premium increase in 2014--\nthat is real money--and a 66-percent premium increase in 2015, \naccording to their insurance agent.\n  Perhaps they believed the President when he said: ``If you like your \nhealth care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan, \nperiod.''\n  Perhaps they believed Members of the majority party, such as the \ndistinguished majority leader from Nevada who said it not only means \nmaking sure you can keep your family's doctor or keep your health care \nplan if you like it but also that you can afford to do it.\n  Perhaps they believed that, but instead a 7-percent premium increase \nis hardly affordable at that and then a 66-percent premium increase, \nwhich is a blow. Their small group plan they offered to their eight \nemployees currently costs $491 per month per employee. By 2015 the plan \nwill cost this small business couple over $800 per month per employee.\n  These are real stories. These are real facts. It is going from $491 \nper month per employee to $800 per month per employee. I wonder how \nmany jobs they will be adding to that small business. This plan doesn't \ninclude dental or vision.\n  They pride themselves, this small business couple, on providing their \nemployees quality, affordable health care that they help supplement. \nBut with the frequent changes the President is making to the law, they \nare uncertain whether they will be able to cover the enormous cost.\n  As small business owners, it is impossible for them to expand. They \nwill not be able to hire additional employees with the uncertainty of \nthe future.\n  Let me mention one other example and then perhaps Senator Chambliss \ncan have a moment to speak on some Georgians.\n  The next example is a family of four living in Corinth, MS, in the \nnortheast corner of our State. They are full-time employed parents who \ncurrently do not have health care. They spent a month and a half trying \nto sign up for coverage for themselves and their two children. The \nleast expensive plan they could eventually find after spending \ncountless hours trying to navigate the Web site will cost them just \nunder $800. For a working family in Mississippi with two young children \nto care for, this cost is an almost impossible burden on this family of \nfour.\n  It may be that the Senator from Georgia has examples similar to \nthese.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. The American people want affordable health insurance. \nThe title of the law even centers on the word ``affordable.'' I am not \nsure how anybody could possibly argue that ObamaCare is affordable when \nthe letters I am receiving from constituents over and over every single \nday, time and again, reference a significant increase in their total \nhealth care costs. Virtually 100 percent of the letters we are getting \nindicate that not only are the monthly premiums going up, but the \ndeductible is going up, their copays are going up, and it is simply \ngoing to be more out-of-pocket expense than either actively working \nindividuals or retired individuals ever thought they would have to pay \nfor health care.\n  Terra from Columbus writes to explain what is happening to her \nchildren.\n\n       I carry medical insurance for my two adult children because \n     they cannot afford it on their own.\n\n  Let us remember, ObamaCare covers children up to 26 years of age.\n\n       Being one that has always had medical insurance and knowing \n     the value of it if something bad happens, I have also made \n     sure that they both had some type of coverage when they \n     became adults. The sad part is I have gotten a letter on both \n     and now their insurance will be canceled because I as their \n     parent can no longer afford to pay it for them either. We \n     received a letter which shows where their old policy covers \n     everything and I mean everything, but because of ObamaCare's \n     requirements to carry everything, a new policy will cost us \n     twice as much each month. With me being unemployed and my \n     husband the only one working we have no choice but to drop \n     their coverage.\n\n  Wynell, from Roswell, GA, wrote:\n\n       My private coverage was superb. But now, my insurance \n     premiums are going from $319 a month to $769 a month and not \n     only that, my copay is increasing from $5 to $20 for my \n     primary care visits and $5 to $50 for specialist visits. I \n     will be responsible for $500 per day out-of-pocket cost if I \n     am hospitalized (before my hospital costs were included) and \n     I will also have to pay for any tests (before all my tests \n     were included). And apparently, subsidies do not apply to me.\n\n  Loretta, from Canton, GA, writes:\n\n       I received a letter from my insurance company dated \n     September 25, 2013. I had until November 15 to choose to \n     remain with my current coverage until December 2014. My rate \n     increased by 16 percent. According to the letter, the \n     Affordable Care Act premium will increase by 139 percent. My \n     former plan did not include maternity. I'm 60 years old. I \n     don't need maternity. My new plan will include maternity. My \n     old plan was great for preventive care. I paid nothing for \n     immunizations including tetanus and flu shots. I paid a $30 \n     copay for a doctor visit. My prescriptions have been very \n     reasonable. The new plan requires a network of doctors and \n     hospitals. The premiums were between 150 percent and 200 \n     percent above what I'm paying now. I did not enroll but have \n     received numerous e-mails reminding me to enroll. So far, I'm \n     hoping I can keep my premium at the 16 percent increase for \n     2014. Otherwise, I will not have health insurance. I can't \n     afford the new premium.\n\n  Kevin, from Roswell, GA, wrote:\n\n       We are a family of four. We have and want a catastrophic-\n     only high deductible health plan with low monthly premiums \n     and full coverage once we hit our deductible. We like our \n     plan.\n\n  This is very typical of a lot of families who were promised by the \nPresident, if you like your plan, you can keep it.\n\n       We were paying $500 a month until July of this year. I had \n     bladder cancer in November of 2012 which was successfully \n     removed and I require no follow up treatment, just biannual \n     checkups, so I expected an increase in my premium this year. \n     In fact, our premium did go up to $560 a month in July. On \n     November 1, I got the letter telling us our premium was now \n     going to $902 a month, a 60 percent increase. After three \n     separate calls, I got the\n\n[[Page S8761]]\n\n     information that the $902 a month change was ``Option B,'' \n     which is an ObamaCare-compliant plan which covers abortion, \n     birth control and maternity care. Since we could not have \n     children, we adopted two kids, so that coverage is 100 \n     percent completely unnecessary for us. ``Option A'' we came \n     to find out a few weeks later, was the option to keep our \n     plan with an increase to $617 a month. This plan will be \n     canceled on December 31, 2014, at which point we will be \n     forced to get an ObamaCare-compliant plan costing much more \n     and covering things we will never, ever need.\n\n  Now, I am sure the Senator from Mississippi has received dozens and \ndozens of these letters, just as we have in my office. Knowing the \nState of Mississippi has a lot of rural areas, as my State does--in \nfact, I live in a rural area--there is a huge discrepancy created by \nObamaCare between insurance premiums in rural America versus insurance \npremiums in more urban areas. Many of these premiums and deductibles \nare so high that it defeats the purpose of having health insurance.\n  This really does hit close to home for me because I truly live in a \nrural part of our State. In two of the regions in Southwest Georgia \ndesignated by ObamaCare, there is only one insurer--one insurance \ncompany--that is offering coverage, and the premiums in that corner of \nour State are much higher than in the rest of our State. It is the \npoorest part of our State.\n  In region one, which includes Albany, GA, the least expensive silver \nplan for a 21-year-old healthy Georgian is $360 a month. That is the \nhighest rate in the State. In region 15, which is also in that part of \nour State, the same plan is $330 a month.\n  You have to remember these are people who are paying zero today \nbecause they aren't covered. They are either going to have to pay a \nfine or they are going to have to take that coverage.\n  In metro Atlanta the cheapest silver plan for a 21-year-old is \n$179.20 a month, matching the rate in regions in northeast as well as \nnorthwest Georgia, which are more populated. That is half the rate of \nan individual in southwest Georgia where the average median income is \nthe lowest of any part of our state.\n  So needless to say, households in rural southwest Georgia often do \nnot have the same income as those in the northwest and northeast part \nof the State, yet they are being stuck with the highest premiums.\n  I could go on and on about these anecdotes and about the serious \neconomic consequences ObamaCare is going to cause for individuals in my \nState, but I want to turn it back over to the Senator from Mississippi \nfor some additional comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, indeed, this does hit rural America much \nharder, but it hits all Americans hard.\n  I would ask unanimous consent if the Senator from Georgia and I may \nspeak as if in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. I didn't hear any debate during 2009, in the extensive \nhours I stood on the floor and listened to the other side propose this, \nexplaining that in situations as in Georgia, folks in the metropolitan \narea would pay half the premium that folks down in rural southwest \nGeorgia would pay. That was never something the majority party, in \nproposing this so-called affordable act, said: Now, we are going to \nhave to live with this, we just want you to know that.\n  This is a total surprise, and one of the myriad unintended \nconsequences of this unfortunate law. Did my colleague hear any warning \nabout that to the American people?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. The Senator is exactly right. Obviously, we both spent \nan awful lot of time on the floor of the Senate debating this. As we \ntalked about, we were here voting on Christmas Eve of 2009 against this \nbill when it passed with 60 Democratic votes. No Republican in the \nSenate voted for the bill. No Republican in the House of \nRepresentatives voted for the bill. It passed with all Democratic \nvotes.\n  If the Senator will recall that famous quote by the then-Speaker of \nthe House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, she said: What we have to do is pass \nthis bill and then we will figure out what is in it.\n  Well, guess what. What we are talking about here is just one of the \nmyriad of consequences the American people are now finding out is in \nthat bill, and they have every right in the world to chastise everybody \nwho voted for that bill who didn't read it, because these are the real \nout-of-pocket consequences to hard-working, taxpaying Americans that \nwere never talked about on the floor of this Senate or the floor of the \nHouse.\n  Mr. WICKER. My friend and colleague has very effectively gone chapter \nand verse into what this law is doing to families in Georgia, to small \nbusinesses in Georgia, to potential job creators in Georgia and all \nacross the United States of America. But it is not just families and \nsmall businesses, it is also local governments.\n  The Senator from Georgia and I came here after the 1994 elections on \na promise, among other things, that we would fight against unfunded \nmandates on local governments. What we are finding out about ObamaCare \nis that it is absolutely an unfunded mandate on, for example, small \ntowns and small counties that make up the bulk of the population in my \nState of Mississippi.\n  Let me just give a couple of examples of what it is doing to \nmunicipal governments. A city employee in Batesville, MS, tells me he \nrecently attended a meeting of city workers and their health care \nprovider. They were told their premiums will rise over 9 percent \nbecause of the President's health care law. This will be an increased \ncost of $55,000 to $60,000 that the city will have to cover to provide \nhealth care coverage for their employees.\n  Presumably, they do not have a printing press in the back of city \nhall, so they are going to have to put an extra tax on the people of \nBatesville, MS, to cover the additional unfunded mandate the Affordable \nCare Act puts on the city of Batesville.\n  I could also mention, and will also mention, at the other end of the \nState on the gulf coast the city of Ocean Springs, MS, reported it will \nsee a premium increase for their little budget of $47,000 to provide \nhealth care under the new improved ObamaCare. This is a 13 percent \nincrease because of the President's health care law. The city currently \ncovers 100 percent of the employee premiums. The mayor of Ocean \nSprings, who I know happens to be a Democrat, said:\n\n       We're going to have to find $47,000 from somewhere.\n\n  Presumably, it will come from the taxpayers of Ocean Springs, MS, and \nother small towns and rural counties around the State of Mississippi.\n  We are all human. I have made many mistakes during my life, and some \nof the mistakes I have made have been in my capacity as a legislator. I \nserved in the State senate for 7 years. I have been in the U.S. House \nand Senate for some 19, along with my good friend from Georgia. I would \nhope that when I have seen mistakes that I have made legislatively I \nhave been willing to go back and revisit those decisions and say: We \nare all human. We didn't get it right this time, and we ought to fix \nit.\n  That is one of the real disturbing things to me about this ObamaCare \nlaw. We see that the rollout was disastrous. We see that the effect on \ntowns, counties, families and businesses is disastrous, and at the end \nof the day we are still going to have over 30 million Americans \nuninsured--the same amount we were targeting for coverage, supposedly, \nwith the passage of ObamaCare. I would hope colleagues from both \nparties at this point would see where this has led us and agree there \nis a reason Congress meets every year. We can alleviate the problems \nthat have arisen. We can correct the mistakes that have been made.\n  I appreciate people such as our colleague from Montana, Senator Max \nBaucus, who at least said the law's implementation, he thought, was \ngoing to be a huge train wreck, noting that small businesses have no \nidea what to do, what to expect. I appreciate that sort of candor from \none of the architects of the act.\n  It would seem to me, that being the case, it is incumbent on people \nwho feel that way to say that we need to revisit this. We need to pull \nthis law out root and branch and replace it with something that cuts \nthe cost of insurance, that slows the growth rate of health care \nexpenditures and uses market forces and competition, which we use in \nevery aspect of our society except for health insurance.\n\n[[Page S8762]]\n\n  I appreciate our colleague from West Virginia, Senator Jay \nRockefeller. He is retiring at the end of this Congress, but he said \nthe health care law was beyond comprehension.\n  I think we would get over 60 percent of Americans agreeing with that. \nThe law is beyond comprehension and the most complex piece of \nlegislation ever passed by the Congress.\n  I appreciate that sort of candor as compared to the position that, as \nfar as I can tell, is still held by the majority leader, the Senator \nwho controls the flow of legislation on the floor of the Senate and who \nwould have to be involved in bringing a corrected bill to the floor.\n  Our majority leader said this earlier this year: ``This legislation \nis working, and it will be working better once we get the Web site \nup.'' Boy, how nonprophetic that was.\n  And I love this quote: ``ObamaCare is wonderful for America,'' said \nthe majority leader of the U.S. Senate, Harry Reid of Nevada. \n``ObamaCare is wonderful for America. Get over it.''\n  I would hope I would be willing, if I had made such an egregious \nmistake, to say we need to come back and revisit this issue--for the \nbenefit of American families, for the benefit of small businesses that \nwant to create jobs, for the benefit of small cities that having to \nincrease their taxes and do without other services to cover this \nunfunded mandate.\n  So I publicly implore my colleagues at this moment to agree that this \ndidn't work. I never thought it would work, but some people did. But it \nhasn't worked. I guess it is the reason we have elections every 2 \nyears. But I would hope that, even before the 2014 elections, \nRepublicans and Democrats could come together and say: We got this \nwrong. We need to fix it, and we need to do it for the right reasons. \nWe need to do it for the future of this country and for American \nfamilies.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. The Senator from Mississippi mentioned the way this \ncame about and the comments of the majority leader that I can't believe \nhe really believes. It is hard for me to believe he thinks this is \nworking. He is not a fool.\n  I also listened to the debate, as we talked about earlier, on the \nfloor leading up to the vote on Christmas Eve 2009. I listened to the \ndebate last night and today by some of our colleagues. I thought our \ncolleague from Nebraska, Senator Johanns, made a very profound \nstatement.\n  We are fortunate to serve, in my opinion, in the greatest legislative \nbody in the world. The Senator and I spent a number of years in the \nHouse, and that is a great institution also. They are both unusual from \na constitutional legislative standpoint. But in the Senate there are \ncertain rights of the minority that you don't have in the House.\n  The American people know and understand what has happened here; that \nis, 2 weeks ago the Democrats in the Senate broke the rules of the \nSenate to change the rules of the Senate, and they did so in a very \narbitrary and almost mean-spirited way that basically ignored the \narguments of the minority. The minority in the Senate has always had \nrights--up until this rule change a couple weeks ago.\n  The Senator from Nebraska said today that when we were debating on \nthis floor during the late fall leading up to the vote in December \n2009, that because the Democrats had 60 votes, they looked to the \nminority on our side of the aisle and they said: We don't care what you \nsay. His direct quote was, ``Sit down and shut up.'' And the Senator \nfelt a very eerie feeling taking place 2 weeks ago during the debate on \nthis floor, where the Democrats broke the rule to change the rule, and \nthey looked on this side of the aisle and said: We don't care what the \nParliamentarian says. We don't care what the rules of the Senate have \nbeen for decades and decades. We are going to change those rules, and \nyou all can sit down and shut up.\n  I thought what Senator Johanns said was pretty significant, and he \nwas right on track.\n  I will mention one other major concern I have with this bill that I \nam sure my friend from Mississippi has also heard, and that has to do \nwith the safety of personal information relative to this new health \ncare system. ObamaCare opens the door to fraud and identity theft like \nwe have never seen in a public program. When individuals visit the \nexchange and apply for health insurance coverage, they have to provide \nsensitive personal data, such as Social Security numbers and income and \ntax return information. This information is then stored in a Federal \ndata service hub. The proper security safeguards for that Federal data \nhub and other components of the Web site have not been put in place. \nDespite repeated warnings about this, the administration insisted on \nmoving forward.\n  If the rollout of healthcare.gov is an indication of what is to \nfollow, then I agree with Americans who have serious reservations about \nthe security of their personal information when applying for health \ninsurance coverage through the exchanges.\n  The Presiding Officer and I sit on the Intelligence Committee \ntogether, and we hear during our daily briefings about cyber attacks \ntaking place against the U.S. Federal Government, against private \nentities in the United States, as well as against individuals inside \nthe United States.\n  I can only imagine, with all the problems we have seen with getting \nup and simply having this Web site of healthcare.gov running, that some \n15-year-old sitting in his garage somewhere in America--or maybe \nBeijing or Teheran--looking to have some fun could hack into the \ncomputer system and retrieve all the personal information of any \nindividual they wanted to, including their Social Security number.\n  Mr. WICKER. Or more than have fun; engage in real mischief and real \nharm to American citizens.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. The Senator is exactly right. And we obviously know \nwhat that would lead to. Those hackers attacking America today are \ngetting proprietary information as well as financial remuneration, \nunfortunately, in too many instances. And to open your personal \ninformation book to the Federal Government is something that \nrightfully, in my mind, has the American people upset, and it is a \nprovision in this health care plan that certainly is not popular. As \nNancy Pelosi said, let's pass it, and then we will read it and figure \nit out. But here we go again. It is another provision in there nobody \nknew anything about. We had no debate, as the Senator from Mississippi \nreferred to earlier about another issue of the floor of the \nSenate, regarding having to provide personal information.\n\n  Mr. WICKER. If I can underscore that, there is no question that \nbecause of the Snowden matter and because of other breaches of \nconfidentiality and security, Americans are more and more concerned \nabout this issue.\n  I note that our colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, said about \nObamaCare that it is causing fear, doubt, and a crisis of confidence. \nAnd I have to feel that some of the lack of confidence the American \npeople have is the very real concern about security.\n  It is no wonder that a Pew survey released this week shows that 54 \npercent of Americans disapprove of the health care law and only 41 \npercent are in favor of it. Yet my friend mentioned the former Speaker, \nthe current minority leader in the House of Representatives, who just \nthis year said: The implementation of this law is fabulous. Fabulous. \nShe compared it to the Declaration of Independence guarantee of life, \nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness. According to the former Speaker, \nthis is what this is all about.\n  I think Americans and more Members of this body are concluding that \nthis law isn't fabulous, contrary to what the former Speaker said; that \nObamaCare is not wonderful for America, contrary to what the current \nmajority leader of the Senate said. I hope that we could even yet \nrevisit this.\n  I think we only have about 5 minutes to go. If I may comment for one \nbrief moment about the breaking of the rules to change the rules that \noccurred.\n  One would have thought that hardly any nominations were getting \nthrough. To hear our friends on the other side of the aisle justify the \nreason for changing years and years of precedent and for going back on \nan agreement we made midyear, an agreement we made back in January, and \na Gang of 14 agreement made by some of the most distinguished people \never to have served in the Senate--as a matter of fact, the facts are \nthese: Hundreds of\n\n[[Page S8763]]\n\nexecutive nominations on this Executive Calendar have been approved \nwith the slightest blip by this Senate, Republicans and Democrats. Only \nfour nominees were felt to involve such extraordinary circumstances \nthat we were determined to prevent those individuals from taking office \nfor very good reasons, we thought, by the use of the 60-vote rule--only \nfour out of hundreds this year. Yet that was given as an excuse to the \nAmerican people to break the rules to change the rules.\n  It was a sad day. It is the kind of overreach we are seeing this \nweek, which gets us back to the matter at hand and is the kind of very \nunfortunate overreach that has visited so much pain and hardship on the \nAmerican people in regard to their health care and their health \ninsurance coverage.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I will close my comments with two additional anecdotes \nthat really strike at what Middle America is all about and what \nsuffering and economic pain Middle America is going through right now \nas a result of ObamaCare.\n  Michael from Dunwoody, GA, wrote in and said:\n\n       I had a really great policy for $277 a month. The premiums \n     were paid by my Flexplan from my employer and the excess my \n     employer paid to my flex each month kept my balance \n     increasing. I now have about $35,000 accrued.\n       My provider cancelled that plan and my Flex now offers a \n     lesser plan. The premiums went to $550 a month. I actually \n     joined AMAC and used their service to find a plan from a \n     different provider. I must now pay the premiums out of my own \n     pocket as President Obama won't allow me to use my own money \n     from my flex plan to pay these premiums.\n       HOW IS THIS LEGAL?\n       I thought it was my money; apparently it's only my money if \n     I buy what Obamacare says I can buy. I had to choose a plan \n     with a $5,000 deductible to make my premiums affordable.\n\n  Lastly, Mary from Powder Springs writes:\n\n       I am an educator with the Cobb County School System. As a \n     reactionary measure to Obamacare, the State Board of \n     Community Health gave state employees only one company option \n     for our health insurance this year.\n       My premiums were going to be $1,800 per year higher, my \n     deductible was going to be $2,000 higher, and the percentage \n     of what was covered went down. We decided to go with my \n     husband's company plan, but wonder what will happen to that \n     coverage next year when the employer mandate goes into \n     effect.\n\n  Michael and Mary are two average, ordinary Americans we ought to care \nabout in this body. Yet we are throwing them under the bus with \nObamaCare.\n  So as we move forward over the next year, I am in hopes we can \ncontinue to engage on this because these problems are going to get more \nfrequent and they are going to get more disastrous from a financial and \na lack of coverage standpoint. There is going to be an opportunity for \nthis body to come together to look at really changing the ObamaCare \nplan that passed in 2009. Let's come together on a plan that is \nmeaningful, that truly does provide affordable and meaningful health \ncare coverage for all Americans.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). All time has expired.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Susan P. Watters, of Montana, to be United States District Judge for \nthe District of Montana?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Deborah Lee \nJames, of Virginia, to be Secretary of the Air Force.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to the provisions of S. Res. 15 of \nthe 113th Congress, there will now be up to 8 hours of postcloture \nconsideration of the nomination equally divided in the usual form.\n  If no one yields time, time will be equally charged.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n\n\n                          Rules Of the Senate\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are definitely proceeding in an \nunusual manner at this point in time in the history of the U.S. Senate. \nWe are moving under regular order. Nominations are being processed in \nregular order. Votes are being held. Debate is being shut off by the \nappropriate procedures. But it is unusual from what we have been doing \nall year and what we have been doing historically. So I guess the \nquestion is, how did we get to this point? What has happened in the \nSenate that has caused the difficulties we now have?\n  I believe it is becoming clear to our colleagues that actions that \nhave been taking place in recent days have altered the very nature of \nthe Senate, have eroded the collegiality that makes this body work on a \ndaily basis, the kind of actions in which people unanimously agreed to \nallow things to happen different from the regular order, that allowed \nthings to be proceeded up and go faster and move forward. It has been \ndone on a regular basis.\n  But we have had a conflict, an alteration in the rules of the Senate \nthat is so serious that it impacts the very nature of this institution \nand causing great concern. We have a lot of new Members in the Senate, \nand they have not seen how the Senate operated just in the--what?--16, \n17 years I have been here. I have seen the great change, and it is a \nconcern to me, and it is even different from that more classical \noperation before I came here.\n  It is not healthy, it is not good, and it cannot be allowed to just \nhappen without any discussion, without any full understanding of how \nthe majority leader of the Senate has accrued to himself powers never \nbefore allowed to be held by the majority leader of the Senate. It has \naltered the very nature of the debate here and the processes that \ninvolve our constitutional responsibility.\n  So I believe we need to talk about it. I believe we need to \nunderstand it, and somehow we need to alter what has happened.\n  I remember when I came to the Senate. Senator Robert Byrd loved the \nSenate. Senator Robert Byrd said there are two great Senates: the Roman \nSenate and the U.S. Senate. He gave all of us new Members a lecture \nabout the great heritage of which we are a part. He wrote a book on the \nrules of the Senate.\n  We have had rules for quite a number of years. The standing rule of \nthe Senate is rule XXII. It is a clear, simple directive passed by two-\nthirds of the Members of the Senate duly chosen and sworn.\n  This is what rule XXII says. It is not confusing. It is very clear. \nIt was adopted by two-thirds of the Senate.\n  It says: A motion signed by 16 Senators--that is, to negotiate \nsomething, to shut off debate, you have to have 16 Senators to file a \nmotion--a motion signed by 16 Senators to bring to a close the debate \nupon any measure, motion, or other matter pending before the Senate--\nany measure, motion, or other matter pending before the Senate, which \nincludes nominations--shall be decided by three-fifths of the Senators \nduly chosen and sworn, except on a measure or motion to amend the \nSenate rules, in which case the necessary affirmative vote shall be \ntwo-thirds of the Senators present and voting.\n  Crystal clear. The rules of the Senate are to be decided by two-\nthirds. To bring to a close debate upon any measure, motion or matter \npending before the Senate requires three-fifths, 60 votes out of our \n100. That is the rule of the Senate. That has guided us for \ngenerations. It has worked well. I am going to talk a little bit about \nthis, and I could go into even greater detail and say that the process \nhas been working very well.\n  Senators on the Republican side have treated the nominees of \nPresident Obama very well, far better than were the nominations of \nPresident Bush when he came here in 2000. When I was here in 2000, his \nnominees were hammered, filibustered for the first time in history, \nheld by some of the same people who now with great outrage attack those \nwho have blocked and filibustered a few of the Obama nominees--just a \nfew.\n  So it is really almost unbelievable to me that we are at this point \nof the rules process of the Senate. So how did it happen? Precisely \nwhat happened? I think the American people need to know.\n  Senator Reid, apparently irritated that he was not able to have three \njudges confirmed to the District of Columbia Circuit bench, decided \nthat he was going to change the rules. Senator Schumer said he was \ngoing to get those nominees confirmed one way or the other.\n  I am the ranking Republican on the budget committee. This country is \nspending money it does not have on things it does not need on an \nabsolutely regular basis. We are wasting taxpayers' money. So the \nactions of the President and the Senate majority that filled three \nseats on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals were scrutinized.\n  In my opinion, I believe it is uncontestable that these positions did \nnot need to be filled. They just didn't. They do not have enough work \non that court to need these judges. The average caseload per judge on \nthe DC Circuit was 149 per judge--149. Well, what does that mean? Is \nthat a lot or not a lot? It is not a lot. It is the lowest number by \nfar of any circuit in America. The caseload has been steadily \ndeclining.\n  I have been chairman in the Judiciary Committee of the court \nsubcommittee that deals with these issues. Senator Grassley was there \nbefore I came. I have been ranking member and am now ranking member on \nthat subcommittee. We have been watching the DC Circuit. The cases \ncontinue to decline. So with 8 judges now active on that court, they \nare down to 149 cases per judge. Well, is that a lot? How about my \ncircuit, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, GA, covering \nFlorida, Alabama, and Georgia? How many cases do they have per judge? \nHold your hat: 740. That is how many my court handles per judge.\n  They say they do not need more judges. In fact, they prefer not to \nhave the court get so large that there will not be a coherent court and \nbe able to have consistency in the law. That has been their tradition \nfor many years, more than 20 years. They do not want more judges. \nActually, we know that the judges on the DC Circuit have said they do \nnot need more judges. We know they took off last summer. They take off \nlong summers, unlike any other court of appeals, from May 16 to \nSeptember 16. They did not hold court from May 16 to September 16.\n  The next lowest circuit in America has almost twice as many cases per \njudge as the DC Circuit. I know that our frugal Presiding Officer, as \nGovernor of Maine, as part of that Yankee frugality for which they are \nfamous, he knew how to manage his money when he was Governor. It costs \n$1 million a\n\n[[Page S8765]]\n\nyear, we are told, to maintain a Federal judgeship. That is a lot of \nmoney. So we are adding three judges to the DC Court of Appeals who \nabsolutely are not needed--absolutely are not needed.\n  This Senate refused to confirm them. We voted not to confirm these \njudges and blocked moving the final vote. They lacked the three-fifths \nvote to confirm those judges. But Senator Schumer said: We are going to \nget them done one way or the other. We do not worry about principle. We \ndo not worry about law. We do not worry about the heritage of the \nSenate. We do not worry about whether we need those judges. We are \ngoing to put them in anyway.\n  Well, I did not pay much attention to that. I did not think he was \nserious about that, I have to tell you. I thought our Democratic \ncolleagues would really understand that we have confirmed almost all of \nthe President's nominees. Only two or three prior to that had failed \nout of the whole 6 years he has been in office. President Bush lost \nfive on 1 day--good nominees--for no other reason than they had a \nclassical view of restraint on the part of a judge.\n  We do not need these judges. As a matter of fact, Senator Grassley \nand I offered and passed legislation that moved one of the DC Circuit \njudges to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in California, a liberal \ncircuit. But that circuit wanted more judges and appeared to need more \njudges to handle the caseload.\n  We moved one. We have legislation to move others to someplace in \nAmerica where they are needed because we are going to have to fill and \nadd some judgeships around the country because, unlike the DC Circuit, \nsome of the areas in our country are adding cases and are needing \njudges and are short of judges. So good management simply says that you \ntake them from where you do not need them and you move them to places \nwhere you do need them and you serve the interests of the American \ntaxpayer and you protect the money they send us. We have a holy charge \nto protect every single dollar extracted from every American.\n  The former Speaker, the Democratic leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi, \nsaid: We have cut all we can cut. We cannot find any more waste in our \ngovernment. There is nothing left to cut.\n  Well, there are places left to cut. These three judges on the DC \nCircuit are just one of thousands, tens of thousands of places we could \nsave the money we are spending that we do not need to be spending, that \ndoes not help America, does not make us stronger and does not benefit \nthe rule of law.\n  So how did it happen? What happened that so upset Senator Reid? The \nmajority leader is one of 100, puts his britches on one leg at a time. \nHe does not get to dictate to this Senate. He gets to stand right \nthere, and because his Presiding Officer is selected by Senator Reid--\nhe is the majority leader--the Presiding Officer will always recognize \nhim first.\n  It is done when Republicans have the majority. It is done when the \nDemocrats have the majority.\n  He asked for recognition and received it. This is how he changed the \nrules of the Senate that require a three-fifths vote to shut off \ndebate. Remember, a change of the rules of the Senate is supposed to \ntake a two-thirds vote, 67 votes.\n  He said to the Presiding Officer at that point, the President pro \ntempore of the Senate, Senator Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, a man who is most experienced in all of these matters--this \nis what Senator Reid said, and it makes the hair on the back of my neck \nstand up.\n  I talked to a reporter, an experienced, well-known reporter, the \nother day. He was talking about it, and he said--he didn't ask for \nconfidentiality. He probably used my name.\n  He said: I didn't think he was going to do it, and when it started, \neverybody in the newsroom just stopped and we looked.\n  Wow. Because this was a big deal. This was a huge event in the \nhistory of the Senate. This is what Senator Reid said and everybody \nneeds to know how it happened.\n  He said, ``I raise a point of order that the vote on cloture under \nrule XXII for all nominations other than for the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States is by majority vote.''\n  The vote on cloture to shut off debate, he moved that under rule \nXXII. He said ``under rule XXII'' that the vote on cloture to shut off \ndebate for all nominations ``other than for the Supreme Court''--he \nthought of that, I suppose--``is by majority vote.''\n  Rule XXII says, `` . . . a motion signed by sixteen Senators, to \nbring to a close the debate on any measure, motion, other matter \npending before the Senate . . . shall be decided . . . by three-fifths \nof the Senators duly chosen and sworn.''\n  The majority leader of the Senate, knowing precisely what rule XXII \nsaid, stood right there and asked the chairman, the Presiding Officer, \nto pretend that this is not a rule of the Senate and that only a \nmajority vote is needed. That is what he said.\n  What did Senator Leahy say? The transcript shows Senator Leahy is the \nPresident pro tempore of the Senate. He said, ``Under the rules, the \npoint of order is not sustained.''\n  It is exactly right. Senator Reid's petition that it ought to be \ndecided by a majority vote couldn't be sustained because it is \nabsolutely in violation of the rules of the Senate. Senator Leahy so \nruled, as he was advised, I am sure, by the Parliamentarian, also \nselected by Senator Reid.\n  There is no question about this. There is absolutely no question \nabout it.\n  But there is this little deal that on a matter where a \nParliamentarian rules on matters dealing with the rules of the Senate, \nsomebody can ask and appeal the ruling of the Senate, an appeal of the \nwhole Senate to check to decide whether the Parliamentarian is correct.\n  They used this corrective measure to allow the will of the Senate to \ninterpret the rules of the Senate, to break the rules of the Senate. \nThat is what they did, lemming like, my Democratic colleagues, surely \nnot understanding what they did, one by one they walked up and voted or \nvoted from their chairs in support of Senator Reid.\n  All but two of the Democratic colleagues voted--over 50, a majority \nvoted--to say that the rules of the Senate don't mean what they say and \nthey will just ignore them.\n  The net effect was that once that was ruled, then cloture could be \nshut off, debate could be shut off with a simple majority. That became \nthe rule of the Senate in a way contrary to the rules of the Senate \nwhich say ``--except on a measure or motion to amend the Senate rules, \nin which case the necessary affirmative vote shall be two-thirds. . . . \n''\n  To change that rule of the Senate that says it takes 60 votes to shut \noff debate through a majority to shut off debate would take two-thirds. \nThey just ignored that.\n  The reason it is so important is every other rule, tradition, and \nstandard of the Senate is at stake. A very wise Senator, Carl Levin of \nMichigan, a longtime Democrat, chairman of the Armed Services Committee \non which I sit, I have watched him work all the years I have been in \nthe Senate and I have been very impressed. He and I don't agree on many \nof the substantive issues and how we approach spending, taxes, and \nregulations. He knows how to preside in a committee to give everybody a \nfair shake. He said we shouldn't do this. He pleaded with his \nDemocratic colleagues not to vote in this fashion.\n  He said that if you can change a rule in this fashion, if you can \nalter the rules of the Senate this way, there are no rules. There is no \npower, no protection for the minority, other than the simple power of \nthe majority vote. There is nothing in this Senate if we follow this \nprecedent that can't be changed by a simple ruling of an appeal of the \nchair and all those rights that have always protected the minority.\n  That is a very dangerous thing. It was played with and talked about \nby the Republicans on one occasion when the entire ground rules of the \nSenate for confirmation of judges was altered. We found ourselves with \na stunning filibuster of 10 of the first 12 nominees President Bush \nsubmitted for the court of appeals, but it was never executed. An \nagreement was reached to alter that.\n  Indeed, when this tension rose at the beginning of this year, Senator \nReid agreed that changes in the process gave the majority party and the \nPresident\n\n[[Page S8766]]\n\nmore power to expedite nominees and gave them more power over the \nminority. He was able to secure that agreement in a way consistent with \nthe heritage of the Senate. He said at that time he was not going to \nseek to change the rules of the Senate again.\n  I wish to say this should not be looked at as a little matter. It is \na very big matter. I am extraordinarily troubled by it. That is part of \nwhat is happening now.\n  I wish to mention one more thing on a chart I have that talks about \nthe caseload for the DC Circuit. Look at these numbers. This is the \nEleventh Circuit, 720 cases per judge, not 740, as I said earlier. Look \nat these caseloads per judge until you get down to the DC Circuit, 149 \nper judge.\n  We didn't need to add three judges. The existing, active judges, not \ncounting the vacancy, just 8 active judges, only have 149 cases per \njudge. We don't need to add one new judge.\n  The President was determined to try to shove that through, and that \nhe did, and got us into all of this turmoil when the Senate didn't \nagree--three-fifths of the Senate not agreeing to move forward to a \nfinal vote resulting in the lack of confirmation of those judges. That \nis where we are.\n  In the Fifth Circuit in Texas, there are 488 cases per judge; the \nNinth Circuit in California, 472 cases per judge. The Second Circuit, \nhandling some of the more complex cases in America, Manhattan in New \nYork, there are 440 cases per judge. We can see the caseload averages \naround the country.\n  The average is 384 cases per judge. That is about 2\\1/2\\ times the \nnumber of cases that the DC Circuit has per judge. That is why there \nwere objections to the nominees. I said when this happened most of \nthese nominees would probably be confirmed, because if it hadn't been \nfor the low caseload, that there was not a question--I suggested, \nwithout going into detail, the nominees were probably qualified and it \nwould be unlikely that they would be filibustered because of lack of \nqualifications, although I was probably wrong in that for at least one \nof them. Pillard's nomination represents a judge whose views on the law \nare so outside the mainstream that I don't believe, having studied that \nrecord subsequent to those remarks, she should have been confirmed on \nthe merits.\n  My basic view, as I stated from the very beginning, is not a question \nof the merits of the nominees. The question was do we need to spend $3 \nmillion a year for these three judges when we have other circuits that \nneed judges and they don't need them there.\n  I will share with you what President Obama was looking for in his \nnominee.\n  Ms. Pillard went to Yale and Harvard. She also spent 6 years with the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP Legal Defense and \nEducation Fund. She is a long-time member of the very liberal activist \nAmerican Constitution Society. They believe in activist judges and \nadvocate for that. In recent years an activist conservative legal \nmovement has--she has been a professor at Georgetown. She has written \nmany controversial articles and has a record exclusively devoted, it \nseems to me, as a very extreme, progressive, judicial philosopher who \nsays judges do not need to be objective and are empowered to read the \nmeanings of the Constitution to advance an agenda. It seems to be in \nharmony with President Obama's openly stated views about what he looks \nfor in judges, and that is a judge who is empathetic. He has empathy.\n  What does that mean, ``empathy''? What it means is he wants a judge \nnot committed to law. That is what it means.\n  What is empathy? Feelings, ideology, politics--that is what it sounds \nlike to me.\n  The American heritage of law is based on objective criteria, the rule \nof law. Judges take an oath to serve under the Constitution of the \nUnited States and the laws of America. They are under them. They serve \nthe law. They don't write the law. They don't amend the law. They don't \nchange the law. They don't change the meaning of words in our laws or \nour Constitution to meet some empathetic feeling they have, some \npolitical agenda they have. And the American people are on to it. They \nknow this is happening too much. They do not like it. They want it to \nstop. They do not want this kind of judge on the bench.\n\n  But many of our great law schools, many of our judicial philosophers \nand writers think this is all great. They think we need this kind of \nthing. We need to advance the law. That is what they say, and the hero \nto them is the one who comes up with some gimmick to reinterpret the \nplain meanings of our Constitution to have it say what they want it to \nsay at a given time--to help decide a lawsuit they would like to see \nhelped to advance an agenda.\n  It is really part of a post-modern approach to life, to law. Senator \nReid's nuclear option execution is also a post-modern power thing. It \nis the result, it is the end, it is the ideology, it is the revolution. \nAdvance the cause. No rules apply.\n  Some may say: Jeff, you are too hard. You shouldn't say that. That is \nexactly what it is, I have to say, in my belief. Remember, in 2001, \nwhen President Bush got elected, there were virtually no filibusters. A \nfew judges had problems that were held up for a while, but there were \nno filibusters of judges. The Democrats met in retreat--Laurence Tribe, \nMarcia Greenberger, Cass Sunstein were there, according to the New York \nTimes, and they came out of the retreat with a decision, and the \ndecision was to alter the ground rules of confirmations. They \nimmediately accepted the two nominees President Bush had submitted that \nwere Democrats. One of them hadn't been confirmed under President \nClinton so he renominated them. They took those two and confirmed them. \nThey blocked ten great judges, great nominees, and this went on for \nover a year.\n  There was vote after vote after vote, and they steadfastly--Senator \nSchumer, the leader--blocked those judges from being voted on by a \nfilibuster, because there weren't 60 votes to shut off debate to effect \ncloture. So this went on for an extraordinary time, and at some point \nthe threat was that the nuclear option would be executed. So a group of \nSenators met and said: Look, let's not change the rules of the Senate \nby breaking the rules of the Senate. Let's reach an agreement. And this \nis what they said. They said: You shouldn't filibuster judges any more \nunless there are extraordinary circumstances to justify it. Normally, \nyou should just vote yes or no for the judge. In most cases yes or no \nshould be the vote, and serious filibusters of nominees should not \noccur except for extraordinary circumstances.\n  I thought that was OK. I didn't really think we should filibuster, \nperiod. But it seemed to be a reasonable compromise in a political body \nthat would do the right thing for the confirmation process. We have \nbeen operating under that since 2002, I guess it was when that \nagreement was reached. I thought it was pretty good, actually. I was \nsort of proud of the way that came out. Therefore, President Obama has \nhad very few filibusters.\n  But when this gang of 14 reached their agreement, and it sort of was \nadopted by the Senate, there were ten judges being filibustered out of \nthe first batch of judges President Bush had nominated. What came of it \nwas that five were confirmed and five failed. So on one day, five \njudges were defeated without, in my opinion, anything like a \njustifiable basis to defeat those judges. But that is the way it was. \nWe agreed to it. Five judges were blocked and never got to serve; five \nmore were confirmed.\n  And who orchestrated that? It was Senator Reid. He complained \nmightily when anybody would even think about ending the right to \nfilibuster a judge, and Senator Schumer was leading the filibusters.\n  So when the three judges that were nominated for absolutely unneeded \nseats on the DC circuit were blocked, you would have thought this was \nthe first time in history anybody had ever been blocked from being a \njudge in this Senate. And they went and changed the rules of the \nSenate. It is just unbelievable to me that we are at this point.\n  I truly believe that President Obama's nominees were treated fairly. \nI believe they have been evaluated fairly, and only a very few have \nbeen blocked.\n  On one day Senator Reid filed cloture on 17 nominations. It was \ntotally set up, and do you know what he said? He said it was because we \nwere filibustering these. Every time he filed cloture he said a \nfilibuster was occurring.\n\n[[Page S8767]]\n\nNone of these judges were blocked. All of these judges got confirmed. \nThere was not even a vote on cloture for the 17. Yet when he claimed \nthere was some unprecedented number of filibusters in the Senate, he is \ncounting that. There has not been this situation.\n  So this is part of the tension we are involved in, and we remember \nthat brooding over all of this is the Affordable Care Act--Obamacare--\nand how that legislation was opposed by a substantial majority of \nAmericans, consistently 2 to 1. Virtually 2 to 1 consistently the \nAmerican people rejected ObamaCare. They told this Congress not to pass \nit. We did everything we could on the Republican side to keep it from \npassing. We pleaded with our colleagues not to do this.\n  But, oh no, they had to pass it. President Obama wanted it, and they \nwere going to pass it. We would find out later what was in it. That was \nliterally the gist of what happened.\n  Senator Scott Brown from Massachusetts--liberal Massachusetts, the \nhome of Ted Kennedy, who believed in government's involvement in health \ncare--was elected on a promise in Massachusetts to be the vote to kill \nit. There was a vacancy. Senator Kennedy's death had created this \nvacancy, and Senator Brown campaigned to kill and be the vote that \nwould deny the Democrats the 60th vote, in essence.\n  So what did they do? They used the reconciliation budget process to \npass this monumental policy change in America in a way that kept Scott \nBrown--and the American people, through the electoral process--from \nending this piece of legislation that put us in the position we are in \ntoday, where you don't get to keep your doctor, you don't get to keep \nyour health care, where deductibles are going through the roof, where \nthe price of insurance is going up, where people are not being hired, \nwhere two-thirds of the people who get a job this year in America only \nget a part-time job, which is clearly being driven by business \ninterests in trying to avoid being caught up in the obligations of the \nAffordable Care Act. But the Democrats insisted.\n  Senator Reid has used every parliamentary maneuver possible to block \nany votes that would actually fix this bill or alter it in any way.\n  So I just have to say we are at a point where we have to wonder \nwhether democracy is happening in the Senate.\n  So we go back home. People get elected to the Senate. They campaign, \nand they say they want to go to Washington and change ObamaCare. Have \nwe had a single vote this year to change ObamaCare? No, because Senator \nReid knows how to fill the tree and block any votes and keep it from \nhappening. We are not voting on it.\n  The House has repeatedly passed all kinds of legislation and sent it \nto the Senate, supposedly to cause us to respond to it, to review the \nlegislation, to have votes, offer amendments and see what kind of \nresponse we would have to fixing the problems with ObamaCare. But what \nhappens? Senator Reid obstructs that process. He does not allow these \nvotes to occur. They might as well have thrown their legislation down \nthe well.\n  What good is it for the House to send a bill to the Senate if it \nnever gets brought up on the most important issue facing our country \ntoday--health care? We can't even have a debate about it or vote about \nit. Is this the great Senate that Robert Byrd referred to?\n  What about the Defense bill? The Defense bill is over here now. It \nspends over $500 billion--about half of the discretionary spending the \nUnited States Congress spends. What are we told? We are told the Senate \nis too busy. We can't bring up the Defense bill and have an amendment. \nNo more amendments. The two little amendments that were voted on in an \nentire week are all we are going to get. No more amendments will be \naccepted. We are going to pass the bill as it is or we can vote no on \nit.\n  Why? Why? Because Senator Reid knows there are some very important \nissues involved in the Defense bill and they are controversial. People \nhave different views about them, and some people on his side of the \naisle don't want to vote on those because they have to stand up before \ntheir constituents and before America and before the world and actually \ncast a vote and be accountable for their tenure in the Senate.\n  Members on this side, such as Senator Tom Coburn, have ideas to fix \nthe Defense Department and to save money. But Senator Reid won't give \nhim a vote on it, and he objects. Senator Reid says: Senator Coburn, \nyou are obstructing. You are one of those Republican obstructionists. \nYou don't get a vote, Senator Coburn. I decide who votes here. I have \nfilled the tree. I know how to fill the tree. I am the majority leader, \nand if you want a vote, you have to ask me, and I'm not giving you any \nmore votes. I have had enough of you guys.\n  That is kind of the way it has been. It is the way it has been with \nthe ObamaCare bill and with the Defense bill. The very idea that \nnational security is at stake and we have a $500 billion Defense bill--\nnow, I'm on the Armed Services Committee, and we tried to work \ntogether. We basically had an almost unanimous vote on it. Last year we \nhad a unanimous vote on the Defense bill. But there are still matters \nwe carry to the floor with the full understanding there will be debate \nand votes on those disputed issues and the whole Senate would get to \nvote on them. They are not being allowed to vote on those.\n  This is unusual, colleagues. This has never happened in the history \nof the Senate. There was a study that found in the last 28 years \nprevious to Senator Reid, the tactic of filling the tree to limit \ndebate was done 40 times. Since Senator Reid has been the majority \nleader, he has done it 77 times. It is every time, really. He is in \ncomplete control of the amendment process in the Senate.\n  We had a Democratic colleague who said he thought he had to get \napproval of the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, before he could \nget his amendment voted on. Why? Well, Senator Reid says the \nRepublicans filed 20 amendments. Senator Reid says: You can only have \nthree. So he starts with Senator McConnell, and Senator McConnell says: \nThat is not enough, Senator Reid. You can get five, but I want to \napprove them. I suppose Senator McConnell may say: How many are you \ngoing to have? I want to know what they are before I reach an agreement \nwith you.\n  So I suspect it may be true that we have Democratic Senators having \nto ask the minority leader of the Senate for approval to get their \namendments up.\n  That is not the way this should operate. It has never operated that \nway. Our history is open and free debate, unlimited debate in which the \ngreat issues of our time can be discussed here and actually voted on. \nAnd our constituents back home, if they don't like the way we are \nvoting, can vote us out of office and send somebody else up here. So \npolitics is driving it. There is no other reason.\n  The contention is that there wasn't enough time to vote on the \nDefense bill, but the Defense bill was on the floor an entire week. We \ncould have had 10 votes a day, 15 votes a day easily on the Defense \nbill.\n  Senator Inhofe, the ranking Republican on the Armed Services \nCommittee, told Senator Reid he had limited the number of amendments \nthat Senators on our side had to 25, and those could have been done \neasily in a week. But what was also true, as Senator Inhofe noted, was \nthat a lot of those votes would actually never occur because a person \nwould realize they didn't have the votes to pass, the manager of the \nbill would agree to some of the amendments, or something else would \nhappen. So it is very unlikely that many votes would have been cast. \nBut that is what we have done in the past. We have had 2 and 3 weeks of \ntime spent on the Defense bill, and we have had multiple amendments--\n30, 40, 50 amendments--and that has just ended.\n  So here we are, at a time when our country has a crisis on its hands, \nthe American people are suffering from a massive takeover of health \ncare that was rammed through this body against their will, and they \nstill remain steadfastly opposed to it. Those of us who share those \nsame concerns and want to change and alter this bill that is damaging \nto our economy, that is damaging health care, that is hammering the \nmiddle class, we can't even get votes on it because we have a leader\n\n[[Page S8768]]\n\nwho has dictated how things are done here.\n  This has to end. It has to end. It cannot continue. I don't see how \nany Member of this body can go back home if they are a Democrat and \nsay: I couldn't get up an amendment.\n  Why?\n  Well, Senator McConnell wouldn't let me.\n  I go back home to my State, and others go back home to their States, \nSenator Toomey goes back to Pennsylvania and says: I offered all these \namendments to improve ObamaCare.\n  His constituent says: Well, did you vote on it?\n  No.\n  Why not?\n  Senator Reid wouldn't let me.\n  Where did this become part of the history of our country? Is this \nwhat we teach our children in grade school about how democracy is \nsupposed to work? No. It has to end.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to share these remarks tonight. We are \nat a point where this Senate has to stand, reverse the trends that have \nbeen going on, and ensure that we operate in an open way. People have \nto vote and vote and vote so they can be held accountable to the people \nwho sent us here. And when we make people mad, they have every right to \nvote us out of office. We don't have any right to come here and hide \nunder our desks, not to expose ourselves, not to let people know how we \nreally feel and how we have really been moving the country.\n  So I think the tea party rightly has concerns about that kind of \nthing, and I hope we can make progress to improve this situation that \nis essential for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise as we consider the nomination of \nDeborah Lee James as Secretary of the Air Force, and I wish to touch on \nsome of the points that were made by the Senator from Alabama.\n  I wish to state how much I appreciate his leadership, especially as \nthe ranking member of the Budget Committee, his consistent leadership \nand fighting for fiscal discipline and putting our country back on a \nsustainable fiscal path, his commitment to an open amendment process, \nthe opportunity to have vigorous debate in the Senate so that this body \ncan work its will, and, of course, his work on the Armed Services \nCommittee. I appreciate all of that, and I appreciate him being here \ntonight.\n  I do think it is important we have a discussion about how we got \nhere, a discussion about the circumstances that have led to this \ncompletely unprecedented moment.\n  In the entire history of the Republic, we have never found ourselves \nin this circumstance where a majority party has decided that they alone \nshould have sole say in who shall be appointed to the executive branch \nand who shall have the lifetime appointments to our Federal bench. I am \none who believes this will very likely have very detrimental effects \nbecause when one party can ram through their choice without having to \ngive any regard whatsoever to what the other party thinks, then what do \nwe get? We get legislation like ObamaCare and we have extremes in the \nnominations that will eventually be confirmed.\n  Any President comes under pressure from the extremes within his or \nher party to put the most extreme people in positions of power, and the \nSenate has played a vital role in moderating that extreme, that \ntendency, that pressure, because it has virtually always been the case \nthat neither party has 60 votes. Very seldom has it been the case that \na party has had over 60 votes. So it has almost always been necessary \nthat there be some broad bipartisan consensus on the people who will \npopulate powerful posts as regulators and lifetime appointments to the \nbench.\n  That is no longer the case. There is no such check, and I fear that \nthe consequences will be very detrimental: extremism in the regulatory \nagencies, volatility as we move from one administration to another and \nwe have these swings, and probably the most disturbing of all is the \nreal danger that the greatest source of pride Americans can have in \ntheir Federal Government, which has been an independent, nonpartisan \njudiciary--that very judiciary becomes a creature of the political and \nbecomes captured by the political branches of government. That is the \ndanger, and that is why it is important we consider how we got here and \nwhy we got here.\n  It is particularly extraordinary when we consider the statements of \nsome of the leaders on the other side of the aisle, Democratic leaders \nwho for years were passionately opposed to doing exactly what they did \nlast month. The majority leader himself just a short time ago said:\n\n       The right to extend the debate is never more important than \n     when one party controls Congress and the White House. In \n     these cases, a filibuster serves as a check on power and \n     preserves our limited government.\n\n  Senator Schumer, the senior Senator from New York, put it this way:\n\n       The checks and balances which have been at the core of this \n     Republic will be evaporated by the nuclear option. The checks \n     and balances say that if you get 51 percent of the vote, you \n     don't get your way 100 percent of the time.\n\n  That was Senator Schumer and Senator Reid. There are many other \nquotes on the record in which they vigorously opposed the notion of \ndenying the minority any say in the confirmation process when it was \ndiscussed but never implemented some years ago. So why would they have \nsuch a 180-degree reversal? Why would their opinion and that of the \nvast majority of my Democratic colleagues have changed to the point \nwhere they would actually take this absolutely unprecedented step?\n  Senator Reid gave an explanation on the day he inflicted these \nchanges on this body. I will quote from Senator Reid's explanation. He \nsaid:\n\n       There has been unbelievable, unprecedented obstruction. For \n     the first time in the history of our Republic, Republicans \n     have routinely used the filibuster to prevent President Obama \n     from appointing his executive team or confirming judges.\n\n  That is what Senator Reid said. So it has been about Republicans \nobstructing the President from appointing his executive team and \nconfirming judges.\n  Well, let's consider the case of judges to start. Let's take a look \nat this chart. Since President Obama has been President, there are some \nvery simple, very easily verifiable facts we can look at.\n  The President has sent nominees for the Senate to consider since he \nbecame President. The Senate has confirmed 215 of those nominees, but \nthe Senate has blocked 2 of his nominees. These are verifiable facts. \nThey are not in dispute. These are the numbers. In total, the President \nhas sent us the names of 217 candidates for judgeships, and 215 were \nconfirmed and are sitting judges and 2 were blocked.\n  There is another category of nominees; that is, the executive branch \nnominees--the various agencies and regulatory bodies that are subject \nto senatorial confirmation. The President has sent us a total of 1,494 \nnonjudicial executive branch nominees. The Senate has confirmed 1,492. \nThe Senate has blocked two.\n  The math is not that complicated. The President has nominated and \nsent to the Senate for our consideration a total of 1,711 altogether, \nand the Senate has confirmed 1,707. The Senate has blocked four. If you \ndo the math, that is a confirmation rate of 99.8 percent.\n  So of all the nominees the President has sent to this body to be \nconfirmed, we haven't actually confirmed every one; we have only \nconfirmed 99.8 percent of them. Of the 1,711, we have blocked 4.\n  I would suggest that the power of advice and consent--the \nConstitution says advice and consent; it doesn't just say advice. If it \njust said advice, then that would clearly imply that the President \ncould ignore the advice if he chose. But it doesn't just say advice; it \nsays advice and consent. The power to consent clearly and obviously \nimplies that under some circumstances that consent would be withheld. \nIf not, there is no meaning to this at all.\n  So I would suggest it is patently absurd to suggest that a 99.8-\npercent confirmation rate is a pattern of obstruction, as we have been \naccused of. So that can't be the real reason, obviously. Obviously, \nthis kind of record of almost universally approving Presidential \nnominees can't possibly be the real reason we had this unprecedented \npower grab and rules change.\n  So what was the real purpose? What was the real motivation behind \nthis very dramatic development? I am here\n\n[[Page S8769]]\n\nto tell you that I think it is very clear what the real motivation was. \nThe motivation was to pack the DC Circuit Court of Appeals so that a \npartisan group of judges would validate an agenda that this \nadministration and many of our friends on the other side of the aisle \nwant to impose.\n  That is an outrageous thing to say in some ways. Some people might \nthink that is quite an accusation. What would be my basis for saying \nsomething like that? It would be the fact that Senator Reid and Senator \nSchumer told us that was their reason. They said so. I will get to \ntheir quote, but let me explain why this has been done.\n  The fact is that elections have consequences. The President of the \nUnited States was elected. The Republicans have been enormously \ndeferential in confirming his nominees, among other things.\n  But in 2012 the President wasn't the only person on the ballot. The \nentire House of Representatives was on the ballot, and the American \npeople chose to reelect a Republican majority in the House of \nRepresentatives. Those elections have consequences as well, and one of \nthe consequences of that election--the set of elections that produced a \nRepublican majority in the House and left many Republicans in the \nSenate--is that the more liberal aspects of the President's agenda \ncan't pass in Congress. They are not supported by a majority of the \nAmerican people. They are not supported by majorities in Congress. \nThings like cap and trade, card check, the war on coal, and recess \nappointments don't have support. I don't think they have broad support \nin either body, certainly not enough in the House of Representatives to \npass.\n  So what is a President to do if he can't get his legislation passed \nbut he nevertheless wants to pursue an agenda? Well, one way a \nPresident could choose to do this--especially one who is not interested \nin working with the minority party--and let's face it, ObamaCare is the \nclear example that this President is not interested in the input of \nRepublicans. That was jammed through without a single Republican vote \nin either the House or the Senate. There was no input from Republicans. \nThere was no consideration for what the minority party considered. \nThere was not a broad consensus.\n  It is not surprising that a very short time later there is a big \nmajority of the American people who do not support this bill because it \nwas never designed with enough input and enough buy-in to have that \nbroad consensus. If a President is not interested in working with the \nminority party and he cannot get his legislation through because there \nare not enough members of his party in Congress, the alternative is to \ntry to impose it through the regulatory process, through the agencies, \nthrough the regulators, through the executive branch, which has become \nenormous and enormously powerful.\n  There is only one big hurdle for a President to try to go down this \nroad and that hurdle is that eventually people who are the victims of \nan overreaching group of regulators and administrators and agency \nheads, they have recourse. If they think that a given regulator is \nacting unfairly or illegally or unconstitutionally, they can go to \ncourt and in fact people do that. Guess what court ends up hearing the \nappeals and making what is very typically the final decisions, as a \npractical matter, regarding Federal regulations. Why, it is the DC \nCircuit Court of Appeals. That is the way our Federal system works.\n  In fact, the DC Circuit Court has generally been upholding the laws. \nI believe the evidence is very clear that it is a capable, competent, \nnonpartisan group of talented judges who make decisions as they see \nfit. They call balls and strikes, as referees ought to. Among their \ndecisions, for instance--I am sure I do not agree with all of them but \nthey did block what I thought was an illegal overreach by the EPA, \ninconsistent with the laws regulating EPA. They did not believe the \nPresident had the right to decide when Congress was in recess and make \nappointments that suited him when we were not able to deny consent. \nThat was the DC Circuit Court's decision. This, and several others, \nwere completely unacceptable to some of my Democratic friends. It was \nunacceptable this independent, nonpartisan court might reach decisions \nthat were inconsistent with the liberal agenda.\n  How do we know this was unacceptable? We have some quotes. The senior \nSenator from New York, Mr. Schumer, discussed this. He was speaking to \na group of supporters. It is on the record. He complained that the DC \nCircuit overturned the EPA's ability to regulate existing coal plants. \nHe complained the SEC cannot pass rules unless they do what is called a \ncost-benefit analysis. He complained they struck down the \nadministration's illegal recess appointments to the NLRB. He told a \ngroup of supporters that Democrats ``will fill up the DC Circuit one \nway or another.''\n  That was the quote. It was pretty straightforward, I will give him \nthat. It is pretty candid. We do not like the decisions that are coming \nout of this court so we will pack the court with people who agree with \nour ideology.\n  Senator Schumer was not the only one to make this case. Senator Reid \nhad this to say of the DC Circuit:\n\n       They are the ones who said the President can't have recess \n     appointments. They have done a lot of bad things. So we are \n     focusing very intently on the DC Circuit. We need at least \n     one more. There are three vacancies. We need at least one \n     more and that will switch the majority.\n\n  This is Senator Reid on the DC Circuit: ``We need at least one \nmore,'' obviously referring to a judge. ``We need at least one more and \nthat will switch the majority.'' I think it is pretty clear what was \ngoing on here.\n  Now fast-forward to a few weeks ago. There was just one obstacle to \nputting the people who would agree with Senator Schumer and Senator \nReid on the DC Circuit Court and render the decisions they wanted. The \nobstacle was Republicans were not interested in going along with the \nscheme to pack the court for ideological purposes. They didn't think \nthat was a very good idea. They thought it was probably better to have \njudges who were not there to try to advance a political agenda but \nbelieved their job is to apply the law as written and make sure it is \nconsistent with the Constitution as opposed to pursuing a political \nagenda.\n  Despite the fact that Republicans had to that point confirmed 99.8 \npercent of all the President's nominees, that was going a little bit \ntoo far, to simply blatantly pack the DC Circuit Court, and we said no \nto the three nominees who were people they were intending to pack that \ncourt.\n  When we did, Senator Reid, after publicly promising he was not going \nto change the rules this way just this past summer, nevertheless did \nexactly that. Despite the fact the Senate rules are very clear to \nchange the rules requires a vote of 67 Senators, precisely so there \nwould be a broad consensus behind the rules, Senator Reid changed the \nrules with a mere 51 votes. He broke the rules so he could change the \nrules so the Democratic majority can now steamroll through and \nrubberstamp all of the President's nominees, including those necessary \nto pack the court so they can pursue the agenda they want to pursue. \nThis is not my speculation. These are the quotes from the man who \nhelped to organize this effort.\n  It is, frankly, very reminiscent in a lot of ways of ObamaCare: \nSteamroll through Congress, one party, no input from the other party, \nthe minority party, and a complete disaster. By the way, the other big \nsimilarity is the broken promises. Senator Reid clearly, unambiguously, \nunequivocally, unconditionally made the promise that he was not going \nto change the rules and then he did.\n  Then what have we been hearing about ObamaCare? One broken promise \nafter another.\n  What I am going to do for the remainder of the time that I consume \nthis evening is remind all of us of some of the promises that were \nmade. Then I am just going to read a small sample of the emails that \nhave been coming into my office from Pennsylvanians who have learned \nfirsthand, the hard way, the painful way, just how untrue these \npromises were.\n  The first one is maybe the most famous of the promises. This is the \nPresident's repeated promise, echoed by many others, and I will quote: \n``If you like your health plan you can keep your health plan.'' I don't \nknow how many times the President said it, but we have all seen it, we \nall know it. But what is particularly maddening is we also know \nsomething else. We know everybody who said this always knew this\n\n[[Page S8770]]\n\nwas not true. It was not true because the design of the bill forbids \npeople from keeping health insurance plans in many cases--not all cases \nbut many cases--and the authors of the bill and the supporters of the \nbill and the people who voted for the bill knew full well that one of \nthe purposes of the bill was to establish government-approved standards \nfor all insurance plans.\n  If your plan did not meet those standards, you were going to lose \nyour plan. So this is what some folks have written to us about this \npromise, that if you like your health plan you can keep your health \nplan. This was just 2 days ago, a gentleman from Lancaster County from \nPennsylvania wrote:\n\n       As my Congressional representative, you need to know how \n     ObamaCare is harming my life and health care.\n       I work for a small construction company. My cost for family \n     health care was already over $11,000 per year. We received \n     notification that our policy was being cancelled since it did \n     not comply with the requirements of the ``Affordable Care \n     Act.''\n       Our company looked for the best rates they could find for \n     comparable coverage which did comply. They chose a new \n     insurance company. We just recently were given the costs for \n     next year. My cost to cover myself and my family will be over \n     $17,500 per year (a 59-percent increase). Even with that, the \n     deductibles and out of pocket maximums are higher. This is \n     not ``Affordable Care.'' This would eat up a major part of my \n     income.\n       I attempted to log onto the healthcare.gov website several \n     times, but always get kicked out. I do not hold up much hope \n     that I will get any better rates, because I do not qualify \n     for a credit.\n       We were already struggling to live on my take home pay. We \n     cannot afford to have it reduced by over $6,500. We may have \n     to drop health coverage for my wife or kids, and pay the \n     penalty.\n       I suspect this law will result in many more people losing \n     their health care, at the expense of a few getting free or \n     reduced healthcare.\n\n  Another from a gentleman from Cumberland County last week.\n\n       My wife Barb and I have been trying for almost three weeks \n     to get signed up. . . . all income and health info and \n     private information is on the unsecured Web site and the \n     application is accepted . . . but we have not been able to \n     get on and pick the plan or get our price. . . . so nobody \n     has been paid. Thus our cancelled insurance ends on December \n     31st and we look to be out.\n       A BIG mistake by the folks that voted for this . . . I've \n     had cancer a couple times, my wife has had cancer and we both \n     see our doctors when needed. This ACA will ruin many families \n     if we can't get on to an insurance plan.\n\n  These folks are not only losing the insurance they have, but they \nhave not been able to get an alternative plan.\n  A woman from Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, last week sent me this \nemail.\n\n       We had our healthcare discontinued, and after an appeal \n     were able to get it reinstated, but only for this year. \n     Currently we have a healthcare savings plan, with a \n     deductible of $3,000 a year. . . . In the new plan, our \n     deductible would increase to $12,000 . . . and our premiums \n     would increase to $9,000 a year. How is a middle class \n     married family supposed to pay for that?\n       This is absolutely ridiculous, and this is our situation. I \n     hope every government worker has to purchase their plan \n     through this plan.\n\n  A gentleman from Delaware County sent me this email last week.\n\n       I am 66 and I am on Medicare. My wife, Mary Ann is 63. Her \n     insurance company canceled her ``longstanding'' policy due to \n     the requirements of the ACA. Her ``new'' policy costs $350 \n     more per month. We are on a strict budget. . . . We are the \n     hard working middle class. Who stands for us?\n\n  A small business owner in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, December \n3, 2013:\n\n       I am a small business owner with 3 employees looking for \n     health insurance. My old policy is being canceled and was \n     offered a replacement policy which is 68% higher than the old \n     policy with higher deductibles. I went through the \n     healthcare.gov site and was quoted an individual policy for \n     my family which is 74 percent higher, with higher \n     deductibles.\n       When do I see affordable health care for my family?\n       I have been self-employed for 19 years and have paid for my \n     insurance all these years myself. With deductibles I am \n     looking at $26,000 out of pocket for health insurance this \n     year. Please Help!\n\n  Another promise that we heard--these were people, real people who \nwere demonstrating how untrue was the promise that you could keep the \nhealth insurance plan that you have. But there was another promise we \nheard frequently and that promise was, ``If you like your doctor, you \nwill be able to keep your doctor, period.'' The President added that \nflourish at the end, ``period,'' just to emphasize. These are the \nPresident's words: ``If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep \nyour doctor, period.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/11/senate-section/article/S8770-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/11/senate-section/article/S8770-2", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/11/senate-section/article/S8770-3", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hanrahan, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nhas passed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1471.

A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to eliminate the corn \nethanol mandate for renewable fuel, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce The Corn Ethanol \nMandate Elimination Act of 2013, a bill cosponsored by my distinguished \ncolleagues: Senators Tom Coburn, Kay Hagan, Susan Collins, Patrick \nToomey, Jeff Flake, Bob Corker, Richard Burr, James Risch, and Joe \nManchin.\n  This legislation would eliminate the Federal corn ethanol mandate \nfrom the Renewable Fuel Standard, RFS, while leaving the requirement \nthat oil companies purchase and use low-carbon ``advanced biofuel'' in \nplace.\n  Let me briefly explain why this legislation is necessary.\n  The Renewable Fuel Standard, a statute enacted in 2007, requires oil \ncompanies to use 16.55 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2013. This \nannual requirement increases to 36 billion gallons in 2022.\n  Every year, the law directs that an increasing portion of this \nmandate be met using low-carbon ``advanced biofuel'' that is not \nderived from corn starch and lowers lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions \nby at least 50 percent. I strongly support this provision to lower the \ncarbon emissions from our fuel supply.\n  However, 14.4 billion gallons in 2014, and 15 billion gallons each \nyear after, of the RFS mandate established in statute is met using corn \nethanol, which amounts to a corn ethanol mandate.\n  There are two major problems with continuing to mandate the \nconsumption of more and more corn ethanol in the United States each \nyear.\n  First and foremost, the policy has led us to divert 44 percent of the \nU.S. corn crop from food to fuel, about twice the rate in 2006.\n  As the Associated Press laid out in a recent detailed investigation, \nthe use of corn for ethanol is artificially pushing up food and feed \nprices while damaging the environment. The investigation found \nconservation lands are disappearing.\n  Before Congress enacted the corn ethanol mandate, the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture Conservation Reserve Program grew every year for nearly \na decade. But in the first year after the corn ethanol mandate, more \nthan 2 million acres were removed. Since Obama took office, 5 million \nmore acres have been repurposed.\n  The AP also found that farmers have broken ground on virgin land, \nwhich it described as ``the untouched terrain that represents, from an \nenvironmental standpoint, the country's most important asset.''\n  Using government satellite data, the AP estimates that 1.2 million \nacres of virgin land in Nebraska and the Dakotas alone have been \nconverted to fields of corn and soybeans since 2006.\n  Since 2005, the AP calculates that corn farmers increased their use \nof nitrogen fertilizer by more than two billion pounds.\n  The nitrates from this fertilizer wash into our rivers and flow to \nthe Gulf of Mexico, where they feed algae. When the algae die, the \ndecomposition consumes oxygen, leaving behind a ``dead zone.''\n  This year, the AP reports the dead zone covered 5,800 square miles of \nsea floor, about the size of Connecticut.\n  Using more and more corn for ethanol, in drought years as well as \nyears with bumper crops, has had economic consequences as well as \nenvironmental effects.\n  Higher feed prices have cost our beef, poultry, restaurant, and dairy \nindustries dearly.\n  According to recent testimony in the House of Representatives, from \nOctober 2006 to July 2013, poultry and egg producers have had to bear \nthe burden of higher feed costs totaling over $50 billion.\n  Joel Brandenberger, the President of the National Turkey Federation, \nestimates that the RFS cost the turkey industry $1.9 billion in \nincreased feed expenses last year.\n  According to a recent Price-Waterhouse-Coopers study, the federal \nmandate on corn-based ethanol substantially raised prices and costs \nthroughout the food supply chain. If the RFS mandate were left \nunchanged, it would increase chain restaurant industry costs by up to \n$3.2 billion a year.\n  But the damage has probably been greatest in California, where \ndairymen are drowning under a combination of low milk prices and high \nfeed costs.\n  The milk producers' group Western United Dairymen reports that more \nthan 400 dairies have gone out of business in the past 5 years, \nincluding 105 in the past year alone.\n  ``California's remaining 1,500 dairies are fighting for survival,'' \nthe group said in a recent statement.\n  The bottom line is increased feed prices associated with corn ethanol \nhave bent this industry to its breaking point.\n  But the corn ethanol mandate in the Renewable Fuel Standard also \npresents an additional problem.\n  As Corporate Average Fuel Economy, CAFE, Standards required by the \nTen in Ten Fuel Economy Act drive down gasoline consumption, oil \ncompanies face a ``blend wall'' as the RFS mandate exceeds the limit at \nwhich ethanol can be blended into the fuel supply--determined to be 10 \npercent of total gasoline consumption.\n  This blend wall is about 13.4 billion gallons of ethanol--well below \nthe 2014 corn ethanol statutory mandate of 14.4 billion gallons.\n  According to EPA: ``EPA does not currently foresee a scenario in \nwhich the market could consume enough ethanol . . . to meet the volumes \n. . . stated in the statute.'' This situation is likely to increase \ngasoline prices.\n  While EPA has proposed using a creative statutory interpretation to \nreduce the RFS volumes in 2014, unfortunately EPA's proposal would \nreduce the advanced biofuel side of the RFS mandate by more than 41 \npercent, while it proposes to reduce the corn ethanol portion of the \nmandate by only 10 percent.\n  The Corn Ethanol Mandate Elimination Act would address the blend wall \ndirectly, thereby allowing EPA to continue increasing volumes of low \ncarbon advanced biofuel.\n  This legislation would eliminate the corn ethanol mandate, but it's \nimportant to point out it would by no means eliminate the corn ethanol \nindustry. Refiners will continue to blend com ethanol into the fuel \nsupply in the absence of a mandate for two reasons.\n  First, ethanol is the preferred octane booster used to increase the \nefficiency of gasoline.\n  Second, the wholesale price of ethanol is currently 65 cents per \ngallon less than the wholesale price of unblended gasoline, meaning \nblenders lower their costs and increase profits when they add ethanol \nto gasoline.\n\n[[Page S8774]]\n\n  The multi-billion dollar corn ethanol industry will compete directly \nwith oil based on price without a mandate, and the economic benefits of \nmixing corn ethanol into gasoline would remain.\n  I am aware that the advanced biofuel industry is working to scale and \ncommercialize their technologies, and their investors seek regulatory \nand economic certainty during this period.\n  I am also fundamentally committed to the vitally important public \nhealth protections provided by the Clean Air Act.\n  That is why I would like to make it crystal clear that this \nlegislation is a narrow bill repealing the corn ethanol mandate. \nSenator Coburn and I jointly made this clear when we agreed to the \nfollowing statement:\n  ``We are opposed to a mandate on the use of corn ethanol and plan to \nintroduce the Corn Ethanol Mandate Elimination Act to repeal this \nunwise policy. The bill's language will explicitly clarify that the \nlegislation has no effect on the low-carbon advanced biofuel provisions \nin the Renewable Fuel Standard, and we are both committed to opposing \nany amendment to the bill that would broaden its scope to amend, revise \nor weaken the advanced biofuel provisions or other public health \nprotections provided by the Clean Air Act.\n  If provisions threatening public health were successfully added to \nthe Corn Ethanol Mandate Elimination Act, we would no longer support \nthe bill.\n  I also understand that some in the advanced biofuel industry argue \nthat legislative changes to the corn ethanol portion of the Renewable \nFuel Standard could reduce certainty for their industry.\n  Respectfully, I disagree. The current law is not providing this \nindustry with the certainty it needs.\n  While EPA has some flexibility under the RFS statute to adjust RFS \nmandated volumes, most of that flexibility rests in EPA's power to \nreduce the amount of ``advanced biofuel'' mandated under the RFS.\n  EPA's ability to reduce the corn ethanol mandate under current law \nand current circumstances is far from clear. Its proposal to reduce the \ncorn ethanol mandate in its recently released draft rule for 2014 will \nbe subject to aggressive legal challenge.\n  EPA's lack of discretion has led EPA to propose a rule drastically \nreducing volumes for advanced biofuels, including biodiesel, by 41 \npercent, while it proposes only a modest 10 percent reduction in corn \nethanol volumes.\n  Unless The Corn Ethanol Mandate Elimination Act is enacted, EPA will \nlikely carry forward its proposal to dramatically reduce ``advanced \nbiofuel'' volumes in order to address the blend wall. We believe \neliminating the corn ethanol mandate is a much more responsible \nalternative.\n  This legislation has strong support from the prepared food industry, \ndairy, beef, poultry, oil and gas, engine manufacturers, boaters, \nhunger relief organizations and environmental groups. I would like to \nlist all the organizations that have expressed support for this bill:\n  ActionAid USA; American Bakers Association; American Frozen Food \nInstitute; American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers; American Meat \nInstitute; American Sportfishing Association; Americans for Prosperity; \nBoatU.S.; California Dairies, Inc.; California Dairy Campaign; \nCalifornia Poultry Federation; Clean Air Task Force; Competitive \nEnterprise Institute; Dairy Producers of New Mexico; Dairy Producers of \nUtah; Environmental Working Group; Freedom Action; Georgia Poultry \nFederation; Grocery Manufacturers Association; Idaho Dairymen's \nAssociation; Indiana State Poultry Association; International \nSnowmobile Manufacturers Association; Iowa Turkey Federation; Marine \nRetailers Association of the Americas; Michigan Allied Poultry \nIndustries, Inc.; Milk Producers Council; Minnesota Turkey Growers \nAssociation; National Cattlemen's Beef Association; National Chicken \nCouncil; National Council of Chain Restaurants; National Marine \nManufacturers Association; National Restaurant Association; National \nTaxpayers Union; National Turkey Federation; Nevada State Dairy \nCommission; North American Meat Association; North Carolina Poultry \nFederation; Northwest Dairy Association; Oregon Dairy Farmers \nAssociation; Oxfam; South Carolina Poultry Federation; South East Dairy \nFarmers Association; Southeast Milk Inc.; Specialty Equipment Market \nAssociation; Taxpayers for Common Sense; Texas Poultry Federation; The \nPoultry Federation; Virginia Poultry Federation; Washington State Dairy \nFederation; Western United Dairymen; and the Wisconsin Poultry & Egg \nIndustries Association.\n  The Corn Ethanol Mandate Elimination Act of 2013 would fix both of \nthe problems with the current Renewable Fuel Standard.\n  First, it would eliminate the unnecessary pressure on corn prices and \ncorn production, allowing the multi-billion dollar corn ethanol \nindustry to compete directly with oil based on price, not mandates.\n  Second, it reduces RFS mandated volumes below the blend wall.\n  The bill addresses both problems while maintaining the RFS provisions \nthat encourage the development, deployment and growth of cellulosic \nethanol, algae-based fuel, green diesel, and other low carbon advanced \nbiofuels, maintaining a market for the innovative, nascent, domestic \nindustry that this statute was designed to build up.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1807\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to encourage, enhance, and integrate Silver Alert \nplans throughout the United States and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the \nEarthquake Insurance Affordability Act.\n  This bill will help families and communities quickly recover after \nmajor earthquakes by encouraging local investment in mitigation and \ninsurance coverage.\n  You see, in California, the State with the greatest exposure to \nearthquake damage, only about 1 in 10 homeowners has insurance to pay \nfor earthquake damage. Other States, including Washington, Oregon, \nAlaska, Tennessee, Missouri and Arkansas, also have significant \nearthquake risks and low rates of earthquake insurance.\n  Insurance coverage rates are so low that many believe it has now \nbecome a national crisis.\n  Because when homes aren't structurally sound, and insurance is \nlacking, local earthquake recovery costs quickly become America's \ncosts.\n  The math is simple: less insurance means more Federal spending after \na disaster.\n  For example, the August 2011 Virginia earthquake was devastating to\n\n[[Page S8775]]\n\nhomeowners in and around Spotsylvania County. Most of those homeowners \ndid not have an insurance policy that covered earthquake damage.\n  Mr. Cantor, the House Majority Leader, summed it up: ``Obviously the \nproblem is most people in Virginia don't have earthquake insurance. \nThat is going to be a hardship. If there needs to be money from the \nFederal Government, we'll find the money.''\n  Congress did ultimately find that money. A Federal disaster \ndeclaration was made, and homeowners received more than $16 million to \ncover uninsured losses.\n  But with bigger disasters come bigger uninsured losses.\n  Consider the costs of Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy.\n  The GAO estimates that the federal government provided about $26 \nbillion to homeowners who lacked adequate insurance in response to \nHurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma.\n  Congress provided $16 billion housing recovery for Sandy victims.\n  The bottom line is this: Uninsured homeowners drive up federal \ndisaster spending. So if we can find a way to convert uninsured \nhomeowners into insured homeowners, we will lower federal disaster \nspending and save American taxpayers millions each year.\n  The Earthquake Insurance Affordability Act will do just that. It will \nmake earthquake insurance more affordable and expand access to \ncoverage. It will dedicate non-federal funding to earthquake loss-\nmitigation programs to make houses and communities more resilient.\n  At its core, this legislation would authorize a private-market debt-\nguarantee program. The U.S. Treasury would guarantee certain debt \nissued by eligible state earthquake insurance programs following a \ncatastrophic earthquake.\n  The debt would be limited in amount, and pre-arranged, and the \neligible State programs would be highly creditworthy.\n  By definition, this legislation is designed to promote the use of \nprivate capital to finance earthquake risk. So this means that private \ncapital, not Congressional appropriations, will support rebuilding \nhomes and restoring communities.\n  The Federal guarantee will assure that qualified insurance programs \ncan sell debt at reasonable rates, even during difficult post-disaster \nmarket conditions.\n  By lowering interest rates, insurance programs can spend less on \ninterest and reinsurance, and instead invest that money on rate \nreductions and mitigation.\n  Rate reduction is the key goal; because uninsured homeowners \noverwhelmingly attribute their lack of insurance to the high price of \nthese policies.\n  The California Earthquake Authority, the largest earthquake-insurance \nprovider in the state, estimates the Earthquake Insurance Affordability \nAct will allow them to lower premiums and direct millions of dollars \ninto mitigating homes.\n  That means the bill will not only lower insurance rates, but \nthousands more homes would become more earthquake-resistant.\n  Every homeowner who benefits from this legislation is one less \nhomeowner who will rely on Federal disaster benefits after a \ncatastrophic earthquake--that's millions of taxpayer dollars saved.\n  I know some of my colleagues will be concerned about putting the full \nfaith and credit of our Federal Government behind insurance programs \nthat are working to pay off catastrophic damages. I shared these \nconcerns; and that is why the bill mandates strict criteria for \ndetermining how and when an insurance program can access a Federal \nguarantee.\n  First, the program must be an independent, State-run program.\n  Second, the program must be not for profit. The benefits of a Federal \nguarantee must go to policyholders, not shareholders.\n  Third, and most importantly, only financially sound programs are \neligible. Before any Federal guarantee is offered, the Treasury \nDepartment must carefully confirm, then certify, that the program can \nrepay the debt it incurs.\n  What is more: as a condition getting approved by the Department, the \nprogram must cover all actual and expected costs of conducting these \ncredit reviews and administering the program.\n  Because of these key features, initial estimates from Congressional \nBudget Office staff affirm that this legislation brings no budgetary \nimpact.\n  An independent assessment by the RAND Corporation also found that a \nprogram such as this would likely save tens of millions of dollars \nduring a major disaster.\n  The bill brings other benefits to the taxpayer as well. Under a new \nprovision added to the bill this year, participating State insurance \nprograms must dedicate 2 percent of their Federal guarantee toward \nmitigating vulnerable properties and providing earthquake-hazard \neducation.\n  Again, these mitigation funds will bring real benefits to homeowners, \nwithout appropriating Federal funds.\n  According to the United States Geological Survey, there is a 99.7 \npercent chance that a magnitude 6.7 earthquake will strike California \nwithin the next 30 years.\n  Even more concerning--the USGS forecasts a 46 percent chance that a \nmuch more devastating magnitude 7.5 or higher earthquake will occur in \nCalifornia during the same period.\n  The question is what are we doing to prepare?\n  Will we stick with the status quo; a system where the Federal \nGovernment comes in after the fact and spends billions to try to clean \nup the mess but leaves the community just as vulnerable to the next \ndisaster?\n  Or will we apply the lessons from disasters like the 1994 Northridge \nearthquake where we spent the equivalent of more than $10 billion, and \ntransition to a system where homeowners are encouraged to share the \nfinancial burden by purchasing earthquake insurance and making their \nhomes stronger?\n  In the current budget environment, the choice cannot be simpler. We \ncannot continue to spend billions on disaster relief when reliable, \ncheaper options are available.\n  With a few simple steps, the Earthquake Insurance Affordability will \ncreate an affordable mechanism to help our country prepare for, and \nrecover more quickly from, the major earthquakes that we all know are \njust around the corner. I urge my colleagues to quickly adopt this \ncritical legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 1822.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1822\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Foreign Medical School \n     Accountability Fairness Act of 2013''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       To establish consistent eligibility requirements for \n     graduate medical schools operating outside of the United \n     States and Canada in order to increase accountability and \n     protect American students and taxpayer dollars.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Three for-profit schools in the Caribbean receive more \n     than two-thirds of all Federal funding under title IV of the \n     Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.) that \n     goes to students enrolled at foreign graduate medical \n     schools, despite those three schools being exempt from \n     meeting the same eligibility requirements as the majority of \n     graduate medical schools located outside of the United States \n     and Canada.\n       (2) The National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and \n     Accreditation and the Department of Education recommend that \n     all foreign graduate medical schools should be required to \n     meet the same eligibility requirements to participate in \n     Federal funding under title IV of the Higher Education Act of \n     1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.) and see no rationale for \n     excluding certain schools.\n       (3) The attrition rate at United States medical schools \n     averaged 3 percent for the class beginning in 2009 while \n     rates at for-profit Caribbean schools have reached 26 percent \n     or higher.\n\n[[Page S8776]]\n\n       (4) In 2013, residency match rates for foreign trained \n     graduates averaged 53 percent compared to 94 percent for \n     graduates of medical schools in the United States.\n       (5) On average, students at for-profit medical schools \n     operating outside of the United States and Canada amass more \n     student debt than those at medical schools in the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 4. REPEAL GRANDFATHER PROVISIONS.\n\n       Section 102(a)(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 \n     U.S.C. 1002(a)(2)) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking clause (i) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(i) in the case of a graduate medical school located \n     outside the United States--\n\n       ``(I) at least 60 percent of those enrolled in, and at \n     least 60 percent of the graduates of, the graduate medical \n     school outside the United States were not persons described \n     in section 484(a)(5) in the year preceding the year for which \n     a student is seeking a loan under part D of title IV; and\n       ``(II) at least 75 percent of the individuals who were \n     students or graduates of the graduate medical school outside \n     the United States or Canada (both nationals of the United \n     States and others) taking the examinations administered by \n     the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates \n     received a passing score in the year preceding the year for \n     which a student is seeking a loan under part D of title \n     IV;''; and\n\n       (2) in subparagraph (B)(iii), by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n       ``(V) Expiration of authority.--The authority of a graduate \n     medical school described in subclause (I) to qualify for \n     participation in the loan programs under part D of title IV \n     pursuant to this clause shall expire beginning on the first \n     July 1 following the date of enactment of the Foreign Medical \n     School Accountability Fairness Act of 2013.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. LOSS OF ELIGIBILITY.\n\n       If a graduate medical school loses eligibility to \n     participate in the loan programs under part D of title IV of \n     the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087a et seq.) \n     due to the enactment of the amendments made by section 4, \n     then a student enrolled at such graduate medical school on or \n     before the date of enactment of this Act may, notwithstanding \n     such loss of eligibility, continue to be eligible to receive \n     a loan under such part D while attending such graduate \n     medical school in which the student was enrolled upon the \n     date of enactment of this Act, subject to the student \n     continuing to meet all applicable requirements for \n     satisfactory academic progress, until the earliest of--\n       (1) withdrawal by the student from the graduate medical \n     school;\n       (2) completion of the program of study by the student at \n     the graduate medical school; or\n       (3) the fourth June 30 after such loss of eligibility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/11/senate-section/article/S8776-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 319--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE IN \n  LIGHT OF PRESIDENT YANUKOVYCH'S DECISION NOT TO SIGN AN ASSOCIATION \n                   AGREEMENT WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION\n\n  Mr. MURPHY (for himself, Mr. Johnson of Wisconsin, Mrs. Shaheen, and \nMr. Durbin) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 319\n\n       Whereas, according to a poll conducted in November 2013, a \n     majority of the people of Ukraine supported signing an \n     historic trade and political agreement with the European \n     Union;\n       Whereas a closer association between Ukraine and the \n     European Union has been supported by Ukrainian civil society, \n     business leaders, and politicians across the political \n     spectrum and would bring lasting political, democratic, and \n     economic benefits to the people of Ukraine;\n       Whereas Ukraine successfully passed much of the legislation \n     required to conform to European Union standards for signing \n     an Association Agreement;\n       Whereas, on September 22, 2012, and November 18, 2013, the \n     Senate unanimously passed resolutions calling for a \n     demonstrable end to selective justice in Ukraine and \n     expressing its belief that Ukraine's future lies with \n     stronger ties to Europe, the United States, and others in the \n     community of democracies;\n       Whereas the experience of countries such as Poland, \n     Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia provides a positive example of \n     increased economic opportunity, enhanced personal freedom, \n     and good governance. which can also be realized by Ukraine;\n       Whereas the Government and people of Ukraine have the \n     sovereign right to choose their own foreign policy and \n     economic course, and no other country has the right to \n     determine their political and economic orientation, nor \n     decide which alliances and trade agreements they can join;\n       Whereas, on November 21, 2013, President Viktor Yanukovych \n     suspended Ukraine's preparations for signing the Association \n     Agreement one week before a critical European Union Summit in \n     Vilnius, Lithuania;\n       Whereas the abrupt reversal on the eve of the summit \n     following Russian economic coercion and to protect the narrow \n     interests of some officials and individuals in Ukraine \n     prompted hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians all across the \n     country, especially young people and students, to protest the \n     decision and stand in support of furthering Ukraine's Euro-\n     Atlantic integration;\n       Whereas international nonprofit and nongovernmental \n     organizations provide essential care to needy Ukrainians, yet \n     face direct threats and challenges to their existence and \n     administrative and regulatory impediments, including \n     challenges to operating with the tax-exempt status necessary \n     to maximize the use of funds on the ground and threats to the \n     fabric of civil society vital to democracy in Ukraine;\n       Whereas, on November 30, 2013, at Independence Square in \n     Kyiv, special division police dispersed a peaceful \n     demonstration of students and civil society activists who \n     were calling on President Yanukovych to sign the Association \n     Agreement;\n       Whereas approximately 35 individuals were detained or \n     arrested, and dozens were hospitalized, some with severe \n     injuries;\n       Whereas, on December 9, 2013, raids were conducted on three \n     opposition media outlets and the headquarters of one \n     opposition party;\n       Whereas, on December 11, 2013, Ukrainian authorities \n     conducted an overnight police operation in an attempt to \n     forcefully take control of Independence Square, but were \n     resisted by brave Ukrainians who filled the square and \n     rebuffed the police action;\n       Whereas all three former Presidents of Ukraine have \n     underscored the need to refrain from violence and the \n     importance of engaging in a dialogue with the opposition; and\n       Whereas Ukraine faces an impending economic crisis that can \n     only be solved with long term economic reforms: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) stands with the people of Ukraine and supports their \n     sovereign right to chart an independent and democratic future \n     for their country;\n       (2) urges leaders in the United States and the European \n     Union to continue working together actively to support a \n     peaceful and democratic resolution to the current crisis that \n     moves Ukraine toward a future in the Euro-Atlantic community \n     and a long-term solution to Ukraine's economic crisis;\n       (3) encourages demonstrators and members of the opposition \n     and civil society in Ukraine to continue avoiding the use of \n     violence and engage in a dialogue of national reconciliation;\n       (4) urges all political parties to refrain from hate speech \n     or actions of an anti-Semitic or other character which \n     further divide the Ukrainian people when they need to be \n     united;\n       (5) calls on the Government of Ukraine to refrain from \n     further use of force or acts of violence against peaceful \n     protestors, and to respect the internationally-recognized \n     human rights of the Ukrainian people, especially the freedoms \n     of speech and assembly;\n       (6) condemns the decision by Ukrainian authorities to use \n     violence against peaceful demonstrators on November 30, \n     December 1, and December 11, 2013, and calls for those \n     responsible to be swiftly brought to justice and all detained \n     nonviolent demonstrators to be immediately released; and\n       (7) notes that in the event of further state violence \n     against peaceful protestors, the President and Congress \n     should consider whether to apply targeted sanctions, \n     including visa bans and asset freezes, against individuals \n     responsible for ordering or carrying out the violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/11/senate-section/article/S8776-2", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2544.

This was no great mystery, \nand it was not some unintended and unforeseeable consequence. It was \npart of the design of the bill.

SCHUMER, Chairman.\n\n[[Page S8780]]\n\n  I got this email from a woman who lives in Westmoreland County. She \nsays:\n\n       I have been self-employed for 13 years and have never been \n     without health insurance. 3 years ago I was diagnosed with \n     multiple sclerosis. Having an expensive preexisting condition \n     was not a problem for me as I had never let my insurance \n     lapse. My medications cost (without insurance) $4,000+ per \n     month. I received notice several weeks ago that they were \n     going to cancel my plan and were doing so as of Jan. 1 and I \n     had to sign up for new coverage through the health insurance \n     exchange.\n\n  My staff reached out to this woman to see if we could help. It turns \nout that where she lives and given her circumstances there were two \ndifferent plans available to her. One plan covered her doctors, the \nother plan covered the medicine she needed to treat her multiple \nsclerosis. Neither plan would do both. What kind of a choice is it that \nthis woman is going to have to make?\n  I have another email that arrived last week:\n\n       I finally got to where I could compare plans on the \n     government website, only to find that my insurance premiums \n     would go from $512 per month for a plan with a $500 \n     deductible/$2500 out of pocket plan to $799 for a plan with a \n     $500 deductible and a $2700 out of pocket expense.\n       Where is the savings? None of the plans include my current \n     doctor, whom I want to desperately keep. Obamacare is such a \n     disaster!!! Please stand firm and continue to work towards \n     REPEALING it.\n\n  Finally, there is one more false promise--I am going to give some \nexamples of responses I have gotten--and that is the promise that \npremiums for a family would decrease by $2,500 per year. In fact, the \ndata I have seen suggests that on average premiums in the individual \nmarket have been increasing. Consider the case of some of the people \nwho have reached out to my office from Pennsylvania.\n  This is a small business owner from Carbon County, PA, who sent me \nthis email last week. He said:\n\n       I have had an HSA high deductible plan . . . for several \n     years for my employees. I have paid 100% percent of the \n     premiums and contributed 50% of the deductible every year \n     that they paid the other 50% percent. I just received notice \n     that my insurance premiums are going up 100%.\n       What can be done to enforce the president's statements that \n     we can keep our current plans? There is no way I can pay this \n     new premium. My employees will be the ones hurt the most. \n     They loved the coverage they had and I hate that we can no \n     longer provide this benefit.\n\n  Here is an email I got from a father of two from Bucks County, PA.\n\n       I received notice last week that my healthcare will more \n     than triple. Currently I am paying $265 a month for me and my \n     two young sons . . . my monthly premium will go up to $836 a \n     month!!!\n       The president promised ``you can keep your plan'' and \n     ``families will save $2500 per year'' . . . I can keep my \n     plan, I just can't afford it . . . I do qualify for subsidies \n     . . . $80 bucks a month.\n\n  I got this email from a man from Mercer County, PA, 2 days ago.\n\n       I just became another Obamacare victim. Because my \n     employer's health plan costs are going up almost 100% I will \n     have $400 less in my pocket each month. At 58 I will have to \n     cut way back on how much money I can put into my local \n     economy. Obamacare needs to be scrapped.\n\n  This email is from a man from Crawford County, PA:\n\n       I am a small business owner, and I speak with many vendors \n     in my field. One of said vendors says that his monthly cost \n     would increase to $9.00 an hour on insurance alone. Another \n     said he feared he would not even be able to stay in business \n     because of the insurance costs. My own situation is just as \n     dire. Currently, I personally pay about $1,500 a month for \n     insurance, and under Obamacare I have seen costs go up by \n     $375. On top of that, my wife, who is an insurance agent, \n     fears that she will lose her coverage next fall due to the \n     law.\n\n  Here is an email I got last week from a father from Luzerne County.\n\n       Please keep fighting the disaster that is happening to the \n     thousands of working men and women that will be losing their \n     health care along with some of us retired folks.\n       Our son is one of them and the alternative is unthinkable--\n     his plan cost doubled to $300 a month . . . but the \n     deductible is $4500. Now how can anyone say everyone will \n     have affordable health care insurance on top of the statement \n     no one will lose their plan or doctor if they are satisfied \n     with them? Your fight is hard, but our prayers are with you.\n\n  Here is an email I got from a small business owner from Cumberland \nCounty, PA. He writes:\n\n       I am a small business in the Carlisle area. We have been in \n     business for 30 years . . . I offered insurance to the full \n     time employees for many years . . . If it weren't for the \n     rising costs of health care I could hire another employee \n     because we could use the help but with the anticipated \n     increases I won't be able to. I have been told by our \n     insurance carrier that we can expect up to 50% increases.\n\n  Finally, a small business owner from Chester County, PA, wrote this \nemail last week:\n\n       We just got our Insurance coverage options for my small \n     business. Previous rate was $470.00 per month with $0.00 \n     deductible, a good plan. The new plan is $692.00 per month \n     with a $2,000.00 deductible, a bad plan. OK, I cannot keep my \n     plan. To get close to the one I need to pay more and incur a \n     ridiculous deductible.\n       This is not free market. I don't like the government \n     telling me what is best for me.\n       I have several older employees and their rates are up over \n     $1,000.00 per month each. I cannot pay for their insurance \n     and they cannot afford to either. I am forced to drop the \n     plan or remove them from employment.\n       This is out of control.\n\n  This is a small sample of the emails I have gotten. I am one Senator \nfrom one State. The fact is the vast majority of people who experience \nthese problems don't send an email to their Senator.\n  So we have this tiny little sliver of the hundreds of thousands--\nactually millions--of Americans who are suffering from the direct \nconsequences--and I would argue intended consequences--of this bill. \nThey are unable to keep their health insurance plan, unable to keep \ntheir doctors, not experiencing savings but, rather, experiencing \nincreases in costs. These are just a few of the terrible consequences \nof ObamaCare.\n  There are many others I could cite, but I was just focusing on broken \npromises tonight. There are too many to list.\n  I do want to also stress that these are symptoms of a completely and \nimpossibly flawed bill. The real underlying problem of ObamaCare is \nsomething that Friedrich Hayek warned us about; he called it the fatal \nconceit. This is the idea that a small group of really smart people can \nknow more than the combined, accumulated knowledge and wisdom that is \ndisbursed across an entire population. It is an absurd notion. Yet it \nis at the heart of all kinds of big government plans, socialism \neverywhere, and it is clearly at the heart of ObamaCare.\n  The idea is that these Mandarins who are so smart and know so much, \nthey should be able to force their will on everyone else. It is an \nextraordinarily insulting premise that this is based on, but it is.\n  The premise is that individual men and women across America are \ncertainly not qualified, they are certainly not smart enough to know \nwhat is good enough for them. They should not be free to decide what \nkind of health plan they want to buy for their family. There are \ntradeoffs that you make when you buy something like a health insurance \nplan, such as how important is a higher deductible versus lower \npremiums or the importance of having maternity coverage or the \nimportance that someone might attach to a particular doctor.\n  All of those judgments, which are so personal, are taken away from \nindividuals in ObamaCare. That is not for Americans to decide. You will \ntake the plan that is available to you and approved by the government, \nperiod. By the way, you are breaking the law if you don't, and you will \nbe assessed a fine.\n  This is outrageous. This is not the society we have always been, but \nit is really just the most recent and egregious example of this warning \nthat Hayek gave us--this arrogance of big government. I would argue \nthat it is an offensive affront to the freedom of the American people, \nand it is predictably and sensationally a failure.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  (Mr. MURPHY assumed the Chair.)\n  (Mr. DONNELLY assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak until \nthe top of the hour.\n\n[[Page S8781]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today, as I have \nover the past several years, to talk about issues affecting this \ncountry. I know there is a nomination we are discussing on the floor, \nand I have concerns about the issues related to that nominee and the \nway that nomination has been brought forward because it was done by \nwhat I believe to be an abuse-of-power move in a way that resulted in \nvoting in the middle of the night, discussions in the middle of the \nnight--all, in my opinion, to distract from the disaster of the Obama \nhealth care law.\n  The Obama health care law continues to affect people all across the \ncountry. What we saw on October 1 in the great debacle of the rollout \nof the Web site was really just about a Web site on October 1. But come \nJanuary 1, it will be about real people who have lost their insurance \nwho are going to be hurt personally in terms of their own health by \nthis terrible law.\n  So I come to the floor, as I have week after week since the law \npassed, to talk about concerns I have as a doctor, someone who has \npracticed medicine in Wyoming for 24 years as an orthopedic surgeon, \ntaking care of people from around the State, and someone who as a \nmedical doctor was director of a program called the Wyoming Health \nFairs aimed at giving people low-cost blood screens, having health \nfairs people can attend from around the State where they can check \ntheir blood results and visit with doctors and nurses and others in the \ncommunity about issues of heart disease, diabetes, all aimed at \npreventing disease, early detection of problems, and lowering the cost \nof their care.\n  So I had great interest when this health care law was proposed and \nwhile watching it unfold. The concerns I had as it was passed continue \ntoday, and I think more and more Americans are seeing that those \nconcerns are being realized in their own lives. And that is what it is \nabout--people's lives.\n  The Web site failures are just the tip of the iceberg. What people \nare seeing now all across the country are higher premiums, and there \nare stories rampant around the country.\n  I still recall the President of the United States saying that by the \nend of his first term, insurance premiums would be down $2,500 per \nfamily. Instead, families are paying much more for health insurance. \nThere are concerns, obviously, because of canceled coverage. Around the \ncountry, over 5 million folks, I understand from recent accounts, have \nreceived letters saying that they have lost their insurance, that their \ninsurance will be canceled effective January 1.\n  The President promised: ``If you like your doctor, you can keep your \ndoctor.'' But now we are seeing that many people aren't keeping their \ndoctors. Even though they like their doctors and want to keep their \ndoctors, they can't.\n  There are issues of fraud and identity theft that we are hearing \nabout on a daily basis. The chief of staff of one of the Members of the \nSenate was applying on the Obama health care Web site, the government \nWeb site, trying to get insurance just this Monday, and it sure looked \nlike the Federal Web site and he thought he was on the Federal Web site \nand was putting in information. Then it goes to a screen where they \nwanted to know his bank account number and his PIN number.\n  He said: This can't be right.\n  He called the help line and spent over an hour on the phone, and they \nultimately said: No. Get off of that. It can't be the Federal \nGovernment Web site. Get off of it.\n  He was focused enough to think, this can't be right, but the fraud is \ngoing to be rampant, we know that, and identity theft as well.\n  And then we are seeing huge problems with higher copays and \ndeductibles.\n  I have with me a couple articles. Wednesday's Wall Street Journal has \ntheir recent poll numbers. ``Health Law Hurts President Politically.'' \nThe subheadline is that the disapproval rate of Obama's job performance \nrises. ``The disapproval rate of the President's job performance now \nrises to an all-time high of 54 percent,'' it says, ``even as Americans \nare upbeat on the economy.'' So it is not the economy that has people \nso disappointed and disapproving of the President.\n  Let me read a couple paragraphs because this is about the President \nof the United States and what we would want in a President of the \nUnited States in terms of credibility with the American people.\n\n       The Federal health-care law is becoming a heavier political \n     burden for President Barack Obama and his party, despite \n     increased confidence in the economy and the public's own \n     generally upbeat sense of well-being, a new Wall Street \n     Journal/NBC News poll suggests.\n\n  They go through how the poll was conducted, but people across the \ncountry believe the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll is a true reflection \nof what is happening nationwide.\n  It says:\n\n       Disapproval of Mr. Obama's job performance has hit an all-\n     time high in the poll, at 54 percent, amid the flawed rollout \n     of the health law. Half of those polled now consider the law \n     a bad idea, also a record high.\n\n  This is a big-time survey of 1,000 adults, and this is really a \ndisturbing part for us as a nation and should sadden all America:\n\n       The survey of 1,000 adults conducted between Dec. 4 and \n     Dec. 8 found a sharp erosion since January in many of the \n     attributes--honesty, leadership, ability to handle a crisis . \n     . .\n\n  These are abilities we want in a President. We want a President who \nis honest and who is perceived by the public as honest. We want a \nPresident who can handle a crisis and is perceived by the public as \nbeing able to handle a crisis. But they say there has been ``a sharp \nerosion since last January in many of the attributes--honesty, \nleadership, ability to handle a crisis--that had kept Mr. Obama aloft \nthrough the economic and political turmoil of his first term.''\n  The poll goes on and asks: In terms of the impact of the President's \nhealth care law, is this going to have a positive impact on you and \nyour family? Fewer than one out of eight people in the country today \nbelieves this health care law will have a positive impact on them and \ntheir family. We are changing the entire health care system of the \ncountry, and only one out of eight people believes it is actually going \nto help them?\n  The performance of the President is considered to be very bad, a \nsignificant disapproval, and it is because of the health care law.\n  People look at this and they say: What does this mean to me? How is \nthis going to affect my life? Those are the issues we talked about \nhere. People are being hit with the incredible increased costs. They \nsay: Well, there are some policies that may be a little bit cheaper, \nthe so-called bronze policies. So the New York Times took a look at \nthat. Again, these are articles from just this week.\n  This is from Monday, December 9: ``On Health Exchanges, Premiums May \nBe Low, but Other Costs Can Be High.'' This is by Robert Pear this \nMonday, a well-known writer who does his research and gets the facts. \nHe says, ``But as consumers dig into the details . . . ''--boy, that is \na key phrase because I believe that so many people who voted for this \nhealth care law never looked into the details, didn't know what it \nmeant, didn't know what was going to be in it because Nancy Pelosi \nfamously said: First you have to pass it before you get to find out \nwhat is in it. Well, Americans are now looking at it, digging into it.\n  Robert Pear in the New York Times said:\n\n       But as consumers dig into the details, they are finding \n     that the deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs are often \n     much higher than what is typical in employer-sponsored health \n     plans.\n\n  So what they actually have to pay out of their pockets is much higher \nthan in employer-sponsored health plans.\n  Well, people really care about what they have to pay personally for \nthings.\n  The same day, the Wall Street Journal, Monday, December 9, page 1.\n  ``High Deductibles Fuel New Worries of Health-Law Sticker Shock''--\nthe same information that we have seen there in the New York Times.\n  It says the average individual deductible for what is called the \nbronze plan on the exchange, the plan I was talking about a little \nearlier, which is the lowest priced average deductible is $5,081 a \nyear, according to a new report on insurance offerings in 34 of the 36 \nStates\n\n[[Page S8782]]\n\nthat rely on the federally--Washington-run--online marketplace. That is \n42 percent higher than the average deductible last year on plans that \nwere purchased. This is before the Federal law took place. ``High \nDeductibles Fuel New Worries of Health-Law Sticker Shock.''\n  I heard the President say the States that have done it have done it \nvery well. It is astonishing. When you turn to the second part of this \narticle, page A6 says ``Deductibles Fuel New Worries of Health-Law \nSticker Shock.'' What about the States doing their own plan? The \nheadline above that: ``Health-Site Snafus Plague Maryland,'' a State \nthat has decided to do their own Web site.\n  This is from Monday:\n\n       Maryland is struggling to fix its troubled health-insurance \n     website more than two months after it opened, showing how \n     technology woes are affecting more than just the federal \n     system.\n\n  We see it is not just the Web site--one article about the bad Web \nsite, the next article is about higher copays and deductibles. \nInterestingly, the official in charge of Maryland's insurance \nmarketplace resigned after criticism of her decision to take a vacation \nin the Cayman Islands during Thanksgiving week. New statistics released \nFriday showed just a trickle of customers signing up for private \ncoverage in the State.\n  It is interesting that States are having problems and the Federal \nGovernment is having problems. People wanted to keep their insurance. \nThey wanted to keep their insurance. They liked their insurance.\n  I talked to a woman--a rancher in Wyoming--at the Farm Bureau \nmeeting. She lost her insurance. Her insurance worked very well for her \nand her family, but she lost it because it didn't meet President \nObama's criteria of the 10 different standards that had to be met. She \nknows me and called me Doc because I had known her, and I am a doctor \nin Wyoming. She said it is interesting that the reason she lost her \ninsurance is because it didn't include maternity coverage.\n  She said, Doc, I had a hysterectomy. I don't need maternity coverage. \nShe said, I know I don't need maternity coverage, but apparently \nPresident Obama believes she needs maternity coverage. The Democrats in \nthe Senate believe she needs maternity coverage.\n  The question is, Who is the best judge for you and your family? Is it \nthe government or the Democrats who believe they know better than you \ndo or the freedom-loving Americans who believe they can make their own \ndecisions about their lives and their families and what insurance they \nwant or do not want.\n  People wanted to keep their insurance. They weren't allowed to, but \nthe President said they could. Time and time again, the President said \npeople could keep their insurance if they liked their insurance. I \nthink that is one of the major reasons the President's credibility has \ndropped.\n  As a matter of fact, there is a nonpartisan fact checker called \nPolitiFact, and each year they go through lots of comments and lots of \nstatements that are made, and they came out last night with their lie \nof the year. They do this every year--the lie of the year. The lie of \nthe year that came out from PolitiFact for the year 2013 was: If you \nlike your health care plan, you can keep it. We all know who said it--\nthe President of the United States.\n  They go on to say he didn't just say it once. We counted dozens of \ntimes that President Barack Obama said if people like their health \nplan, they can keep it. They go on to say:\n\n       It was a catchy political pitch and a chance to calm nerves \n     about his dramatic and complicated plan to bring historic \n     change to America's health insurance system. ``If you like \n     your health plan, you can keep it,'' President Barack Obama \n     said many times, but the promise was impossible to keep.\n\n  This fall, as cancellation letters were going out to approximately 4 \nmillion Americans, the public realized the President's breezy \nassurances were wrong and, therefore, they have given it the lie of the \nyear.\n  People saw this coming. Republicans saw this coming. My colleague \nfrom Wyoming, Senator Mike Enzi, saw this coming. That is why he came \nto the floor years ago and said: People are going to lose their \ncoverage. People are going to lose it. He brought a resolution to the \nfloor because he actually reads the Federal Register, and he saw the \nregulations that came out.\n  He came to this floor with legislation to say: Wait a second. If you \ntruly believe people can keep their coverage, you have to adopt this \npiece of legislation so people truly can keep their coverage. Yet we \nsaw Republicans vote with Senator Enzi, saying let people keep their \ncoverage. We saw Democrats say, forget it, Senator Enzi, we don't \nbelieve you are right.\n  The President was wrong; Senator Enzi was right.\n  There was a letter to the editor in the Powell Tribune in Powell, WY, \nwith the headline ``Enzi saw ACA impacts beforehand, shows value of \nSenator Enzi.''\n\n       Dear Editor: Fox News had a very interesting and \n     informative program Tuesday evening Nov. 6 on ``The Kelly \n     Files with Megyn Kelly.''\n       As anyone who watches Fox News knows, they are covering the \n     beginning effects of the Affordable Care Act, also known as \n     ObamaCare, as it is being implemented. Megyn Kelly began her \n     program stating she had a special guest who had predicted \n     three-and-one-half years ago almost exactly what will happen \n     when the ObamaCare law guess into effect this October.\n\n  Her special guest was our own Wyoming senior Senator Mike Enzi and he \nhad made his predictions in a speech on the Senate floor three-and-one-\nhalf years ago. He was then called a fearmonger by the Democrats and a \nradical rightwinger. Senator Enzi was probably one of a very few \nelected officials who had actually read the bill.\n  Senator Enzi reads all the bills. He understands the bills and the \nimplications and then reads the Federal Register so he knows what is in \nthem. He then brings to the floor thoughtful pieces of legislation to \nactually make things better for the American people, not worse.\n  What we are now seeing is that people can't keep their insurance. \nThey are losing their insurance, their doctor, and losing their \nhospitals. It is interesting in terms of being able to not even keep \nyour doctor, not being able to go to the hospital you prefer.\n  I would like to talk for a few seconds about the doctor-patient \nrelationship and why when the President says: ``If you like your \ndoctor, you can keep your doctor, period,'' that actually caused \ncomfort for people. But, again, that is another broken promise. It is \nnot necessarily ranked by PolitiFact to the level of, ``If you like \nyour coverage, you can keep your coverage,'' because people have gotten \nthe letters. Next year we will see more and more people who will not be \nable to keep their doctor.\n  As a doctor, I wrote an article that appeared on Wednesday of this \nweek in Investors Business Daily called ``ObamaCare Disrupts the \nDelicate Relationship Between Patient and Doctor.'' I would like to \nshare parts of it now specifically because this past weekend on one of \nthe Sunday talk shows Rahm Emanuel's brother Ezekiel Emanuel, who \nwas one of the architects of the President's health care law, which was \nwritten behind closed doors, was on one of his talk shows responding to \na question about the President's comment, ``If you like your doctor, \nyou can keep your doctor.'' Can you really keep your doctor?\n\n  What I wrote in this column December 11 was:\n\n       A central architect of the President's health care law \n     admitted this week that the often repeated promise that ``if \n     you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor'' simply isn't \n     true.\n       Instead, Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel explained that if you like \n     your doctor, you will simply need to pay more to keep your \n     doctor.\n       As a physician, I know firsthand how this will hurt many \n     Americans.\n\n  I write about how families look to doctors as trusted friends, \nconfidants, counselors, and turn to them for advice in making life-and-\ndeath decisions.\n  In Wyoming, patients have included me in graduations, weddings, and \nasked me to serve as a pallbearer at funerals. They have asked me to \npray with them, referee family disputes, and provide reassurance when a \ndoctor they didn't know was called in to consult.\n  Norman Rockwell's painting ``Doctor and Doll'' tells the story. A \nlittle girl holds up the doll as the trusted family doctor listens with \na stethoscope. A caring and compassionate physician takes the time to \nreassure a concerned little girl.\n  The doctor-patient relationship is a very special bond. It requires \nfaith and trust for a patient to allow me to cut\n\n[[Page S8783]]\n\ninto their body to remove a tumor, to replace a wornout joint, to fix a \nbroken bone, to repair a torn ligament, and above all else, to do no \nharm.\n  The President knew of that special relationship between people and \ntheir doctors. That is why when he was trying to gain support for the \nhealth care law, he made a clear and simple promise to the American \npeople. The President said: ``If you like your doctor, you can keep \nyour doctor, period.''\n  Now people all across the country are finding out that they can't \nkeep their doctor. The same law that has caused millions of Americans \nto lose the health insurance that worked for them is now causing them \nto lose their doctor.\n  People who are shopping for insurance on government exchanges are \nbeing forced to purchase insurance for things they don't want, don't \nneed, and will never use. To keep costs down, many of these policies \nlimit the doctors and hospitals that patients can use.\n  Some of the Nation's premier hospitals--including the Mayo Clinic and \nCedars-Sinai Medical Center--are excluded from many insurance exchanges \nin their networks. Some of the best children's hospitals in the country \nare also excluded from the exchanges. This means a child with cancer \nmay lose access to his or her doctor and their specialty hospital. Why? \nBecause of the law.\n  In New Hampshire, 10 of the State's 26 hospitals are excluded from \nthe only carrier that offers insurance in the exchange. The head of the \nmedical staff at one of the excluded hospitals in New Hampshire has \nlearned that her plan does not even let her, the chief of staff of the \nhospital, seek treatment at her own hospital.\n  The situation can be equally bad for seniors on Medicare. Thousands \nof doctors caring for seniors on Medicare Advantage have been dropped \nfrom their networks. Those Medicare patients are now going to be \nchallenged to find a new doctor to take care of them.\n  The President's health care law is making it harder for doctors as \nwell as for patients. Doctors know their patients. They know their \nhealth history, they know their lives, and doctors value the personal \nrelationship as much as the patient does.\n  People become doctors in the first place to take care of their \npatients. Even if someone is able to keep their doctor, they will not \nnecessarily be able to spend as much time with them as they might like \nto. That is because nearly two-thirds of doctors expect to have to \nspend more time on paperwork under the requirements of the law.\n  This isn't at all what the President promised the American people. \nPeople all across America put their faith and their trust in Barack \nObama when they elected him President. It is the same kind of faith and \ntrust they have in their own doctor. When patients lose trust in their \ndoctor, as citizens they are now losing faith in their President, it is \nextremely difficult to regain that trust.\n  So I continue to hear from my patients in Wyoming. They have always \nhad my home phone number. They are anxious. They are angry. They know \nwhat they want from the health care reform. They want access to quality \naffordable care. That is not what they got with this law. Now many face \nlosing the doctor who has always been there for them.\n  If President Obama wants to regain the trust of the American people, \nhe will sit down with Republicans to deliver reforms that will help all \nAmericans and fully protect the doctor-patient relationship. After all, \nPresident Obama has his own doctor at the White House, a doctor who is \ndedicated to the President's care. I am sure the President values his \nrelationship just as much as other Americans value their relationship \nwith their doctor.\n  I continue to come to the floor. I see my colleagues are arriving. I \nwould call their attention to this issue, as they say we have to make \nthe coverage for all these things, they feel they know what is best for \nAmerican patients, we need to provide psychiatric insurance an \ncoverage, and I have voted to provide parity for psychiatric care, but \nyesterday's New York Times article by Robert Pear, ``Fewer \nPsychiatrists Seen Taking Health Insurance.'' So the insurance the \nPresident is providing for people doesn't actually help them. It maybe \nmakes the President feel better, but it is not helping people get care.\n  The President has been very confused and used the word ``coverage'' \nwhen he should have been talking about actual health care for people, \nproviding physicians to take care of them so people can get what they \nneed in health care reform, the care they need, from a doctor they \nchoose, at lowers costs.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

Insurance plans differ. Some \ncover certain doctors, others cover other doctors. Since some plans \nwere certainly going to be canceled, inevitably some people were going \nto lose the plans that covered their doctor. This was no great mystery, \nand it was not some unintended and unforeseeable consequence. It was \npart of the design of the bill.

SCHUMER, Chairman.\n\n[[Page S8780]]\n\n  I got this email from a woman who lives in Westmoreland County. She \nsays:\n\n       I have been self-employed for 13 years and have never been \n     without health insurance. 3 years ago I was diagnosed with \n     multiple sclerosis. Having an expensive preexisting condition \n     was not a problem for me as I had never let my insurance \n     lapse. My medications cost (without insurance) $4,000+ per \n     month. I received notice several weeks ago that they were \n     going to cancel my plan and were doing so as of Jan. 1 and I \n     had to sign up for new coverage through the health insurance \n     exchange.\n\n  My staff reached out to this woman to see if we could help. It turns \nout that where she lives and given her circumstances there were two \ndifferent plans available to her. One plan covered her doctors, the \nother plan covered the medicine she needed to treat her multiple \nsclerosis. Neither plan would do both. What kind of a choice is it that \nthis woman is going to have to make?\n  I have another email that arrived last week:\n\n       I finally got to where I could compare plans on the \n     government website, only to find that my insurance premiums \n     would go from $512 per month for a plan with a $500 \n     deductible/$2500 out of pocket plan to $799 for a plan with a \n     $500 deductible and a $2700 out of pocket expense.\n       Where is the savings? None of the plans include my current \n     doctor, whom I want to desperately keep. Obamacare is such a \n     disaster!!! Please stand firm and continue to work towards \n     REPEALING it.\n\n  Finally, there is one more false promise--I am going to give some \nexamples of responses I have gotten--and that is the promise that \npremiums for a family would decrease by $2,500 per year. In fact, the \ndata I have seen suggests that on average premiums in the individual \nmarket have been increasing. Consider the case of some of the people \nwho have reached out to my office from Pennsylvania.\n  This is a small business owner from Carbon County, PA, who sent me \nthis email last week. He said:\n\n       I have had an HSA high deductible plan . . . for several \n     years for my employees. I have paid 100% percent of the \n     premiums and contributed 50% of the deductible every year \n     that they paid the other 50% percent. I just received notice \n     that my insurance premiums are going up 100%.\n       What can be done to enforce the president's statements that \n     we can keep our current plans? There is no way I can pay this \n     new premium. My employees will be the ones hurt the most. \n     They loved the coverage they had and I hate that we can no \n     longer provide this benefit.\n\n  Here is an email I got from a father of two from Bucks County, PA.\n\n       I received notice last week that my healthcare will more \n     than triple. Currently I am paying $265 a month for me and my \n     two young sons . . . my monthly premium will go up to $836 a \n     month!!!\n       The president promised ``you can keep your plan'' and \n     ``families will save $2500 per year'' . . . I can keep my \n     plan, I just can't afford it . . . I do qualify for subsidies \n     . . . $80 bucks a month.\n\n  I got this email from a man from Mercer County, PA, 2 days ago.\n\n       I just became another Obamacare victim. Because my \n     employer's health plan costs are going up almost 100% I will \n     have $400 less in my pocket each month. At 58 I will have to \n     cut way back on how much money I can put into my local \n     economy. Obamacare needs to be scrapped.\n\n  This email is from a man from Crawford County, PA:\n\n       I am a small business owner, and I speak with many vendors \n     in my field. One of said vendors says that his monthly cost \n     would increase to $9.00 an hour on insurance alone. Another \n     said he feared he would not even be able to stay in business \n     because of the insurance costs. My own situation is just as \n     dire. Currently, I personally pay about $1,500 a month for \n     insurance, and under Obamacare I have seen costs go up by \n     $375. On top of that, my wife, who is an insurance agent, \n     fears that she will lose her coverage next fall due to the \n     law.\n\n  Here is an email I got last week from a father from Luzerne County.\n\n       Please keep fighting the disaster that is happening to the \n     thousands of working men and women that will be losing their \n     health care along with some of us retired folks.\n       Our son is one of them and the alternative is unthinkable--\n     his plan cost doubled to $300 a month . . . but the \n     deductible is $4500. Now how can anyone say everyone will \n     have affordable health care insurance on top of the statement \n     no one will lose their plan or doctor if they are satisfied \n     with them? Your fight is hard, but our prayers are with you.\n\n  Here is an email I got from a small business owner from Cumberland \nCounty, PA. He writes:\n\n       I am a small business in the Carlisle area. We have been in \n     business for 30 years . . . I offered insurance to the full \n     time employees for many years . . . If it weren't for the \n     rising costs of health care I could hire another employee \n     because we could use the help but with the anticipated \n     increases I won't be able to. I have been told by our \n     insurance carrier that we can expect up to 50% increases.\n\n  Finally, a small business owner from Chester County, PA, wrote this \nemail last week:\n\n       We just got our Insurance coverage options for my small \n     business. Previous rate was $470.00 per month with $0.00 \n     deductible, a good plan. The new plan is $692.00 per month \n     with a $2,000.00 deductible, a bad plan. OK, I cannot keep my \n     plan. To get close to the one I need to pay more and incur a \n     ridiculous deductible.\n       This is not free market. I don't like the government \n     telling me what is best for me.\n       I have several older employees and their rates are up over \n     $1,000.00 per month each. I cannot pay for their insurance \n     and they cannot afford to either. I am forced to drop the \n     plan or remove them from employment.\n       This is out of control.\n\n  This is a small sample of the emails I have gotten. I am one Senator \nfrom one State. The fact is the vast majority of people who experience \nthese problems don't send an email to their Senator.\n  So we have this tiny little sliver of the hundreds of thousands--\nactually millions--of Americans who are suffering from the direct \nconsequences--and I would argue intended consequences--of this bill. \nThey are unable to keep their health insurance plan, unable to keep \ntheir doctors, not experiencing savings but, rather, experiencing \nincreases in costs. These are just a few of the terrible consequences \nof ObamaCare.\n  There are many others I could cite, but I was just focusing on broken \npromises tonight. There are too many to list.\n  I do want to also stress that these are symptoms of a completely and \nimpossibly flawed bill. The real underlying problem of ObamaCare is \nsomething that Friedrich Hayek warned us about; he called it the fatal \nconceit. This is the idea that a small group of really smart people can \nknow more than the combined, accumulated knowledge and wisdom that is \ndisbursed across an entire population. It is an absurd notion. Yet it \nis at the heart of all kinds of big government plans, socialism \neverywhere, and it is clearly at the heart of ObamaCare.\n  The idea is that these Mandarins who are so smart and know so much, \nthey should be able to force their will on everyone else. It is an \nextraordinarily insulting premise that this is based on, but it is.\n  The premise is that individual men and women across America are \ncertainly not qualified, they are certainly not smart enough to know \nwhat is good enough for them. They should not be free to decide what \nkind of health plan they want to buy for their family. There are \ntradeoffs that you make when you buy something like a health insurance \nplan, such as how important is a higher deductible versus lower \npremiums or the importance of having maternity coverage or the \nimportance that someone might attach to a particular doctor.\n  All of those judgments, which are so personal, are taken away from \nindividuals in ObamaCare. That is not for Americans to decide. You will \ntake the plan that is available to you and approved by the government, \nperiod. By the way, you are breaking the law if you don't, and you will \nbe assessed a fine.\n  This is outrageous. This is not the society we have always been, but \nit is really just the most recent and egregious example of this warning \nthat Hayek gave us--this arrogance of big government. I would argue \nthat it is an offensive affront to the freedom of the American people, \nand it is predictably and sensationally a failure.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  (Mr. MURPHY assumed the Chair.)\n  (Mr. DONNELLY assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak until \nthe top of the hour.\n\n[[Page S8781]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today, as I have \nover the past several years, to talk about issues affecting this \ncountry. I know there is a nomination we are discussing on the floor, \nand I have concerns about the issues related to that nominee and the \nway that nomination has been brought forward because it was done by \nwhat I believe to be an abuse-of-power move in a way that resulted in \nvoting in the middle of the night, discussions in the middle of the \nnight--all, in my opinion, to distract from the disaster of the Obama \nhealth care law.\n  The Obama health care law continues to affect people all across the \ncountry. What we saw on October 1 in the great debacle of the rollout \nof the Web site was really just about a Web site on October 1. But come \nJanuary 1, it will be about real people who have lost their insurance \nwho are going to be hurt personally in terms of their own health by \nthis terrible law.\n  So I come to the floor, as I have week after week since the law \npassed, to talk about concerns I have as a doctor, someone who has \npracticed medicine in Wyoming for 24 years as an orthopedic surgeon, \ntaking care of people from around the State, and someone who as a \nmedical doctor was director of a program called the Wyoming Health \nFairs aimed at giving people low-cost blood screens, having health \nfairs people can attend from around the State where they can check \ntheir blood results and visit with doctors and nurses and others in the \ncommunity about issues of heart disease, diabetes, all aimed at \npreventing disease, early detection of problems, and lowering the cost \nof their care.\n  So I had great interest when this health care law was proposed and \nwhile watching it unfold. The concerns I had as it was passed continue \ntoday, and I think more and more Americans are seeing that those \nconcerns are being realized in their own lives. And that is what it is \nabout--people's lives.\n  The Web site failures are just the tip of the iceberg. What people \nare seeing now all across the country are higher premiums, and there \nare stories rampant around the country.\n  I still recall the President of the United States saying that by the \nend of his first term, insurance premiums would be down $2,500 per \nfamily. Instead, families are paying much more for health insurance. \nThere are concerns, obviously, because of canceled coverage. Around the \ncountry, over 5 million folks, I understand from recent accounts, have \nreceived letters saying that they have lost their insurance, that their \ninsurance will be canceled effective January 1.\n  The President promised: ``If you like your doctor, you can keep your \ndoctor.'' But now we are seeing that many people aren't keeping their \ndoctors. Even though they like their doctors and want to keep their \ndoctors, they can't.\n  There are issues of fraud and identity theft that we are hearing \nabout on a daily basis. The chief of staff of one of the Members of the \nSenate was applying on the Obama health care Web site, the government \nWeb site, trying to get insurance just this Monday, and it sure looked \nlike the Federal Web site and he thought he was on the Federal Web site \nand was putting in information. Then it goes to a screen where they \nwanted to know his bank account number and his PIN number.\n  He said: This can't be right.\n  He called the help line and spent over an hour on the phone, and they \nultimately said: No. Get off of that. It can't be the Federal \nGovernment Web site. Get off of it.\n  He was focused enough to think, this can't be right, but the fraud is \ngoing to be rampant, we know that, and identity theft as well.\n  And then we are seeing huge problems with higher copays and \ndeductibles.\n  I have with me a couple articles. Wednesday's Wall Street Journal has \ntheir recent poll numbers. ``Health Law Hurts President Politically.'' \nThe subheadline is that the disapproval rate of Obama's job performance \nrises. ``The disapproval rate of the President's job performance now \nrises to an all-time high of 54 percent,'' it says, ``even as Americans \nare upbeat on the economy.'' So it is not the economy that has people \nso disappointed and disapproving of the President.\n  Let me read a couple paragraphs because this is about the President \nof the United States and what we would want in a President of the \nUnited States in terms of credibility with the American people.\n\n       The Federal health-care law is becoming a heavier political \n     burden for President Barack Obama and his party, despite \n     increased confidence in the economy and the public's own \n     generally upbeat sense of well-being, a new Wall Street \n     Journal/NBC News poll suggests.\n\n  They go through how the poll was conducted, but people across the \ncountry believe the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll is a true reflection \nof what is happening nationwide.\n  It says:\n\n       Disapproval of Mr. Obama's job performance has hit an all-\n     time high in the poll, at 54 percent, amid the flawed rollout \n     of the health law. Half of those polled now consider the law \n     a bad idea, also a record high.\n\n  This is a big-time survey of 1,000 adults, and this is really a \ndisturbing part for us as a nation and should sadden all America:\n\n       The survey of 1,000 adults conducted between Dec. 4 and \n     Dec. 8 found a sharp erosion since January in many of the \n     attributes--honesty, leadership, ability to handle a crisis . \n     . .\n\n  These are abilities we want in a President. We want a President who \nis honest and who is perceived by the public as honest. We want a \nPresident who can handle a crisis and is perceived by the public as \nbeing able to handle a crisis. But they say there has been ``a sharp \nerosion since last January in many of the attributes--honesty, \nleadership, ability to handle a crisis--that had kept Mr. Obama aloft \nthrough the economic and political turmoil of his first term.''\n  The poll goes on and asks: In terms of the impact of the President's \nhealth care law, is this going to have a positive impact on you and \nyour family? Fewer than one out of eight people in the country today \nbelieves this health care law will have a positive impact on them and \ntheir family. We are changing the entire health care system of the \ncountry, and only one out of eight people believes it is actually going \nto help them?\n  The performance of the President is considered to be very bad, a \nsignificant disapproval, and it is because of the health care law.\n  People look at this and they say: What does this mean to me? How is \nthis going to affect my life? Those are the issues we talked about \nhere. People are being hit with the incredible increased costs. They \nsay: Well, there are some policies that may be a little bit cheaper, \nthe so-called bronze policies. So the New York Times took a look at \nthat. Again, these are articles from just this week.\n  This is from Monday, December 9: ``On Health Exchanges, Premiums May \nBe Low, but Other Costs Can Be High.'' This is by Robert Pear this \nMonday, a well-known writer who does his research and gets the facts. \nHe says, ``But as consumers dig into the details . . . ''--boy, that is \na key phrase because I believe that so many people who voted for this \nhealth care law never looked into the details, didn't know what it \nmeant, didn't know what was going to be in it because Nancy Pelosi \nfamously said: First you have to pass it before you get to find out \nwhat is in it. Well, Americans are now looking at it, digging into it.\n  Robert Pear in the New York Times said:\n\n       But as consumers dig into the details, they are finding \n     that the deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs are often \n     much higher than what is typical in employer-sponsored health \n     plans.\n\n  So what they actually have to pay out of their pockets is much higher \nthan in employer-sponsored health plans.\n  Well, people really care about what they have to pay personally for \nthings.\n  The same day, the Wall Street Journal, Monday, December 9, page 1.\n  ``High Deductibles Fuel New Worries of Health-Law Sticker Shock''--\nthe same information that we have seen there in the New York Times.\n  It says the average individual deductible for what is called the \nbronze plan on the exchange, the plan I was talking about a little \nearlier, which is the lowest priced average deductible is $5,081 a \nyear, according to a new report on insurance offerings in 34 of the 36 \nStates\n\n[[Page S8782]]\n\nthat rely on the federally--Washington-run--online marketplace. That is \n42 percent higher than the average deductible last year on plans that \nwere purchased. This is before the Federal law took place. ``High \nDeductibles Fuel New Worries of Health-Law Sticker Shock.''\n  I heard the President say the States that have done it have done it \nvery well. It is astonishing. When you turn to the second part of this \narticle, page A6 says ``Deductibles Fuel New Worries of Health-Law \nSticker Shock.'' What about the States doing their own plan? The \nheadline above that: ``Health-Site Snafus Plague Maryland,'' a State \nthat has decided to do their own Web site.\n  This is from Monday:\n\n       Maryland is struggling to fix its troubled health-insurance \n     website more than two months after it opened, showing how \n     technology woes are affecting more than just the federal \n     system.\n\n  We see it is not just the Web site--one article about the bad Web \nsite, the next article is about higher copays and deductibles. \nInterestingly, the official in charge of Maryland's insurance \nmarketplace resigned after criticism of her decision to take a vacation \nin the Cayman Islands during Thanksgiving week. New statistics released \nFriday showed just a trickle of customers signing up for private \ncoverage in the State.\n  It is interesting that States are having problems and the Federal \nGovernment is having problems. People wanted to keep their insurance. \nThey wanted to keep their insurance. They liked their insurance.\n  I talked to a woman--a rancher in Wyoming--at the Farm Bureau \nmeeting. She lost her insurance. Her insurance worked very well for her \nand her family, but she lost it because it didn't meet President \nObama's criteria of the 10 different standards that had to be met. She \nknows me and called me Doc because I had known her, and I am a doctor \nin Wyoming. She said it is interesting that the reason she lost her \ninsurance is because it didn't include maternity coverage.\n  She said, Doc, I had a hysterectomy. I don't need maternity coverage. \nShe said, I know I don't need maternity coverage, but apparently \nPresident Obama believes she needs maternity coverage. The Democrats in \nthe Senate believe she needs maternity coverage.\n  The question is, Who is the best judge for you and your family? Is it \nthe government or the Democrats who believe they know better than you \ndo or the freedom-loving Americans who believe they can make their own \ndecisions about their lives and their families and what insurance they \nwant or do not want.\n  People wanted to keep their insurance. They weren't allowed to, but \nthe President said they could. Time and time again, the President said \npeople could keep their insurance if they liked their insurance. I \nthink that is one of the major reasons the President's credibility has \ndropped.\n  As a matter of fact, there is a nonpartisan fact checker called \nPolitiFact, and each year they go through lots of comments and lots of \nstatements that are made, and they came out last night with their lie \nof the year. They do this every year--the lie of the year. The lie of \nthe year that came out from PolitiFact for the year 2013 was: If you \nlike your health care plan, you can keep it. We all know who said it--\nthe President of the United States.\n  They go on to say he didn't just say it once. We counted dozens of \ntimes that President Barack Obama said if people like their health \nplan, they can keep it. They go on to say:\n\n       It was a catchy political pitch and a chance to calm nerves \n     about his dramatic and complicated plan to bring historic \n     change to America's health insurance system. ``If you like \n     your health plan, you can keep it,'' President Barack Obama \n     said many times, but the promise was impossible to keep.\n\n  This fall, as cancellation letters were going out to approximately 4 \nmillion Americans, the public realized the President's breezy \nassurances were wrong and, therefore, they have given it the lie of the \nyear.\n  People saw this coming. Republicans saw this coming. My colleague \nfrom Wyoming, Senator Mike Enzi, saw this coming. That is why he came \nto the floor years ago and said: People are going to lose their \ncoverage. People are going to lose it. He brought a resolution to the \nfloor because he actually reads the Federal Register, and he saw the \nregulations that came out.\n  He came to this floor with legislation to say: Wait a second. If you \ntruly believe people can keep their coverage, you have to adopt this \npiece of legislation so people truly can keep their coverage. Yet we \nsaw Republicans vote with Senator Enzi, saying let people keep their \ncoverage. We saw Democrats say, forget it, Senator Enzi, we don't \nbelieve you are right.\n  The President was wrong; Senator Enzi was right.\n  There was a letter to the editor in the Powell Tribune in Powell, WY, \nwith the headline ``Enzi saw ACA impacts beforehand, shows value of \nSenator Enzi.''\n\n       Dear Editor: Fox News had a very interesting and \n     informative program Tuesday evening Nov. 6 on ``The Kelly \n     Files with Megyn Kelly.''\n       As anyone who watches Fox News knows, they are covering the \n     beginning effects of the Affordable Care Act, also known as \n     ObamaCare, as it is being implemented. Megyn Kelly began her \n     program stating she had a special guest who had predicted \n     three-and-one-half years ago almost exactly what will happen \n     when the ObamaCare law guess into effect this October.\n\n  Her special guest was our own Wyoming senior Senator Mike Enzi and he \nhad made his predictions in a speech on the Senate floor three-and-one-\nhalf years ago. He was then called a fearmonger by the Democrats and a \nradical rightwinger. Senator Enzi was probably one of a very few \nelected officials who had actually read the bill.\n  Senator Enzi reads all the bills. He understands the bills and the \nimplications and then reads the Federal Register so he knows what is in \nthem. He then brings to the floor thoughtful pieces of legislation to \nactually make things better for the American people, not worse.\n  What we are now seeing is that people can't keep their insurance. \nThey are losing their insurance, their doctor, and losing their \nhospitals. It is interesting in terms of being able to not even keep \nyour doctor, not being able to go to the hospital you prefer.\n  I would like to talk for a few seconds about the doctor-patient \nrelationship and why when the President says: ``If you like your \ndoctor, you can keep your doctor, period,'' that actually caused \ncomfort for people. But, again, that is another broken promise. It is \nnot necessarily ranked by PolitiFact to the level of, ``If you like \nyour coverage, you can keep your coverage,'' because people have gotten \nthe letters. Next year we will see more and more people who will not be \nable to keep their doctor.\n  As a doctor, I wrote an article that appeared on Wednesday of this \nweek in Investors Business Daily called ``ObamaCare Disrupts the \nDelicate Relationship Between Patient and Doctor.'' I would like to \nshare parts of it now specifically because this past weekend on one of \nthe Sunday talk shows Rahm Emanuel's brother Ezekiel Emanuel, who \nwas one of the architects of the President's health care law, which was \nwritten behind closed doors, was on one of his talk shows responding to \na question about the President's comment, ``If you like your doctor, \nyou can keep your doctor.'' Can you really keep your doctor?\n\n  What I wrote in this column December 11 was:\n\n       A central architect of the President's health care law \n     admitted this week that the often repeated promise that ``if \n     you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor'' simply isn't \n     true.\n       Instead, Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel explained that if you like \n     your doctor, you will simply need to pay more to keep your \n     doctor.\n       As a physician, I know firsthand how this will hurt many \n     Americans.\n\n  I write about how families look to doctors as trusted friends, \nconfidants, counselors, and turn to them for advice in making life-and-\ndeath decisions.\n  In Wyoming, patients have included me in graduations, weddings, and \nasked me to serve as a pallbearer at funerals. They have asked me to \npray with them, referee family disputes, and provide reassurance when a \ndoctor they didn't know was called in to consult.\n  Norman Rockwell's painting ``Doctor and Doll'' tells the story. A \nlittle girl holds up the doll as the trusted family doctor listens with \na stethoscope. A caring and compassionate physician takes the time to \nreassure a concerned little girl.\n  The doctor-patient relationship is a very special bond. It requires \nfaith and trust for a patient to allow me to cut\n\n[[Page S8783]]\n\ninto their body to remove a tumor, to replace a wornout joint, to fix a \nbroken bone, to repair a torn ligament, and above all else, to do no \nharm.\n  The President knew of that special relationship between people and \ntheir doctors. That is why when he was trying to gain support for the \nhealth care law, he made a clear and simple promise to the American \npeople. The President said: ``If you like your doctor, you can keep \nyour doctor, period.''\n  Now people all across the country are finding out that they can't \nkeep their doctor. The same law that has caused millions of Americans \nto lose the health insurance that worked for them is now causing them \nto lose their doctor.\n  People who are shopping for insurance on government exchanges are \nbeing forced to purchase insurance for things they don't want, don't \nneed, and will never use. To keep costs down, many of these policies \nlimit the doctors and hospitals that patients can use.\n  Some of the Nation's premier hospitals--including the Mayo Clinic and \nCedars-Sinai Medical Center--are excluded from many insurance exchanges \nin their networks. Some of the best children's hospitals in the country \nare also excluded from the exchanges. This means a child with cancer \nmay lose access to his or her doctor and their specialty hospital. Why? \nBecause of the law.\n  In New Hampshire, 10 of the State's 26 hospitals are excluded from \nthe only carrier that offers insurance in the exchange. The head of the \nmedical staff at one of the excluded hospitals in New Hampshire has \nlearned that her plan does not even let her, the chief of staff of the \nhospital, seek treatment at her own hospital.\n  The situation can be equally bad for seniors on Medicare. Thousands \nof doctors caring for seniors on Medicare Advantage have been dropped \nfrom their networks. Those Medicare patients are now going to be \nchallenged to find a new doctor to take care of them.\n  The President's health care law is making it harder for doctors as \nwell as for patients. Doctors know their patients. They know their \nhealth history, they know their lives, and doctors value the personal \nrelationship as much as the patient does.\n  People become doctors in the first place to take care of their \npatients. Even if someone is able to keep their doctor, they will not \nnecessarily be able to spend as much time with them as they might like \nto. That is because nearly two-thirds of doctors expect to have to \nspend more time on paperwork under the requirements of the law.\n  This isn't at all what the President promised the American people. \nPeople all across America put their faith and their trust in Barack \nObama when they elected him President. It is the same kind of faith and \ntrust they have in their own doctor. When patients lose trust in their \ndoctor, as citizens they are now losing faith in their President, it is \nextremely difficult to regain that trust.\n  So I continue to hear from my patients in Wyoming. They have always \nhad my home phone number. They are anxious. They are angry. They know \nwhat they want from the health care reform. They want access to quality \naffordable care. That is not what they got with this law. Now many face \nlosing the doctor who has always been there for them.\n  If President Obama wants to regain the trust of the American people, \nhe will sit down with Republicans to deliver reforms that will help all \nAmericans and fully protect the doctor-patient relationship. After all, \nPresident Obama has his own doctor at the White House, a doctor who is \ndedicated to the President's care. I am sure the President values his \nrelationship just as much as other Americans value their relationship \nwith their doctor.\n  I continue to come to the floor. I see my colleagues are arriving. I \nwould call their attention to this issue, as they say we have to make \nthe coverage for all these things, they feel they know what is best for \nAmerican patients, we need to provide psychiatric insurance an \ncoverage, and I have voted to provide parity for psychiatric care, but \nyesterday's New York Times article by Robert Pear, ``Fewer \nPsychiatrists Seen Taking Health Insurance.'' So the insurance the \nPresident is providing for people doesn't actually help them. It maybe \nmakes the President feel better, but it is not helping people get care.\n  The President has been very confused and used the word ``coverage'' \nwhen he should have been talking about actual health care for people, \nproviding physicians to take care of them so people can get what they \nneed in health care reform, the care they need, from a doctor they \nchoose, at lowers costs.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on the nomination.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Deborah Lee James, of Virginia, to be Secretary of the Air Force?\n  Mr. BARRASSO.

A quorum is present.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have an announcement. I realize everyone \nis tired, anxious, and some are a little concerned about everything.\n  I have had, especially late last night and early this morning, \nconversations with Republicans and Democrats as to what we should do \nthis weekend.\n  The next set of votes will come shortly before noon today. Then we \nwill have another set of votes this afternoon. Absent consent, the \nSenate will vote late Saturday, about 10:30 or thereabouts, on \nconfirmation of Jeh Johnson to be the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  The Senate has already received a budget bill from the House. We \nexpect momentarily to receive the Defense bill from the House. I wish \nto have the Senate process these important bills as quickly possible. I \nplan to move to proceed on these bills as soon as we can. That would be \nas soon as we handle the pending nominations that are now before this \nbody.\n  Thereafter, there are certain things we need to do before Christmas \nbreak. We need to do those two important bills, the budget and defense. \nWe have to do the Chair of the Federal Reserve system. There is an \nUnder Secretary of State that is very urgent, according to John Kerry. \nWe have a Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, Under Secretary of \nDepartment of Interior, the head of the Internal Revenue Service, and \nthe remaining judge on the DC Circuit. There have been requests from \neverybody--I shouldn't say that--lots and lots of people to do other \nthings, but we are limited as to what we can do before next weekend. \nThere are some other nominations that we are happy to discuss with \nindividual Senators.\n\n  So it would be my suggestion that we go ahead and do this vote; \nduring this vote, and prior to the next series of votes, I will meet \nwith the Republican leader to see if there is a way we can give some \ntime, especially to the staff, over the weekend. These people have \nworked extremely hard, and I haven't heard a complaint from a single \none of them, quite frankly.\n  I went up last evening and visited the court reporters. We have 18 \ncourt reporters, and up on the 4th floor they have been sharing--for a \nlittle respite--two beds and taking naps, or at least trying to lie \ndown and rest for a bit. They are working in 15-minute shifts, and they \nhave been doing that for days now. So if we can work that out, I would \nbe happy to do that.\n  My goal is we would wind up at the same place on Monday in the \nevening as we would wind up if we did all this stuff over the weekend. \nSo I am happy to be as cooperative as possible. Christmas is on its \nway, and there are certain things we need to have done. There are lots \nof other things we need to do, but we are probably not going to be able \nto do those.\n  So I have laid out for everyone a broad scope of the schedule. I will \nmeet with my friend the Republican leader and see if there is some way \nwe can do this; otherwise, we will just proceed on.\n  The good news is that following the vote this afternoon, we wouldn't \nhave anything until tomorrow night under the schedule as now listed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate \nthat debate be brought to a close on the nomination of Heather Anne \nHigginbottom, of the District of Columbia, to be Deputy Secretary of \nState for Management and Resources.\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will now report the nomination.\n  The assistant bill clerk read the nomination of Heather Anne \nHigginbottom, of the District of Columbia, to be Deputy Secretary of \nState for Management and Resources.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the provisions of S. Res. 15 of the \n113th Congress, there will now be up to 8 hours of postcloture \nconsideration of the nomination, equally divided in the usual form.\n  Who yields time?\n  If neither side wishes to yield time, the time now will be equally \ndivided.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I wish to take a short time here to \ndiscuss a situation which I think is gaining some attention in the \nactual news media on a continuing basis.\n  But with the Affordable Care Act and what we are doing or not doing \nhere on the floor of the Senate with regards to the 51-50 controversy, \nperhaps we overlooked the number one obligation we have as Members of \nthis body, and that is our national security, the defense of our \nindividual freedoms, and the part we play in determining the same kind \nof objectives--liberty and freedom--all throughout the world. I am \ntalking about foreign policy, and I am talking about the very dangerous \nsituation that we face with regard to Iran.\n  On November 24 the United States, Germany, France, China, Great \nBritain, and Russia signed an interim\n\n[[Page S8785]]\n\nagreement with Iran regarding its nuclear weapons program. The \nPresident and Secretary John Kerry, former colleague, have applauded \nthis deal.\n  The President has claimed: We have opened a new path forward toward a \nworld that is more secure. The Secretary of State, who came before us \nthis week and gave Senators a briefing, argues: This is why we had \nsanctions in the first place.\n  With all due respect, I disagree. The world, it seems to me, is not a \nsafer place, and in 6 months I do not believe we will be one step \ncloser to dismantling Iran's ability to produce a nuclear weapon.\n  This administration is asking us to trust a regime which has been \nclear on its intentions, quite frankly, to wipe Israel off the face of \nthe planet--their words--and, is the world's largest state-sponsor of \nterrorism, sponsor of the Assad regime, Hezbollah, and Hamas.\n  I don't think that represents a step toward security. I think that is \nmisguided at best. This, to me, is not a good plan. I would even \nreverse that to say it is a bad plan.\n  At this moment, the administration is asking--rather pressuring--\nCongress to back down from additional sanctions which many of us have \nsupported and think would certainly a better thing to do at this \nparticular time. At any rate, this is not a request that I can oblige. \nSanctions are, indeed, the reason that Iran has decided to come to the \ntable. But coming to the table and honestly negotiating are certainly \ntwo different things.\n\n  If the reports are true, the administration has been holding secret \ntalks with Iran for months. I do not know what was discussed during \nthose talks. I am not sure that anyone in the Senate really does know. \nWhat did the State Department, the Treasury Department, and the \nPresident offer to bring Iran to the public stage? It seems to me that \nshould be transparent. So I think the Congress and the American people \nare left to wonder with regard to transparency what was arranged before \nthis deal or this peace plan?\n  The bigger problem is that it has taken painstaking effort on the \npart of those like myself and others in this body who care about our \nNation's security and the security of our allies to implement sanctions \nto the strength that we have today. It has taken a decade. It has taken \nsix actions by the Security Council of the United Nations, 10 years of \nwork, and a tremendous effort to finally get people on board. But now \nthe President is asking us to back off after we have gained the support \nof the international community and just begun to make inroads.\n  The administration is offering to cut back now on these sanctions and \nto allow the Iranian government to continue enriching the uranium. Why? \nIt is widely accepted that the Iranians have no real use for enriched \nuranium to use for nuclear power because Russia provides fuel supplies \nfor its sole operational nuclear power plant. But they do have use for \nenriched uranium to contribute to the assembly of a nuclear weapon.\n  Why should we back off and only get promises? Why should we not keep \napplying pressure on Iran through sanctions until they give up their \nentire program? It seems to me that it would be in our best interests \nthat Iran would commit to several things for this deal to be a true \nstep for security. I am just going to mention a few. No. 1, let's just \nget to the heart of the matter: Public acceptance for the Jewish State \nof Israel and to allow for the peaceful coexistence of the Israeli \npeople in the Middle East. Nobody in Iran has agreed to that. That is \nthe main issue, the right of Israel to exist. That should be the \nfoundation that we have to start all talks.\n  Then we should have reporting and inspection access to the Parchin \nfacility, and full details of the undeclared nuclear activities.\n  Third, dismantling of Iran's plutonium-producing heavy water reactor \nat Arak. Fourth, the construction of new centrifuges has to stop. Last, \nan end to all enrichment. Unfortunately this agreement fails to include \nany of these points.\n  If the purpose of sanctions was to get Iran to the negotiating table, \nhow did we walk away without getting what we need, a complete end to \nIran's nuclear program? Difficult, but certainly the overarching and \nprimary goal. For a decade, Iran has openly disregarded the tenets of \nthe nuclear nonproliferation agreement, legally binding resolutions \npassed by the United Nations Security Council, and mandatory \ninspections by the International Atomic Energy Association, the IAEA. \nAll of this, completely disregarded by Iran's regime.\n  But the President believes we should trust them. Why? Because Hassan \nRouhani has been elected President? On the international scene he \ncertainly is a smiling presence. It is well accepted, however, that the \nSupreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, does actually control everything in \nIran, including its nuclear policy, meaning that Mr. Rouhani's election \nequates with no change in Iran, except in regards to its public face.\n  It seems to me this is why we cannot back off now. Many of my \ncolleagues, in particular--Senator Kirk and Senator Graham--are working \non a new phase of sanctions. They are tough sanctions and I am right \nthere with them.\n  I do not have any faith with regard to where the Iranians claim they \nwill be in six months. Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has \ncalled this a ``dangerous blunder.'' He has warned ``Israel has the \nright and the obligation to defend itself by itself against any \nthreat.''\n  It concerns me that the administration has no Phase II plan in place \nfor the end of this 6-month period. If in fact we ease the sanctions, \nwhich we are doing, and people take advantage of easing those sanctions \nand are doing business with Iran, to put those same sanctions back in \nplace, or tougher sanctions back in place, is going to be very \ndifficult. One of my colleagues described this as once the toothpaste \nis out of the tube you can't put it back. Ten years, six different \nattempts in the Security Council finally taking a stand--how do you put \nback the sanctions that we have had in place that brought Iran to the \ntable if in fact at the end of this period no progress is being made? \nNot to mention the tougher sanctions that we have proposed.\n  It is a real concern. The administration's hope, of course, is that \nthis leads to a stronger long-term agreement. I hope this works out but \nI am highly skeptical. When the interim agreement is up, I think Iran \nwill remain capable of producing a nuclear weapon in a mere few weeks \nbecause we are not asking more of this regime. At that moment we must \nhave very strong sanctions in place to make sure that Iran does not \nweaponize with regard to its nuclear capability.\n  I fully support a new round of sanctions, and I will continue to work \nwith my colleagues to ensure that these are passed before the 6-month \nperiod is over. Unfortunately, if we do not take this kind of action, \nIran is set to gain everything while the United States loses, not just \nthe United States but Israel and Europe as well. Ending Iran's nuclear \nweapons program entirely is what I consider a path toward a world that \nwould be more secure.\n  In today's issue of the Wall Street Journal, there is an editorial \ncalled ``Mood-Music Diplomacy On Iran.'' Basically, it simply states \nmore sanctions would strengthen the United States leverage with Tehran. \nIt closes by saying that Secretary Kerry ``now likes to quote Ronald \nReagan's `trust but verify' mantra for dealing with Iran.'' But it goes \non to say, ``But the Gipper's real legacy was to show resolve when it \ncounted. The Obama administration and their opposition to new sanctions \nwith a delayed trigger feeds suspicions,'' according to this editorial, \n``that it is eager to accept just about any agreement with Iran.'' And \nit states, ``Members of Congress from both parties who want a good and \ncredible deal can help by passing this sanctions bill.''\n  I think that is advice well taken.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine). If there is nobody who seeks \nrecognition, the time will be equally divided.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S8786]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I yield back the Democrats' time on this \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All Democratic time is yielded.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, we are now in about the third day of a \nsomewhat tortured process that was the result of a power grab that has \nchanged the tradition of the Senate, a tradition which held for about \n225 years.\n  Republicans are frustrated with the successful attempt made by the \nDemocratic Party under its leader to change the rules--to break the \nrules to change the rules. So we end up with no rule, no rule relative \nto protecting the rights of the minority.\n  I know it is easy for those who have been elected in recent years and \nwho have never served in the minority because they simply don't have \nthe experience of what it is like to be subject to a leader and a party \nwhich basically says: We don't care what you think, we don't care what \nyou say, we don't care what you do, none of it will be allowed unless \nwe give you consent to do it. I know a lot of my friends across the \naisle have said: It is your party that is holding things up and you are \nmaking the Senate a dysfunctional institution. What they haven't done \nis ask: Why are you doing this?\n  First of all, I don't believe we are the ones making it \ndysfunctional, but even if one thinks that, the question has not been \nasked: Why are you doing this? We are doing this because we have 3 \nyears, or more, of pent-up frustration under the leadership of this \nmajority leader who has essentially turned the Senate into the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  People say: Well, what is wrong with that? Majority vote rules on \njust about everything else we do, so why shouldn't majority vote rule \nhere? The Senate was not set up that way. It is famously known that the \nSenate was set up to be a place where tempers could be cooled, passions \ncould be cooled, something could be debated and worked on. And if major \nlegislation is passed that affects this country significantly, it is \npassed in a bipartisan fashion, following thorough debate. And we have \nalways had a provision which basically says those in the minority will \nhave their right to participate in the debate and have their right to \noffer amendments.\n  We have been shut down from offering amendments, and there has been \ngrowing frustration on our side because this is not how the Senate has \nworked traditionally. This has not how it has worked historically. This \nis not how it has worked according to the Founding Fathers' \ndetermination of protecting the Senate, giving Members an extra long \nterm, giving Members the opportunity to use the agreed-upon rules to \nallow the right of someone in the minority to speak up.\n  Democrats are going to rue the day when they made this move, when \nthey jammed this down our throats and said: If you don't like it, \ntough. Because at some point the pendulum will swing, and I think maybe \nsooner than a lot of people think; 2014 looks like a turnaround year. \nIf it is, they are suddenly going to find themselves in the minority, \nand we will see what happens and whether they will learn what it is \nlike to be denied the opportunity to be elected to the Senate and be a \nMember of this body, to be 1 of 100 people who are chosen to represent \ntheir States and represent the United States of America, and yet be \nshut down from having any opportunity whatsoever to have a voice in \nwhat goes forward here, shut down from offering your thoughts, your \namendment, and the ability to represent your State, and to be told by \nthe majority leader: I will decide whether you can have an amendment. \nAnd, by the way, I will use procedures to make sure you can't have your \namendment debated.\n  I have had the privilege of serving on two different occasions. I \ncame in early 1989 and served 10 years in the Senate. I don't recognize \nthe Senate today. I came back in 2010, 12 years later, and I don't \nrecognize this place. This is not the Senate I joined in 1989. It was \nunder Democratic control, like today, but it is different now. George \nMitchell was the majority leader at that time. The Democrats had the \nmajority. They controlled the Senate. I had served 10 years in the \nHouse of Representatives, along with my colleague from Kansas, Senator \nRoberts, who is here listening to me speak, and I appreciate that. We \nhave gone through this same experience. But when I served before under \nDemocratic leadership I realized what the difference was between the \nupper Chamber and the lower Chamber.\n  Under the genius of our Founding Fathers, the lower Chamber is \nelected every 2 years to represent the immediate concerns of the people \nof their State or their districts, and the Senate is given the \nopportunity to step back and take a broader look and work to fashion \nbipartisan support so something major that impacted the American people \nand impacted our constituents was debated and worked out through the \nprocess and gave us an opportunity to say: Wait just a minute. Do we \nwant to rush to judgment or do we want to just step back and look at \nthe larger picture?\n  So as a minority Member of the Republican Party in 1989 and following \nall the way up to 1995, I enjoyed and revered the opportunities I had \nto represent Hoosiers. Former Members of the House would ask me: What \nis the difference between serving in the House and serving in the \nSenate? And I would say: In the House, the majority party rules and you \nare lucky if you can get the Rules Committee over there to allow you to \nhave an amendment on a particular bill.\n  Every once in a while it would happen and you would say: Wow. This is \nspecial. But in the Senate, every minority Member can offer any \namendment to any bill at any time.\n  That is a great privilege that had been afforded to us and a \nnecessary privilege. Because without it, you get stuff rammed down your \nthroat that doesn't have bipartisan support, and you are denied the \nopportunity to participate, to amend, to adjust, to be a part of \nfashioning something that can be accepted by the American people with \nsupport from both sides.\n  So this boiling-up frustration that has been happening is increasing \nunder the leadership of this majority leader, who simply says: I am \ngoing to turn this into the House. I am going to change the 225-year \ntradition of this institution to something entirely different, and \nforget it, you guys on the other side, you in the minority. You don't \nhave the rights you once used to have.\n  I respected majority leader George Mitchell. He was tough. He ran \nthis place like clockwork. We were in late at nights a number of times, \nbut every Member of the minority had the opportunity and the right to \noffer an amendment, the right to participate, and the right to be \nheard. George Mitchell, as majority leader, recognized those rights and \nhe would say: Guys, ladies, you can offer any amendment you want. We \nwill take it up. We will have a vote on it. You may win, you may lose, \nbut you have that right.\n  So the reason we are frustrated, and the reason we are using some \nprocedures now, which are denying all of us a lot of sleep to make \nplans for the Christmas season with our families is that this \nfrustration with the majority leader has boiled over. The last insult \nwas basically saying: Forget it. Forget the rules, forget the \nprocedures, and forget the courtesy. Forget the privilege. Forget the \nrights you have enjoyed for all these years in the Senate. We are going \nto turn this into a different place and you just take it or leave it. \nSo we are kind of left with very few resources in being able to express \nhow we feel.\n  I think there is an easy solution to our problem, and it starts, No. \n1, with an understanding of the frustration each side has, but it has \nto include the understanding of why they are frustrated. It is not just \nthe Democrats who are frustrated with the Republicans trying to use \ntechniques that will allow us to at least have a say in how things are \nworking here but also frustration among Republicans. We're\n\n[[Page S8787]]\n\nfrustrated that bill after bill, time after time, we have amendments we \nwould like to offer, amendments that represent the wishes of the people \nof our States, our constituents and we are being denied that \nopportunity by the majority leader.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Would the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. COATS. Not everyone calls me distinguished, but I am happy to \nyield to someone who does but also a good friend.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. There is a good reason for that. We both came to the \nHouse at the same time. We were sorry to lose the Senator to the \nSenate.\n  I truly appreciate what the Senator has said. It reflects \nconversations we both have had to try to educate, to get to know or \nunderstand a little better what our colleagues across the aisle are \ndoing and why this is taking place and describe what our frustrations \nare. But the Senator has summarized them very well.\n  I urge my colleagues across the aisle to take the Senator's \nsuggestions--and plea on behalf of us all--to heart and would encourage \neverybody who has nothing else to do around here to read the \nCongressional Record and the Senator's remarks and take them to heart.\n  I remember so well, when I came to the Senate in 1996--and the \nSenator was here--I had an amendment I wanted to offer. Being a Member \nof the House for 16 years, what we had to do in the House was to check \nwith the chairman. We served in the minority and then the revolution \ncame in 1994 and things changed. But then, we had to go to the Rules \nCommittee, which the Senator has pointed out was a very unique \nexperience. I remember then what I had to do to get anything done in \nthe House is I basically had to find a Democratic colleague--a friend \nwho was serving in the majority--to cosponsor the bill which I had, put \nhis name first, and then go to the Rules Committee to make it in order \nso that my bill and his bill could work. My partner in this effort was \nCongressman Charlie Stenholm.\n  When I first went to the Rules Committee in the House, I had not been \nto the Rules Committee and I thought the debate would be about \ngermaneness or whether this bill should be considered or was it timely, \net cetera. I find out it was just a debate all over again on the merits \nof the bill. On a partisan, party-line vote, they would deny any \nRepublican amendments.\n  So Stenholm was a partner in that effort with that bill. I can't even \nremember which one it was at this particular time, but it was my first \nbig attempt and it was on the farm bill. We had mutual concerns and we \nthought it was a good amendment. It was the Roberts-Stenholm bill. It \ndidn't take me very long to figure out that the Roberts-Stenholm bill \nwas going nowhere. So Charlie leaned over and said: It might be a good \nidea if this was the Stenholm-Roberts bill or maybe just the Stenholm \nbill, and I said: I think you have got a pretty good idea.\n  So for a while it became the Stenholm bill, and it was made in order. \nThen, on the floor, Charlie Stenholm, being the kind Member he was, all \nof a sudden it became the Roberts-Stenholm bill again and it passed \nand, voila, my first amendment on the floor of the House.\n  So I had another amendment, this time in the Senate--and I know the \nSenator remembers well, because we were standing right about down here \nand I was asking him--I had checked with the ranking member and the \nchairman. At that time we were in control and we had the majority. I \nhad a very simple amendment. I will not go into it, but it was referred \nto the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. I was checking \naround with the ranking member and whomever, and they looked a little \nsurprised that I was even checking with them.\n  The chairman of the committee, a Republican chairman, indicated: I \nwould just as soon you wouldn't do that because we have a completed \nbill. We'll put it through the committee. I think your amendment has \nmerit.\n  I knew I had bipartisan support for it and I knew it was a very easy \namendment that would pass. But he told me: Just wait. We will take that \nup sometime down the road.\n  ``Down the road'' in the Senate means way down the road. So I was \nsort of grumpy, and you asked me what was wrong. I said: The chairman \ndoesn't like it. You said: Listen. This is the Senate. You can offer \nany amendment at any time whether it is germane or not. This is the \nSenate. You have rights.\n  I knew that. I had gone to the Robert C. Byrd lecture as a new \nMember. He lectured me on minority rights and how we should conduct \nourselves. He was the institutional flame of the Senate.\n  Then Senator Coats urged me to offer the amendment. I should have \ndone it, but I thought: All right. I will wait. I will defer to the \nchairman's advice. I have often regretted that. Later--I am talking \nabout 2 or 3 years later--the same subject came up. I happened to be on \nthe floor, and Senator Ted Kennedy was in charge. They had taken back \ncontrol. He knew about the amendment. He said: Would you like to get \nyour amendment passed? He was standing on the floor and there was \nhardly anybody else here and, bingo, using the parliamentary procedure \nthat you could do in the majority, my amendment was passed. It was not \nthe Kennedy-Roberts bill, by the way. It was still the Roberts bill \nthat was authorized. We didn't get too much money for it, but at least \nwe made the effort.\n  I have gone into a long personal history just to demonstrate exactly \nhow this works.\n  Now we have a farm bill that has been hung up for over 2 years. We \nhave a farm bill that the principals are meeting on in secret. There \nare 37 of us who are also on the conference wondering where on Earth is \nthe farm bill. The House has just passed by unanimous consent an \nextension of the current farm bill as we did last year.\n  Last year, we passed a farm bill. Last year, the majority leader in a \ndiscussion with me said: If you can get it done in 3 days, I will let \nit happen. Note, ``I will let it happen.'' Chairperson Stabenow \ncertainly was working extremely hard on her side, I was working on my \nside, we were going to the steering committee and said: I think we can \nget regular order. I think you can get your amendments up. Nobody \nbelieved me.\n  We had 73 amendments. We did it in 2\\1/2\\ days. Once that tipping \npoint hits and people start withdrawing amendments, you get your work \ndone. But the minority had every opportunity to offer amendments.\n  So one year ago, considering the farm bill, the first amendment was \nby Senator Rand Paul considering the Pakistani who helped us with \nregard to the Osama bin Laden raid. He was in prison, and so Senator \nPaul thought it would be a good idea to hold the aid to Pakistan until \nthey released the prisoner.\n  What did that have to do with the farm bill? Nothing. It was the \nfirst amendment considered. It didn't pass, by the way. But many other \namendments that came from folks who had never had the opportunity for \nan amendment to be brought up and discussed, well, those amendments \nwere discussed in the farm bill. I would say that probably, of the 73 \namendments that were considered, there were 300 offered. People \nwould get up and they would have their say. They discussed the \namendment. They knew probably it would not pass, and they would \nwithdraw it. But they at least had an opportunity to present their \nopinion and represent their States and their constituents and we made \nsure they had that opportunity.\n\n  This year's farm bill wasn't 73 amendments. We only voted about 10 \ntimes. Senator Thune, a respected Member of the Agriculture Committee; \nSenator Johanns, former Secretary of Agriculture, Senator Grassley, and \nmyself, we all together had a total of about 12 amendments. We withdrew \nthose from consideration during the committee markup and said we will \ntake them up on the floor--except, on the floor, the majority leader \ncut debate off, saying: Time out. No more. So none of us got those \namendments.\n  As the former chairman of the Agriculture Committee in the House and \nthe ranking member last year, I have to wonder, what is that all about? \nYou have a farm bill, you have people on the Agriculture Committee, \nthey have pertinent amendments with regard to the direction of the \nbill--and, bingo, you are cut short. That causes a lot of frustration, \nto say the least.\n\n[[Page S8788]]\n\n  I have gotten into the weeds on this simply because of our friendship \nand the Senator's advice to me, which I treasure. But the Senator's \nwillingness to come and speak from the heart to demonstrate to our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle: Think about this. Think \nabout why we are doing this. Why we are doing this is because if you \nbreak the rules--which they have--to change the rules, it can't be \nupheld. More especially on nominations, what is happening is we are \npacking the District Court in Washington, which is the appeals court--\nprobably more important than the Supreme Court in deciding on all the \nregulatory matters that come up; i.e., the President's Executive \norders, the President's waivers, the President's interim final rules or \nany agencies interim final rules--we have government by regulation \ntoday. We do not have government by legislation today. We have \ngovernment by regulation and this court becomes the Senate.\n  We had an even number of judges, and now we are going to have three \nmore. Consequently, the President--who says he can't work with the \nRepublicans but in fact it is he who will not work with Republicans--is \ngoing to have his way because this is going to be jammed down our \nthroats.\n  When the Senator goes back to Indiana and when I go back to Kansas, \none of the top issues we hear about from any economic sector of our \neconomy is: What on Earth is going on with all these regulations? \nSomebody holds up a piece of paper and says: Pat, are you aware of this \nregulation? No, I am not, but I will check on it. What is our ability \nto deal with that? Almost nothing.\n  So we have government by overregulation.\n  That is what this is about. The agenda by the President to add more \nregulation to get his agenda done is being challenged and going through \nthe courts as opposed to the Senate of the United States. That is why \nwe are faced here with this situation. That is why I was here from 8 to \n9 talking about Iran. The Senator is talking about the issue at hand, \nand I truly appreciate it.\n  I thank the Senator for coming to the floor. I thank the Senator for \nmaking these comments. I just wish people would understand why we are \nfeeling this frustration and have a more accurate reflection of what is \ngoing on here. I know that is not reflected much in the media. I \nunderstand that, but that is simply the case.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank my colleague from Kansas. I am glad he mentioned \nhis own personal experience and our experiences together.\n  It is more than about the Senator from Indiana or the Senator from \nKansas. It is about this institution. It is about the future of the \nSenate. What kind of a body are we going to be? Are we going to be the \nSenate which has been the Senate for 225 years, with the rights of the \nminority being able to be expressed?\n  How the majority leader can look across the aisle and say: The former \nchairman of the Agriculture Committee, the former Secretary of \nAgriculture can't have a say in the farm bill. It is a treasure trove \nof experience, it is a treasure trove of knowledge of the whole \nagricultural sector, and the majority leader whimsically just simply \nsays: Because I am in power and I can tell you what you can do and what \nyou can't do, forget it. Forget your adjustments to this.\n  But that leads us right into the most egregious power grab of all, \nand that was when, under total Democratic control both in the House and \nthe Senate and at the Presidency in White House, Democrats decided they \nwere going to tell us how we should reshape our health care system and \nreadjust one-sixth of the entire U.S. economy and, by the way, we have \nall this expertise--or we think we have this expertise--and we will \nwrap all this up in one 2,000-plus page bill and we will run it down \nyour throats without any input from the other side.\n  Oh, we had input. But the rules were adjusted, the vote was changed, \nand it was passed by a simple majority and, therefore, had no \nconstructive impact from those who did not think this was the right way \nto address our health care system. Now look at the mess we are in.\n  We have been talking for days about calls--not reflecting just our \nviews but calls from constituents saying: What in the world have you \ndone?\n  The reason I ran in 2010 is I was so upset about two major things: \nOne, the way the Democrats have essentially taken this health care \nbill: Don't worry about reading it, as Nancy Pelosi said; we will find \nout later. Boy, are we finding out about it later. Frankly, those who \nwrote it are finding out about it later. The people it has been imposed \nupon, the people we represent are now finding out about it later.\n  I have a whole packetful of responses. I don't know if they are \nRepublicans, Democrats, liberals or Conservatives. All I know is they \nare my constituents--I represent all of them and am trying my best to \nrepresent them--and they have flooded my office with tweets and \nFacebook and all this social stuff that I have a little trouble \ngrasping right now--but emails and letters pouring in, phone calls \njammed, people saying: What have you done to us? What are you imposing \non us?\n  I can go through and read horror stories about people and the broken \npromises. I think as the Senator from Kansas knows--we have both been \nin this business here for a while--you better be careful if you fall \ninto the trap of going home and promising what you can't deliver.\n  It is so easy to walk in front of groups and say what they really \nwant to hear so they will like you and vote for you in the next \nelection. It is so easy to go home and promise something that makes \npeople feel good so they will feel good about you, but you better be \ncareful because if you overpromise and underperform, they are going to \nsay: Wait a minute.\n  No one has overpromised and underperformed more than this President \nof the United States regarding health care. He said, ``If you like your \ndoctor, you can keep your doctor, period.'' I bet the President wishes \nhe had not said ``period.''\n  I am sure he wishes he had not said, ``If you like your doctor, you \ncan keep your doctor.'' Thousands of people in Indiana are saying: I \ncan't keep my doctor. Mr. President, you promised, and you said \n``period.'' What does ``period'' mean? Hey, take it to the bank. Count \non it. Finally, finito, no more questions need to be asked. I am \ntelling you: If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor, period. \nNothing more needs to be said.\n  The same was said about: Don't worry, your premiums won't go up. \nDon't worry, you can keep your plan. If you like your plan, you can \nkeep your plan.\n  I don't know how many hundreds of letters I have received from people \nwho say: I love my plan. Why do you think I chose it? If I didn't like \nmy plan, I wouldn't have selected my plan. Now those people are getting \nletters saying: Your plan is no good. You have to go into the \ngovernment's plan. You have to go into the ObamaCare plan, and this is \ngoing to be affordable. Don't worry, folks, no money will be spent.\n  Were we told about the $400 million that was spent just to fashion \nthe Web site? Can you imagine how they screwed up the Web site. After \n3\\1/2\\ years they cannot even put out a Web site. I am getting horror \nstories about the Web site, which are continuing, by the way.\n  If you can't do that, how are you going to manage the program if you \ndo get people signed up? On and on it goes. But this idea of promising, \nand now having these promises broken, just feeds into the cynicism and \nthe lack of trust among the American people and in the institutions of \ngovernment, their elected representatives, and in their President. That \nis just a cancer in this country. If you can't put your faith and trust \nin the promises of what is said by the people who represent you and who \nare making the laws you have to comply with, that is a sad day.\n  I yield to the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. When the President said if you like your doctor, you can \nkeep him, period, that isn't really what he meant. Really he meant, if \nyou like your plan, you can keep it--semicolon--if I like it. He really \nmeant: If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor if it is \npossible and we think it is all right.\n  Mr. COATS. If I could add to what the Senator said, if you don't like \nyour plan and if you want something different, we will tell you what \nyou have to like and what you don't have to like. It is no longer your \nchoice. We\n\n[[Page S8789]]\n\nwill tell you what we think you need, but you can't make that decision \nfor yourself.\n  So here is our plan: If you look at our plans, you can pick one of \nthose, but if you want something different and if you want to go to the \ninsurance company for you or your employees or employee-sponsored plan, \nforget it because we know more than you do. We wrote the law, and we \nwrote the law because we don't think you have the intelligence or \nability to figure out what is best for yourself.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. These were called lemon plans, shoddy plans, substandard \nplans, plans that were denigrated even though the families involved had \na plan they liked. I am sure the same is true in Indiana as it is in \nKansas. More people have lost their insurance after they have signed \nup.\n  We understand that we have a lot left to do with health care reform, \nand I would say that almost every Senator has a 5-point plan on what \nthey would like to do, and it is certainly more market oriented.\n  I will tell you what also isn't working, as opposed to the rollout, \nis the advertising for this. Some of it is unbelievable. Thank goodness \nthe media is now watching and paying attention to this issue. There is \na rap group that is on television that said it is cool to sign up for \nObamaCare. Why on Earth are the taxpayers paying for that when every \nday Secretary Sebelius is changing the game, along with the President?\n  The President changed this plan about 17 times. Maybe that is a low \nnumber now, but if that's what he wants he should come back to the \nCongress for that. I think a lot of these changes are unconstitutional. \nAt least he should come back to the Congress, which gets me back to my \nfriend's basic point.\n  What would have happened if we had gone ahead with regular order and \nsworn in Scott Brown as the new Senator from Massachusetts and then it \nwould not have been on a one-vote margin with regard to ObamaCare, or \nthe Affordable Care Act, or whatever it was called back then, the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The acronym for that, by \nthe way, is PPACA, which I think pretty well sums it up.\n  At any rate, had that happened, they would have had to have some kind \nof bipartisan agreement, which is really what we are talking about when \nwe talk about breaking the rules now. They didn't have to do that \nbecause they would not swear in Scott, and so there we were on \nChristmas Eve.\n  None of us knew what was in the bill because it was in Harry Reid's \noffice. As a member of the HELP Committee, I was privileged to consider \nthis bill. We worked hard. I had three amendments on rationing--I am \nstill worried about rationing. There are four rationers that I will not \nget into now.\n  IPAB is the No. 1 issue I am worried about. They decide the \nreimbursements that your hospitals in Indiana will get, and that my \nhospitals will get, and that is why we are trying to do the SGR reform \nand the Doc Fix.\n  We were in the HELP Committee, and we had three amendments, and all \nthree were defeated by a party-line vote. That mark--I don't know where \nthat bill is now--I think it is collecting dust. Then my amendments \nwere considered by the Finance Committee. Then I wanted to offer the \namendments on the floor.\n  I did this because we are going to have a lot of problems with the \nrationing boards making decisions as opposed to individual patients and \ntheir doctors--if they can even have their doctor, period.\n  So we get back, again, to regular order. We get back to respecting \nthe minority's rights. We get back to protecting minority rights. Had \nwe had those amendments, I think this bill possibly could have been \nworked out. I now believe that this bill was proposed by those who \nreally prefer national health insurance, and this was a stalking horse \nfor national health insurance. I don't think anybody on that side of \nthe aisle realized that this bill would be like Thelma and Louise going \noff into the canyon, but that is what happened. So now we have this \nmess on our hands and every day we learn about something new.\n  The Secretary came out with something yesterday with additional \nchanges. It doesn't really mean anything because she is just simply \nurging the insurance companies to go back and talk to those folks the \nSenator from Indiana was talking about--about the plan they would like \nto have or the plan they would like to keep. She is just saying to the \ninsurance companies: We urge you to do that.\n  What is that all about? The toothpaste is out of the tube. I don't \nknow how on Earth you can get that done. There were other suggestions. \nI am getting off subject here because my friend started out talking \nabout the rights of the minority, and the health reform bill didn't \npass with any Republican votes and very little Republican input. I \nthink, in part, that is why it has crashed and is burning right now.\n  If we had just had regular order input during that particular time, I \nthink there would have been a better product. I probably still would \nhave voted no because I don't want national health insurance. I feel a \nlot better that I expressed my rant to my friend from Indiana, and it \nhas been a better morning as a result.\n  I think anybody listening to us could finally understand the depth of \nour frustration. We want to be a part of this Senate and we have a \nright to be a part of this Senate, but that right and privilege \neverybody had for 225 years has now been taken away.\n  It will be interesting when, in fact, the pendulum does swing back \nand Republicans are in control. What will we do? Will we go back to the \n225-year precedent or will we say: Well, what is good for the goose is \ngood for the gander? Will we seek a pound of flesh or two? I don't know \nwhat we will do. I hope that we will go back to the 225-year precedent. \nIt would be the right thing to do, but it will be interesting to see.\n  I thank the Senator from Indiana for allowing me to share his time.\n  Mr. COATS. The Senator from Kansas is a long-time friend and someone \nI have had the privilege of serving with and getting to know on a \npersonal basis--he and his wife and family. We are both here with some \nexperience under our belts, and unlike many of our colleagues who may \nsee only one side of the story, we have been on both sides.\n  I had my differences with Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia. There \nwas no greater defender of the rights for the minority than Senator \nRobert Byrd, a Democrat who served his lifetime in the U.S. Senate.\n  I wish there had been some respect for what Senator Byrd said. I can \nsee him standing on the floor saying: It doesn't matter how partisan \nthis is, these privileges are engraved in stone. We have learned from \nour Founding Fathers, and they learned through their adverse \nexperiences throughout history about denying the minority a voice, a \nright to participate. This never would have happened if Robert Byrd \nwere here.\n  I know there are new Members who have just not experienced what it is \nlike to be told to sit down and shut up. We will tell you what you can \nsay and what amendment you can offer, if any. To be told time after \ntime after time--and you know it builds. As all the bills come up and \nyou have five things you would like to get done this year on behalf of \nyour constituents, and you wait for the next bill to be brought up and \nyou say: Mr. Leader, can I have an amendment on this bill?\n  Sorry, no more amendments. I filled the tree. It is done. We are \ngoing to move forward.\n  OK. I will go to the next one. Can I have it on the next one?\n  Here we are at the end of the year and the cycle is over--done. \nSorry. You can't represent your constituents with what you think they \nwant to do.\n  Maybe my amendments wouldn't have prevailed, but at least I would \nhave been in the fight and people would have had the opportunity to put \ntheir yes or no vote on it. That way I could go home and say: I gave it \neverything I had. I didn't win, but I was fighting for you, and I was \nallowed the opportunity to do it.\n  As it is now, we go home and say: I wasn't even allowed to express \nyour interest--you, my constituents' interests--through offering an \namendment to the bill as a Member of the minority. I mean, the history \nof this place, the history of Democratic leaders when they had power, \nis a respect for that right, for the right of the institution.\n\n[[Page S8790]]\n\nIt is not about Senator Coats or Senator Roberts. It is not about the \ncurrent state of the Republican Party in the Senate. It is about this \ninstitution. It is about what goes forward. Do we want to turn this \nthing into a ``we got the power and you might as well just go \nhome.'' That is what the frustration is. I hope the new Members who \nlook at this and say this should be a more efficient place and we \nshouldn't have to go through all of this--we wouldn't have to go \nthrough all of this if they would just give us a chance to participate. \nBut how else can we express our frustration other than at least having \nthe opportunity to slow things down here so maybe we will be listened \nto?\n\n  Maybe they will go to some of--I wish they had listened to Senator \nLevin, who has been here a long time and who is a respected Democrat \nand chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Senator Levin came to the \nfloor and said ``we should not be doing this'' to his own colleagues. \nHe made a compassionate plea, a compelling argument that we shouldn't \ndo this.\n  I think back to the Republican leaders and the Democratic leaders, \nwhether they were majority leader or minority leader, and both came to \nthe agreement that these rights need to be protected, whether it was \nBob Dole, George Mitchell, Trent Lott, or Tom Daschle. I mean, all of a \nsudden we are cast into a situation here, which is, sit down and shut \nup. We have the votes. Tough.\n  That is our frustration. And I would tell my colleagues, think about \nthis. Think about how we can get back to what the Senate has been for \n225 years, and think about what it might be like for them when they are \nin the minority. They are going to want to go home and tell their \nconstituents: I am sorry, the other party rules and I don't have any \npower at all. I don't have any ability to represent you at all. I can't \noffer any amendment expressing your wishes, and we won't have a chance \nto get it to a vote.\n  Senators will have to go home and say: I was denied the opportunity \nto even put it up for a vote.\n  I remember--of course, Senator Roberts knows this well--how Bob Dole \nwould say: Look, this is the U.S. Senate. We have to take tough votes. \nWe are not going to win every one. Members are going to have to go home \nand explain those votes. But this isn't just a deny, don't take tough \nvotes because we don't want to explain them back home. Step up, debate \nit, and vote. We might win, we might lose, but we are here to vote. We \nare here to give everyone a right to have a vote on how to best \nrepresent their constituents. We didn't come here to avoid votes, to \nhide behind a desk and say: Oh, this might affect the next election.\n  I really came down here to talk about the debacle of ObamaCare. I \nhave all of these letters. All one has to do is turn on the television \nor the radio or read the newspaper or talk to a neighbor. \nUnfortunately, the word is not spreading about this situation through \nthe media, but I think even the media is realizing what a debacle this \nwhole thing is. But all one has to do is talk to a neighbor at the \nbowling league or church.\n  I got my termination letter, and I don't know what I am going to do.\n  I have tried 21 times to get in the Web site. I can't get in.\n  No one is talking about the fact that, ironically, those who wrote \nthe bill--the President of the United States and his executives--are \nfortunate that they don't have to go into ObamaCare. I don't know why \nthis hasn't been more publicized. Is this the ultimate in hypocrisy? To \nthe American people: We have decided this is good for everybody except \nus, by the way, so we are exempting ourselves. The President of the \nUnited States, all his Cabinet Secretaries, his political appointees, \nhis major staff, and even some of the staff who wrote the bill exempted \nthemselves. How can they write reasonable legislation, impose it on \n300-and-some million Americans and say: Well, that is not for me. It is \nfor you, but since I am writing the bill, I can write an exemption for \nmyself.\n  I don't know why the media is not all over this. I don't know why we \nhaven't had an amendment from the Democratic side saying: This is \nwrong. How do we go home and tell people that my President and my \nmajority leader's staff is exempt and it will not be imposed on all of \nus?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, it isn't as \nif we haven't tried.\n  Mr. COATS. No, it is not as if we haven't tried.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. As the Senator knows, Senators are under that \nobligation--and their staffs. The committee staff is different, the \nleadership staff is different, and as the Senator pointed out, the \nexecutive is different. What is that all about? It should be uniform or \nnot all, and it should be uniform for everybody who had a hand in this \ndebacle.\n  I even thought about an amendment saying that those who didn't vote \nfor it--I voted against ObamaCare three times: Once in the HELP \nCommittee, once in the Finance Committee, and once it came out of Harry \nReid's office. My colleagues said: Did you read the bill? Nobody read \nthe bill because it had been changed, so then we had to wade through \nit, and then, as different events came about, one problem led to \nanother problem, that problem led to two problems, and those problems \nled to other problems, so we are still finding out about that.\n  But back to the point of the Senator from Indiana, we can name \nSenators who said: Look, let's make this uniform. If it is good enough \nfor Americans, it ought to be good enough for us. And that just has not \nhappened.\n  Mr. COATS. Well, it has happened to us, and I spent tortuous hours \ntrying to sign up on the DC exchange.\n  We all have to go through this as Members. People don't understand \nthis back home. They think we are exempt. We are not. I went through \nthis tortuous process for two hours because of all kinds of technical \nproblems. I hit the confirm button. Error--not enrolled. I had to do it \nall over again. The second time I got a confirmation. I told my staff \nto print it--you are enrolled in the DC exchange; you are part of \nObamaCare now.\n  I got the piece of paper, my secretary goes down to the disbursing \noffice to confirm it, and they say: Senator Coats is not enrolled.\n  How about this piece of paper?\n  They say: Well, I know it says you are, but maybe there is a \ntechnical difficulty.\n  Does that ring a bell for anybody? And there are horror stories I \nhave heard from people who have tried not just 2 times or 10 times but \n21 times.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, if the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. COATS. I yield to the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. My wife is much more adept at the social media \ncapability, and so it was up to her. I thought we were confirmed, only \nto find out almost before the deadline--it was midnight, and there was \na desperate attempt on the part of my staff and myself. I needed help \nto get this done, so I had to redo it. Then the thought occurred to me, \nwe are going to have two Pat Roberts in there: one that my wife did and \nthen the new attempt. I hope that is not the case. I think maybe we \nhave it cleared up, but I am not sure, so we will find out. I hope we \ndon't have to work to find out, but we will find out.\n  I think that is just a duplication of what everybody in the country \nis going through. And then what do you do if, in fact, you can't have \ninsurance and you find out about copays and deductibles and all of \nthis. I am repeating a sad story that I think everybody knows.\n  I thank the Senator from Indiana once again for his heartfelt plea to \nmake the other side understand the error of their ways. I hope we can \nfix this. I hope they can see fit to fix this down the road. I doubt \nthat will be the case, and I don't think the country will be better off \nas a result.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator from Kansas. He mentioned signing up \nhere and the frustrations so many people had.\n  Kathleen from Mooresville, IN, called my office in Indianapolis and \nsaid: Help. She said this: I have spoken to someone at the 1-800 number \nhelpline for the Federal exchange 21 times since October 21--when she \nfirst began to try to enroll on the healthcare.gov Web site.\n  Twenty-one times she had tried this, so she called our office in \ndesperation and told us: Well, at one point I asked if I could be \ntransferred to this advanced resolution group--which was\n\n[[Page S8791]]\n\nsome other group set up to help people who couldn't get into the Web \nsite, I guess--and the customer service representative said that he did \nnot know how to transfer her to that site.\n  She said: Well, I need help. How can I get it?\n  So she finally then called the insurer directly to try to enroll, and \nthey said: Well, the only way you are going to get this done is if you \nbypass the whole ObamaCare Web site because we can't do it either. So \nthey finally figured out that she had enrolled through the insurance \ncompany, but she felt she needed to let the government site people know \nso they would not put her on the list that she hadn't enrolled.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Right.\n  Mr. COATS. So she called up there and finally got through to \nsomebody, and he said one word--``fine''--and hung up. Well, he \nprobably was so frustrated.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the Senator yield for one more observation.\n  Mr. COATS. Yes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I was watching the news last night, and many more \nmillions of dollars are now being spent to hire more navigators, so the \nSenator's constituent should have had a navigator. In many cases they \nwant navigators, and now they are being hired from various community \norganizations, some of which I really wonder about. But in some States \nwhere only hundreds have signed up, there will be more navigators than \npeople who have signed up. So obviously it has gotten to the point \nwhere everybody has a problem, where insurance ought to have a \nnavigator. This is at considerable expense--I don't remember now how \nmany millions it totals--and a brand new group of navigators is being \nhired at considerable expense to make this work. And the advertising \nrolls on, and then the news media discovers more and more about all the \nproblems.\n  I appreciate the Senator bringing this to the attention of the \nAmerican people.\n  I note the distinguished Senator from Nebraska is here, and he even \nhas a chart that will educate the American people.\n  Mr. COATS. He is. I am happy to yield to him, but I have about 5 more \nminutes left, I want to wrap up with one more story from Doug from \nIndiana.\n  After 2 weeks of trying to get on the Web site, he finally was able \nto at least create a log-in name and password. Then he had to try for \nanother week to secure coverage, never successfully getting through, \nbut he finally completed the form, submitted it, and then had the \nsecurity questions sent back to him so they could verify that he is who \nhe said he is.\n  He received four questions.\n  Question No. 1: Our records indicate you lived on the following \nstreet in the last 2 years. What city is this in?\n  Well, the street they listed is where his sister lives, and she \ndoesn't even use the same last name, so I am not sure how they came up \nwith that. Doug had never lived there or had any financial dealings \nwith that property. So how do you answer--I am quoting him--how do you \nanswer a question as stupid as that?\n  They said: Well, we can't verify you because you didn't give us the \nanswer.\n  He said: I have never lived there. That is my sister.\n  Question No. 2 was about which county he lived in, and I think they \ngot that right.\n  Question No. 3 was to include his previous employers. Well, the only \nprevious employer listed that was accurate was misspelled, so Doug \nsaid: Well, how do I answer that?\n  Question No. 4: Our records indicate that you purchased pet insurance \nin the last 2 years. What is the name of your pet?\n  I mean, you can't make this up. If ``Seinfeld'' were still going, \nthis would be a great episode. This would be one of the greatest \nepisodes ever.\n  Doug had not had a pet for over 10 years, and he has never purchased \npet insurance, but they said: What pet insurance do you have?\n  I have a dog, but I don't have insurance for it. Maybe I should. But \nthey didn't ask me that question, so maybe I am OK.\n  So he put down ``none of the above,'' and since he did that, they \nsaid: Sorry, since you didn't answer the security questions, we can't \nenroll you in ObamaCare.\n  I mean, you can't make this up. It is a Hollywood scriptwriter's \ndream for a soap opera or for a comedy such as ``Seinfeld.'' If \n``Seinfeld'' were still on, this would be unbelievable.\n  Of course, every night on the late night talk shows we here about all \nof these horror stories and so forth and so on. It is comical, but it \nis sad. It is sad. It is an overreach by government. There are limits \nto what it can do and what it can't do, and we clearly have reached the \nlimit on this one. I think an apology is due to the American people. I \nthink we ought to step back and say: Let's do this over and do it \nright. Let's do it with bipartisan support. Let's do the sensible \nthings that are affordable and will allow people to keep their doctor, \nthat will allow people to keep their health care plan if they like it, \nand will provide means by which we can address the uninsured, the \npreconditions, and those who need insurance but do it in a way that is \nbased on tested free market principles, not on a nanny government that \nsays: We know better than you. Boy, have we proved that is not true.\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I will start by thanking my colleagues \nfrom Indiana and Kansas for their discussion on this very important \nissue. I say this somewhat facetiously, but I have been reading the \nstories about the rollout of ObamaCare just like the rest of us have. \nWhat an incredible embarrassment. If there is a State out there that \nepitomizes the embarrassment of all embarrassments, it is the State of \nOregon. Recently, they had not signed up a single person through their \nexchange--not one. Not a single person in Oregon could get through \nthat. That is notwithstanding that the Democratic Governor supported \nit, embraced it, notwithstanding that the U.S. Senators in this body \nsupported it, embraced it. They could not find a single person.\n  Well, I just read an article; I think it was this morning. I was \ncatching up on some reading. Somehow, some way, they went out there and \nthey found 44 people in Oregon who have signed up successfully. After \nall of these weeks since this rollout occurred, they probably went \ndoor-to-door in Oregon and found 44 people who they believe have signed \nup successfully. We will see whether they actually have insurance.\n  Well, maybe we could offer this for that poor State: Maybe we could \noffer that if they signed up successfully, they get a picture with \ntheir Governor and their U.S. Senators--their own individual picture. \nMadam President, 44 people would not be too many to get through in a \npicture line. They probably have fundraisers that are twice that big or \nthree times that big, where they do pictures with everybody. I think \nthose persistent citizens of the great State of Oregon deserve \nsomething more than just a mention that they are 1 of 44 in some \nnewspaper somewhere, that they successfully navigated the site. I would \noffer that I think they need a picture.\n  Mr. COATS. Autographed.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. An autographed picture with their U.S. Senators and \ntheir Governor.\n  Let me move on to something far more serious, and I am going to talk \nabout ObamaCare too. I am going to tie that into why I believe this \nprocess we are going through relating to our constitutional right to \nadvise and consent the President of the United States when it comes to \nhis appointments--I am going to tie that into why I believe that has \nall happened and why we find ourselves here today because of this \nfailed ObamaCare system.\n  Yesterday when I was on the floor, I talked at some length about the \nhistory of filibuster changes. I mentioned that I have a tremendous \namount of respect for a Senator who passed not all that long ago, who \nserved in this body for a long time and probably knew the body better \nthan anybody who ever served in the history of the Senate. That would \nbe Senator Bob Byrd.\n  I came here, and he was in failing health by the time I arrived in \nthe Senate about 5 years ago, but what a wonderful man. I got to know \nhim a little bit. We actually participated, worked together on a \nclimate change amendment. The knowledge this gentleman had of the \nSenate was always amazing to me.\n\n[[Page S8792]]\n\n  On the 200th anniversary of what is called the Great Compromise, when \nthe whole concept of the U.S. Senate was created, some people went to \nSenator Byrd and convinced him that speeches he had given on the floor \nof the Senate and historical writings he had done should be put \ntogether in a book. It would be commemorative of the 200th anniversary \nof the U.S. Senate--the Great Compromise. So that was done.\n  When I first got to know Senator Byrd, I became so impressed with the \nman that I decided that my Senate office needed that historical record \nfrom him. Well, I thought I was buying a book. I was not buying a book \nat all. I was buying four books--four books filled with beautiful \ninformation about the Senate, its history, people who had served here, \npeople who stood up for the U.S. Senate and therefore stood up for the \npeople they represented in the United States of America.\n  I talked a little bit yesterday about that history leading up to \nfilibuster changes. It was the system here originally in the early part \nof our country--in fact, until the early 1900s--where basically there \nwas not a way to end debate. So if a debate was going on, an individual \nSenator could come to the floor and literally take a bill down a path \nwhere it may never become law. Somehow, some way, through the years the \nSenate figured out a way to operate with that kind of unusual situation \nwhere a single Senator could take a bill down that road.\n  Along came World War I. If you think about World War I, there were \nmany Members in the body who had pretty close relatives in Germany, and \nthis was a challenge because they had to debate and decide issues \nrelating to that war and that country. As we might expect, it became \nvery difficult to get things passed.\n  A piece of legislation came forward, and you can imagine what \nhappened. It got carried down this road of never seeing the light of \nday, and they could not get that legislation passed although that \nlegislation was considered very important by many in our country, maybe \nthe vast majority of the people in our country.\n  The country reacted to that, and there was a big debate. I think \npeople in this body and people in the country came to the conclusion \nthat kind of this open-ended process where debate may never end--and \nthere was no vehicle or mechanism to end that debate--well, that had to \nend; that somehow, some way, the wisdom of the individual Members in \nthis body had to be brought to bear on how to allow Senators to have \ntheir day, have their say, be able to come here and debate the great \nissues and offer amendments. How could we allow that to happen and give \nthem their rights as Senators while still having an ability at some \npoint to stop the debate and cast a vote? The Senators, in their \nwisdom, decided they had to find that way, and they did.\n\n  Originally, if I remember the history correctly, and I may have this \npiece not quite accurate, but I think they agreed that two-thirds of \nthe Senators could vote at some point to end debate and then vote on \nthe legislation. But Senators still had the right to offer amendments. \nThey still had the right to come to the floor and debate. They still \nhad the right to work through the day and the night and build \ncoalitions to get their amendments passed, to shape a piece of \nlegislation, to make that legislation maybe better for the country or \nfor their individual State. All of those rights continued to exist \nbecause, after all, everybody recognized that the power of an \nindividual Senator to do that was significant to our country. It was \nimportant to our Nation, not only then but in the future.\n  That process went on for a number of decades following that decision. \nThen in the 1970s a decision was made again by this body under its \nrules, and that decision basically said: When 60 Senators come to the \nfloor and they agree to end debate, that they would get themselves to a \npoint where that debate would terminate and they could vote on passage \nof the bill, they could vote on getting that bill done. So in the \n1970s, 60 votes became the norm.\n  An important point to mention is this: The rights we have as \nindividual Senators representing our constituency--which in my case is \nthe great people of Nebraska, and the people of the United States of \nAmerica, for that matter--those rights were intended to exist in every \nrespect. In other words, I could come to the floor as a Senator, under \nthe rules, and if a piece of legislation was there and I had an \nimportant issue I wanted to bring to the attention of the country or \nthis body, I could offer an amendment, and, except under certain \ncircumstances, that amendment did not even need to be germane.\n  I remember, for example, that when this health care bill was passed \nthere was a provision that if somebody in business bought over $600 \nworth of items, they had to file forms with the IRS, a 1099, and give a \nform to the vendor.\n  That is a mess because you never know if the first purchase on \nJanuary 1 is going to be the last purchase or the first of a series of \npurchases that get you over $600. I wanted to get that out of the bill. \nIt did not make any sense. Even the citizens' advocate for the IRS was \nsaying: Well, gosh, we have looked at this. It does not make any sense.\n  So we started working, and on every piece of legislation that would \ncome forward I would offer that amendment to get rid of the 1099 \nrequirement in the health care bill. Originally, I was nearly laughed \nout of the Chamber. Democrats who had passed the bill were basically \nsaying to me: You want us to change our bill? Get lost. I came back a \nsecond time. I came back a third time. I came back a fourth time. The \nbusiness community got involved, and small businesses started calling \ntheir Senators and saying: Senator, please, look at what Mike is \noffering. This is sensible. This needs to happen. We offered it a fifth \ntime. At some point, the President of the United States in his State of \nthe Union--I was sitting right there, about two rows back from where he \nwas. Madam President, I was not any farther from the President of the \nUnited States than I am standing from you today. He mentioned that it \nwas time for this provision to go. So we offered it a sixth time, and \nthen we offered it a seventh time, and we finally got it done.\n  Do you know what? I did not go out and crow: My goodness, I must be \nthe smartest Senator in the body or I must be the best Republican and \nthose evil Democrats. I did not do that at all. I went out and I said \nto public: This is very important for small businesses. I am glad my \ncolleagues agree with me, and we can all take credit for this. Go back \nhome and tell people you supported it.\n  There were very few who voted against it in this body. So an issue \nthat started out with basically no support to speak of in a bipartisan \nway not only got huge bipartisan support--over 80 votes--it even got a \nmention by the President of the United States in his State of the Union \nAddress as something that needed to get done. And we could all take \nownership of it then and today.\n  Why do I mention that point? I mention that point because those \nrights continued after those filibuster changes. This body came to the \nconclusion that under the Senate rules it was appropriate to somehow \nget to a point where we could say: OK, everybody, you have had your \nday. It is time to bring the debate to an end, if we can, if we can get \nsufficient votes. If we cannot, well then we cannot. This bill is \nprobably not going to go any further. That has been the history of this \ninstitution literally from its beginning. Read Bob Byrd's books. He \nwill explain that to you. As you read what he is saying there, you \nbegin to feel the admiration that he felt for the Senate. But the other \nthing you will begin to feel as you read through these books is this: \nYou will begin to feel how deeply he cared about the individual rights \nof each Senator, whether they were in the majority, whether they were \nDemocrats, whether they were in the minority, whether they were \nRepublicans. You see, Senator Byrd understood that the pendulum does \nswing. There will be times where Republicans will be in control of the \nSenate. The voters will decide that. There will be times, therefore, \nthat Democrats will be in the minority.\n\n  He also understood that there would be times when Democrats would be \nin the majority and Republicans would be in the minority and that as \nour country would go through various transformations and various \npolitical processes, we would end up with a different\n\n[[Page S8793]]\n\nSenate depending upon what happened in each election cycle.\n  But the one thing Senator Byrd wanted to emphasize and hold as a \nsacred constant in our system of government was that each Senator had \nrights. Each Senator could come to the floor and exercise those rights \nwhether the person they called leader was Democrat or Republican. He \nwanted to make sure the tyranny of the majority would never silence \nthose rights of the minority or the individual Senator.\n  With that context in mind, let me review the events of the last few \nweeks. With that context in mind, I am hoping that is instructive \nrelative to what happened here. As I said yesterday during my comments \non the floor, I guess we would all like to probably think we are the \nsmartest Senator who has ever served in the body. We are not. Some of \nthe giants of this great country have served in this body. Some of the \nintellectual giants who have ever lived in the United States found \ntheir way to the Senate.\n  They not only worried about what was happening in their period of \nhistory, they worried about what the Senate would be 10 and 20 and 100 \nand 150 years in the future. Keep in mind, this body has been here over \n200 years. In many respects, as Senator Byrd points out in his book, \nthe rules we operate under are similar. Why? Because they were smart in \nthe beginning and they are smart today. They have served us well for \nover 200 years.\n  As I said, I guess we probably all like to think we are about the \nsmartest Senator who has ever served. I can tell you, during the vote \nright before Thanksgiving, there were some Senators who were kind of \ncrowing about the change that had occurred. I even read some newspaper \narticles that, boy, their day had arrived.\n  So what happened? Let me tell you what did not happen. Under our \nrules that govern how we operate, how we pass laws, how we debate the \nimportant issues of the day, we can amend our rules with 67 votes, a \ntwo-thirds majority. It is right there in the rules. What a thoughtful \nprovision.\n  The whole idea behind that provision was you do not want the tyranny \nof the majority to crush the minority. You do not want the tyranny of \nthe majority to crush the rights of the individual Senator, whether he \nis from Nebraska or California or Florida or wherever.\n  So in those rules it takes 67 votes. Did that happen before \nThanksgiving? Did Members who wanted to see this done come over here to \nthis side and say: You know, Mike, think through this with me. Please \njoin with me in trying to get this done. I cannot get it done with 55 \nDemocrats. I need your help to get to 67. That is going to take \nDemocrats and it is going to take Republicans and it might even take an \nIndependent or two to get this rule change done.\n  Is that the way this happened? No, not the way it happened at all. So \nwhat did happen right before Thanksgiving? The majority leader, in \nessence when you cut through everything, asked for a ruling from the \nChair. The ruling by the Chair was consistent with the rules of the \nSenate. Then the majority leader said: I will appeal the ruling of the \nChair. What does it take to overrule the Chair? It takes a majority \nvote.\n  All of a sudden on executive appointments, circuit court judges \nacross the United States of America--a lifetime appointment, I remind \nyou, there is no way they can be removed except by the impeachment \nprocess once there--and Federal district court judges across the United \nStates of America, the rule was changed.\n  By a two-thirds vote as the rules would contemplate? No. By appealing \na correct ruling of the Chair and overruling it with a majority vote. \nLike I said, there are probably many here who would like to think: I \nthought that up. I must be pretty much the smartest person who ever \nserved in this body. I cannot imagine why somebody did not think that \none up before. Do not fool yourself.\n  That was thought up many times. Read the writings of Senator Byrd. \nRead the writings of any great intellectual who has looked at the \nSenate and how it operates and understands the rules. We have known for \ndecades and decades and decades, maybe since the beginning, that you \ncould appeal a ruling of the Chair and make reality out of a majority \nvote even though the Chair ruled correctly. That is what happened.\n  I spoke of the tyranny of the majority. The Senate was never intended \nto be a majority-based body. Let me get back to the Great Compromise. I \nmentioned that when Senator Byrd decided to put all of this information \ntogether in that four-volume set, it was to honor 200 years of history \nof the Senate or, stated another way, 200 years since the Great \nCompromise.\n  The Great Compromise came about because when we as an infant country \ndecided there were going to be two Houses in our legislative process, \nalmost immediately our Founders decided that one House, the House of \nRepresentatives, would be population based and majority ruled. If you \nare California or New York, as it turns out, that works pretty well; if \nyou are Nebraska or South Dakota, not so well. Why? We have three \nMembers in the House. It seems to me every day of the week California \nis going to outvote Nebraska. New York is going to outvote Nebraska. \nFlorida is going to outvote Nebraska. Darn near anybody in the country \nis going to outvote Nebraska.\n  Although we have this very large land mass, our population is 1.7 \nmillion to 1.8 million people. It is spread out across this very large \nland mass called the great State of Nebraska.\n  Our Founders looked at that and said: It does not take much to figure \nthis out. This is not going to work out very well over time. It is a \nmajority-based body. So political parties have been a feature almost \nfrom the beginning of our country. So if you are in the majority, you \nare always going to win. You are also going to beat the minority as \nlong as your team sticks together.\n  But they wisely said: The Senate is going to be different. The Senate \nis going to be that body where every State gets two. You see, in that \nregard, Nebraska is just as powerful as New York. We are just as \npowerful as Pennsylvania. We are just as powerful as California. We are \njust as powerful as Hawaii. Why? Because we each get two.\n  Then the Senate was structured in a way, as I have pointed out, where \nliterally from the beginning one could debate a bill right down to a \npathway where it was not going to get passed and thoughtfully and \ncarefully. But under the rules of the Senate what was happening is as \nwe decided to limit debate at some point in the process, you had to get \nthis supermajority\n  Senators knew they could appeal a correct ruling of the Chair and \nreverse it. But they knew that option should never be used. It did not \nget its name ``nuclear option'' by accident. Most recently when \nRepublicans were in control, the threat was made: We might go to the \nnuclear option to get our judges confirmed.\n  Oh, my goodness. Democrats in this body rose up. They were offended \nthat those words would even come out of a Senator's mouth. They were \nfighting tooth and nail to stop that because it so changes what happens \nin this body. Now what has happened? The worm did turn. They are in \npower. All of a sudden, well, I reserve the right to change my mind.\n  So just before Thanksgiving, a correct ruling of the Chair was \noverturned on a pure party-line vote, where Democrats said to each \nindividual Senator who is a Republican, where Democrats said to each \nindividual Member who sits in the minority if a Republican: Sit down \nand shut up.\n  That is what this rule change does. It relegates my voice as a Member \nof a minority party in the Senate on district judges, executive \nappointments, and circuit court judges--two of those being appointments \nfor life--it renders my voice absolutely, positively meaningless.\n  No Democrat has to cross that line and come over here and say: Mike, \nI want you to look at this judge in wherever--let's say Arkansas--\nbecause I think they are qualified and I want you to think about voting \nfor them. They do not have to do that anymore. They do not need me. \nThey can just outlast me, just like they are doing right now. They can \nbring this to a vote, and on a straight party-line vote they can \nappoint the entire judiciary of the United States in the district \ncourts and in the circuit courts with absolutely no involvement \nwhatsoever from the minority. None. That is what their rule change did.\n\n[[Page S8794]]\n\n  Let me take that rule change and think out loud about where we have \nput ourselves as a country. I wonder who was the first Senator in our \nhistory who came to the floor and said: My fellow Senators, I have \nthought about this, I have contemplated it, maybe I have even prayed \nabout it, and I believe the day has arrived to end slavery in the \nUnited States, and I will be attaching an amendment to every bill to \nend that horrific practice.\n  I will bet they were a very lonely Senator at that point in our \nhistory. But I am also guessing that Senator, and tenacious other \nSenators along the way, exercised their rights as a minority and as an \nindividual Senator to continue to force that issue. What a courageous, \nremarkable thing to do.\n  So let's think about where we are headed. We now have a precedent. As \nBob Byrd pointed out in his writings, precedents voted on by Senators \nhave significant binding effect in this body. It is not something you \ndo one time, tear up and throw away. It is something that becomes a \npart of the heart and soul of this body. It is something that is a \nmethod of operation, a rule, if you will, by which future decisions are \nmade within the Senate.\n  What is this precedent? This precedent is not that Democrats or \nRepublicans have to cross the aisle and get 67 votes together to change \nthe rules. This precedent now is that you can ask for a ruling of the \nChair, the Chair can correctly deliver a ruling, and you can then get \nyour team together, Republican or Democrat, and you can vitiate, \noverrule, and annihilate the correct ruling of the Chair to get a \ndifferent result.\n  So for the first time in our history we are now confirming judges in \nthe circuit court, in the district court, and executive appointments \nunder a majority rule--for the first time in history. Why? Was it \nbecause 67 Senators said: Look, let's do it this way. No. It is because \nthe majority leader asked for a ruling from the Chair, the Chair gave a \ncorrect ruling, and then the majority leader stepped in and said: I \nwill appeal that. He kept his Democrats together and successfully \nappealed it and, all of a sudden, we are off in a different direction.\n  So let's think about this. Let's say you are a Democratic President \nand the Senate is Democratic--maybe it is evenly divided, but you have \nthe Vice President in the Chair so you can break ties. You are in the \nlast 18 months of your time in office and you have already won a \nreelection so you are term limited. In 18 months you move on down the \nroad. Let's say you have a Supreme Court where four of the members are \nconservative, four are what would be regarded as liberal and you have \none member kind of right in the middle. So whenever there is a major \nargument before the Supreme Court everybody is trying to guess which \nway the one in the middle will go. Will he or she side with the \nliberals on this one? What has he or she done in the past? Will that \nSupreme Court Justice side with the conservatives? What has he or she \ndone in the past on these kind of issues? You can kind of get a roadmap \nof what they might do on this major constitutional issue.\n  Now, for whatever reason, that Supreme Court Justice dies in office, \nbecomes ill, can't perform the duties, decides to retire, decides: \nLook. I have been here a long time. It is time for me to move on. Maybe \nthey even have an inkling they want this President to appoint their \nreplacement. My goodness, this is a pretty important issue. You have \nthat one vote that kind of moves back and forth, and this is pretty \ndarned critical for the next 10, 25 or 50 years in the United States. \nIt could make all the difference in the world.\n  Let's say the President of the United States takes a look at that and \nsays: 18 months. I am not sure I can get this done. The President calls \nhis friend, the majority leader in the Senate, and says: My friend, how \ndo we move this Supreme Court nominee whom I am going to announce \ntomorrow before I leave the White House? We need to get this done. \nMaybe it is not even 18 months, maybe it is 12 months or 6 months. How \ndo we get this done?\n  The majority leader says: Mr. President, you know, under the current \nrules change we did in 2013, right before Thanksgiving, we took the \nvoice away from the minority. So on circuit court or district court I \ncould help you out, but we didn't apply that rule to the Supreme Court.\n  Maybe it is even further down the road and parties have switched. \nThere is a Republican in the White House and the Senate is Republican \nand the majority leader is Republican. The Republican President calls \nand says: How do I get this done?\n  My friends, let me remind us again the precedence is set. Let me \nremind us again, as Senator Byrd points out in his very scholarly \nanalysis of the Senate, that a Member-voted change appeal of a ruling \nof the Chair is a big dang deal. It is how we operate.\n  So the majority leader says: Let me think about it. He calls the \nPresident back and says: Here is how you get there. I will ask for a \nruling of the Chair at the appropriate time. I don't know exactly when \nthat will be. But at the appropriate time you have my commitment, Mr. \nPresident, just like they did right before Thanksgiving in 2013, I will \nask for a ruling of the Chair. The Chair is going to rule against me, I \nwant you to be aware of that. So if you are watching the proceedings, \ndon't faint because this isn't over. But I need to have you go to work, \nas President Obama did in 2013, and make sure Members are in line. I \nwill go to work and I will turn my whip team loose and we will keep our \nteam together.\n  Let's say it is a Republican situation and all of a sudden you have \nthe ruling and the majority leader says: I want to appeal that and the \nteam stays together and so now we can change the complexion of the U.S. \nSupreme Court because the precedent is set.\n  I had somebody from the Democratic side say to me yesterday: Well, \nMike, I would never agree to that. I thought about the comment he made. \nIn fact, I was trying to get to sleep last night and I thought about \nthat comment, and it was just so obvious to me I wish I had said it to \nmy friend and colleague. I wish I would have said: You won't have a \nvoice because you are in the minority. Under the precedent set right \nbefore Thanksgiving, your voice was silenced. You were told to sit down \nand shut up because of the passage of this rule.\n  So huff and puff all you want, go to the floor and scream, cry, yell, \nthreaten to do whatever you are going to do, but at the end of the day \nyou don't have a voice because my team is together on this, and by a \nmajority vote we are going to overrule a correct ruling of the Chair \nand we are going to pave the way for a new Supreme Court Justice who \nwill decide cases based upon our philosophy. You know what. We are \ngoing to go a step further. We think those four Republicans there or \nfour Democrats there, they haven't gone far enough. So we are going to \nget somebody who is really out there.\n  You know what. The precedent is set. You have the pathway to get it \ndone.\n  Is there anybody in this country who believes for a moment that \ntemptation will not be just too darned great? Look. How many times did \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle during the last debate on \nthis a few years ago say: Never do this. It will destroy the Senate. We \naren't going to do this. They signed letters, and those same people \nvoted yes to break the rules to change the rules. Those same people \ncame in and--of course, they had a reason. Of course--they came in and \nsaid: Well, you know, these evil Republicans. I really don't want to do \nthis. I feel so badly about doing it, but they are so darned bad, they \nare so evil, and they are such obstructionists, when there was no \nevidence to support that.\n  The reality is it is not what is happening these days, it is not what \nis happening over the next year on circuit court appointments or \ndistrict court appointments or who is going to be the Under Secretary \nor the Deputy of something in the USDA; it is what is going to happen \nnext when that President has that short a period of time to leave a \nlasting imprint on this great country and they can't pass up the \nopportunity. So all of a sudden the precedent is set and you are off to \nthe races.\n  Some may be thinking: Mike, if that ever happens, I am going to call \nmy Senator--who is in the minority, whether Republican or Democratic--\nand I am going to chew on them up one side and down the other side. I \nam going to point out to them that if they don't do something about \nthis, I will run against them or I will find somebody to run against \nthem because this\n\n[[Page S8795]]\n\ncan't happen to our country; because Supreme Court appointments, you \ncan't get rid of them once they are there, unless it is some kind of \nimpeachment process. This is a lifetime appointment. Once done, it is \nover.\n  Do you know what that minority Member will say to all those calls? \nThey will come in by the hundreds and thousands, if not the tens of \nthousands. Thank you for your call, but I have been silenced. I have no \nability to stop that. I am in the minority.\n  It will not be a situation where that Senator will be able to say: I \nam just not persuasive enough. I don't think I can build the argument.\n  It will be a situation where they say: I am in the minority. My voice \nhas been silenced. So we have a situation where the precedent is set, \nand that Member now has no voice.\n  Let's think about this in the last minutes that I have, because it \ndoesn't end here. Again, keep in mind the precedent is set.\n  Let's say again that there is a very important piece of legislation. \nMaybe it is a health care bill, maybe it is a climate change bill. \nMaybe it is a bill to do whatever. I could think of a whole bunch of \nbills on either side that people would like to see get done. All of a \nsudden, the majority, working with their President in the White House, \nrealizes the only way it is going to get done--because they can't get \nthe 60 votes necessary--is try to change how things operate.\n  Not to worry, because the precedent has been set: Ask for a ruling of \nthe Chair. The Chair will correctly rule. Keep your team together. \nOverrule the Chair and, by a majority vote, we now pass legislation by \na majority.\n  Many in the Chamber who are majority or minority would say: Well, \nMike. I don't like that. Gosh, I am not going to let that happen. I \nhave heard that before. Because the same people who voted for this \nargued forcefully just a few years ago: We can't ever let this happen. \nThis would destroy the Senate. This would destroy the purpose of the \nSenate.\n  But then they came in here and voted for it. Of course it will \nhappen. The precedent is set, and then you have a different country. \nLet's think about that.\n  I have traveled all over the world in my roles as Governor and as \nSecretary of Agriculture trying to sell our ag products. There were \ncertain parts of the world where markets were open and the economy was \nworking and people were employed. They were good markets for our \nproducts. There were other parts of the world where, my goodness, even \ntoday not much is going on. People live in poverty. They live in crime \nand filth and disease. It is just horrific. There are a lot of reasons \nfor that. It is complex.\n  But one of the constants in that was the political instability of the \ncountry. Whoever won got the spoils. So they would throw out everything \nthe last group passed and they would pass a whole bunch of new things \nbecause they had the majority. Then the voters would rebel and say: Oh, \nmy goodness. Did we make a mistake on this. Let's get rid of these \nfools. Then a whole new group would come in on the other side and they \nwould throw out all the laws the last group had passed and they would \npass their own laws. Why? Because they had the majority. On and on it \nwent.\n  Businesses would look at that and say: How do we ever invest there? \nYou are asking me to build a $25 million warehouse to do my work when I \ndon't know what the laws are going to be 2 or 4 years from now? Because \nthe elections would determine that.\n  In the United States of America we have had this remarkable economy \nfor over 200 years. It has had good times and bad. I am not \nPollyannaish about this. But jobs have been created, small \nentrepreneurs--and I could name them--built businesses that grew into \nremarkable companies. It is just incredible. Who are the next ones? \nWhat an amazing country we live in.\n  I will acknowledge, there are a lot of reasons for that. We are \nblessed with enormous resources, and I could go on and on. Our \neducation system. But one of the reasons it has worked is we have \ntremendous governmental stability. Whether we want to or not, every \nadministration is kind of in a position where they build upon the \nshoulders of the last administration.\n  What is the constant there? The White House can change every 4 years. \nIt has to change every 8. The House of Representatives can change every \n2 years, and it often does. Sometimes it doesn't. It is a majority-\nbased body. So a new group comes in, they throw things out; a new group \npasses new things. It is kind of always moving and shaking. That is \nwhat the House was intended to do. What has been the constant in all of \nthis? The Senate.\n  I know people get frustrated. They look over here and say: Geez, \nMike. I wish you could pass something. Why can't you get more done? Why \nis this pace so frustrating? I will tell you, as a former chief \nexecutive, a mayor, a Governor, a Cabinet member, I sometimes come in \nhere and go: My goodness. I am going to be 80 before this law ever \npasses, and I will not even recognize it.\n  It is the give-and-take of the Senate. It is exactly what was \ncontemplated, and no one was going to come in and throw this out in 2 \nyears and put this in and then 2 years later throw this out. Why? \nBecause the Senate said: Wait a second. Not only are we going to call \nthis the Great Compromise, but you are going to have to reach across \nthe aisle to get things done.\n  Sometimes in our history that hasn't happened. At other times in our \nhistory it has happened. But through pandemics, world wars, crises, \nattacks upon our Nation, this body found a way to function and a way to \nstabilize the United States.\n  So when a young entrepreneur went out there and said: If I build this \nsoftware, according to the tax laws we have now, will those laws be \nthere 2 years from now? Yes, we can say they will be. We don't change \nthe Tax Code very often. I am one of these people who argue we need \nreform in our Tax Code. But having said that, I know I am going to have \nto get it done in a bipartisan way.\n  But the precedent is set. We know now that if the majority leader \nasked for a ruling of the Chair and the Presiding Officer decides \ncorrectly, under the rules of the Senate, in consultation with the \nParliamentarian, how that issue should be decided and decides it \ncorrectly under the rules, we know now what we feared over the last \ndecades; that is, that the majority leader can say to the Presiding \nOfficer: I want to appeal your ruling. I want to appeal your ruling. I \nwant to get this Supreme Court Justice on the Supreme Court and a \nlifetime appointment.\n  I want to appeal your ruling because I am sick and tired of the other \nside not cooperating with me on what I want done. I have had enough of \nit. I am going to get my way. My team is together, and they are all \ngoing to vote just as I will. Even though your ruling was correct under \nour rules, we are going to set that aside, we are going to vitiate it, \nand we are going to get our way because my team--my team--is in \ncontrol.\n  That is where we are today.\n  These rules have been changed over time. They were changed in \naccordance with our rules.\n  I see the leader is here. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that if cloture is \ninvoked on the Patterson nomination, that at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, \nDecember 16, all postcloture time be considered expired and the Senate \nthen proceed to vote on confirmation of the Patterson nomination; that \nupon disposition of the Patterson nomination, the Senate proceed to \nvote on the motion to invoke cloture on the Johnson nomination; that if \ncloture is invoked on the Johnson nomination, then all postcloture time \nbe yielded back and the Senate proceed to vote on confirmation of the \nJohnson nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                Program\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we are going to have two votes at noon \ntoday. After that, the next vote will be at 5:30 on Monday. There will \nbe a series of votes on Monday.\n  As I indicated this morning, the Republican leader and I have spent \nsome time together and I think we have had a productive discussion on \nthe schedule. This schedule has been extremely difficult for everyone.\n\n[[Page S8796]]\n\n  We have worked out a schedule that allows for the next set of votes \nwhich will occur at noon today to be the last votes of this week. We \nagreed on Monday evening the Senate will vote on the matters that we \nwould have voted on the rest of today and this weekend.\n  So on Monday at 5:30 in the afternoon, the Senate will vote on \nPatterson, Johnson, one would be on the cloture on Johnson, and then it \nwill be confirmation. We are doing our utmost to finish our business \nhere a week from today so we can go home for Christmas.\n  So we will be in session Sunday afternoon. There will be no votes on \nSunday. The next rollcall, I repeat for the third time, will be 5:30 \np.m. Monday. On Tuesday, we will begin consideration of the budget and \nWednesday the Defense bill. After that, we will address further \nnominations of which the most important one is Janet Yellen to be on \nthe Federal Reserve. The others, I will work with Senator McConnell \nfiling a number and see how many we can get done.\n  I personally thank Senators for their cooperation this week and next \nweek as we work through these important matters. I know there is a lot \nof work we have to do to get back to regular order. We will see what \nhappens with the Defense bill we are going to vote on and the budget \nbill. But I am satisfied we have made progress.\n\n\n                  Orders for Monday, December 15, 2013\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate completes it business today, it adjourn until 1 p.m. on Sunday, \nDecember 15, 2013; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning \nhour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, \nand the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the \nday; and the Senate convene for legislative business only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I want to make sure everyone understands that we have votes \ntoday.\n  The distinguished Senator from Nebraska was speaking and I \ninterrupted him. I relinquish the floor. If he has more to say, he may \ncertainly do so. I have no right to suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, the Senate has had an opportunity to be \ngiven an update on the status of our negotiation on the farm bill. It \nis my pleasure to announce that since our first conference committee \nmeeting in October, we have been working to reach an agreement on a new \n5-year farm bill. This is a bill we can take to the House and Senate. \nBy working in collaboration and through our differences, we made \nprogress and established a framework for our agricultural sector to \ncontinue to contribute in an important way to the economic life of our \nNation. I am pleased to say we are making progress, but there are still \nsome decisions that lie ahead of us. I am hopeful that on both sides of \nthe aisle, in both bodies, we can come together on a farm bill \nagreement that will reform and modernize programs and produce budget \nsavings at the same time as well as provide certainty about the \ngovernment's role to producers and consumers alike.\n  I might also add that related to this is an interest many homeowners \nhave in flood control insurance protection and government assistance. \nThere is a reform bill, the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability \nAct, that I am pleased to have cosponsored that would delay premium \nrates temporarily until we can review and make sure these changes are \ngoing to serve the interests of homeowners and landowners in areas that \nare threatened by natural disasters. We don't want to a Federal \nGovernment Agency to draw a line on a map arbitrarily without fully \nconsidering all of the ramifications.\n  We must put the Flood Insurance Program on a path to fiscal solvency, \nand one way to do that is to ensure that it is a good deal in terms of \ninvestment and prospective return on investment for individuals as well \nas communities.\n  On another subject, I recently had an opportunity to review some \ncorrespondence and notes about calls my office received from \nconstituents on the subject of the Patient Protection and Affordability \nCare Act. This is a major piece of health care legislation, as \neverybody knows. It affects insurance companies, it affects \nindividuals, it affects the entire country, and it is a very important \narea of concern.\n\n  In order to comply with the law's requirements, a family could see \ntheir monthly premiums increase from $700 to almost $1,400, which is an \nincrease of more than 90 percent. To put it in perspective, it is more \nthan $16,000 per year that a family would have to spend on health \ninsurance premiums alone. These figures are just not affordable for \nmost Americans. So there is sticker shock associated with this \nmisguided effort to help improve and expand our Nation's health \ninsurance programs. These figures just signal to us how serious the \nimplications are, and we must address this problem and seek proposals \nwith very serious care and diligence.\n  Monthly premiums, for example, do not include copayments or out-of-\npocket expenses. It does include the cost of several health benefits \ndeemed ``essential'' by the administration, regardless of the fact that \nmany people do not need or want to pay for these services. One \nconstituent posed an interesting question to me, which is, Why can't \nwe, the policy owners, decide what benefits and deductibles we want? I \nthink they are right. They ought to have that right, and they ought to \nbe given that choice.\n  Choice is what families should have when it comes to health \ninsurance. Unfortunately, the freedom to make a decision based on what \nis in their best interests is no longer an option for millions of \nAmericans who have to search for new insurance coverage, pay for \nbenefits they will not use, and potentially even give up the doctors \nthey know and wish to keep.\n  Despite assurances by the President that people who like their health \ninsurance will be able to keep it, we have learned that the \nadministration has known for at least 3 years that millions of \nAmericans would lose the health insurance they currently have and would \nlike to keep, as advertised.\n  Reports indicate there are an estimated 15 million people facing a \npotential coverage gap because many currently have insurance from the \nindividual market but have received cancellation notices because their \npolicies don't meet the law's requirements.\n  Since the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was enacted--\nincidentally, without a single Republican vote--in 2010 the \nadministration has struggled to meet its own deadlines for \nimplementation of the law. The ongoing problems with the law's \nenrollment Web site conspicuously foreshadowed the more significant \nfailures that can be expected as this law is implemented.\n  The most recent marketplace enrollment report, which was released by \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, states that less than 365,000 \nindividuals have selected plans from the State and Federal marketplaces \nsince October 1. It has been estimated that more than 47 million \nnonelderly Americans were uninsured in 2012. This means that less than \n1 percent of the uninsured population in the U.S. has selected a health \ninsurance plan by way of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct.\n  We are told that it is likely that on January 1 of this next year, \nmore Americans will be uninsured than were uninsured at the time the \nhealth care law was enacted. This law's primary intent was to expand \ncoverage, to encourage insurance, but it seems to be failing on both \ncounts.\n  Implementation of the law's mandates reveals that the legislation \nwill fail to reduce health care costs as well. In 2013, we are \nprojected to spend $2.9 trillion on health care in the United States. \nThis is approximately 18 percent of the entire U.S. economy. National \nhealth care expenditures are expected to increase substantially in the \nyears beyond that.\n  Health insurance is just one component of our Nation's very complex \nhealth care system, and we could do better, should do better, and I \nthink we can do better than this initial work product. We should get \ntogether and find common ground to improve the quality of health care \nin our country, to improve access, and reduce overall health care \ncosts. We owe that to our constituents, our national economic \ninterests, and to the future of quality health care in the United \nStates.\n  Madam President, I invite other Senators to come to discuss this or \nother\n\n[[Page S8797]]\n\nissues we have identified as important for our consideration. In the \nmeantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Discussions in Vienna\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Hawaii for the \nway she has dealt with us since she has been here.\n  I rise today to talk about discussions that have been taking place in \nVienna over the last four days relative to the Iran P5+1 discussions. I \nknow each of us in this body focuses on different topics based on the \ncommittee assignments we have. I wish to point out that reports have \ncome out today and last night that the technical experts who have been \nmeeting around the deal that has been announced still are having \ndifficulties trying to understand how to implement this deal that was \nwritten down on four pages.\n  I say this to talk about the fact that there are many in this body on \nboth sides of the aisle who would like to weigh in on this issue. I \nrealize the administration has expressed concerns as to what type of \nweighing in they think might be harmful to the discussions. I think \nthere are many of us who understand those things and have tried to \nfigure out a way to weigh in in an appropriate way.\n  (Mr. KAINE assumed the Chair.)\n  To bring people's memories back into focus, one of the concerns we \nhave all had leading up to the announcement of this deal has been the \namount of time, if you will, that remains before Iran reaches a status \nof being a nuclear armed state. So it was very important, I think to \nall of us, as we heard the announcement of this interim deal, that we \nactually understand the timeframes that were involved.\n  I know many people were alarmed--were alarmed--by this interim \nagreement because, in fact, there was a tacit understanding that Iran--\nwhich has been a rogue nation--no doubt, if this agreement continues to \ngo through, is going to be a state that will be allowed to enrich \nuranium, much in the face of the 123 Agreements that we negotiate \naround the world, trying to establish a gold standard with countries to \nkeep them from doing that.\n  This agreement--let's face it, I think that Wendy Sherman, yesterday, \nin testimony to the Banking Committee, and, I can assure you, every \nsingle Iranian official who has been involved in these negotiations, \nunderstand that what the United States of America, with other \ncountries, has agreed to is to allow Iran to be able to enrich uranium \nat some level when a final deal is actually done.\n  I think one of the concerns that many of us have right now is that \nthis interim deal either becomes the norm or--as the previous nuclear \nczar to the Obama administration, Gary Samore, has said--that we really \njust begin a series of rolling agreements and we never get to the place \nof establishing an end-state.\n  I hate to say this, but yesterday Wendy Sherman--I think many of us \nhave certainly conducted discussions with the White House and have been \nin classified briefings, and one of the things we have really wanted to \nput in place--and I think Carl Levin in a meeting at the White House \nspoke most clearly to this--and that is, in order to alleviate that \nkind of thing occurring, we need to have a firm beginning date and a \nfirm end date. He said that end date should be 6 months, which is, by \nthe way, what the agreed announcement said.\n  I think what is dismaying to many people in this body is we are now \nfinding out that not only is there not an end date, but addendums that \ncan be mutually agreed to. In other words, there is no end date to this \nagreement.\n  We are now finding out, based on testimony yesterday from Wendy \nSherman, we do not even know when the start date is, that officials \ncannot even agree as to when the beginning of this agreement is going \nto be and when the implementation begins.\n  It is pretty amazing to me that we could spend months negotiating \nover an issue that is so important to us and so important to the world \nand yet, after it is concluded, we do not even really know when the \nagreement begins, and we certainly--because of the text of the \nagreement--know that it does not have an end date.\n  I have tried to listen to the concerns that the administration has. I \nthink I have demonstrated since I have been here that I really want to \nseek understanding, No. 1, but also try to use that understanding to \nsolve problems.\n  So our office has worked hard to develop an amendment. It is an \namendment that establishes a firm end date. But it also describes the \nend-state. That is what this amendment does.\n  I think people on both sides of the aisle--I do not think it; I know \nit because of public expressions--have been very concerned that this \ninterim agreement already violates the U.N. Security Council \nresolutions that this administration agreed to back in 2010, as did the \nother members of the Security Council. Many people are concerned that \nif we start with an agreement that, no doubt, expressly violates the \nU.N. Security Council resolution, and it does not have even a clear \nstart date or end date, there are a lot of concerns, as you can \nimagine, that we will never get to that place that countries have \nagreed to back in 2010 as it relates to where Iran's end-state should \nbe.\n  Another concern that people have is, as we begin lifting these \nsanctions--and let's face it, Congress, the administration, and the \ninternational community actually have done a very good job together \ntrying to figure out a way of appropriately implementing sanctions that \nhave put pressure on Iran and have brought them to the place where they \nnow are.\n  But I think the concerns--and as a matter of fact Senator Jack Reed, \nyesterday, expressed these concerns in a Banking hearing--once you \nbegin to basically say that Iran is not a rogue nation, that they are \nbeing brought hopefully into the international community, once you \nbegin lifting even a minor portion of those sanctions, countries and \ncompanies around the world are going to clamor to do business because \nthey see that in the very near future additional sanctions are going to \nbe lifted. Just by virtue of that occurring, the sanctions begin to \ndissipate at a rapid pace. This is something, again, that has been \nexpressed in a bipartisan way.\n  So I have an amendment. I am the ranking member on the Foreign \nRelations Committee, which means nothing other than I spend a lot of \ntime on these issues and working with colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to find solutions. As a matter of fact, we have not passed \nanything out of our committee yet that has not been bipartisan.\n  We have coming over, I understand, an NDAA bill that has typically \nbeen the vehicle on which we all express ourselves on these kinds of \nissues. It is my understanding that the majority leader has decided \nhimself--I will say, much to the consternation of my friends on the \nother side of the aisle, but certainly to the consternation of people \non my side of the aisle--that he is not going to allow any amendments, \nthat he himself has decided what is best for this body.\n  So after spending months and months, and just coming from the region \nrecently, working with the Presiding Officer and others on so many \ndiplomatic and foreign policy issues together in a bipartisan way, I am \nnow serving in a body that has the vehicle that typically is used to \nexpress ourselves on foreign policy issues and I do not have the right \nto raise an amendment to it. The body, by the way, may decide they do \nnot support it. That is what happens around here. You debate issues and \nyou decide whether you want to support them. By the way, the amendment \nI am offering does not add sanctions. All it does is define when the \nend is going to be, which, by the way, every world leader has stated is \nvery, very important because of what is occurring on the ground in \nIran, and it establishes a minimum end-state, which is what the U.N. \nSecurity Council resolution already says.\n  I am one Senator, I realize, and there are 99 others, and I am sure \nthere are many people in this body who would like to express themselves \non issues that are not deemed to be partisan or deemed to be political, \nbut just to express themselves on policy they believe\n\n[[Page S8798]]\n\nto be important to the country. But the majority leader, on his own, \nhas decided that is not going to be the case.\n  Yesterday I was riding the elevator with a Senator who I came in \nwith. I came in with nine Democrats and one Republican. I was the only \nRepublican, excuse me. I did not come in with any other Republicans. I \nwas it. We have had a lot of fun, and we get together once a year and \ntalk about that. Candidly, relations between us, generally speaking, \nhave been very good for the 7 years I have been here.\n  This one Senator, who I have actually worked with more than others of \nthe group on so many issues, said to me that what happened on the \nSenate floor a few weeks ago, where the majority overruled their own \nParliamentarian--their own Parliamentarian--overruled with a simple \nmajority vote, which means there are no rules in the Senate anymore--\nthis person said to me: Look, Bob, it was not personal.\n  What is amazing to me is that the way this Senate is run is not \npersonal to my friends on the other side of the aisle, the fact that, \nlike lemmings, in so many cases, they would just follow, follow the \nmajority leader, and let him decide what this body is going to vote on, \nand let him decide what policies this Senate is going to put in place. \nI do not understand that.\n  We have all worked hard to be here, and we all work hard to represent \nour constituents. I think we all work hard not to disrespect ourselves, \nnot to disrespect the office we hold, not to disrespect--I will not say \nwe have all worked hard not to disrespect this institution because I \nbelieve what happened greatly disrespected this institution--and \ncertainly, hopefully, we work hard not to disrespect the citizens with \nwhom we serve.\n  But what I find myself in total dismay over is that my friends on the \nother side of the aisle do not deem it personal that on the one vehicle \nthat we typically express ourselves most on foreign policy issues--and \nat a time when we have so many foreign policy issues that in a \nbipartisan way people have concerns about--that they would decide to \njust let the majority leader decide what we are going to vote on, when \nwe are going to vote on it, and if it is even appropriate to have a \nvote at all.\n  So here we are. We have witnessed the many problems that have \ndismayed both sides of the aisle relative to the rollout of the health \ncare bill. I think everybody in this body would recognize I have not \nbeen down here taking cheap shots at that. Look, I am concerned about \nthe citizens of our State and what they are dealing with relative to \nthis policy, and hearing the distress calls of people who have had \ntheir insurance canceled and maybe have had a quadruple bypass and are \nconcerned about getting on, and I know all of us are involved in trying \nto help those citizens who are in dismay and are very concerned they be \nsuccessful in actually being able to get on the exchanges.\n  But here right now, seriously, we are watching a major foreign policy \nissue be rolled out by this administration with many of the same \nproblems. We do not have a start date. We do not have an end date. We \nhave not even broached the toughest issues with Iran over what the end-\nstate is going to be.\n  I think that is a tremendous disservice to our Nation. It is a \ntremendous disservice to the countries with which we work all around \nthe world. It is a tremendous disservice for this body not to express \nits will.\n  I know that the chairman of the committee had acted as if he wanted \nto participate in this somehow, making sure that Congress was heard on \nthis in a way that does not blow up the negotiations. I think everyone \nhere wants to see a diplomatic solution--everyone here. I do not know \nof anybody in this body that does not want to see that happen.\n  But I also know, and I think the administration knows this as well, \nthat the actions of this body, candidly, over the years are the main \nreasons that we are where we are. But, again, I will close; I know I am \ngetting redundant. Our majority leader in his wisdom--and I know the \nmajority leader decides who serves on committees. He decides who the \nchairman is of those committees. I realize that with that you have a \ngreat ability to keep people from expressing their will or rising and \nreally wanting to do something in a bipartisan way.\n  I am coming to understand, especially in recent weeks, what \nbipartisan means to our majority leader is whatever he decides is \n``bipartisan.'' Even though the majority of the people in this body \nwould really like to weigh in on this policy, to do so in an \nappropriate way so that we do not, in fact, do something that does \nsomething to harm the negotiation, but does something to strengthen our \nhand in these negotiations.\n  That will not occur. To me, that is a disservice to this body. It is \na disservice to this Nation. It is a disservice to every Member. No \ndoubt, when each of us do not have the opportunity to express ourselves \nthrough amendments, what that really means is the folks we represent \nback home have no rights to have their concerns expressed or voted on.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/11/senate-section/article/S8798-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8798-S8799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n                                 prayer\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PATTERSON TO BE AN ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Anne W. \nPatterson, of Virginia, a Career Member of the Senior Foreign Service, \nClass of Career Ambassador, to be an Assistant Secretary of State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to the provisions of S. Res. 15 of \nthe 113th Congress, there will now be up to 8 hours of postcloture \nconsideration of the nomination equally divided in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                              Gun Violence\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it seems hard to believe that tomorrow will \nbe the anniversary of the deaths of 20 little boys and girls in \nNewtown, CT. Not only those little boys and girls, but six educators, \nwhose lives were taken by an unspeakable tragedy at Sandy Hook \nElementary School.\n  Their names are Allison, Avielle, Charlotte, Daniel, Olivia, \nJosephine, Ana, Dylan, Madeleine, Catherine, Chase, Jesse, James, \nGrace, Noah, Jack, Emilie, Caroline, Jessica, and Benjamin.\n  These little boys and girls were 6 and 7 years old. They were \nmurdered. Although their years were few, their lives have touched and \nwill continue to touch us all.\n  As it did a year ago, my heart goes out to the families of these \nlittle angels, and to all those affected by this tragedy. I honor the \nultimate sacrifice of Victoria Soto, Dawn Hochsprung, Mary Sherlach, \nLauren Rousseau, Rachel Davino, and Anne Marie Murphy--teachers and \neducators who died trying to safeguard the children in their care.\n  These six educators devoted their lives to teaching Newtown's \nchildren how to read and write, how to add and subtract, how to be good \nboys and girls, and how to grow into good men and women. They gave \ntheir lives to keep those children safe. They are a source of hope in a \nworld that sometimes seems hopeless.\n  It is hard to comprehend the type of tragedy that occurred at Sandy \nHook, let alone to recover from it. But I am inspired by the families \nin this community who have found purpose in the face of despair.\n  There is a Tibetan saying that says, ``Tragedy should be utilized as \na source of strength.''\n  The Dalai Lama says that whatever trouble you have experienced, and \nhowever deep your heartbreak, ``If we lose our hope, that's our real \ndisaster.''\n  The families of Newtown have channeled their pain into activism, \nraising awareness about gun violence and mental health issues in this \ncountry.\n  I have met with them on a number of occasions, and their bravery in \nthe face of such pain is truly an inspiration not only to me but to all \nof us.\n  I am proud of how hard my caucus fought this year to pass safeguards \nthat would keep guns out of the hands of felons and people with severe \nmental illness. That is why 85 percent of the American people agree \nwith us. Why should someone who has a severe mental illness or someone \nwho is a criminal be able to purchase a gun? They shouldn't. Those who \nare trying to stop that legislation from going forward should be \nembarrassed and ashamed of themselves.\n  I personally am happy with my vote to keep military-style weapons off \nthe streets and to improve our mental safety. But at a time when more \nthan 30,000 Americans are killed by guns each year, it is shameful that \nthe Senate can't pass gun safety legislation that would protect our \nmost vulnerable citizens--our kids, our children, our babies.\n  So I told the families of the 26 innocents killed a year ago in \nNewton, and the 173 children killed by guns since December 14, 2012, \nthat Senate Democrats will not give up on them, and that is still the \nfact. We will not give up on the victims of 26 school shootings that \noccurred since the Newtown massacre, including one in Sparks, NV, where \na young man came with a gun. Who stepped forward to save the children? \nA teacher. He was killed. Two\n\n[[Page S8800]]\n\nothers were injured in that assault. I will not give up on the families \nand friends of those gunned down at a movie theater in Colorado, a Sikh \ntemple in Wisconsin, a shopping mall in Oregon, and every day on the \nstreets of America's cities.\n  Last December I promised the families a meaningful conversation about \nhow to change America's culture of violence. I want everyone within the \nsound of my voice to know that the conversation is not over.\n  The American people will prevail on this issue. When 85 percent of \nthe American people believe in an issue--when 85 percent of the \nAmerican people believe in not only an issue but in a quest, in \nfairness, it is going to happen. It is only a question of when it \nhappens.\n  I urge the families and friends of those killed in Newtown to never \nlose hope. Never lose hope.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, John Adams, America's first Vice \nPresident--and second President--and whose bust sits right above us \nlooking over the Senate every day, once said:\n\n       Facts are stubborn things. And whatever may be our wishes, \n     our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they \n     cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.\n\n  It has been more than 3 years since President Obama signed the \nAffordable Care Act into law. In that time, its opponents have made \nevery effort to misinform the American public about this law and the \nvital benefits it provides the American people.\n  But as Adams said, facts are stubborn things, and I want to make sure \nthe facts about the Affordable Care Act do not get lost amongst the \ncriticism and false claims.\n  So here are the facts.\n  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, 100 million people have received \nfree preventive care, more than 7 million seniors have saved nearly $9 \nbillion on prescription drugs, and 25 million people who lacked health \ninsurance will finally be able to get the coverage they need.\n  The Affordable Care Act has also helped slow the growth in health \ncare costs. National health care spending grew by 3.9 percent each year \nfrom 2009 to 2011--the slowest rate on record.\n  I can remember not too many years earlier the annual rate increase in \nhealth care costs was in the neighborhood of 6, 7, 8, 9 percent a year. \nIt is a dramatic reduction.\n  That means we will save huge sums of money down the line. For \nexample, the CMS projection of national health care expenditures in \n2019 has dropped by $574 billion in 3 years. That is $574 billion in \nreduced projection of national health care costs in the year 2019.\n  While there is more than just the Affordable Care Act at work in \nthose savings, it certainly has played a part.\n  The health insurance marketplaces are open for business, and every \nday we hear how the Web site healthcare.gov is working better. It is \npicking up steam. It is handling more and more consumers.\n  The New York Times reported on Tuesday that--and I am quoting--``the \nnumber of applicants who dropped a plan into their virtual grocery \ncarts was climbing at a rapid clip.''\n  Those are the facts. The Affordable Care Act is helping millions of \npeople. It is improving millions of lives.\n  But frankly, I think the American people are a bit tired of hearing \npoliticians argue over the law. I am sure every one of my colleagues \nhas spoken at length about it here on the Senate floor or back home. I \nknow I have.\n  I think it is time to change the conversation. I think it is time to \nhear from the American people--hear from them--about how they think the \nlaw is helping them. I think it is time to hear what the New York Times \ncalled the ``voices of quiet optimism and relief amid the uproar over \nthe health law.''\n  Take these two stories.\n  Claire He is a college student whose parents have never been able to \nafford insurance. She and her brother lived most of their lives without \ncoverage. She told the New York Times that if they got the flu ``we \njust stayed home and waited it out.''\n  But when Claire and her family sat down to look at their options \nunder the Affordable Care Act, here is what they found: They found a \nhigh-quality plan that will cost them only $30 a month.\n  Claire said of the ACA's critics: ``I see so much negativity behind \nthis. . . . But in reality there's a lot of families who are like \nmine.''\n  Then there is the story of Bruce Kleinschmidt, a lawyer who lives in \nLouisville, KY. Bruce had insurance through his employer until he \nstopped working full time.\n  Bruce is 61--not yet eligible for Medicare. In another era, his \nhealth problems would have made it impossible for him to find \ninsurance. But using Kentucky's new health marketplace, Bruce found a \ngenerous plan that saves him $300 a month in premiums. Bruce called it \na ``godsend.''\n  There are hundreds of similar stories in newspapers all across the \nNation--the San Jose Mercury News, the Las Vegas Sun, the Hartford \nCourant, the Palm Beach Post, the LA Times, and many more.\n  Not only do we read these kinds of personal stories in newspapers, we \nreceive letters with them every day. Here are a few examples from \nletters I have received from Montanans.\n  John wrote to my office with his family's story. What did he say? \nJohn's daughter recently beat cancer. She is under age 26, so thanks to \nthe Affordable Care Act she is still covered under her parents' \ninsurance.\n  And there is more. When she does turn 26, she will have a guaranteed \nright to coverage. No insurance company can turn her away because she \nhad cancer. John said they are counting on the Affordable Care Act to \nhelp them find an affordable plan.\n  Marge wrote to say that the Affordable Care Act has been an enormous \nrelief for her. She has battled emphysema for years--despite the fact \nthat she is not a smoker. A doctor once told her she could never leave \nher job because no one else would ever insure her.\n  So for Marge, the Affordable Care Act means she can breathe again--\nthat she does not have to live in fear of losing her insurance or \nfalling into bankruptcy because of her medical costs.\n  We all know--because many, many told us before the act--how many \npeople went into bankruptcy because one of the leading causes of \nbankruptcy was health care costs.\n  Jillian wrote to say how excited she was to be able to shop for \ncoverage in the marketplace.\n  Jillian is married, and she and her husband are expecting a child. \nBut her husband's employer-sponsored plan does not pay for her \ncoverage.\n  Here is what she wrote: ``I am looking to make a more affordable \nchoice for me and my baby-to-be. . . . ''\n  Letters like these come in every day. They tell the stories of how \nthe Affordable Care Act is working for them, it is helping them, and in \nthe end that is what matters--not the punditry, not the polls, not the \npolitical points. What matters is that the law is improving the lives \nof millions of Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Senate Rules\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have been engaged in the back-and-forth \nfor many years concerning the rights of the minority to oppose \nlegislation or nominations for Senate advice and consent, which, \nobviously, as we all know, is part of the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  After investing all of those hundreds of hours in compromises, both \nwhen Republican leadership wanted to act to curtail the rights of the \nminority and when Democrats were doing it--I fought hard. A short time \nago Senator Levin and Senator Schumer and others changed the rules to \ntry to expedite the consideration of legislation for a whole lot of \nreasons, including the fact\n\n[[Page S8801]]\n\nthat a majority of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nnever been here in the minority.\n  We have now acted in a draconian fashion and, in my view, have \nfundamentally, historically damaged this institution. Among other \nthings, for the first time since the Senate has been a body, we have \nnow changed the rules to 51 votes rather than 67. First time in \nhistory. Unfortunately, the repercussions will be that we are moving a \nstep--a very significant step--toward a majority-rule body.\n  As my friend from Michigan Senator Carl Levin quoted Senator \nVandenberg, a former Senator from Michigan and a highly regarded \nindividual in this institution, we have now broken the rules to change \nthe rules. On the night we changed the rules, I read a letter from \nSenator Robert Byrd--who was one of the most outstanding leaders and \nclearly the expert on the Constitution and this institution--cautioning \nagainst it.\n  The reason I come to the floor today is not so much to revisit that \nbecause it is done. I wish to point out that I see the first \nmanifestation now of the majority-rule vote. I have been a member of \nthe Homeland Security Committee, and I have been involved in these \nissues for many years. I was also involved in the so-called Gang of 8, \nwhere we came up with a comprehensive immigration reform bill which was \npassed through this body. We still hope that the other body will \naddress, at least in some way, the issue of comprehensive immigration \nreform.\n  I come from a border State, as my colleagues know. Our border is not \nsecure. In fact, the majority of drugs that still come across our \nsouthern border come across the Arizona-Sonora border in Mexico. My \nconstituents, many who live in the southern part of the State of \nArizona, have home invasions, people crossing their property. In one \ncase a rancher was shot and killed, and a Border Patrol agent was \nkilled. In fact, the reality is that they don't have the same security \nin the southern part of my State as the rest of our citizens do in \nother parts of the country.\n  Border security was a fundamental and vitally important issue in the \nhundreds of hours of debate and discussions that I and my seven \ncolleagues engaged in as we shaped the comprehensive immigration reform \nlegislation, which was largely passed intact in the Senate.\n  I went back to my constituents and I said there is a very vital and \nimportant provision in this bill; that is, when this legislation is \npassed, we will embark on the goal of achieving 90 percent \neffectiveness at our border. We can never get complete control of our \nborder--we all recognize that--but 90 percent effective control through \nsurveillance, through hiring new people, through capabilities that we \nhave--we can achieve 90 percent effective control.\n  Then comes the nomination hearing of Mr. Jeh Johnson for Secretary of \nDepartment of Homeland Security. I asked Mr. Johnson a simple, \nstraightforward question. The question was: Mr. Johnson, when you are \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security, will you provide this \ncommittee and me, Senator McCain, with a description of the measures \nthat need to be taken in order for us to achieve what we have turned \ninto legislation--at least in the Senate--90 percent effective control \nof our southern border?\n  His answer was no.\n  His answer, believe it or not, was no, that he could not provide that \ninformation. In fact, I was so astonished that I wrote him a letter and \nreceived a response, which I will read:\n\n       November 19, 2013.\n       Dear Senator McCain,\n       I regret that in my current posture as a nominee and \n     private citizen, I am not now in a position to commit to \n     provide the information you seek from the Department of \n     Homeland Security.\n       At this point, I must respectfully refer you to the \n     Department's current leadership. I know this was a matter of \n     discussion between you and Secretary Napolitano, and I \n     understand your frustration. As I believe I have demonstrated \n     to you and others on the Senate and House Armed Services \n     Committee--\n\n  Why he said Senate Armed Services Committee, I am not sure.\n\n     --I have a strong respect for Congress' oversight role. If I \n     am confirmed, and if your request is still outstanding at \n     that point, I promise that addressing your letter will be a \n     top and immediate priority for me.\n\n  This is the November 19, 2013, letter from Mr. Jeh Charles Johnson.\n  In other words, the nominee for the Department of Homeland Security, \nwho has direct responsibility for securing our borders, direct \nresponsibility as outlined in legislation passed by this body, the \ncomprehensive immigration reform bill, refuses to give me and this body \nthe information. I hope there are other Senators who might be \ninterested in what is necessary to achieve 90 percent effective control \nof our borders. He refuses to give me that information.\n  Thanks to the good offices of my beloved friend Carl Levin and my \ndear friend Senator Carper, I just came from a meeting in my office \nwith Mr. Jeh Johnson. Mr. Jeh Johnson again repeated to me that he \ncould not give me the information of what is necessary, what tools are \nnecessary to ensure 90 percent effective control of our border.\n  Allegedly, he is being prevented from doing that by the White House. \nIt is stunning. Why would the White House prevent the nominee for \nSecretary of Homeland Security from providing this to Members of the \nSenate and members of the committee that has oversight of homeland \nsecurity, which is fundamental information if we are going to achieve \neffective control of our border?\n  I go home to Arizona and I say: Yes, it is in the law, my friends. It \nis in the law that we are going to have to get 90 percent effective \ncontrol of our border, but I don't know how we do it because the agency \nthat will be required to do it will not give me the necessary \ninformation to do it.\n  My friends, we will voting on Monday to confirm Mr. Johnson. He will \nbe confirmed. There is no doubt about it now that we have majority \nvote. We have now deprived Republicans of their advice and consent \nresponsibilities and authority. We have not only changed the rules of \nthe Senate, we have abridged the Constitution of the United States \nbecause the only way that I could have received this information from \nMr. Johnson was if I had said: I can't approve of your nomination until \nyou provide the information which, by any objective observer, I am \nentitled to--not only entitled to; it is my responsibility to know \nthat. It is my responsibility. That is why we have a committee. That is \nwhy we have a committee, the homeland security committee, that has \noversight of the functions of the executive branch. That is how equal \nbranches of government are supposed to function.\n  Mr. Johnson will be confirmed, and the message will go out, believe \nme: You don't have to answer a question by a Republican Senator. You \ndon't have to respond to a straightforward question.\n  There was nothing devious about the question I asked Mr. Johnson. \nThere was nothing complicated. They certainly should have the \ninformation of what steps and measures are necessary to ensure 90 \npercent effective control of our border--which is a requirement in the \nlaw, if it is ever passed. Certainly the requirement was passed by the \nSenate.\n  It is kind of a sad day. It was a sad day for me when we changed the \nrules. It was a sad day for me to see people who have been here a very \nshort period of time basically shatter the comity which exists and \nwhich is vital to doing business in the Senate.\n  I also would point out to my colleagues--particularly those who are \nnew and who drove this change in the Senate rules--what goes around \ncomes around and what goes around will come around. To their deep \nregret, some day--I say to the President and I say to my colleagues who \nvoted for it on a party-line vote, for the first time in history \nchanging the rules of the Senate from 67 votes to 51 votes--they will \nregret it.\n  The people who will suffer greatly from this are the American people \nbecause this place is largely dysfunctional anyway. If we think it was \ndysfunctional before, wait and see. I say that with deep regret because \nI value and treasure my relationships with my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle. Some of the best friends I have are on the other \nside of the aisle. But to expect to do business as usual when I can't \neven get a straight answer for a question that--now by not having the \nanswer inhibits and in many ways prohibits my ability to respond and \ncarry\n\n[[Page S8802]]\n\nout my responsibilities to the citizens of my State--cannot go without \nbeing responded to.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. I now yield back all time on the Patterson nomination.\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I was unable to attend the rollcall vote \non the nomination of Heather Anne Higginbottom to be Deputy Secretary \nof State for Management and Resources and the rollcall vote on the \nmotion to invoke cloture on the nomination of Anne W. Patterson to be \nan Assistant Secretary of State. Had I been present for these two \nvotes, I would have voted ``aye.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/11/senate-section/article/S8801-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8801]\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I come to the floor today to \nrecognize the retirement of an upstanding citizen from the Commonwealth \nof Kentucky, and to pay tribute to his career of service to my home \nState. This month, Greg Jones concludes over 21 years as executive \ndirector of the non-profit Southeast Kentucky Economic Development \nCorporation, SKED. His daily presence at the helm of the organization \nwill be sorely missed, but his legacy will endure in the thousands of \njobs he helped create and the increased economic vigor he helped bring \nto the region.\n  When he first took the job at the behest of Congressman Hal Rogers in \n1992, Greg oversaw a two-person staff and commanded a $75,000 budget. \nUnder his leadership the organization has grown to its current staff of \n10 professionals and a budget of nearly $2 million. Throughout his \ntenure as executive director, Greg marshaled SKED's resources to help \nstart and expand businesses, provide training for entrepreneurs, and \nattract new industries to the corporation's 45-county service area. \nUnder Greg's watch, SKED has unquestionably lived up to its stated \nmission--``to foster economic growth and vitality in the region.''\n  I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in recognizing Greg's exemplary \ncareer as well as wishing him a happy retirement with his wife Belinda \nand son Christopher.\n  An article about Greg Jones's retirement from SKED recently appeared \nin an area newspaper, the Commonwealth Journal. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objections, the article was ordered to be printed as \nfollows:\n\n        SKED Executive Director Greg Jones Retiring in December\n\n                    [From the Commonwealth Journal, \n                             Oct. 13, 2013]\n\n       Somerset, Ky.--Greg Jones, executive director of Southeast \n     Kentucky Economic Development Corporation (SKED), will retire \n     in\n\n[[Page S8802]]\n\n     December after more than 21 years of service to the nonprofit \n     organization and to Southeast Kentucky.\n       The longest serving executive director in the \n     organization's 27-year history, Jones is credited with \n     strengthening SKED's mission of job creation and making it \n     the premier economic development agency in the region. \n     Beginning with a $75,000 budget and two-person staff in 1992, \n     Jones and his current staff of 10 professionals now operate \n     with an annual budget of nearly $2 million.\n       ``I've had the privilege to lead SKED and our amazing team \n     of professionals for over two decades, and I am extremely \n     proud of our successes,'' Jones said. ``I shall forever be \n     grateful to Congressman Hal Rogers and the incredibly \n     supportive and talented individuals on the SKED Board of \n     Directors for giving me the opportunity to be a part of this \n     remarkable organization. And, finally, I wish to thank the \n     dedicated staff of SKED for their loyalty and friendship over \n     these many years.''\n       It was Congressman Rogers who asked Jones to head up the \n     grassroots effort he began, in 1986, back in 1992. At the \n     time, Jones was working as executive director of the \n     Somerset-Pulaski County Chamber of Commerce.\n       ``Over the last two decades, Greg Jones has worked \n     tirelessly to recruit thousands of jobs and expand the \n     industrial portfolio of southern and eastern Kentucky,'' said \n     Rogers. ``Greg's foresight to address vital infrastructure \n     upgrades, recruit high-tech companies and support \n     entrepreneurial growth will continue to benefit economic \n     development in our region for years to come. While he is \n     moving on from daily operations at SKED, I have asked Greg to \n     remain in close contact to offer guidance for the \n     organization that he has helped mold for success. My wife \n     Cynthia and I wish Greg and his family many blessings in his \n     years of retirement.''\n       As SKED executive director, Jones has been responsible for \n     the marketing and industrial recruitment activities for the \n     45-county SKED service area, managing a $10-million loan \n     portfolio and providing economic and community development \n     assistance to local communities in Southeast Kentucky.\n       Under his leadership, SKED has successfully assisted more \n     than 100 businesses and industries in starting or expanding \n     their operations in the region. These companies now employ \n     more than 7,700 workers and have invested an estimated $500 \n     million in Southeast Kentucky. He has successfully prepared \n     loan and grant applications totaling more than $26 million to \n     support the organization's job creation activities.\n       Building partnerships has been Jones's mantra for the past \n     21 years. Whether it was with local community leaders or \n     state and national funding agencies, Jones worked tirelessly \n     to form strong alliances across the region, state and nation. \n     One of those key partnerships is with the Appalachian \n     Regional Commission (ARC).\n       Earl Gohl, ARC federal co-chair, has worked with Jones on \n     several key projects in recent years.\n       ``Greg's leadership has made SKED what it is today,'' Gohl \n     said. ``What he has accomplished with the SKED \n     entrepreneurship program and the Valley Oak Technology \n     Complex has laid the groundwork for what Eastern Kentucky can \n     be tomorrow.''\n       Jones led SKED to receive designation as a Community \n     Development Financial Institution (CDFI) in 1999. As a \n     result, the organization received funding to implement \n     several innovative regional projects including the Valley Oak \n     Technology Complex, the Somerset Rail Park, the Southern \n     Kentucky Information Technology Center and the Enterprise \n     Center.\n       SKED received the National Association of Development \n     Organization's (NADO) 2002 Innovation Award in recognition of \n     its technology initiatives.\n       In 2009, SKED became a Certified Development Corporation \n     (CDC) by the U.S. Small Business Administration. This \n     designation authorized SKED to process SBA 504 loans \n     throughout the state of Kentucky. The 504 Loan Program is the \n     SBA's economic development tool to provide small-business \n     financing and create jobs all across America.\n       To date, some 250 people have received entrepreneurial \n     training from SKED thanks to a grant from the ARC in 2011. \n     SKED established the Entrepreneurial SMARTs program designed \n     to offer nationally acclaimed entrepreneurship classes at a \n     reduced rate. A CDFI grant provided the funding to hire a \n     professional to teach the classes.\n       SKED is governed by a 12-member, volunteer board of \n     directors. Over the past 21 years, Jones has worked with a \n     number of successful men and women on the board, each with \n     different areas of expertise and from a variety of career \n     fields, but all leaders in their own communities. As board \n     members, they share SKED's mission of job creation in \n     Southeast Kentucky.\n       SKED President Tim Barnes is one of those community \n     leaders. President and CEO of Hometown Bank, he's led the \n     SKED Board of Directors for the past three years.\n       ``Greg has been the face of SKED for so long, it's hard to \n     imagine ever being able to replace him,'' Barnes said. \n     ``Let's just say there will be no replacing Greg. He's one of \n     a kind. His legacy of caring professionalism will live on \n     through the lending programs and other initiatives he's \n     worked so tirelessly to develop over the past two decades. We \n     wish him all the best in his future endeavors, and speaking \n     on behalf of all board members past and present, I say a \n     hearty thank you.''\n       The SKED Board of Directors plans a national search for \n     Jones's successor.\n       A native of Laurel County, Jones has served on numerous \n     boards and commissions both locally and nationally. These \n     positions include being past president of the Appalachia \n     Development Alliance. He is currently on the board of \n     directors for both TOURSEKY and the National Institute for \n     Hometown Security. He was named East Kentucky Power \n     Community/Economic Development Professional of the Year in \n     2007.\n       He earned his B.S. in industrial technology at Morehead \n     State University in Morehead, Ky. He also holds a master of \n     public administration degree from Southern Illinois \n     University--Edwardsville. He also attended the Institute for \n     Organization Management and Economic Development Institute.\n       In 1995, he received the Certified Economic Developer \n     designation from the American Economic Development Council.\n       He is married to Belinda Taylor Jones and they have a son, \n     Christopher.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/11/senate-section/article/S8802-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, this Saturday will mark 1 year since one \nof the most horrific tragedies in our nation's history: the murder of \n26 innocents at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT on December \n14, 2012. All of us remember the shock we felt when we heard the news \nreports. Twenty first graders--only 6 or 7 years old--were gunned down \nin their classrooms, and six educators were killed while trying to \nprotect their students from harm.\n  The events of that day were heartbreaking. As we come upon the grim \n1-year anniversary of that event, our thoughts and our prayers are with \nthe families and friends of the victims. Many of them stood in a nearby \nfirehouse on that day waiting for first responders to bring them any \nword about their loved ones in the school. One by one, the first \nresponders brought down children and teachers to the firehouse to \nreunite them with their families--until the families of the victims \nwere the only ones left. Then it became clear that no more would be \ncoming.\n  These families have suffered immensely. But in the face of their \ngrief and loss, they have shown incredible strength and courage. They \nhave supported one another with a strong sense of community and faith, \nand they have dedicated themselves to the cause of sparing other \nfamilies what they have gone through.\n  I have met with many of these families over the past year. They have \ncome to meet with Members of Congress, and with lawmakers in many \nStates, to share their ideas for how to reduce the devastating toll of \ngun violence. I salute them for their courage, and I thank them for \nstanding up on behalf of so many families across America who have lost \na loved one to gunfire.\n  Over 11,000 Americans are murdered with guns each year. If we count \nsuicides and accidental shootings, the death toll from guns rises to \nmore than 31,000 Americans each year. This epidemic of gun violence is \nunacceptable. We cannot simply shrug our shoulders and write off these \nshootings as the cost of living in America.\n  In my home State of Illinois, I have met too many grieving mothers \nwho have lost their children to senseless gun violence--mothers such \nas: Annette Nance-Holt, who lost her son Blair in the crossfire of a \ngang shooting; Mary Kay Mace, whose daughter Ryanne was killed in her \nclassroom at Northern Illinois University; Pam Bosley, whose son \nTerrell was shot and killed outside of church; and Cleo Pendleton, \nwhose daughter Hadiya was gunned down at a bus stop where she was \nseeking shelter from the rain.\n  I do not want to go to another funeral for a police officer like \nChicago Police Officer Thomas Wortham IV, who was killed by gang \nmembers with a straw-purchased gun. I do not want to hear about any \nmore killers who couldn't pass a background check but still were able \nto buy guns through a private sale--such as the man who murdered Ricky \nByrdsong, the former Northwestern University basketball coach, in \nSkokie, IL.\n  We need to take proactive steps, consistent with the Constitution and \nthe Second Amendment, to stop these situations from happening. We need \nto reduce this high number of violent shootings. We can do this by \nworking for better gun safety laws laws that will spare other families \nwhat these families have gone through. No matter how long it may take, \nno matter how challenging the road may seem, this is a goal worth \nfighting for.\n  We have seen some positive steps forward when it comes to gun safety \nin the past year. For the first time ever, the Senate confirmed a \ndirector to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and \nExplosives. We have seen an end to the federal funding restrictions on \nresearch into the causes of gun violence. We have seen significant \ngrowth in crime gun tracing, especially with the eTrace program that \nhas helped catch criminals and gun traffickers in Illinois and \nnationwide, and important new gun safety laws have passed in States \nsuch as California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, New \nYork, and my home State of Illinois, where universal background checks \nand mandatory reporting of lost and stolen guns are now the law.\n  We know that more needs to be done. Earlier this year, we failed to \nget the 60 Senate votes we need to ensure that a criminal background \ncheck is conducted on every gun sale. The Senate also fell a few votes \nshort when it comes to toughening our laws against straw purchasing and \nillegal gun trafficking. Of course, the House of Representatives has \nnot even tried to pass legislation to reduce gun violence.\n  I know it is frustrating to many Americans when Congress fails to act \non commonsense steps such as these. It is frustrating for me too, but I \nam not giving up. The goal of reducing gun deaths in America is worth \nfighting for. We may not have the votes we need in Congress today, but \nif the American people speak out and work hard for commonsense reform, \nwe will achieve it.\n  I salute my colleagues in both parties who have worked hard this past \nyear to push for commonsense gun safety laws especially the Senators \nfrom Connecticut, Senators Blumenthal and Murphy, who have become such \nadmirable leaders on this issue. I also commend Senators Manchin and \nToomey, who have crafted a balanced background check bill to make sure \nthat we aren't selling guns to criminals; and Senators Leahy, Kirk, \nCollins and Gillibrand, who have worked with me on a bill to crack down \non the straw purchasers and gun traffickers who supply criminals with \nweapons.\n  The votes haven't been there yet, but we will keep at it. It may not \nhappen right away, but we are in this for the long haul. The families \nfrom Newtown are going to keep working for these reforms, and so must \nwe. I am confident that working together, we will pass commonsense \nreforms that save lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/11/senate-section/article/S8803-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING THE NEWTOWN TRAGEDY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

We cannot simply shrug our shoulders and write off these \nshootings as the cost of living in America.\n  In my home State of Illinois, I have met too many grieving mothers \nwho have lost their children to senseless gun violence--mothers such \nas: Annette Nance-Holt, who lost her son Blair in the crossfire of a \ngang shooting; Mary Kay Mace, whose daughter Ryanne was killed in her \nclassroom at Northern Illinois University; Pam Bosley, whose son \nTerrell was shot and killed outside of church; and Cleo Pendleton, \nwhose daughter Hadiya was gunned down at a bus stop where she was \nseeking shelter from the rain.\n  I do not want to go to another funeral for a police officer like \nChicago Police Officer Thomas Wortham IV, who was killed by gang \nmembers with a straw-purchased gun. I do not want to hear about any \nmore killers who couldn't pass a background check but still were able \nto buy guns through a private sale--such as the man who murdered Ricky \nByrdsong, the former Northwestern University basketball coach, in \nSkokie, IL.\n  We need to take proactive steps, consistent with the Constitution and \nthe Second Amendment, to stop these situations from happening. We need \nto reduce this high number of violent shootings. We can do this by \nworking for better gun safety laws laws that will spare other families \nwhat these families have gone through. No matter how long it may take, \nno matter how challenging the road may seem, this is a goal worth \nfighting for.\n  We have seen some positive steps forward when it comes to gun safety \nin the past year. For the first time ever, the Senate confirmed a \ndirector to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and \nExplosives. We have seen an end to the federal funding restrictions on \nresearch into the causes of gun violence. We have seen significant \ngrowth in crime gun tracing, especially with the eTrace program that \nhas helped catch criminals and gun traffickers in Illinois and \nnationwide, and important new gun safety laws have passed in States \nsuch as California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, New \nYork, and my home State of Illinois, where universal background checks \nand mandatory reporting of lost and stolen guns are now the law.\n  We know that more needs to be done. Earlier this year, we failed to \nget the 60 Senate votes we need to ensure that a criminal background \ncheck is conducted on every gun sale. The Senate also fell a few votes \nshort when it comes to toughening our laws against straw purchasing and \nillegal gun trafficking. Of course, the House of Representatives has \nnot even tried to pass legislation to reduce gun violence.\n  I know it is frustrating to many Americans when Congress fails to act \non commonsense steps such as these. It is frustrating for me too, but I \nam not giving up. The goal of reducing gun deaths in America is worth \nfighting for. We may not have the votes we need in Congress today, but \nif the American people speak out and work hard for commonsense reform, \nwe will achieve it.\n  I salute my colleagues in both parties who have worked hard this past \nyear to push for commonsense gun safety laws especially the Senators \nfrom Connecticut, Senators Blumenthal and Murphy, who have become such \nadmirable leaders on this issue. I also commend Senators Manchin and \nToomey, who have crafted a balanced background check bill to make sure \nthat we aren't selling guns to criminals; and Senators Leahy, Kirk, \nCollins and Gillibrand, who have worked with me on a bill to crack down \non the straw purchasers and gun traffickers who supply criminals with \nweapons.\n  The votes haven't been there yet, but we will keep at it. It may not \nhappen right away, but we are in this for the long haul. The families \nfrom Newtown are going to keep working for these reforms, and so must \nwe. I am confident that working together, we will pass commonsense \nreforms that save lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/11/senate-section/article/S8803-2", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8803-S8804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING MICHAEL JOSEPH O'SHEA\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, today I wish to speak about one of the \nmost important jobs the Senate must do before we go home for the \nholidays--extend Federal unemployment insurance benefits. This is a \nprogram that has helped tens of millions of Americans weather the storm \nof the difficult economy over the last several years. It has helped \nworkers put food on the table, kept a roof over their heads, and kept \nmillions out of poverty.\n  But this program is at risk. If Congress fails to extend it, then \njust 3 days after Christmas on December 28, 1.3 million Americans will \nbe abruptly cut off from their vital unemployment insurance benefits. \nBut it does not stop there: by the end of next year another 3.6 million \nAmericans will be cut off from unemployment insurance. That's a total \nof 4.9 million Americans--including 35,500 Iowans, who have spent 6 \nmonths or more trying to find new work, going out and pounding the \npavement day after day, who will now have to spend this holiday season \nworrying about how they and their families and children are going to \nsurvive. How will they pay their heating bill, their rent, or their \nmortgage, much less afford gifts for their family?\n  Congress has a moral responsibility to continue the Federal \nunemployment insurance program to ensure that Americans and their \nfamilies can survive while trying to get back on their feet and find \nnew work. It is simply unacceptable for us to return to our home States \nto celebrate the holidays without answering our constituents' call to \nkeep this critical lifeline going. They are depending on us.\n  Unfortunately, some people seem to think that the misfortune of \nlosing a job means that these hardworking folks are to blame, or that \nthey do not deserve this basic lifeline. But they are not. In fact, \nparticipation in the unemployment program requires that workers have a \nsignificant work history, which means they have paid into the system \nand earned these benefits. Collecting benefits also requires workers to \nhave lost their job through no fault of their own, and to be actively \nlooking for work. The fact is times are still tough and jobs are hard \nto come by. For every job opening there are three job seekers. That is \nwhy so many millions of workers have been searching for new work for \nsuch a long period of time. Our economy still needs more jobs, and in \nthe meantime, we must make sure that workers who are out of luck in \nthis economy have some basic income to make ends meet. We cannot \nabandon them now.\n  These benefits are crucial for keeping households afloat. For many, \nthis is their last lifeline. If Congress fails to act, millions of \npeople will face real economic devastation. The Council of Economic \nAdvisers found that in 2012 unemployment benefits kept 2.5 million \npeople from falling below the poverty line, including 600,000 children.\n  By helping families to make ends meet, unemployment benefits are a \nhelp not just to jobseekers and their families, but to our economy as a \nwhole. After all, one of the best ways to grow our economy and to \ncreate jobs is to support spending power. And that is exactly what \nunemployment benefits do. When unemployed workers can continue to pay \ntheir bills, businesses can continue to make sales and provide \nservices, and the economy grows. The Congressional Budget Office finds \nunemployment benefits to be one of the most efficient fiscal policies \nto improve economic growth. If Federal unemployment benefits are \nextended through 2014, it would increase GDP by 0.2 percent and create \n200,000 jobs. Those jobs could be lost if we do not extend this \nprogram.\n  It's important to remember who is most affected by long-term \nunemployment. Unfortunately, it is older workers. In a cruel state of \naffairs, those who have been working for decades, but who are not yet \nat retirement age, have the hardest time finding new work. According to \nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics, over half of jobseekers between ages 55 \nand 64 have been searching for work for over 6 months. That is compared \nto 42 percent of those between 25 and 54. These older workers can't yet \nafford the luxury of retirement. They need to continue working to \nsupport their families and hopefully one day save enough to retire with \nsecurity.\n  Congress has a long history of acting to ensure basic security for \nworking people during tough economic times. Over the last 50 years, \nduring seven different economic downturns, Congress has provided \nFederal unemployment benefit programs to assist workers when \nunemployment is high. The current program was put in place in 2008 by \nPresident George W. Bush when the unemployment rate was 5.6 percent. \nWhile unemployment is falling, it is still at a high rate, 7 percent. \nLong-term unemployment has been at record highs for years. Currently 37 \npercent of unemployed workers have been looking for new work for at \nleast 6 months. Congress has never allowed Federal unemployment \nbenefits to expire while the long-term unemployment rate was above 23 \npercent. Our economy is recovering, but we are not there yet. While the \nduration of Federal benefits has appropriately been scaled back as the \nrecovery has progressed, there is no question that American families \nare still depending on Federal unemployment benefits, and there is no \njustification for letting the current program expire now.\n  We cannot let vulnerable Americans be cut off from their unemployment \ninsurance during their time of need. We cannot turn the lights out on \nmillions of Americans. Working families deserve peace of mind and our \ncontinued support while they look for jobs during these tough times. I \nurge the Senate to act to extend unemployment benefits, so that \nfamilies do not have to wonder how they will survive in the New Year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/11/senate-section/article/S8804-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE EXTENSION\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

That's just common sense, and it's the right thing to \ndo for homeowners across the Northeast, who are still putting their \nlives back together in the wake of this storm. The last thing they need \nis another burden like this.\n  I hope our colleagues reconsider their objection, and allow us to \nvote on this bipartisan bill and join us in helping these families \nrebuild and stay in their homes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/11/senate-section/article/S8805-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HUMAN RIGHTS IN HUNGARY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, earlier this year I chaired a Helsinki \nCommission hearing on the situation in Hungary. Today, I would like to \nrevisit some of the issues addressed by our witnesses.\n  Since the April 2010 elections, Hungary has undertaken the most \ndramatic legal transformation that Europe has seen in decades. A new \nConstitution was passed with votes of the ruling party alone, and even \nthat has already been amended five times. More than 700 new laws have \nbeen passed, including laws on the media, religion, and civic \nassociations. There is a new civil code and a new criminal code. There \nis an entirely new electoral framework. The magnitude and scope of \nthese changes have understandably put Hungary under a microscope.\n  At the Helsinki Commission's hearing in March, I examined concerns \nthat these changes have undermined Hungary's system of democratic \nchecks and balances, independence of the judiciary, and freedoms of the \nmedia and religion. I also received testimony about rising revisionism \nand extremism. I heard from Jozsef Szajer, a Member of the European \nParliament who represented the Hungarian Government at the hearing. \nPrinceton constitutional law expert Kim Lane Scheppelle, Dr. Paul \nShapiro from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, and Sylvana Habdank-\nKolaczkowska from Freedom House presented compelling testimony.\n  Unfortunately, developments in Hungary remain troubling.\n  Even though Hungary's religion law was tweaked after the \nConstitutional Court struck down parts of it, it retains a \ndiscriminatory two-tier system. Moreover, the Parliament is empowered \nwith the extraordinary and, for all practical purposes, unreviewable \npower to decide what is and what is not a religion.\n  This month, the government announced it is launching an investigation \ninto the Methodist Evangelical Church, a church persecuted during \ncommunist times. Today, the Methodist Evangelical Church is known for \nits outreach to Roma, work with the homeless and is one of the largest \ncharitable organizations in Hungary. As I noted at the Helsinki \nCommission hearing in March, it is also one of the hundreds of \nreligious groups stripped of official recognition after the passage of \nHungary's new religion law.\n  The church has now complied with submitting the necessary number of \nsupporters required by the law and, as a reply, the government has \nannounced an unidentified ``expert'' will conduct an investigation into \nthe church's beliefs and tenets. This step only reinforces fears that \nparliamentary denial of recognition as a so-called ``Accepted Church'' \nopens the door for further repressive measures.\n  Veneration of Hungary's wartime regent, Miklos Horthy, along with \nother anti-Semitic figures such as writer Jozsef Nyiro, continues. In \nNovember, a statue of Hungarian Jewish poet Miklos Radnoti, who was \nkilled by Hungarian Nazis at the end of 1944, was rammed with a car and \nbroken in half. At roughly the same time, extremists staged a book \nburning of his works along with other materials they called ``Zionist \npublications.'' At the beginning of December, two menorahs were \nvandalized in Budapest.\n  Reflecting the climate of extremism, more than 160 Hungarian \nnationals have been found by Canada this year to have a well-founded \nfear of persecution. Almost all are Romani, but the refugees include an \n80-year-old award winning Hungarian Jewish writer who received death \nthreats after writing about anti-Semitism in Hungary, and was stripped \nof his honorary citizenship of Budapest on an initiative from the far-\nright Jobbik party, supported by the votes of the ruling Fidesz party.\n  While there are many who suggest the real problem comes from the \nextremist opposition party Jobbik, and not the ruling government, it \nseems that some members of Fidesz have contributed to a rise in \nintolerance.\n  I am particularly troubled that the government-created Media Council, \nconsisting entirely of Fidesz delegated members, has threatened ATV--an \nindependent television station--with punitive fines if it again \ncharacterizes Jobbik as extremist. If you can't even talk about what is \nextremist or anti-Semitic in Hungary without facing legal sanctions, \nhow can you combat extremism and anti-Semitism? Moreover, this decision \nserves to protect Jobbik from critical debate in the advance of next \nyear's elections. Why?\n  Other new measures further stifle free speech.\n  Unfortunately, and somewhat shockingly, last month Hungary amended \nits defamation law to allow for the imposition of prison terms up to 3 \nyears.\n  The imposition of jail time for speech offenses was a hallmark of the \ncommunist era. During the post-communist transition, the Helsinki \nCommission consistently urged OSCE countries to repeal criminal \ndefamation and insult laws entirely. In 2004, for example, the Helsinki \nCommission wrote to Minister of Justice Peter Barandy regarding the \ncriminal convictions of Andras Bencsik and Laszlo Attila Bertok.\n  This new law, raced through under an expedited procedure in the wake \nof a bi-election controversy in which allegations of voter manipulation \nwere traded, was quickly criticized by the OSCE representative on \nFreedom of the Media. I share her concerns that these changes to the \ncriminal code may lead to the silencing of critical or differing views \nin society and are inconsistent with OSCE commitments.\n  Hungary was once held up as a model of peaceful democratic transition \nand is situated in a region of Europe where the beacon of freedom is \nstill sought by many today. I hope Hungary will return to a leadership \nrole in the protection of human rights and the promotion of democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/11/senate-section/article/S8805-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HUMAN RIGHTS IN HUNGARY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN.

Madam President, today I wish to honor Lancaster County, \nPennsylvania's impressive feat of preserving 100,000 acres of farmland. \nLancaster County became the first county in the Nation to preserve this \nmany acres of farmland, a full 25 percent of all land available for \nfarming in the county. My father, Governor Robert P. Casey, served as \nGovernor of Pennsylvania from 1987 to 1995 and signed into law the \nState farmland preservation program. Governor Casey made preserving \nfarmland a high priority to ensure that Pennsylvania's farmers could \ncontinue to produce agricultural products and sustain the \nCommonwealth's number one industry.\n  Farmland preservation is one of Pennsylvania's noblest \naccomplishments. There are a lot of words that can describe this \nachievement. But the one word that I think is most important is the \nword sacred. This is truly a sacred act. Reflecting on this tremendous \nmilestone, I am reminded of a line from the Prayer of Saint Francis, \nwhich reads ``For it is in giving that we receive.'' When I think about \nconservation, I am inspired by the gifts which flow so directly from \nthe preservation of land. Conserved lands purify our\n\n[[Page S8806]]\n\nwater, clean our air and maintain open spaces. Conserved lands serve as \nprecious wildlife habitat, allowing species to forage and to flourish.\n  We know that bees, which provide sweet honey and pollinate our crops, \nare searching for habitat in these modern times. Lancaster County's \ntriumph in conservation helps afford bees, which have lived on Earth \nfor more than 100 million years, a place to inhabit. Another gift \ncreated when farmers, foresters and ranchers conserve lands is the \nknowledge that these critical professions--these cherished ways of \nlife--will continue to have a valued role in American society for many \ngenerations to come.\n  In giving lands over to the committed purpose of conservation, people \nreceive bountiful rewards. As a government official, I believe in the \ntransformative and restorative qualities of conservation easements. I \nwill work to ensure vital conservation programs continue to work for \nPennsylvanians and partner organizations, such as the Lancaster \nFarmland Trust and the Lancaster County Agricultural Preserve Board.\n  Furthermore, more than half of Pennsylvania and most all of Lancaster \nCounty lies within the Chesapeake Bay watershed--and approximately 3 \nmillion people live in this area. The challenges of farming in this \nregion are significant. Thus efficient, effective and relevant Federal \nconservation programs are critical to farmers' success. In advance of \nthe Senate agriculture committee's consideration of the 2012 farm bill, \nI introduced the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Fairness Act, legislation \naimed at helping farmers to better implement beneficial conservation \npractices and to meet water quality goals in the watershed. The 2013 \nSenate bill contains portions of this legislation and features \nadditional improvements that better ensure that the remodeled \nconservation programs will serve the needs of farmers in the Chesapeake \nBay watershed.\n  As we move forward with the farm bill, providing farmers in the \nwatershed with the conservation tools included in the Senate bill is \nextremely important. Federal farm land conservation programs must \nremain strong. The voluntary conservation programs in the farm bill \nprovide important tools to help farmers comply with Federal and State \nregulations while keeping farmers in business. Of particular importance \nto Pennsylvanians are programs like the proposed Agricultural Land \nEasements program, designed to take over the current Farmland \nProtection Program, which helps to preserve working farm lands from \ndevelopment.

He commissioned into the \ninfantry in 2002 upon graduation from the Citadel, the Military College \nof South Carolina, as a distinguished military graduate and the cadet \nregimental commander of the South Carolina Corps of Cadets.\n  Major Cox was first assigned as a platoon Leader in A Company, 3-187 \nInfantry Regiment, Rakkasans, 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, \nKY, deploying in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. Upon \nreturn from Iraq, Major Cox was selected to be a Ranger platoon leader \nin A Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, at Fort Lewis, WA, \ndeploying twice in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. After the \nManeuver Captains' Career Course at Fort Benning, GA, Major Cox was \nassigned to 4th Ranger Training Battalion, Fort Benning, GA, to be a \nplatoon Ranger instructor, Company Commander, and Battalion S-1.\n  Major Cox then moved to Fort Bragg, NC, to become the 3rd Brigade \nCombat Team air officer at the 82nd Airborne Division. He assumed \ncommand of A Company, 1-505 Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne \nDivision while deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nFollowing company command and battalion staff, he was selected to be an \nArmy congressional fellow attending the George Washington University, \nwhere he earned a master's degree and subsequently joined my personal \noffice on Capitol Hill.\n  Over the past year, Major Cox has distinguished himself among his \nfellowship peers as a leader in the Senate. From his legislative \ncontributions supporting my role on the Senate Armed Services Committee \nto his dedication to constituent services, Major Cox has deftly applied \nhis military expertise to elevate the performance of my personal \noffice. Across my 19 years in office, Major Cox ranks among the very \nbest of a select group of fellows\n  The Army says that ``Rangers Lead The Way!'' Major Cox has served as \nan inspiration and model Airborne Ranger to me and my colleagues in the \nSenate. I am deeply grateful for his significant contributions and \nleadership over the past year. He has certainly lived up to the Ranger \nmotto.\n  It is my great pleasure to congratulate Major Cox, his wife Joscelyn, \nand their two children, Reagan and Seth, as they leave the Senate and \ncontinue to serve our great Nation.

After the \nManeuver Captains' Career Course at Fort Benning, GA, Major Cox was \nassigned to 4th Ranger Training Battalion, Fort Benning, GA, to be a \nplatoon Ranger instructor, Company Commander, and Battalion S-1.\n  Major Cox then moved to Fort Bragg, NC, to become the 3rd Brigade \nCombat Team air officer at the 82nd Airborne Division. He assumed \ncommand of A Company, 1-505 Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne \nDivision while deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nFollowing company command and battalion staff, he was selected to be an \nArmy congressional fellow attending the George Washington University, \nwhere he earned a master's degree and subsequently joined my personal \noffice on Capitol Hill.\n  Over the past year, Major Cox has distinguished himself among his \nfellowship peers as a leader in the Senate. From his legislative \ncontributions supporting my role on the Senate Armed Services Committee \nto his dedication to constituent services, Major Cox has deftly applied \nhis military expertise to elevate the performance of my personal \noffice. Across my 19 years in office, Major Cox ranks among the very \nbest of a select group of fellows\n  The Army says that ``Rangers Lead The Way!'' Major Cox has served as \nan inspiration and model Airborne Ranger to me and my colleagues in the \nSenate. I am deeply grateful for his significant contributions and \nleadership over the past year. He has certainly lived up to the Ranger \nmotto.\n  It is my great pleasure to congratulate Major Cox, his wife Joscelyn, \nand their two children, Reagan and Seth, as they leave the Senate and \ncontinue to serve our great Nation. I wish them the very best of luck.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/11/senate-section/article/S8806-3", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8806-S8807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL KELLY MARIE LAUREL\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, today I wish to pay tribute to an \nexemplary leader, an accomplished Soldier, and an extraordinary \nAmerican, as she retires from Active Duty with the U.S. Army. LTC Kelly \nMarie Laurel has dedicated nearly 25 years of service to our great \nNation and has set the very standard of leadership, strategic thinking, \nand selfless service that we expect of our finest Army officers. \nCulminating her career as the hand-picked Deputy Chief of the Secretary \nof the Army's Strategic Initiatives Group,\n\n[[Page S8807]]\n\nLieutenant Colonel Laurel has served and excelled at every level of our \nArmy, and she exemplifies the patriotism, fidelity, and commitment to \nwhich every citizen should strive.\n  From her early enlisted career as an airman in the Wyoming National \nGuard to her Active-Duty service in key positions ranging from medical \nplatoon leader and company commander to personally advising the Army \nsurgeon general and the Secretary of the Army, Kelly has been \nexceptional in every respect. Examples of her ever-increasing \nresponsibilities include medical platoon leader, 61st Area Support \nMedical Company at Fort Hood, TX, company commander, Headquarters, 52d \nMedical Evacuation Battalion; and later the chief of the Management \nDivision, 18th Medical Command in Korea; and the chief financial \nofficer for the widely dispersed Heidelberg Hospital and its nine \noutlying clinics in Germany. Her work and potential was so great that \nthen-Major Laurel was soon personally selected to serve the Army's \nsurgeon general as the senior budget analyst, the chief of the \nFinancial Health Policy Division, and finally as the senior \ncongressional affairs coordinating officer.\n  Fortunately for me and so many Members of Congress, the Assistant \nSecretary of the Army for Financial Management and Comptroller soon \nrecognized her outstanding abilities and selected Kelly to serve as the \nArmy's senior budget legislative liaison. I and my colleagues in both \nChambers have personally benefited from Kelly's extraordinary \nintellect, keen analysis, and unmatched determination. During her \ntenure in this position, Kelly routinely worked the most sensitive, \ncomplex, and critical Army actions involving the Senate and House \nAppropriations Committees. Her wisdom and unmatched expertise led the \nArmy to extraordinary success in obtaining vital funding for the most \ncritical medical, environmental, and behavioral health programs and \nensured that our soldiers and their families had the necessary support \nthey needed during these years of war. Moreover, she was instrumental \nin obtaining vital funding for the restructuring and expansion of the \nArmy National Cemeteries Program. Most recently, recognizing her \nleadership and exceptional intellect, the Secretary of the Army \nselected Kelly to be his deputy chief of strategic initiatives. In this \ncapacity, Kelly advised the Secretary and other Army senior leaders on \nthe development and implementation of critical service-wide policies \nand programs that will benefit the Army for many years to come.\n  Kelly's superb career and character is also a true testament to the \nexceptional support and example provided by her family. As the daughter \nof first-generation Americans, Kelly was taught early the value of hard \nwork, commitment, and selfless service by her parents Jose and Dolores \nMontemayor. Moreover, as a child of a career military family, Kelly \nlearned to embody the values of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless \nservice, honor, integrity and personal courage before she even knew \nthere was an Army. As she has repeatedly demonstrated, to Kelly, these \nare not ideals but character traits; not platitudes, but requirements \nand expectations of every citizen. Clearly, her character, work ethic, \nand patriotism are examples to us all. We owe the highest praise and \ntribute to this great American and her family.\n  Accordingly, on behalf of a very grateful nation, I join my \ncolleagues today in recognizing and commending LTC Kelly Marie Laurel \nfor nearly 25 years of service to this country. Although, to the Army, \nKelly is irreplaceable, I am certain this exceptional citizen will \ncontinue to make great contributions to the United States as she \nembarks on the next chapter of her life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/11/senate-section/article/S8807-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. LEVI WATKINS, JR.\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, today I wish to salute Dr. Levi \nWatkins, Jr., a renowned cardiac surgeon who will retire at year's end \nfrom Johns Hopkins Medicine. During his 4-decade-long career, Dr. \nWatkins has had a profound impact on American health care--through the \ncountless patients he has treated, the students he has recruited and \nmentored, and the cultural diversity he has advanced.\n  Levi Watkins, Jr. grew up in Montgomery, AL, the third of Dr. and \nMrs. Levi Watkins, Sr.'s six children. At the Alabama State Laboratory \nHigh School, Watkins excelled in academics and athletics: he graduated \nvaledictorian and was selected for the Montgomery All-Star basketball \nteam. It was in Alabama that he witnessed the early days of the civil \nrights movement. As a member of the First Baptist Church of Montgomery, \nWatkins developed a close friendship with his pastor, the Reverend Dr. \nRalph David Abernathy, and later he attended Dexter Avenue Baptist \nChurch, where he was introduced to the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr. and the King family.\n  Watkins majored in biology as an undergraduate at Tennessee State \nUniversity, where he was elected president of the student body and \njoined Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., Alpha Kappa Mu honor society, \nBeta Kappa Chi honor society, and many other notable organizations. \nWatkins also led many student movements on campus and graduated with \nhighest honors.\n  Dr. Watkins' medical career has been one of monumental firsts. In \n1966, he integrated the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine as the \nfirst African-American student ever admitted. He was later selected to \nbecome a member of Alpha Omega Alpha medical honor society. Watkins \narrived at Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1970 as a general surgery intern \nand became the first African-American chief resident in cardiac surgery \nin the institution's history. There, in 1980, he performed the world's \nfirst implantation of an automatic heart defibrillator in a human--a \nprocedure that is now performed worldwide and has since saved tens of \nthousands of lives. In 1991, Dr. Watkins became the first African-\nAmerican at Johns Hopkins promoted to full professor of cardiac \nsurgery. He was named the first African-American associate dean in the \nSchool of Medicine and established the nation's first postdoctoral \nassociation, helping to revolutionize the culture of postdoctoral \neducation in the United States. Today, there are more than 50 such \nassociations across the nation.\n  Dr. Watkins has been a fierce advocate for fairness and diversity. He \njoined the Hopkins School of Medicine's admissions committee in 1979, \nand began recruiting minority applicants and sponsoring an annual \nwelcoming and networking reception for new students. In 1982, he \nfounded the Martin Luther King, Jr. Commemoration at Hopkins, an annual \nevent that has brought an illustrious array of speakers to Baltimore, \nincluding Coretta Scott King, Rosa Parks, Maya Angelou, Stevie Wonder, \nand Taylor Branch.\n  In October 2002, Vanderbilt University established a Professorship \nand Associate Deanship in his name; in October 2005, Dr. Watkins' \nportrait was unveiled at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine \nhonoring his life's work; and, in 2008, Vanderbilt bestowed upon Dr. \nWatkins its ``Most Distinguished Alumnus Award.''\n  Since 2006, when he stopped performing surgery, Dr. Watkins has \nremained a powerful presence and an important influence on Johns \nHopkins and the city of Baltimore. In December 2008, he was honored by \nthe National Black Caucus of State Legislators with the Nation Builders \nAward, along with President-Elect Barack Obama, and James H. Meredith. \nIn January of 2012, he was appointed co-chair of Mayor Stephanie \nRawlings-Blake's transition team for health and human services.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing Dr. Levi Watkins, Jr. well \nas he embarks upon the next phase of his lifelong journey to improve \nthe health and well-being of others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/11/senate-section/article/S8807-2", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8807-S8808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR.

A bill to improve the management of the Job Corps program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator McCaskill and \nSenator Manchin to introduce the Securing Job Corps Centers Act, a bill \nthat seeks to address the Job Corps' recent management challenges.\n  Job Corps is an educational and vocational training program \nadministered by the Department of Labor, DOL, that helps at-risk young \npeople ages 16 through 24 by giving them the tools they need to \nsucceed. Job Corps has been training young adults for meaningful \ncareers for nearly 50 years and is committed to offering its students a \nsafe, drug-free environment where they can train and learn.\n  Job Corps' mission is to attract eligible young people, teach them \nthe skills they need to become employable and independent, and help \nthem find meaningful jobs or further their education. This mission has \nbeen threatened, however, by the Department of Labor's mismanagement.\n  Earlier this year, the DOL ordered a temporary suspension of new \nstudent enrollments as its way to address a significant Job Corps \nprogram shortfall of $61.5 million. This was in addition to the $39 \nmillion shortfall in the previous\n\n[[Page S8810]]\n\nprogram year. The suspension of enrollments decimated the program, \nsetting it back for years to come, which is especially upsetting \nconsidering Job Corps has compiled an impressive record over five \ndecades in preparing at-risk youth for the workforce or higher \neducation.\n  According to DOL, several factors contributed to Job Corps' financial \nproblems, but the most significant was unchecked growth in expenditures \ndue to serious weaknesses in the financial management processes. I \nwrote to DOL officials for clarification, and they responded with the \nfollowing:\n\n       Job Corps lacked appropriate program monitoring tools and \n     control protocols, including those to sufficiently analyze \n     contractual spending trends. In turn, this led to inadequate \n     spending projections for the Operations account.\n\n  It is clear that the Department of Labor has mismanaged this program, \nand the students suffered the consequences. There are two Job Corps \ncenters in Maine that do excellent work to help these young adults \nbecome productive members of society. The Penobscot Job Corps Academy \nand the Loring Job Corps Center have the capability to serve nearly 800 \nat-risk youth on a daily basis. These centers put these young men and \nwomen on a path to earning their high school diploma and to gaining the \nnecessary skills to enter the workforce or the military or go on to \ncollege.\n  However, the shortfall caused by DOL mismanagement forced these \ncenters to furlough and lay off staff to reduce costs--jeopardizing the \nlong-term sustainability of these centers and their important work.\n  Studies have found Job Corps to be among the most effective of all \nfederally supported programs that serve youth between the ages of 16 \nand 24 who are disconnected from both school and work. Even in the face \nof unprecedented budget shortfalls and enrollment freezes, Job Corps \nhas continued to produce impressive results--85 percent of graduates \nobtain a job, enroll in higher education, or enlist in the military.\n  To ensure recent management challenges are addressed as transparently \nand effectively as possible, our bill would create an advisory board \nresponsible for working with the DOL to develop policy and programmatic \nrecommendations related to Job Corps' administration. The advisory \npanel will provide a series of reports directly to the U.S. Secretary \nof Labor and Congress on budget and financial management protocols, \ncost efficiencies, and maximizing the number of youth served. Our bill \nwill also require earlier notifications of management decisions at DOL \nthat could affect student enrollments.\n  Job Corps' recent management challenges have had ripple effects \nthroughout the communities served by Job Corps centers and continue to \nhave an impact on center operations. The fact that every Job Corps \ncenter continues to operate at 21 to 25 percent below full capacity is \nthe result of a management structure that forced operational decisions \nto be made in haste and without proper consideration of alternatives. \nAn advisory board of experienced Job Corps operations experts can help \nthe program and its new leadership to emerge from the crises of the \nlast year and ensure that, in the future, Job Corps policy decisions \nare always guided by what is in the best interests of Job Corps \nstudents and communities.\n  Job Corps' value remains clear. Studies suggest that leaving behind \nthe youth served by this program could cost our states and our economy \nhundreds of thousands of dollars per youth. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport our bill to ensure that Job Corps returns to the operational \nefficiency that characterized its first 50 years and remains among the \nnation's most successful workforce programs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Department of Labor,\n\n\n                                      Employment and Training,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 21, 2013.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: Thank you for your letter to Acting \n     Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris regarding the U.S. \n     Department of Labor's (Department) oversight and \n     administration of the Job Corps program. Job Corps is part of \n     the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) and the \n     Acting Secretary referred your letter to me for response. \n     Although we are not placing a moratorium on suspension of \n     enrollments at this time, I hope you will find the following \n     information to be helpful.\n       The Employment and Training Administration administers Job \n     Corps through 147 contracts for the program's 125 centers and \n     educational and vocational programs. Private contractors \n     operate 97 centers and the U.S. Department of Agriculture \n     (USDA) runs the remaining 28 centers. This letter discusses \n     the financial problems experienced by Job Corps in Program \n     Year (PY) 2011 and PY 2012, their causes, what we should have \n     done better, corrective actions we have taken, and the steps \n     we will take to ensure that the Job Corps program can \n     continue to provide high-quality programming to some of our \n     nation's most disadvantaged youth. We would welcome the \n     opportunity to provide you and your colleagues with a more \n     in-depth briefing at your earliest convenience. We are \n     continuing to analyze the matters discussed in this letter. \n     The description we have set forth below reflects our current \n     understanding.\n       Several factors contributed to the financial problems with \n     Job Corps in PY 2011, including growth in expenditures (such \n     as student-related expenditures and those associated with the \n     opening of three new Job Corps centers in PY 2010 and PY \n     2011) and serious weaknesses in ETA's and Job Corps' \n     financial management processes that led to a failure to \n     identify and adjust for rising costs in a timely manner. In \n     PY 2012, Job Corps again experienced financial problems \n     because the cost-savings measures taken by ETA and Job Corps \n     management were not aggressive enough to allow the program to \n     stay within budget.\n       For example, Job Corps opened three new centers in PY 2010 \n     and PY 2011 on a delayed schedule. Funding that had been \n     provided to Job Corps to cover the costs of operating these \n     centers in prior years was no longer dedicated to these sites \n     as a result of the delays, and we did not appropriately plan \n     for the increased costs resulting from the opening of these \n     centers.\n       While these and other costs escalated during the course of \n     PY 2011, the extent of the financial problems went \n     unrecognized. This is largely because Job Corps lacked \n     appropriate program monitoring tools and control protocols, \n     including those to sufficiently analyze contractual spending \n     trends. In turn, this led to inadequate spending projections \n     for the Operations account.\n       As you know, Congress provided ETA with authority in PY \n     2011 to transfer up to $26.2 million in funds from the Job \n     Corps Construction, Rehabilitation and Acquisition (CRA) \n     account to the Operations account. In April 2012, I concluded \n     that Job Corps would need to transfer this full amount. At \n     the end of May 2012, I notified the Secretary of the need to \n     transfer the funds. It also became apparent that this \n     transfer would not be sufficient to meet PY 2011 operating \n     needs.\n       Thus, ETA obtained approval from the Office of Management \n     and Budget (OMB) in June 2012 to transfer up to an additional \n     $5.37 million from the Training and Employment Services (TES) \n     and State Unemployment Insurance and Employment Service \n     Operations (SUIESO) accounts to the Job Corps Operations \n     account. The Department notified the Appropriations \n     Committees of its intent to transfer these funds. In the end, \n     only $2.2 million of this initial request was transferred to \n     Job Corps' Operations account.\n       In addition to the fund transfers for PY 2011, ETA \n     implemented a variety of programmatic changes to control \n     costs. These changes focused on non-mission critical \n     administrative expenses to ensure that student academic, \n     career technical training, and post-graduation placement \n     activities were not affected. These included negotiating \n     across-the-board cost-savings targets with each Job Corps \n     center to deobligate PY 2011 funds and suspending enrollment \n     for new students in the month of June, except for homeless \n     youth. ETA also conducted additional oversight on travel by \n     requiring center operators to report all bus and airfare \n     travel directly to the national office prior to arranging \n     travel with ticketing agencies, thus allowing for real-time \n     accounting of June's travel costs. We also required Job Corps \n     center operators to submit their financial reports every \n     three days during the month of June.\n       Concurrently, ETA implemented several initiatives to \n     strengthen and coordinate existing controls and created new \n     controls where appropriate to track contractor expenditures, \n     and certify adequate funding throughout the rest of PY 2011. \n     On May 22, 2012, the Department established a Job Corps \n     working group within DOL to provide weekly oversight of the \n     remediation efforts during the end of PY 2011. In addition, \n     in June 2012, Secretary Solis requested that the Inspector \n     General (IG) perform a comprehensive review of the Job Corps \n     financial control system.\n       We understood at the outset of PY 2012 that we needed to \n     take measures to ensure that program obligations remained \n     within Job Corps' appropriated levels. Even before the \n     program year started, we began to develop a comprehensive \n     plan for cost-cutting measures, which was updated throughout \n     the Program Year. In addition, the improvements made to Job \n     Corps' financial management allowed us to make projections \n     earlier in the program year about the overall budget \n     situation.\n\n[[Page S8811]]\n\n       Given our strong interest in not reducing student services \n     and minimizing disruption to the Job Corps Program, we \n     proceeded cautiously in evaluating and implementing cost \n     saving measures in PY 2012. In retrospect, it is clear that \n     we did not act as quickly or decisively as circumstances \n     required. As the Assistant Secretary, I take full \n     responsibility for our failure to manage these issues more \n     aggressively.\n       Although they ultimately were insufficient, we did take \n     several significant steps throughout PY 2012 to gain better \n     control of Job Corps' expenses. For example, in August a \n     newly-created Office of Financial Administration (OFA) within \n     ETA, headed by a Senior Executive Service-level Comptroller, \n     began operating. OFA oversees the now-centralized budget and \n     financial operations of Job Corps. After OFA began operating, \n     we developed initial targets for both savings and what we \n     believed would be a sufficient reserve for the Job Corps \n     program. We also eliminated a contract for accounting \n     services within the Job Corps Operations account, reduced \n     USDA costs, and negotiated with contractors to identify \n     additional cost-savings measures.\n       In September 2012, the Secretary approved several \n     additional measures for PY 2012: a reduction in new student \n     biweekly stipend and transition pay to graduates, suspension \n     of enrollments in late November and December, centralizing \n     student transportation costs, and reducing the national \n     academic support contract and career technical support \n     contract. In October 2012, we issued guidance informing the \n     Job Corps community that we would be suspending enrollment \n     from November 26 through December 31, 2012. We also announced \n     that, effective November 1, 2012, Job Corps would reduce the \n     stipends and transition pay for new enrollees.\n       Despite these cost-cutting measures, our analysis of data \n     in November showed that Job Corps would need to implement \n     additional savings because costs were again exceeding \n     budgeted amounts. Therefore, in December, we took additional \n     steps, including eliminating the student stipend for days \n     when a Job Corps student is not present for duty, which took \n     effect immediately, and reducing the student clothing \n     stipend, effective January 1, 2013. We reduced Job Corps' \n     national media buy by $4 million for PY 2012. In mid-\n     December, we increased the student to teacher ratio from 15:1 \n     to 18:1 in order to save costs, while properly accounting for \n     the special academic needs of at-risk youth.\n       In January 2013, we also issued guidance to reduce health \n     care-related costs, including by modifying the current health \n     staffing requirements, adjusting the hours for center \n     physicians, dentists and Training Employee Assistance Program \n     specialists based on center usage, and requiring applicants \n     to provide a current record of immunizations in order to \n     eliminate duplicative care. We also continued our work to cut \n     administrative costs. Among other things, we have issued a \n     solicitation that we anticipate will help Job Corps right-\n     size its career technical training and academic programs and \n     we are exploring the best way to centralize utility and other \n     procurements.\n       Notwithstanding these efforts to reduce costs for PY 2012, \n     as of the beginning of January 2013 we continued to project \n     insufficient cost savings to remain within budgeted levels \n     for the program year. On January 18, 2013, Job Corps \n     instructed all centers to temporarily suspend outreach and \n     admission activities, effective January 28, except for \n     runaway, homeless and foster care candidates. The length of \n     the suspension will be determined by the time it takes to \n     achieve the necessary savings, but we do not expect it to \n     last past June 30, 2013.\n       The decision to temporarily freeze Job Corps enrollment \n     nationwide was extremely difficult. It came after we \n     implemented many alternative cost-savings measures, albeit \n     insufficient ones. We also considered other alternatives \n     before deciding to implement the temporary enrollment freeze.\n       Some of the options we considered include an abbreviated \n     program year, slot reductions at a specified number of \n     centers, cutting student stipends and transition pay to \n     current students, and adopting a student leave policy in lieu \n     of scheduled holiday and other school breaks. Ultimately, we \n     rejected these and other options because of their more \n     harmful effect on the Job Corps program and the students that \n     it serves as well as the insufficient savings we would have \n     obtained. Our conclusion was that the most certain and least \n     detrimental savings Job Corps could achieve for the remainder \n     of PY 2012 was from the temporary suspension. This will \n     result in reduced center operating expenses, lower Outreach/\n     Admissions contract costs, as well as savings in student \n     stipend and transportation costs.\n       Notwithstanding the temporary enrollment suspension, on \n     January 28, 2013, Job Corps continued to serve 44,268 \n     students as of that date. With the suspension of new \n     enrollments, Job Corps will be able to keep its commitment to \n     students who are already in the program.\n       In closing, the Department deeply regrets the current \n     situation facing the Job Corps program. I personally take \n     responsibility for not acting more quickly to ensure that the \n     program was operating within its appropriated levels. The \n     decision to temporarily suspend enrollment at all centers is \n     the most balanced, efficient way to achieve the savings now \n     in order to avoid a shortfall in PY 2012. However, we clearly \n     recognize that a comprehensive review and assessment of the \n     Job Corps program, contracting, budget, and management is \n     needed to ensure that we do not face this situation again.

Res. 320\n\n       Whereas 22 years ago, the Wreaths Across America project \n     began an annual tradition, during the month of December, of \n     donating, transporting, and placing Maine balsam fir holiday \n     wreaths on the graves of the fallen heroes buried at \n     Arlington National Cemetery;\n       Whereas more than 1,000,000 wreaths have been sent to \n     locations, including national cemeteries and veterans \n     memorials, in every State and overseas;\n       Whereas the mission of the Wreaths Across America project \n     to ``Remember, Honor, Teach'' is carried out in part by \n     coordinating wreath-laying ceremonies at Arlington National \n     Cemetery as well as veterans cemeteries and other locations \n     in all 50 States;\n       Whereas the Wreaths Across America project carries out a \n     week-long veterans parade between Maine and Virginia, \n     stopping along the way to spread a message about the \n     importance of remembering the fallen heroes of the United \n     States, honoring those who serve, and teaching the people of \n     the United States about the sacrifices made by veterans and \n     their families to preserve the freedoms in the United States;\n       Whereas in 2012, wreaths were sent to more than 800 \n     locations across the United States and overseas, 100 more \n     locations than the previous year;\n       Whereas in December 2013, the Patriot Guard Riders, a \n     motorcycle and motor vehicle group that is dedicated to \n     patriotic events and includes more than 250,000 members \n     nationwide, will continue the tradition of the group of \n     escorting a tractor-trailer filled with donated wreaths from \n     Harrington, Maine to Arlington National Cemetery;\n       Whereas thousands of individuals volunteer each December to \n     escort and lay the wreaths;\n       Whereas December 15, 2012, was previously designated by the \n     Senate as ``Wreaths Across America Day''; and\n       Whereas the Wreaths Across America project will continue \n     the proud legacy on December 14, 2013, bringing approximately \n     130,000 wreaths to Arlington National Cemetery on that day: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates December 14, 2013, as ``Wreaths Across \n     America Day'';\n       (2) honors the Wreaths Across America project, the Patriot \n     Guard Riders, and all of the volunteers and donors involved \n     in this worthy tradition; and\n       (3) recognizes the sacrifices that our veterans, members of \n     the Armed Forces, and their families have made, and continue \n     to make, for our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/11/senate-section/article/S8811-2", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8811-S8812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 321--HONORING THE LIFE, ACCOMPLISHMENTS, AND LEGACY \n OF NELSON ROLIHLAHLA MANDELA AND EXPRESSING CONDOLENCES ON HIS PASSING\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Coons, Mr. Flake, Mr. \nMenendez, Mr. Alexander, Ms. Ayotte, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. \nBaucus, Mr. Begich, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Booker, \nMr. Boozman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown, Mr. Burr, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Cardin, \nMr. Carper, Mr. Casey, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Coats, Mr. Coburn, Mr. \nCochran, Ms. Collins, Mr. Corker, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Cruz, Mr. \nDonnelly, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Enzi, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Fischer, Mr. \nFranken, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Graham, Mr. Grassley, Mrs. Hagan, Mr. \nHarkin, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Heinrich, Ms. Heitkamp, Mr. Heller, Ms. Hirono, \nMr. Hoeven, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Johanns, Mr. Johnson of \nWisconsin, Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, Mr. Kaine, Mr. King, Mr. Kirk, \nMs. Klobuchar, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lee, Mr. Levin, Mr. \nManchin, Mr. Markey, Mr. McCain, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Merkley, Ms. \nMikulski, Mr. Moran, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Murphy, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \nNelson, Mr. Paul, Mr. Portman, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Reed, Mr. Risch, Mr. \nRoberts, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Sanders, Mr.\n\n[[Page S8812]]\n\nSchatz, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Scott, Mr. Sessions, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Shelby, \nMs. Stabenow, Mr. Tester, Mr. Thune, Mr. Toomey, Mr. Udall of Colorado, \nMr. Udall of New Mexico, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Warner, Ms. Warren, Mr. \nWhitehouse, Mr. Wicker, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 321\n\n       Whereas Nelson Mandela was born on July 18, 1918, as \n     Rolihlahla Mandela, to Nonqaphi Nosekeni and Nkosi \n     Mphakanyiswa Gadla Mandela in Transkei, South Africa;\n       Whereas Nelson Mandela's defiance of injustice, and his \n     commitment to peace and reconciliation, played critical roles \n     in the negotiation process that led South Africa to abolish \n     apartheid, a system of racially focused social, political, \n     and economic discrimination, and to ultimately adopt in its \n     place a system of multiparty democracy and universal suffrage \n     for all South Africans;\n       Whereas Nelson Mandela became a political activist as a \n     young man and rose through the leadership ranks of the \n     African National Congress (ANC), becoming the ANC President;\n       Whereas, on August 5, 1962, Nelson Mandela was arrested for \n     his political activism to end the discriminatory policies of \n     apartheid;\n       Whereas, despite calls for clemency on behalf of Nelson \n     Mandela by the international community, including the \n     Security Council, the General Assembly, and the Secretary \n     General of the United Nations, he was found guilty of all \n     charges against him and sentenced to life in prison;\n       Whereas, during 18 of his 27 years of imprisonment on \n     Robben Island, Nelson Mandela was permitted only one visitor \n     a year, and for only 30 minutes;\n       Whereas Nelson Mandela remained resolute, refusing offers \n     to renounce his struggle against the Government of South \n     Africa in exchange for his freedom, and became widely viewed \n     as a martyr for the anti-apartheid movement;\n       Whereas, during his imprisonment, Nelson Mandela was \n     confined to a small cell where he slept on the floor, and he \n     was sentenced to hard labor while being gravely mistreated by \n     prison officials;\n       Whereas, on February 11, 1990, under growing international \n     pressure and national campaign efforts, Nelson Mandela was \n     released from prison, marking the end of his 27 years, 6 \n     months, and 1 week of continuous incarceration;\n       Whereas, upon his release, Nelson Mandela resumed a top \n     leadership role in the ANC and led the party in negotiations \n     that resulted in South Africa's first multiracial elections;\n       Whereas, in 1994, following the first fully representative, \n     multiracial national elections, Nelson Mandela was elected on \n     May 9 and inaugurated on May 10 as President of the \n     Democratic Republic of South Africa under a Government of \n     National Unity;\n       Whereas President Nelson Mandela led the transition from \n     minority rule and apartheid to multicultural, multiracial \n     democracy, and played a critical role in initiating South \n     Africa's ongoing efforts to foster national reconciliation \n     and end the diverse, deep-rooted, and enduring social, \n     political, and economic inequalities created by apartheid;\n       Whereas President Nelson Mandela sought to promote equal \n     opportunity for jobs and education, access to social \n     services, and quality-of-life improvements for all South \n     Africans;\n       Whereas, during the presidency of Nelson Mandela, South \n     Africa established the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to \n     investigate gross human rights violations committed under the \n     apartheid regime;\n       Whereas Nelson Mandela's decision to step down after one \n     term as South Africa's elected President serves as a \n     commendable example of commitment to democratic principles \n     for elected national leaders in new democracies around the \n     globe;\n       Whereas Nelson Mandela continued his social justice and \n     human rights work upon his retirement in 1999, primarily \n     through the Nelson Mandela Foundation and its two sister \n     organizations, the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund and the \n     Mandela-Rhodes Foundation;\n       Whereas, on July 18, 2007, Nelson Mandela convened the \n     Elders, a group of world leaders including Desmond Tutu, \n     Graca Machel, and former United States President Jimmy \n     Carter, to contribute their wisdom and insight towards \n     addressing some of the world's toughest problems;\n       Whereas the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize was jointly awarded to \n     Nelson Mandela and Frederik Willem de Klerk ``for their work \n     for the peaceful termination of the apartheid regime, and for \n     laying the foundations for a new democratic South Africa'';\n       Whereas Congress contributed to the attainment of the \n     political ideals and goals for which Nelson Mandela \n     struggled, by enacting the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act \n     of 1986 (Public Law 99-440) on October 2, 1986, and has \n     honored Nelson Mandela by passing the Mandela Freedom \n     Resolution in the House of Representatives on September 18, \n     1984 (H. Res. 430, 98th Congress), and in the Senate on \n     October 10, 1984 (S. Res. 386, 98th Congress), by adopting \n     the resolution concerning United States support for the new \n     South Africa on October 5, 1994 (H. Res. 560, 103rd \n     Congress), and by awarding Nelson Mandela the Congressional \n     Gold Medal on July 29, 1998;\n       Whereas former United States President Bill Clinton honored \n     Nelson Mandela with the Philadelphia Liberty Medal in 1993, \n     and former United States President George W. Bush honored \n     Nelson Mandela with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in \n     2002;\n       Whereas, on July 18 of each year, people around the world \n     celebrate Nelson Mandela Day, in recognition of Nelson \n     Mandela's birthday, by devoting their time to community \n     service in honor of his legacy;\n       Whereas, in 1995, Nelson Mandela wrote: ``I have walked \n     that long road to freedom. I have tried not to falter; I have \n     made missteps along the way. But I have discovered the secret \n     that after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there \n     are many more hills to climb. I have taken a moment here to \n     rest, to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds \n     me, to look back on the distance I have come. But I can only \n     rest for a moment, for with freedom come responsibilities, \n     and I dare not linger, for my long walk is not ended.''; and\n       Whereas Nelson Mandela leaves a legacy that transcends his \n     time and place in history, which will guide and inspire \n     generations to come: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the life, accomplishments, and legacy of former \n     South African President Nelson Mandela;\n       (2) extends its heartfelt sympathies and condolences to the \n     members of the family of the late President Nelson Mandela \n     and his fellow citizens;\n       (3) requests the Secretary of State to communicate these \n     expressions of honor and condolence to Nelson Mandela's \n     family and to the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa; \n     and\n       (4) requests the President to identify an appropriate and \n     lasting program of the United States Government to honor \n     Nelson Mandela's legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/11/senate-section/article/S8812-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2546.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto S. Res. 321.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 321) honoring the life, \n     accomplishments, and legacy of Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela and \n     expressing condolences on his passing.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, last week the world lost a true hero \nwith\n\n[[Page S8813]]\n\nthe passing of Nelson Mandela. His determined and courageous advocacy \nhelped end South Africa's disgraceful system of apartheid, while his \nenlightened leadership set an example for national reconciliation.\n  Apartheid was a policy of hate. It was a severe form of segregation \nthat denied the non-White population their basic human rights. Millions \nof non-Whites lost their homes and were forced from their lands.\n  In order to travel or work in a restricted White area, special passes \nwere necessary. Non-Whites could not participate in national government \nand were segregated in almost every way imaginable--from education to \ntransportation to health care.\n  Nelson Mandela dedicated much of his life to ending this injustice. \nAfter years of protesting the harsh policies of the South African \nGovernment, he was imprisoned for 27 years--18 of which were spent at \nthe infamous maximum security prison on Robben Island that was \nsurrounded by shark-infested waters.\n  There he suffered in a cell that he described as ``perpetually damp'' \nand only measured 7 feet by 8 feet.\n  From prison, Nelson Mandela was an inspiration to those fighting \napartheid both inside South Africa and throughout the world. And as \npressure grew, the South African Government initiated secret talks with \nMandela for the first time in 1986.\n  That same year, I was a Member of the House of Representatives when \nCongress voted to impose sanctions against the South Africa \nGovernment--overriding a Presidential veto to do so.\n  Two months before that historic and long overdue vote, the President \ngave a speech opposing comprehensive sanctions against South Africa. \nThat same day, I went to the House floor to respond, asking:\n\n       How many children have to die? How many funeral mourners \n     have to die? How much bloodshed will be spent before the \n     President decides that words are no longer enough--that \n     `constructive engagement' has done nothing to prevent 2,000 \n     deaths since late 1984?\n\n  In that same statement, I spoke about the ``concerned citizens all \nover the country who have emphasized the need to do something specific \nto demonstrate our abhorrence of the policies of the South African \ngovernment.'' Those concerned citizens included the Solano County board \nof supervisors, who sent me a resolution in 1985 that declared, \n``Acquiescence to South Africa's apartheid policy, whatever the \nrationalization would be a rejection of the ultimate sacrifices made by \nthose who died to ensure justice for all human beings . . .''\n  It was the grassroots movement against apartheid in the 1980s that \npushed Congress to enact sanctions, and this grassroots movement was \ninspired by the example of Nelson Mandela.\n  In 1990, Nelson Mandela was finally released from prison, and in 1994 \nhe was elected as South Africa's first Black President.\n  Despite more than 40 years of suffering under the brutality of \napartheid, Nelson Mandela chose reconciliation over resentment.\n  During his inauguration, he declared, ``The time for the healing of \nthe wounds has come . . . the moment to bridge the chasms that divide \nus has come. The time to build is upon us.''\n  The legacy of Nelson Mandela lies not just in his courage to fight \nrepression but in his courage to forgive his enemies.\n  In his words, ``Courageous people do not fear forgiving for the sake \nof peace.''\n  My deepest sympathies go out to Nelson Mandela's family, the nation \nof South Africa, and all those who are mourning the loss of this great \nman.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, last week the world lost a true hero \nwith the passing of Nelson Mandela. His determined and courageous \nadvocacy helped end South Africa's disgraceful system of apartheid, \nwhile his enlightened leadership set an example for national \nreconciliation.\n  Apartheid was a policy of hate. It was a severe form of segregation \nthat denied the non-White population their basic human rights. Millions \nof non-Whites lost their homes and were forced from their lands.\n  In order to travel or work in a restricted White area, special passes \nwere necessary. Non-Whites could not participate in national government \nand were segregated in almost every way imaginable--from education to \ntransportation to health care.\n  Nelson Mandela dedicated much of his life to ending this injustice. \nAfter years of protesting the harsh policies of the South African \nGovernment, he was imprisoned for 27 years--18 of which were spent at \nthe infamous maximum security prison on Robben Island that was \nsurrounded by shark-infested waters.\n  There he suffered in a cell that he described as ``perpetually damp'' \nand only measured 7 feet by 8 feet.\n  From prison, Nelson Mandela was an inspiration to those fighting \napartheid both inside South Africa and throughout the world. And as \npressure grew, the South African Government initiated secret talks with \nMandela for the first time in 1986.\n  That same year, I was a Member of the House of Representatives when \nCongress voted to impose sanctions against the South Africa \nGovernment--overriding a Presidential veto to do so.\n  Two months before that historic and long overdue vote, the President \ngave a speech opposing comprehensive sanctions against South Africa. \nThat same day, I went to the House floor to respond, asking:\n\n       How many children have to die? How many funeral mourners \n     have to die? How much bloodshed will be spent before the \n     President decides that words are no longer enough--that \n     `constructive engagement' has done nothing to prevent 2,000 \n     deaths since late 1984?\n\n  In that same statement, I spoke about the ``concerned citizens all \nover the country who have emphasized the need to do something specific \nto demonstrate our abhorrence of the policies of the South African \ngovernment.''
