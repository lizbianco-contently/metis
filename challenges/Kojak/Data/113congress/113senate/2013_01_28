Mr. President, last week, after the Nation celebrated the \nsecond inauguration of President Obama, I expressed a hope that this \nCongress would be characterized by its commitment to finding common \nground.\n  I am pleased that a bipartisan group of eight Senators--four \nDemocrats and four Republicans--will announce an agreement on a \nframework for comprehensive immigration reform as early as this \nafternoon.\n  No one denies America's immigration system is broken. As I have said, \nthis is one of the most important legislative missions Congress will \nundertake this year. I applaud these eight Senators for setting aside \npartisanship to tackle a crucial issue facing our Nation.\n  This is a positive first step, but the true test of our congressional \nleadership will be to pass a comprehensive bill.\n  As a Senator from Nevada who has for years witnessed firsthand the \ndifficulties our broken immigration system presents for immigrants and \ntheir families, it is very important to me personally that we finally \nresolve this issue. So I pledge that I will do everything in my power \nas the majority leader to get a bill across the finish line. Nothing \nshort of bipartisan success is acceptable to me.\n\n  President Obama has already taken commendable executive action to \nsuspend deportation of outstanding young men and women who were brought \nto this country illegally by their parents. I thank President Obama for \nhis leadership and for making comprehensive immigration reform a top \npriority of his administration.\n  I am also pleased President Obama will present to the Nation his own \nideas to fix the current broken immigration system during a visit to \nLas Vegas tomorrow. With bipartisan support building in both Houses of \nCongress, and a President who is eager to solve this issue, there is no \nreason we should not pass comprehensive immigration reform immediately. \nIt will be good for our economy and good for immigrant families. But \nsuccessful immigration reform cannot be piecemeal, and it must include \na path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million undocumented \nindividuals in our country.\n  Legislators must craft a comprehensive solution that, among other \nthings, continues to secure our borders; punishes unscrupulous \nemployers who exploit immigrants and undercut American wages; improves \nour dysfunctional legal immigration system; and requires the 11 million \npeople who are undocumented to register with the government, pay fines \nand taxes, and go to the back of the line--not to the front of the \nline. They have to learn English, work, pay taxes, and stay out of \ntrouble. Only then they, as I have indicated, get to go to the back of \nthe line. But they do obtain legal status, which is so important.\n  The framework proposed by the bipartisan group of eight Senators \nmeets these criteria. I hope we will soon have a bill to send through \nthe committee process and bring to the floor for a vote.\n  I have long said when my Republican colleagues were truly ready to \ncraft a commonsense legislative solution that was tough, fair, and \npractical, we would stand ready to cooperate. We have been doing this \nalone. It is good to have some friends and partners in this effort.\n  For years Democrats have been eager to pass comprehensive immigration \nreform, but the Republicans have been unwilling to work to find common \nground. I am glad things have changed. I am so happy to see that my \nRepublican colleagues--at least some of them--finally seem ready to \nfind a bipartisan way to correct the flaws in this Nation's immigration \nsystem instead of just complaining that the system is broken.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/28/senate-section/article/S300-2", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, during the next few weeks and months \nCongress and the President will again have an opportunity to \ndemonstrate that we are serious about dealing with deficits and debt by \nreducing spending. We have the debt limit issue coming up, we have the \nsequestration issue coming up by March 2, and we have the continuing \nresolution issue coming up on March 27. So those are three very real \ntimes--and important times--to deal with deficit and spending.\n  The reason we need to address the Federal runaway spending is obvious \nto everybody who has a family budget and wonders why Congress cannot \nlive the same as families live--within our income.\n  The reason we need to address the Federal spending is obvious--\nbecause it is the real driver of our deficits and our debt. Spending is \nthe reason we are up against the $16.4 trillion debt limit. Spending \nwas the reason Congress and President Obama raised the debt ceiling by \n$2.1 trillion just a year and a half ago.\n  In 2006 the junior Senator from Illinois, Mr. Obama, came to the \nfloor and made a very passionate and thoughtful statement here on the \nSenate floor in opposition to raising the debt limit. Many of the \nreasons he gave then are relevant today. In fact, they are even more \nappropriate because the debt is much higher and we have a fiscal mess.\n  It is instructive for my colleagues to hear the words straight from \nthen-Senator Obama. He delivered these remarks on March 16, 2006. At \nthat time, the Senate was debating raising the debt limit by $781 \nbillion to a new limit then that seems very small today--about half of \nwhat it is today--raising the limit in 2006 to $8.9 trillion. So I \nthought it would be worth--for the President's benefit as well as our \nbenefit--going over what then-Senator, now-President Obama had to say, \nso I am going to quote partially from his speech. This is from the 2006 \ndebt ceiling debate:\n\n       The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's \n     debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that \n     the U.S. Government can't pay its own bills. It is a sign \n     that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from \n     foreign countries to finance our Government's reckless fiscal \n     policies.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Over the past 5 years, our federal debt has increased by \n     $3.5 trillion to $8.6 trillion. That is ``trillion'' with a \n     T. That is money that we have borrowed from the Social \n     Security trust fund, borrowed from China and Japan, borrowed \n     from American taxpayers. And over the next 5 years, between \n     now and 2011, the President's budget will increase the debt \n     by almost $3.5 trillion.\n       Numbers that large are sometimes hard to understand. Some \n     people may wonder why they matter. Here is why: This year, \n     the Federal Government will spend $220 billion on interest. \n     That is more money to pay interest on our national debt than \n     we will spend on Medicaid and the State Children's Health \n     Insurance Program. That is more money to pay interest on our \n     debt this year than we will spend on education, homeland \n     security, transportation, veterans benefits combined.\n\n  It is more money in one year than we are likely to spend to rebuild \nthe devastated gulf coast in a way that honors the best of America. And \nthe cost of our debt is one of the fastest growing expenses in the \nFederal budget.\n  Senator Obama went on to say:\n\n       This rising debt is a hidden domestic enemy, robbing our \n     cities and States of critical investment in infrastructure \n     like bridges, ports, levees; robbing our families and our \n     children of critical investments in education, health care \n     reform; robbing our seniors of the retirement and health \n     security they have counted on.\n       Every dollar we pay in interest is a dollar that is not \n     going to investment in America's priorities. Instead, \n     interest payments are a significant tax on all Americans--a \n     debt tax\n\n[[Page S301]]\n\n     that Washington doesn't want to talk about. If Washington \n     were serious about honest tax relief in this country, we \n     would see an effort to reduce our national debt by returning \n     to responsible fiscal policies.\n\n  So what he said in 2006 is still very much true today, only we are in \na worse situation. We are in a situation where he is now President of \nthe United States, and through his leadership, something can be done \nabout it.\n  I wish to continue to quote him by saying--this is what he said in \n2006:\n\n       Our debt also matters internationally. My friend, the \n     ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, likes to \n     remind us that it took 42 Presidents 224 years to run up only \n     $1 trillion of foreign-held debt. This administration did \n     more than that in just 5 years.\n\n  The administration he refers to was the Bush administration at that \ntime, and he was legitimately finding fault with that.\n\n       Now, there is nothing wrong with borrowing from foreign \n     countries. But we must remember that the more we depend on \n     foreign nations to lend us money, the more our economic \n     security is tied to the whims of foreign leaders whose \n     interests might not be aligned with ours.\n       Increasing America's debt weakens us domestically and \n     internationally. Leadership means that ``the buck stops \n     here''. Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad \n     choices today onto the backs of our children and \n     grandchildren.\n       America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. \n     Americans deserve better.\n\n  That is what Senator Obama said in 2006. That pretty much applies \ntoday as well. For these reasons, Senator Obama announced his position \nto oppose the effort to increase America's debt limit in 2006.\n  The national debt today is nearly double what it was in 2006 when \nPresident Obama called it a sign of leadership failure and a hidden \ndomestic enemy. During President Obama's first 4 years, we added $6 \ntrillion to the national debt--more than was added under President \nBush's entire 8 years. Yet, under President Obama's recent budgets, \nhe'd add another $10 trillion to the debt over the next 10 years. That \nis his plan, to add another $10 trillion. Perhaps that is why, when \ngiven a chance, not a single Democrat in the Congress voted in favor of \nPresident Obama's budgets.\n\n  When President Obama announced his vote against that debt limit \nincrease in 2006, if we had a debt problem then and a failure of \nleadership in 2006, what do we have today?\n  Surely President Obama, after 4 years of trillion-dollar deficits \neach year, believes that now is the time to reduce our debt by \nreturning to responsible fiscal policies, as he stated as a Senator. At \nmore than $16 trillion, President Obama must know that our national and \neconomic security are undermined by our dependence on foreign countries \nto lend us money.\n  In the summer of 2008, while on the campaign trail, Senator Obama \nmade this statement when answering a question about deficits and debt. \nThis will be the last quote I give. This is not from the floor of the \nSenate, this is from the campaign trail. He was asked about deficits \nand debt.\n\n       The problem is, is that the way Bush has done it over the \n     last eight years is to take out a credit card from the Bank \n     of China in the name of our children, driving up our national \n     debt from $5 trillion for the first 42 presidents--number 43 \n     added $4 trillion by his lonesome, so that we now have over \n     $9 trillion of debt that we are going to have to pay back--\n     $30,000 for every man, woman and child. That's irresponsible. \n     It's unpatriotic.\n\n  Remember, he made these statements when annual deficits were a couple \nhundred billion dollars per year rather than the $1 trillion-plus \ndeficits of each of the past 4 years. He made these statements when our \nnational debt was $8 to $9 trillion rather than today's $16 trillion. \nThat is close to $50,000 for every man, woman, and child, not the \n$30,000 it was when he spoke to us in 2008.\n  So it is time for the President to acknowledge what he realized in \n2006--that we have a spending problem--when he voted against increasing \nthe debt limit.\n  Earlier this month the President got his campaign wish to raise taxes \non the so-called wealthy, even though it will do next to nothing to \nreduce deficits. But that is done. Now it is time to focus on the real \ndriver of our deficits and debt: runaway Federal spending.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and hopefully with \nPresident Obama over the next few months to finally take action to get \nour fiscal house in order. Leadership means the buck stops with him. It \nis time to stop shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs \nof our children and grandchildren. It is what Americans deserve, and \nwith Presidential leadership, it can be accomplished.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/28/senate-section/article/S301-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, there are many complex issues facing \nCongress at the moment, many of which have vexed us literally for \nyears. But one issue that demands our immediate attention is the \nnational debt because if we do not do something now to rein in our \nNation's out-of-control debt, we may never be able to put America back \non a sustainable fiscal and economic path. If that happens, then many \nof the other issues we face will be largely irrelevant.\n  We need to give this issue everything we have, and we need to start \nright now. We need to devote the same kind of energy to this issue that \nwe devoted to other great national threats in the past. That means \nserious bipartisan negotiation, careful committee consideration, and, \nyes, tough decisions on the kinds of votes that reflect that. This work \nwill take time. That is why I have been urging Senate Democrats to set \nthe legislative gears into motion right away.\n  Last week the House passed a bill that would give us 3 months to work \nout an effective solution to the debt crisis we face. On Wednesday we \nwill take it up here in the Senate. If the House bill passes here and \nis signed into law, the Finance Committee should immediately--\nimmediately--begin laying the foundation for a solution. Negotiations \nshould begin, hearings should be scheduled, and legislation should \nactually be marked up.\n  Three months, as you know, is not very much time in Congress, \nespecially considering the fiscal deadlines we have to address in the \ncoming weeks. Let's use this additional time to develop a plan, a \nserious, effective, bipartisan plan that can put the debt on a downward \ntrajectory. Let's put together a proposal that gives new confidence to \nthe American people in our ability to work together, with an eye toward \nimproving their lives and their prospects rather than our own. That \ngives new confidence to the markets and to the ratings agencies that \nhave warned us against doing anything that doesn't address our long-\nterm problem, which is, of course, Washington spending.\n  I know a number of Democrats view this exercise as little more than \nan opportunity to raise taxes. What I am saying is that they need to \nput their preoccupation with taxes aside and focus on the root problem. \nRaising taxes is something you do when you lack the will or the courage \nto reform a government that has become entirely too expensive.\n  It is time to make some tough decisions for a change, and we will \nonly do it if we get started right now, in a bipartisan fashion, \nthrough the regular order. I know my constituents are tired of seeing \nus careen from one crisis to another around here. Regular order is how \nwe will avoid that. Let's avoid the eleventh-hour deals, and that means \ngetting started right now on a legislative plan that can actually pass.\n  Some pundits claim that Washington is simply incapable of ever \nsolving a challenge as big as this one. They say that our democratic \ninstitutions are broken, that divided government precludes us from \npassing things that matter to the future of our country. I say the \nopposite is true. History shows that divided government offers actually \nthe best opportunity to finally surmount this challenge.\n  The President came to office in his first term with a promise to \nunify our country, to work with Democrats and Republicans to take on \nAmerica's greatest challenges. Unfortunately, his rhetoric was just \nthat. Four years later, polls show we are more divided as a nation than \nwe were when the President first took office.\n\n[[Page S302]]\n\n  As I said last week, I believe the beginning of a second term \nactually presents a real opportunity to change course, to do the work \nso many have refused to do for the past 4 years. This is our chance. \nThis is our chance to prove the pundits wrong and actually get \nsomething accomplished.\n  Let's be clear about something up front: Solving our debt problem \nisn't about austerity, it is about opportunity. It is not about \nausterity, it is about opportunity. It is about creating some space for \nbusinesses to grow and for our rising generation of Americans to feel \nas though they can look to the future with optimism rather than with \ndread. But that only comes after some hard work on the debt is done. \nLet's get to work.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. It seems lately that I come to the floor when the \nRepublican leader is making especially reasonable, sensible proposals. \nI heard him say the same thing last week, and I agree with him.\n  I saw a number of my Democratic friends this weekend in different \nplaces, and I said: Look, the President has been elected. He deserves \ncredit for that, and he now has a chance to define his legacy. He told \nus what that is in his inaugural address. Isn't this the right time to \nget out of the way this difficult problem of dealing with entitlements \nthat every single one of us knows we have to do? Hasn't the House of \nRepresentatives actually given us an unexpected 3 or 4 months in which \nwe can do it?\n  If President Obama wants, as I am sure he must, to begin to work on \nthe other issues he talked about in his inaugural address--immigration, \nfor example, and his other important issues--why would we not go to \nwork right now, as the Republican leader says, and deal with the \nrunaway, out-of-control entitlement spending that is going to bankrupt \nthe program the seniors depend upon to pay their medical bills? We know \nthat is going to happen. The Medicare trustees have said it is going to \nhappen in 12 years, and we have all made speeches saying what we should \ndo with it. Let's just do it. As the Republican leader says, this isn't \nabout austerity.\n  The Australian Foreign Minister came to this country about a month \nago, and in his first address--he is a great friend of America's. He \nsaid the United States of America is one budget agreement away--one \nbudget agreement away--from reasserting its global preeminence. That is \nhis view from Down Under. Looking at Asia, looking at China, looking at \nJapan, he wants us to succeed. He thinks that if we succeed, Australia \nsucceeds. He wants us to get this done.\n  Average families want us to get this done. They don't know why we \ndon't get it done. They understand we can't keep spending money we \ndon't have.\n  We have had recommendations from the President's debt commission, \nfrom the Domenici-Rivlin group, and from the Ryan-Wyden proposal. We \nhave had all of these different ideas. We know exactly what to do, and \nsuddenly we have 3 months to do it. I urge the President to make a \nproposal, show us what to do. There are 40 or 50--there might be 60 or \n70 of us here on both sides of the aisle ready to go the work and to do \nit now.\n  I congratulate the Republican leader for his reasonableness and his \ncomments, and I hope he continues to offer this. I might say, without \ntrying to embarrass him, that every time we have had a crisis we need \nto solve, it has been the Republican leader and the White House that \nhave gotten it done. So why don't they try again? Why don't they try \nagain? That is my wish.\n  I came here to talk about something else today, but I am glad I was \nhere to hear that, and I congratulate the Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. As we have discussed before, and I think it is worth \nrepeating, divided government is actually the best time to do difficult \nthings. We have had four excellent examples in the last 25 years: \nRonald Reagan and Tip O'Neill raised the age of Social Security, which \nsaved that important program for another generation. Ronald Reagan and \nTip O'Neill did the last comprehensive tax reform. Bill Clinton and the \nRepublicans did welfare reform and actually balanced the budgets, \nbelieve it or not, in the late 1990s.\n  There is ample evidence that divided government is the best time to \ndo really difficult things. When you join hands and do it, the American \npeople understand that surely it must have been something we needed to \ndo because these guys actually were able to agree on it.\n  I hope we won't miss another opportunity. Sometimes I think we are a \nlittle bit like the early Israeli Foreign Minister, Abba Eban, who said \nof the Palestinians that they ``never miss an opportunity to miss an \nopportunity.'' It appears as if we have rarely missed an opportunity to \nmiss an opportunity. Hopefully, we won't miss this one as well.\n  I thank my friend from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Kentucky.\n  As we spoke on the floor, another example is President Johnson and \nEverett Dirksen on civil rights. That would not have happened if the \ngovernment hadn't been divided, and it wouldn't have been as easily \naccepted by the American people if it had not been divided.\n  If the Republicans and the Democrats--if this Democratic President \nand this mixture of Republicans and Democrats in Congress say to the \nAmerican people: We have a real fiscal cliff for you; all the programs \nyou depend upon to pay your medical bills aren't going to have enough \nmoney to pay them, and we are going to have to make some changes to \ndeal with that, people will accept that, especially if it comes from \nboth of us.\n  As far as who is supposed to propose it, well, Senator Corker and I \nhave proposed it. We proposed what to do, but we are not President. We \nare not President. I don't know what the experience of the Governor of \nVirginia was, but if in Tennessee I had waited around for the \nlegislature to come up with a road program, we would still be driving \non dirt roads.\n  The President has to lay it out there and say: Let's do it this way. \nThen the legislators, all 535 of us, will say: No, Mr. President, we \ncouldn't possibly do it that way. Let's do it a little bit differently, \nand we will come to a result. That is the way our system works. We have \n3 months to do it, and I hope the Republican leader will continue to \nmake his point.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/28/senate-section/article/S302-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S302-S304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RECESS APPOINTMENTS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, last Friday a three-judge Federal \nappellate court made an important decision. It said that the President \nof the United States, President Obama, on January 4, 2012, made some \nrecess appointments when the Senate wasn't in recess. In other words, \nthey were constitutionally invalid.\n  The President made four appointments on January 4, 2012--three to the \nNational Labor Relations Board and one to the consumer finance agency. \nHe did it under his so-called recess appointment authority, which is \ndefined in article II of the Constitution.\n  But the Court said: No, Mr. President. The Senate wasn't in recess. \nThe only time you can make those appointments is between the annual \nsessions of Congress, and the Constitution also says that those \nvacancies to which you appoint have to happen during that recess.\n  The Chairman of the National Labor Relations Board made a remarkable \nresponse to the order of the Court. The order of the Court, by the way, \nvacated an important decision the Board made and said the two remaining \nNLRB members who are still on the Board are unconstitutionally there, \nso they vacated the order. Instead of recognizing the authority of the \nCourt, the NLRB Chairman said, in effect: I am going to hang up a sign \nthat says ``Open for business. We have important work to do.'' And they \nare going to keep going despite the fact that the NLRB has made 219 \ndecisions with these two unconstitutionally appointed members since the \nmonth of January 2012, all of which, I would say, are invalid because \nthe members who voted on the decisions were unconstitutionally \nappointed.\n  I am here today to call for Sharon Block and Richard Griffin--the two\n\n[[Page S303]]\n\nmembers of the National Labor Relations Board who were \nunconstitutionally appointed by the President according to the Federal \nappellate court--calling on them to resign their positions and calling \non the President of the United States to nominate a full slate of \nmembers to the National Labor Relations Board, and then let's do what \nthe Constitution says we are supposed to do.\n  The best known authority of this body, the Senate, is likely to be \nthe advice and consent provisions of the Constitution. Article II, \nsection 2: With the advice and consent of the Senate, the President \nshall appoint Ambassadors and others. There are about 1,100 of those \nwhom the President appoints.\n  Two years ago and then just last week, we streamlined the \nconfirmation process a little bit to narrow the focus on the most \nimportant appointees and make it easier to get them confirmed. Those \nare the checks and balances the Constitution meant to establish. They \ndid that so we would have liberty from a tyrannical executive branch, \nwhich is what the Founders were worried about. The Court has said the \nPresident has exceeded that. Therefore, these two remaining members of \nthe NLRB should resign immediately and pack their bags and go home with \nour thanks for their hard work, despite the fact that the 219 cases \nthey voted on ought to be vacated and probably will be when someone \nchallenges those cases.\n  A new sign needs to go up at the National Labor Relations Board. Take \ndown the sign that says ``Open for business'' and put up a sign that \nsays ``Help wanted. Nominations accepted.''\n  The three-judge court of appeals did an interesting thing: They \nactually read the Constitution in its plain English. Here is what the \nConstitution says:\n\n       The President shall have power to fill up all Vacancies \n     that may happen during the Recess of the Senate.\n\n  Now, what is the recess of the Senate? Well, let's go back to the \nbeginning of our country and for many years thereafter.\n  Sam Houston, Senator Sam Houston of Texas, had to go from Texas to \nNew Orleans, get on a boat, come up the Mississippi River, and then \nride a horse and take a stagecoach to get here. It took him weeks--same \nto go home.\n  James K. Polk of Tennessee, Speaker of the House, would take a \nstagecoach up to Pennsylvania and then follow the road or go on the \nriver up to Pennsylvania and follow the road to the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  At one time, President Polk, after he became the President, had a \nvacancy in the Attorney General's Office, and he wrote to some person \nup in New Hampshire and asked him to take the job. It took 2 or 3 weeks \nto receive the letter, and it took 2 or 3 weeks to get the answer, and \nthe answer was no.\n  In those days, there were long, extended periods in this country \nbetween the annual sessions of the Congress, when the Members of \nCongress were spread all over the country. The Founders anticipated \nthat, and they wisely put into the Constitution a provision that said \nthat during those times, the President may make a recess appointment \nwhile the Senate is in recess. And that person may hold the position \nuntil the end of the session.\n\n  Well, over the years, that has changed. Various Presidents have tried \nvarious ways to fill vacancies during a recess, and that has become \nsomething different in the last while. This hasn't been just Democratic \nPresidents who have done it. Presidents have become frustrated because \nsometimes Senators don't give their advice and consent. I know about \nthat; I was nominated by President Bush the first to be the Education \nSecretary, and the Senator from Ohio at the time thought I needed a \nlittle examination and held me up for 3 months. Finally, the Senate \nagreed to my confirmation unanimously.\n  But that is what we are for. We are supposed to consider the \nPresident's nomination of Senator Kerry to be Secretary of State, as we \nare. We are supposed to consider the nomination of Senator Hagel as \nSecretary of Defense. And according to the law, we are supposed to \nconsider the President's nominees for the very important National Labor \nRelations Board. But what the President did was to make three \nappointments to the Board the day after we went into our annual \nsession. We went into session on January 3, 2012, and he made these \nappointments on January 4.\n  The court said the Senate was clearly in session--clearly in session. \nSo if the President disagrees with the Senate, if he is afraid he is \nabout to nominate somebody who the Senate won't like, well, then, he \nhad better get somebody the Senate will approve or else he is not going \nto get that nominee. But the President said: No, I am going to do it my \nway, so I will try to change this recess appointment and do it in a way \nthat is more extreme than has ever been done before.\n  I want to hasten to add there is no excuse here that if the President \nhadn't acted in this way the Senate might have held up the nomination \nfor too long. Of course, the Senate has that right, if it chooses to do \nso. But in this case the nominations only arrived 3 weeks before the \nPresident made his appointments. So we have a straight-out set of facts \nhere, says the court. According to the Constitution, valid appointments \nmay only be made during the recess between annual sessions of Congress, \nand these were not. Secondly, it may only be made to a vacancy that \noccurred during the recess, and two of the three vacancies which we are \ntalking about occurred months before the recess.\n  The Chairman of the National Labor Relations Board effectively says \n``open for business.'' In fact, the board should not be open for \nbusiness, because the board only has one member who has been \nconstitutionally appointed and confirmed, unanimously by the Senate. So \nthe board, without a full quorum of three members, which it does not \nhave--two are unconstitutionally appointed--can't issue regulations and \ncan't decide cases, including appeals of decisions of unfair labor \npractices.\n  Let me give an example that might affect the State of Tennessee. We \nwere very concerned last year--I was; Tennesseans were--when a \ncomplaint began to make its way through the National Labor Relations \nBoard affecting the Boeing Company and its decision to put a plant in \nSouth Carolina. In other words, Boeing, from a State that does not have \na right-to-work law, wanted to put a new plant in a State that does \nhave a right-to-work law, and a complaint was filed, which, on the face \nof it, made it look like as if, in trying to do that, it is prima facie \nevidence they were violating national labor laws. That is a very \nexpensive delay for the Boeing Company--or any company. Well, that \neventually got settled after a lot of expense.\n  But let's say we have a small supplier in the State of Illinois, \nwhich is not a right-to-work State, that might want to work in \nTennessee or Virginia, which are, and someone files a complaint. Do we \nwant a board there that is unconstitutionally placed that might rule \nthat is a prima facie violation of Federal law? To have members of the \nNLRB who are not confirmed by the U.S. Senate raises the prospect that \nwould undermine the right-to-work law in Tennessee and Virginia and all \nthe other States that have chosen to have one.\n  So this has very practical, everyday application in the State of \nTennessee.\n  But even though the board can't issue regulations or decide cases, \nthe rest of the NLRB can be open for business while the President makes \nnominations and the Senate considers those nominations under regular \norder. For example, the NLRB could conduct elections, it could \ninvestigate allegations of unfair labor practices, it could issue a \ncomplaint, administrative law judges could hold hearings, regional \ndirectors can settle cases, the general counsel may seek to enforce \norders, and the general counsel could issue enforcement guidance \nmemoranda.\n  They are all open for business, but the National Labor Relations \nBoard is not open for business. Its ``open for business'' sign needs to \ncome down, and a new one needs to go up that says: Help wanted. \nNominations accepted.\n  Finally, there is a larger issue here. At the beginning of last year, \nI visited Mount Vernon. I mentioned it in the 2 minutes I had at the \nPresident's inaugural last week, because it made such an impression on \nme. I was reminded that the American Revolution was about tyranny by a \nking. That was the danger. That was what caused people to sacrifice \ntheir lives.\n\n  I saw in the National Archives this weekend the oath of allegiance \nsigned\n\n[[Page S304]]\n\nby George Washington and his troops, which swore allegiance to a \ncountry that was not even formed yet--an allegiance that would have \ncaused him to be executed if we had lost the American Revolution. So \nthere was a lot at stake when our country was founded, and so much of \nit was about liberty and about an ability to resist a king or an \nimperial leader.\n  George Washington himself imposed his own character upon the American \ncharacter by his modesty and restraint, by his decision to step down as \ngeneral of the American army. He could have been general for the rest \nof his life. He made the decision to step down as President of the \nUnited States after two terms. He could have been President for the \nrest of his life. But at the beginning of our country, liberty, to many \npeople, meant avoiding an executive that was too strong, that didn't \nhave proper checks and balances. And our Founders put into our \nConstitution checks and balances with the court and with the \nlegislature.\n  Of course, as we like to point out, article 1 is about the Congress, \nabout the legislature. And as I said earlier, perhaps the best known \nfunction the Senate has is the ability to advise and consent. The \nPresident may nominate, but those important people--men and women--may \nnot take their offices until they have been confirmed by the Senate.\n  This administration, I am sorry to say, has not respected those \nchecks and balances, as I had hoped it would. I would suggest maybe a \nretreat to Mount Vernon for President Obama and the White House staff. \nThe Obama administration has appointed more czars than the Romanovs. We \nhave always had some czars, such as the drug czars, but they have three \ndozen--three dozen who aren't subject to the usual restrictions that we \nhave through the appropriations process.\n  The most blatant example of the imperial Presidency are the recess \nappointments at a time when the Senate, according to this court, was \nnot in recess, in order to put into those positions men and women with \nwhom the Senate would not agree. If the President could do what the \nPresident did on January 4, 2012, on a regular basis, we might take a \nrecess break for lunch and come back and find we have a new Supreme \nCourt Justice.\n  I am here to suggest the right thing to do would be to respect the \ntradition of checks and balances that is built into our Constitution. \nIt is at work here, because the President took an action, we didn't \nlike it, and the third branch of government has made a decision the \nPresident was wrong. The way to go forward is for the two remaining \nmembers of the National Labor Relations Board who were appointed \nunconstitutionally to resign their position and for the President to \nnominate as rapidly as he can men or women to fill the remaining \nvacancies on the board. And to the extent the committee on which I am \nthe ranking Republican, which oversees labor matters, has anything to \ndo with that, I will pledge speedy consideration of those nominees.\n  Let's get the National Labor Relations Board back in business. But it \ncannot be open for business today. It cannot be properly open for \nbusiness today. Those two members should resign their positions and \nrecognize the court has said we still have in America a Constitution \nthat provides checks and balances. So take down the sign that says: \nOpen for business, and put up the sign that says: Help wanted. \nNominations accepted.\n  Mr. President, I commend my colleagues to read my floor remarks of \nFebruary 2, 2012, about recess appointments, which I made following the \nPresident's so-called recess appointments and following my visit to \nMount Vernon.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we are now entering a postfiscal cliff \nphase of budget negotiations, and a troubling but familiar refrain is \nalready beginning to echo through this Chamber which goes something \nlike this: In order to fix our deficit, we must cut Medicare and \nMedicaid benefits. This is wrong. This is flatout wrong and it is \nfactually wrong.\n  A recent Providence Journal editorial touched on the dangers of that \nmisguided approach. The editorial read: We need a better run Medicare \nand Medicaid, not one that covers fewer people. Quality can be improved \nand costs contained without throwing people off the rolls and into the \nstreets and back into the free care of emergency rooms mandated for the \nuninsured and into expensive private insurance. In the end, we all pay \nin some way, in quality of life and in money, for the gaps we tolerate \nin our health care system.\n  Attacking Medicare and Medicaid is consistent with a particular \npolitical ideology--it has been part of that political ideology for \ndecades now--but it is not consistent with the facts. It ignores the \nfact that our health care spending problem is systemwide, not just in \nFederal programs. It ignores the fact that we operate in this country a \nwildly inefficient health care system. It is not just Medicare.\n  For example, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said, in reference to \nthe defense budgets: We are being eaten alive by health care.\n  New data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services shows \nour national health care spending increased to $2.7 trillion in 2011, \nwhich is about 18 percent of America's gross domestic product. This is \nmore than three times what it was in 1992, and it is about 100 times \nwhat it was back in 1960. The Presiding Officer, the new Senator from \nVirginia, and I were probably around in 1960. So in our lifetime it has \ngone up 100 times.\n  At this rate, by 2020, $1 out of every $5 in this country will go \ntoward health care. This is a rocketing pace of increase.\n  In 1979, the year after I graduated from college, $221 billion; 1987, \n$519 billion; 1992, $857 billion; and now $2.7 trillion. Anybody \nlooking at that graph of our exploding national health care costs who \ncan think that Medicare is the problem simply does not have a grasp of \nthe facts.\n  Let's compare U.S. spending to other developed countries. This is us, \n``pre'' the last report when we were still at 17.6 percent of GDP. The \nnext least efficient developed country is the Netherlands at 12 percent \nof GDP in 2010. Germany and France were at 11.6 percent of GDP.\n  This margin right here is the margin by which we are more inefficient \nthan the least efficient of our industrialized competitors--$800 \nbillion a year. We could save $800 billion a year on our national \nhealth care system just by becoming as efficient as the least efficient \nof our national competitors.\n  For all of this extra spending, the extra $800 billion a year, one \nmight expect that we would have paid for and earned longer and \nhealthier lives, but that is not the case. Our National Institute of \nMedicine recently compared the United States to 17 peer countries. We \nwere worst for prevalence of diabetes among adults among those 17 \ncountries, worst for obesity across all age groups of those 17 \ncountries, and had the worst infant mortality of all 17 countries. We \nsuffer higher death rates and worse outcomes for conditions such as \nheart disease and chronic lung disease.\n  This chart from that National Institute of Medicine report shows all \nthese dots of the other countries grouped around cost--expenditure per \ncapita--and life expectancy. That is the United States of America, the \ndot with the red circle around it. We are an outlier, below virtually \nall of these countries\n\n[[Page S305]]\n\nexcept Poland and Turkey and Hungary, below them all on life \nexpectancy. They are all above 78 and we are just below it, and we are \nwildly out of the grouping on cost. We are at way higher cost than the \ngrouping of all of our industrialized competitors. We are wild outliers \nin a very bad direction of high cost and poor outcomes. This is a stark \nand unsettling disparity of us from virtually all the other nations. It \nis not to our benefit.\n  The real issue is the fact that we have to deal with the cost and the \nperformance of our health care system. Another fact that I know the \nPresiding Officer is well aware of is how hard this is on American \nfamilies. From 2000 to 2009 the average family premium for health \ninsurance more than doubled from around $6,500 to more than $13,000. I \ncan assure you the average family income did not double during that \nsame period, unless maybe you were an average family on Wall Street.\n  Health care costs are a leading cause of family bankruptcy in this \ncountry. Thankfully, the Affordable Care Act will help millions of \nuninsured Americans purchase health coverage. But we should add, in \naddition to the kneejerk reaction to target Medicare and Medicaid being \nout of step with these facts, it will also hurt these families more \nwithout grappling with the real health care system cost problem.\n  Again, going after Medicare is wrong. It is a misdiagnosis of the \nproblem, and, of course, when you miss the diagnosis you prescribe the \nwrong cure.\n  Medicare is actually one of the most efficient parts of our \ninefficient health care system. From 2007 to 2011, for the same set of \nhealth benefits, the annual growth rate in health spending per Medicare \nenrollee was 2.8 percent; for private plans, 5.6 percent, twice as \nmuch, a 100-percent higher cost than for Medicare.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has found that for every dollar we \nspend on Medicare, 98 cents of it goes through to people in the form of \nhealth care, actual health care. Spend $1, get 98 cents' worth of \nhealth care. For Medicare Advantage that the private insurance sector \nruns that operates under similar rules and treats the same population \nas Medicare, every $1 delivers only 89 cents in health care, with the \nrest spent on administrative cost and CEO salaries and marketing. So \nnot only is Medicare not the problem, it is actually one of the best \nways we have for delivering health care through this wildly inefficient \noutlier of a health care system.\n  I am not alone in saying that a correct diagnosis of the problem will \nlead us to health care system reform, not Medicare benefit cuts. Gail \nWilensky, the former CMS Administrator under President George H.W. \nBush, said in 2011:\n\n       If we don't redesign what we are doing, we can't just cut \n     unit reimbursement and think we are somehow getting a better \n     system.\n\n  A lot of my colleagues give great credence to the private sector. In \nthe private sector, one of the leaders in health care is George \nHalvorson, who recently stepped down as chairman and CEO of Kaiser \nPermanente, one of the biggest and best health care companies in the \ncountry. Here is what he said:\n\n       There are people right now who want to cut benefits and \n     ration care and have that be the avenue to cost reduction in \n     this country and that's wrong. It's so wrong, it's almost \n     criminal. It's an inept way of thinking about health care.\n\n  So from Republican administrators to private sector leaders, the \nmessage is the same: We have to solve this as a system problem.\n  Let me give a couple of examples of how we might want to go about \ndoing this. As one example of the significant savings to be found in \nour health care system, a Washington Post columnist recently wrote:\n\n       Few people realize that Medicare spends wildly different \n     amounts per senior depending on where the senior happens to \n     live. . . . Medicare spends 2.5 times more per senior in \n     Miami than in Minneapolis.\n\n  I repeat, 2\\1/2\\ times more per senior in Miami than in Minneapolis--\n\n       Yet there is no difference in quality or health outcomes \n     associated with this extra spending. In other words, Medicare \n     redistributes billions from regions where doctors practice \n     cost effectively to regions where the local Medical \n     Industrial Complex pads its income with excess services and \n     procedures.\n\n  Our colleague, Senator Franken, often says: If we could just deliver \nhealth care the way we do in Minnesota, we could solve our problem. And \nthis column and this information bears it out. If they are not getting \nbetter health care in Miami, then why do we tolerate letting Miami \nabsorb 2.5 times the cost per senior than they are able to provide it \nfor in Minneapolis? We should be driving Miami toward Minneapolis, \nwhere we know they can do it in Minneapolis. Make that the model and \nforce the change.\n  This graph uses data from the Dartmouth Atlas Project to illustrate \nthis point. Not only is there significant variation in health care cost \nand quality--each of these dots is a State, and they are rated on \noverall quality and spending per beneficiary. As we can see, they \nspread out from very high cost and very poor quality States, such as \nLouisiana, to very low cost and very high quality States, such as New \nHampshire. But if we draw a statistical line through this array of \ndots, here is the line we get. It shows the reverse correlation: The \nmore you spend the worse your care.\n  A second example, and it is consistent with this, is how poorly our \nhealth care system performs on basic measures of quality and safety and \nprevention. For example, according to the news magazine ``The Week,'' \navoidable infections passed on due to poor hospital hygiene kill as \nmany people in the United States--about 103,000 people killed every \nyear--as are killed by AIDS, breast cancer, and auto accidents \ncombined. We are killing more people in this country through hospital-\nacquired infection than through AIDS, breast cancer, and auto accidents \ncombined. These deaths are tragic to those families, but they are \ntragic in another sense because they are preventable.\n  As we have shown, in Rhode Island, when hospital staff follow a \nchecklist of basic instructions--washing hands with soap, cleaning the \npatient's skin with antiseptic, placing sterile drapes widely over the \npatient--rates of infection plummet and the costs of treating those \ninfections disappear. The costs of treating the 100,000 Americans who \ndie every year from those hospital-acquired infections are huge, and \nthey would disappear if we do not have the infections in the first \nplace and the cost of treating the hundreds of thousands who get those \ninfections and do not die, who are not among the 103,000 who die but \nnevertheless have to be treated, those costs also disappear. It is a \npretty big number. We don't know exactly what it is, but the Center for \nDisease Prevention reported that from 2001 to 2009, there were State \nand Federal efforts to improve these efforts to prevent hospital-\nacquired infections, and that contributed to a 58-percent decrease in \nthe number of central line bloodstream infections among intensive care \nunit patients. That, in turn, represents up to 27,000 saved and \napproximately $1.8 billion in cost savings to our health care system. \nLet's do more of that before we go after Medicare benefits.\n  A third example is managing and preventing chronic disease. Compare \nthe United States to France on the treatment of lung disease and you \nwill find that although France has more smokers and therefore higher \nrates of lung disease than the United States, levels of severity and \nfatality are three times lower in France. France spends eight times \nless on treatment per person than we do.\n  Compare the United States to Britain on diabetes. You will find that \nBritain spent only half of what we spend per person on diabetes, but it \nis five times more productive in managing diabetes than we are.\n  Dr. Daniel Vasella, who is the chairman of Novartis, explains that \n``in America, no one has incentives to make quality and cost-effective \noutcomes the goal.''\n  France and Britain give their health care providers incentives to \nfocus on early detection and cost-effective treatment that make \nwellness the goal, not treatment. To paraphrase George Washington \nUniversity Professor Thomas J. Schoenbaum: ``Make virtue profitable and \neveryone's a saint.''\n  Saving money by reforming how we deliver health care is not just \npossible, it is happening. A 2008 report from the Dartmough Atlas \nProject predicted that ``using the Mayo Clinic as a benchmark, the \nnation could reduce health care spending by as much as 30 percent for \nacute and chronic illnesses.'' A benchmark based on Intermountain \nHealthcare, which is a great\n\n[[Page S306]]\n\nprovider based in Utah, predicts a reduction of more than 40 percent. \nSo we are doing it; it is happening. We just need to spread it more \nwidely. During a 2011 Senate HELP hearing that I chaired, Greg Poulsen \nof Intermountain Healthcare said:\n\n       Intermountain and other organizations have shown that \n     improving quality is compatible with lowering costs and, \n     indeed, high-quality care is generally less expensive than \n     substandard care.\n\n  Take a look at what various experts estimate as the potential annual \nsavings that could be found in our health care system. The President's \nCouncil of Economic Advisers says that we could annually save $700 \nbillion a year. The National Institute of Medicine recently reported \nthat we could save $750 billion a year. The New England Healthcare \nInstitute has estimated that a savings of $850 billion a year is \npossible, and the Lewin Group--a private group that focuses extensively \non health care and does research and analysis--together with George \nBush's Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, have come up with an estimate \nof $1 trillion a year. We don't know what the exact number is. These \nare estimates, but for sure there is a huge potential for savings in \nour health care system.\n  These savings flow through to our Federal budget. The Federal \nGovernment does 40 percent of America's health care spending. If the \nestimate by the Council of Economic Advisers is correct, the national \nhealth care expenditure is $2.7 trillion, Federal health care spending \nis $1.1 trillion. After we do the math, it is 40 percent.\n  Of the four estimates, let's take the most conservative one. Let's \ntake the Council of Economic Advisers' estimate of $700 billion--the \nlowest of the four--and multiply it by 40 percent. The Federal share \nwould be $280 billion per year for the Federal Government. It would be \n$280 billion per year just by getting those kinds of savings.\n  Let's say we cannot get the $700 billion, that it is too hard to \nlift; we tried and cannot get there. Let's say we can only get half of \nthose estimated savings. That is $350 billion times 40 percent. We \ncould set a target of $140 billion of savings in the Federal budget in \nhealth care having assumed a 50-percent failure rate in getting there \nfrom the lowest of the four major estimates. That is pretty \nconservative to start from the lowest of the four major estimates, \nassume a 50-percent failure rate, and there we are, we still get $140 \nbillion a year we could target as savings coming back into the Federal \nbudget and the Federal health care system.\n  Let's say we set the target at $350 billion, the halfway target, and \nwe failed at meeting even that target. Let's say we failed again by \nhalf, which is not close. That is a huge miss. Let's say the best we \ncould do is to get $175 billion of the $700 billion in savings, which \nwas the most conservative of those four estimates. If we multiply that \nby 40 percent, guess what. That is $70 billion a year.\n  What do we do when we get into budget discussions? We multiply by 10 \nbecause it is a 10-year budget estimate. If we are going to take that \n$70 billion and move into a budget discussion, it becomes $700 billion. \nSo this is real money.\n  Let me add that most recently the Commonwealth Fund released a report \nthat outlines a set of distinct policies that would accelerate health \ncare delivery system reform and slow health spending by $2 trillion \nover 10 years. So that is not just $700 billion but $2 trillion over 10 \nyears, from 2014 to 2023.\n  How do we get there? Well, many of the tools necessary to drive down \ncosts and improve the quality of patient care are already in the law. \nThe Affordable Care Act, the famous ObamaCare, included 45 provisions \nwhich have virtually never been discussed on this Senate floor--because \nthey were not controversial--that were dedicated to redesigning how \nhealth care is delivered. These delivery system reforms cover five \npriority areas: payment reform, making sure that people are paid to \nkeep us well and not wait until we get sick and have to treat us more; \nprimary and preventive care, making sure we are taking care of chronic \npatients, less specialists, more care upfront; measuring and reporting \nquality so we are not dealing with the hospital-acquired infections so \nmuch; administrative simplification because for doctors it is a bear to \ntry to keep up with the insurance companies that try to continue to \ndeny them payment; and health information technology so we have an \nelectronic health record that loads with data and is sensible and state \nof the art.\n  These Affordable Care Act delivery system reforms span our health \ncare system and engage all stakeholders in the effort--for example, \npatients, physicians, hospitals, State governments, and the Federal \nGovernment--which is good because working together is the right way to \nachieve these reforms.\n  There is even evidence that the Affordable Care Act is already \nworking to slow the growth of health care spending. In a Washington \nPost op-ed this summer, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen \nSebelius wrote:\n\n       In the decade before the law passed, national health \n     expenditures increased about 7 percent a year. But in the \n     past two years, those increases have dropped to less than 4 \n     percent per year.\n\n  At the top of this graph, it is actually starting to tip down a \nlittle bit, thanks to that. Dropping it to less than 4 percent per year \nhas saved Americans more than $220 billion.\n  Peter Orszag, the former Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget, said the same thing in a recent Providence Journal editorial. \nHe said----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator needs to begin to wrap \nup.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 2 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I know the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama is waiting and I will wrap up.\n  Peter Orszag wrote in the Providence Journal:\n\n       In January 2009, [CMS] projected that expenditures would \n     reach 19.8 percent of gross domestic product in 2017. This \n     year, the projection for 2017 is down to 18.4 percent of GDP. \n     That difference amounts to a whopping $280 billion. In other \n     words, relative to the projections issued three years \n     earlier, today's forecasts suggest health savings of $3,500 \n     per family of four by 2017.\n\n  I did this report for the Senate HELP Committee last year on the \nAffordable Care Act delivery system reform provisions. Anybody who is \nwatching and wants a copy, contact my office; we will mail or e-mail it \nto you.\n\n  In the report we found that the administration has made fairly \nconsiderable progress on the 45 delivery system reform provisions in \nthe law, but much more can and must be done. Specifically, the report \ncalls upon the Obama administration to set a cost savings target for \nhealth care delivery system reform. A cost savings target will focus \nand guide and spur the administration's efforts in a manner that vague \nintentions to bend the health care cost curve will not. It would also \nprovide a measurable goal by which we can evaluate the progress of the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  In a report I mentioned earlier, the Commonwealth Fund has reported \nthat ``the establishment of targets . . . can serve both as a metric to \nguide policy development and as an incentive for all involved parties \nto act to make them effective.''\n  One of the best examples of a clear target was President Kennedy \ndeclaring that within 10 years the U.S. Government would put a man \nsafely on the Moon and bring him home. That message and the mission \nthat was outlined were clear. The result was a mobilization of private \nand public resources to achieve that purpose because the goal was clear \nand specific.\n  This administration has a similar opportunity, particularly now at \nthe height of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act: Set a \nserious cost savings target for our Nation's health care system--none \nof this spongy bending the health care cost curve stuff--and put the \nfull force of American innovation and ingenuity into achieving that \ntarget. That approach has a triple benefit: protecting Medicare and \nMedicaid benefits that don't need to be cut if we are doing this right; \nsecond, improving patient outcomes, making people healthier; and third, \ndialing back health care spending by potentially hundreds and hundreds \nof billions of dollars. The alternatives to that will harm seniors and \nthose least able to afford adequate health care.\n\n[[Page S307]]\n\n  I conclude by urging the administration to set a real cost savings \ntarget with a number and a date, and then let's get to work to give the \nAmerican families the health care system they deserve. Instead of waste \nand inefficiency and being a disgraceful outlier from all the rest of \nthe world on quality and cost, let's make for America the health care \nsystem that is the envy of the world. That should be our goal and that \ncould be our destiny.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  I express my appreciation to the distinguished Senator from Alabama \nfor his patience during my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/28/senate-section/article/S307-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S307-S311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I know there is a group of Senators who \nannounced today that they have ideas, a plan, an outline, and a \nframework for a new comprehensive immigration bill. Indeed, the fact \nthat our current immigration system is not working effectively and is \nfailing on a daily basis cannot be denied. It certainly needs to be \nfixed. It is a challenge for us to do so and it will not be easy. I \nwant to warn my colleagues that a framework is not a bill.\n  In 2006 and 2007, with the full support of the Republican President \nof the United States, a bipartisan group announced with great \nconfidence that they had a plan that was going to fix our immigration \nsystem and we were all going to just line up and vote for it. The \nmasters of the universe had decided, met in secret, had all the special \ninterest groups gathered and worked out a plan that was going to change \nour immigration system for the better, and we should all be most \ngrateful.\n  It came up in 2006, and it did not pass. It came back again in 2007 \nwith even more emphasis, and it failed colossally. It failed because it \ndid not do what they said it would do. It did not end the illegality, \nit did not set forth a proper principle of immigration for America, and \nit did not sufficiently alter the nature of our immigration system to \nadvance the national interest of the United States. It did not, and \nthat is why it didn't pass. They had all the powerful forces, including \nthe TV and newspaper guys, the Wall Street guys, the agriculture guys, \nthe civil rights group, La Raza, and the politicians. But the American \npeople said no. It was a challenge, and there was a long debate, but it \ndidn't pass. I thought the lesson learned from that was there needs to \nbe a demonstration that the law is being enforced, end the illegality, \nand then we can wrestle with how to compassionately treat people who \nhave been in America a long time. I thought that was kind of what we \nhad decided.\n  Now my colleagues say: Don't worry, this is going to be a better \npiece of legislation that can work for us. I hope that is true. We do \nneed to fix the immigration system. There are things we can do on a \nbipartisan, nonpartisan basis which would make our country's \nimmigration policy better and more effective, and I hope that is what \nwill result from this.\n  But no one should expect that Members of the Senate are just going to \nrubberstamp what a group of Members have decided. We are not going to \njust rubberstamp what the President of the United States has just \ndecided because we need to analyze it. Each one of us, every Member of \nthis Senate has a responsibility, a firm duty to evaluate this proposal \nto ensure that it enhances our ability as a nation to do the right \nthing.\n  We are a nation of immigrants, and we are going to continue to be a \nnation of immigrants. We admit over 1 million people into our country \nevery single year legally. But now we are told that after 1986, when \nthey had that immigration bill, that amnesty bill, that we have allowed \n11 million more people, give or take a few million, into the country \nillegally. They have entered the country illegally. In 1986 Congress \npromised the American people that if they would give amnesty to the \npeople who were here and who entered illegally, they would stop illegal \nimmigration in the future and we wouldn't face this challenge again. In \nfact, our colleagues basically said that in their piece they put out \npromoting the bill: We are never going to have to worry about \nimmigration again if Members pass our legislation. That was the promise \nmade in 1986 when the bill did pass, but it did not fulfill its \npromise.\n  So once again I think we are in a situation where the promise will be \nmade that people will be given immediate regularized status and they \nwon't be given full rights of citizenship until certain laws are \nenforced, and don't worry about it--it is all going to work out \nsometime off in the distant future. But questions do need to be asked, \nand we will ask those questions, and it will be important for us to do \nthe right thing.\n  I know there are people who like low wages. I know there are people \nwho believe that it is hard to get Americans to do certain jobs and \nthat we can use immigrants and they will do those jobs at less pay and \nask fewer questions and demand fewer benefits. I know that is out \nthere. We have talked about that in the past. I am hoping this \nlegislation is not designed for the special interests but designed to \nadvance American interests.\n  What are some of the principles I think need to be in this system? I \nlike Canada's system of immigration. It seems to work very well. They \nask a number of questions. They give points when one applies to come \ninto Canada, and a person gets more points for meeting the goals they \nhave. One of the goals they have is that the potential immigrant speak \nthe language. In Canada, they have two--French and English. If a person \nspeaks French or English, they get more points or maybe they don't even \nget in if they don't have some grasp of the language before they come \nin on a permanent basis. Then they give more points, more preference to \npeople with education, skills they need in Canada.\n  This proposal suggests it does that. It should do that. It should be \na major part of any immigration reform that focuses on trying to get \npeople who will be most successful in America, the ones we know are \ngoing to be able to do better here.\n  The plan should not admit a person who is likely to be a public \ncharge. However, that is already the current law. A person is not \nsupposed to be admitted to America if they are likely to be a public \ncharge; that is, they will need government aid to take care of \nthemselves. Some people will be turned down because of this. We should \ntake the ones who are not going to be a public charge.\n  We discovered in looking at the numbers recently that less than one-\ntenth of 1 percent of applicants that come to the United States are \nturned down on the basis that they might be a public charge. So, in \neffect, that is not being enforced. Basically, it is just not being \nenforced.\n  So how can we be sure of that? My friend Stephen Moore was on the TV \ntoday. He is at the Wall Street Journal. He said: You don't have to \nworry about people coming in and being a public charge. There is a law \nagainst that.\n  Well, Mr. Moore, there may be a law against it, but it is not being \nenforced. We need to know it is going to be enforced in the future.\n  Younger people in Canada get a priority. Pretty soon, people will be \non Social Security and Medicare when they reach those ages. Shouldn't \nwe as a rational nation look to give priority to younger people who \nwill work a little longer and pay more into the system before they draw \nthese benefits?\n  They give preferences to investors, those who create jobs and bring \nfactories and manufacturing to their country. Those are the kinds of \nthings I think we ought to be talking about.\n  This proposal makes reference to guest workers. It is a very delicate \nissue. Let me tell my colleagues what was in the bill in 2007 and the \nreason. In my mind, it was one of the greater errors in the \nlegislation. People would come into the country for 3 years. They could \nbring their families. If they were still working at the place at which \nthey came in to work, they could extend for another 3 years and then \nanother 3 years and then another 3 years. So I would ask, somebody who \nhad been in the country 8, 9, 10 years, could we just easily ask them \nto leave? Not likely. What if they have had two children and the \nchildren are automatic citizens?\n  This is a very impractical system. So we need to examine how a guest \nworker\n\n[[Page S308]]\n\nplan will actually be carried out. In my view, a guest worker should \ncome without family for less than a year at a time to do seasonal--to \ndo particular work and then return to their country. Otherwise, we \ncreate an entirely new system, and it will be very difficult to \nenforce.\n  We need to know pretty much what the Nation can rightly absorb in \nterms of the number of people who come each year, and as a result of \nthat, we need to make sure any legislation has a limit that would make \ncommon sense in the world in which we live.\n  Finally, I would say that we face a particular hurdle this time. We \nfaced this hurdle last time, but I believe it is even more serious this \ntime. That is, if the chief law enforcement officer of the country--\nthen President Bush, now President Obama--President Obama has \nparticularly acted to undermine the ability of the law enforcement \ncommunity to actually enforce existing laws----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have \nvoted unanimously ``no confidence'' in Mr. John Morton, the Director of \nICE, because of his failure to lead and his, in fact, undermining of \ntheir ability to do their jobs, and they sued him for interfering with \ntheir ability to do their jobs in enforcing the laws of this country. \nActually, a federal court just recently upheld the lawsuit and allowed \nit to proceed. What a terrible thing it is that law enforcement \nofficers have to sue their leadership to be able to do their jobs.\n  So we need to be sure we have in the President someone who is \ncommitted to enforcing the law if it is passed. If that had been so, we \nwould be in a lot better position today.\n  I see my colleague from Louisiana, and I believe he is to be \nrecognized next. He has been such a good student of this issue. He is a \nfabulous lawyer, editor of the Tulane Law Review, and he understands \nthis, and I am really glad he could be here today.\n  There is one more thing I would note. In addition to the fact that we \nhave a President less willing to enforce the law, the labor \nparticipation rate in 2007 when the last comprehensive reform bill that \nincluded amnesty was defeated was 66 percent. Today, labor \nparticipation has dropped to 63.6 percent. Unemployment in 2007, when \nthe last proposal failed, was 4.5 percent. It is now 7.9 percent.\n  So I think we need to ask serious questions about any proposal, and \nmaybe we can move forward with some legislation that would serve the \nnational interests. Maybe we can do it on a bipartisan basis, but it is \ngoing to take real attention to details. The details are what make the \ndifference, and that is what I am concerned about.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n8 minutes, and I ask the Chair to alert me when 6 minutes has elapsed.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, but I ask unanimous consent to follow the Senator from \nLouisiana to speak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Mr. President. Through the Chair, I wish to \nthank Senator Durbin for his courtesy in light of another engagement I \nhave.\n  I rise to join my colleague from Alabama and to join many others to \nexpress real concern on this topic of illegal immigration and the \ndesperate need to fix this problem, to solve this problem.\n  I believe we all want to cherish and hold up and continue the proud \ntradition of this country which is founded on immigration. One of the \nmany things that make America unique is that we are a nation of--all of \nus--immigrants. None of us somehow has some blood oath or blood tie to \nthis land that goes back from time immemorial. We all came here \nrelatively recently in the grand scheme of things from other lands, all \nof our families. We are a nation of immigrants and immigration, and we \ncherish and celebrate that.\n  But, of course, historically, that has been a system of legal \nimmigration. It is so worrisome to me and so many others that over the \nlast 30 years in particular, it has really evolved into a wide open, \nrelatively little enforcement system of illegal immigration that \nflourishes and abounds and grows as our traditional legal immigration \nsystem gets less and less workable for the folks trying to follow the \nrules. That is my concern as I look at many of these immigration reform \nproposals, particularly proposals for so-called comprehensive reform \nsuch as the one outlined today.\n  I think the test is pretty simple: How do we uphold our tradition of \nimmigration and fix the problem, solve the problem, and not allow it to \ncontinue or, worse yet, grow and mushroom? To me, that is the bottom \nline. Will any proposal we make be debated--will the proposal outlined \nby some of my colleagues today fix the problem or will it perpetuate \nthe problem or, God forbid, even grow the problem dramatically?\n  What heightens my concern is that we have history as a guide, and \nhistory suggests that brand of so-called comprehensive immigration \nreform--this promise of enforcement as long as we have an amnesty--all \nof those things put together are a recipe for failure. Of course, the \nmost notable case of this was in 1986 under President Reagan. There was \na so-called comprehensive immigration reform proposal passed into law. \nThe promise, the model was very simple: We are going to get serious \nabout enforcement--we really, really are--and we are going to have a \none-time leniency or amnesty. It will fix the problem once and for all. \nWe will never have to look back, and that will be done.\n  As we know from bitter experience since then, it didn't quite turn \nout that way. The promised enforcement never fully materialized. In \nfact, in my opinion, it never materialized to any significant extent. \nHowever, the leniency, the amnesty happened immediately. It happened \nthe second that bill was signed into law.\n  So did it fix the problem estimated at about 3 million illegal aliens \nthen? No. It not only perpetuated the problem, it grew the problem to \n12 million-plus--some people think as high as 15 million to 20 million \nillegal aliens now. So it grew the problem enormously because we had \npromised enforcement which never adequately materialized but an amnesty \nwhich happened immediately. That is the fundamental concern. That is \nthe deadly scenario I am concerned about with regard to virtually all \nof these so-called ``comprehensive'' solutions.\n  There is one thing--at least one thing--that has changed since 1986. \nIt is this: Compared to 1986, we have a President and an administration \nin power which has proved time and time again that they have no will, \nno focus on real enforcement. Why do I say that?\n  Well, this is the administration that sued States attempting to \nenforce immigration laws and get control of the border. It did mot \nsupport those States, did not try to find a Federal fix. It did one \nthing: sued States such as Arizona trying to deal with a flow across \nthe border and all of the violence and crime that is an aspect of that.\n  This is the administration that ended the 32 287(g) local law \nenforcement programs that were fairly effective, at least in focused \nlimited ways, with regard to enforcement. They scuttled that program, \ncompletely threw it out the window. This is the administration, of \ncourse, that propagated the Fast and Furious gun-walking scandal and \nstill has not answered questions about that adequately, in my opinion.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed 6 minutes.\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  This is the administration that unconstitutionally put into effect \nthe DREAM Act by administrative fiat. Congress would not pass that. A \nDemocratic House and a Democratic Senate failed to pass it. President \nObama at the time said he did not have adequate powers to put it into \nlaw administratively, and yet when it came time to\n\n[[Page S309]]\n\nrun for election, he did it by administrative fiat, in my opinion--in \nmany people's opinion--well beyond his legal authority.\n  So that is the main thing that is different from 1986. We have a \nPresident and an administration that has proved to be completely \nopposed to aggressive and real enforcement. So I hope, as we continue \nthis debate with my distinguished colleague from Illinois and many \nothers, we focus on that central question: Will this solve the problem?\n  In my opinion, we have seen this movie before. We have tried this so-\ncalled comprehensive approach before--this marriage of promises of \nenforcement with leniency or amnesty. History suggests that does not \nwork. The enforcement never adequately shows up. The amnesty \nimmediately does. In this proposal, although it might not be immediate \ncitizenship, it is immediate legal protection and many benefits that \nflow from that.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to continuing this discussion.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it was July of 1911. A boat arrived in \nBaltimore. It came over from Germany. And among the passengers getting \noff that boat were a small number of people from Lithuania. They \nincluded my grandmother, my aunt, my uncle, and my mom. My mother was 2 \nyears old in 1911, and she was brought to America along with her family \nas an immigrant.\n  I wish I had asked the questions before everyone passed on about how \nmuch anyone remembered from that experience because I have always \nwondered about it. I always wondered how this family who spoke no \nEnglish got off that boat and got to East St. Louis, IL, which is where \nI grew up, and where a lot of Lithuanian immigrants went to work in the \npackinghouses, in the steel mills, and coal mines nearby. But that is \nthe story of the Durbin family, at least my mother's side of it. It is \nnot a unique story. It is a story of America.\n  My mother came to this country 2 years of age, with a mother who did \nnot speak English, and today her son serves in the U.S. Senate. It is a \ngreat story about this great country. It also tells the story of how \nmany millions such as her came to these shores looking for something \nthat was important in their lives--first and foremost, to feed their \nchildren, to get a job. That is always the No. 1 reason.\n  But up in my office here, just a few steps away from the Senate \nfloor, in a desk drawer I have one thing that was carried in the \nluggage by my grandmother when she came over from Lithuania. It is a \nprayer book. It is a Catholic prayer book. We are Roman Catholics. They \nwere leaving Lithuania where the Russian czar had come in and said to \nthe Roman Catholics: If you are not Russian Orthodox, you are going to \nhave to play by different rules. And one of the rules is, you can't \nhave any of your prayer books written in Lithuanian. They must be \nwritten in Russian.\n  Well, my grandmother, whom I never knew, must have been a defiant and \nrisk-taking woman because she had one of these contraband prayer books \nand brought it with her to America because she knew she could use it \nhere without a problem because of the freedoms in this country.\n  That again is a little family story from my life experience, my \nfamily experience, but one that could be replicated in many different \nways.\n  We just had a press conference upstairs, and you may see some \ncoverage a little later on. There were five of us representing six \nSenators who had been sitting together and working on this immigration \nissue--three Democrats and three Republicans. On the Democratic side, I \nhave been honored to join Chuck Schumer of New York and Bob Menendez of \nNew Jersey. On the Republican side is John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey \nGraham of South Carolina, and Marco Rubio of Florida. It is a pretty \ninteresting group, right? It is a pretty interesting political spectrum \nrepresented by these six Senators.\n  For the last few months, we have been sitting down and working out a \nstatement of principles about immigration reform. And today we unveiled \nthose principles. We have a lot of work to do. We still have to write \nthe law, and we still have to bring it to the Senate to be debated and \nto be passed.\n  I do not assume for a minute that we are going to have the support of \nevery Senator on both sides of the aisle. That would be too much to \nconsider or to ask. But I know from listening to the speeches that were \ngiven by Senator Sessions of Alabama and Senator Vitter of Louisiana, \nthey have many questions they want to ask about how we approach \nimmigration reform. So let me try, if I can, to speak to some of the \nbasics that are included in our effort.\n  First, when I listened to the Senator from Louisiana, he said that \nPresident Obama had done little to enforce immigration laws. I think \nyou will find, for the record, that this President has deported more \npeople in his tenure than predecessors, particularly those who have \nbeen associated with criminal activity. In fact, he has received some \ncriticism saying he is going too far. So to argue that he is not \nenforcing the law is not supported by the facts and the statistics.\n  The Senator from Louisiana also said that President Obama was the \nauthor of the Fast and Furious program, which was a border effort to \ntry to stop the flow of guns that blew up in the face of those who \nengineered it, and ended up in the tragic death of one of our own. I \nwould say for the record that program began under President Bush, not \nunder President Obama. So there are some facts that we need to put on \nthe record. But I wish to also speak to a couple elements here that \nhave been raised about this effort on immigration reform.\n  Let's get down to basics. Immigration is part of who we are in \nAmerica. It is the reason we are such a diverse Nation. My family \nstory, as I said, could be repeated over and over. Every generation has \nfaced a new wave of immigration coming into this country.\n\n  I think it is healthy. I think there is something in the DNA of those \npeople who get up and come here who are determined to improve their \nlives. These people turn out to be the entrepreneurs and the teachers \nand the leaders of our Nation because they were not content staying in \nsomeplace where they did not achieve their goals. They wanted to come \nto America.\n  So immigration is part of who we are, and the debate over immigration \nis part of who we are. It has been going on forever. I think as soon as \nthe first boat to America landed with immigrants, they started \nquestioning whether we needed another boatload of immigrants. That \ndebate has gone on throughout our history. There have been some \nterrible things done in the name of immigration reform and some good \nthings as well.\n  Secondly, immigration and the demand for immigration says a great \ndeal about America. People want to come here. It says a lot about it, \ndoesn't it? Here we are in a democracy with the freedoms we enjoy and \nan economy that offers such wonderful opportunities, and people from \nall over the world, given a choice, would come here for their future. \nThat is a positive.\n  But the third thing is, our immigration system is broken. I got \nelected about 16 years ago to the Senate. One of the first phone calls \ncame from Senator Ted Kennedy, chair of the Immigration Subcommittee in \nthe Judiciary. He said: Welcome to the Judiciary Committee. Please come \non my Immigration Subcommittee. I said: Well, thank you. I am honored \nyou would ask. He said: We are about to rewrite the immigration laws. \nWe have not done it for 10 years. The last time was under President \nReagan. Now we are going to do it again, and we need you to be part of \nit.\n  Oh, I signed up in a hurry. It did not happen and 16 years have \npassed.\n  So for 25 years-plus, we have not looked at this immigration law. It \nis broken. It is broken badly. It is broken when we have 11 or 12 \nmillion people living here who are undocumented. Many of them came here \non a legal visa and overstayed their visa. Some did sneak across the \nborder to come into the United States. There are a variety of \nexplanations, but they are here. I have come to know them. For many \npeople who are not in this business, maybe you do not know them. But I \nwill tell who they are.\n  They happen to be the person who just took the plates off your table \nat the restaurant. They are the ones who are unloading the food at the \ndock behind the restaurant. They will be making the beds in the hotel \nrooms across America tonight. A lot of them are in\n\n[[Page S310]]\n\nthe day-care centers every day with our children and grandchildren, \nwhom we dearly love. Some are tending to our parents and grandparents \nwho are in nursing homes. And some of them have sat down next to you in \nchurch on a regular basis. They are undocumented. They do not talk \nabout it. They do not wear it on their sleeves. Many of them are afraid \nto say anything. And they do not live in a house full of undocumented \npeople. By and large, you are going to find families split up. You may \nfind dad, who has been here the longest, who qualified under the Reagan \namnesty in 1986. He is a legal citizen. Mom is not. All three children \nborn here are. There is a family that is literally split by our \nimmigration system.\n  That is the reality of what we see in America today. The question is, \nhow did we reach this point? What can we do about it? We now are \nsitting down on a bipartisan basis to address it.\n  First, we need to make sure we are doing everything we reasonably can \ndo at the border to keep illegal immigration down, to reduce it as low \nas possible. I know, as I said earlier, there are people from all over \nthe world who want to come here.\n  But for those who suggest we are not doing enough at the border, I \nwish to call their attention to a recent press release from the \nMigration Policy Institute. This press release is from January 7 of \nthis year. It says: ``The U.S. government spends more on federal \nimmigration enforcement than on all other principal federal criminal \nlaw enforcement agencies combined, with the nearly $18 billion spent in \nfiscal 2012 approximately 24 percent higher than collective spending \nfor the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, Secret Service, U.S. \nMarshals Service and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and \nExplosives. . . . ''\n  So to argue that this President is not enforcing the law, when we \nhave so many deportations, and to argue that he is not taking it \nseriously, when we are spending record-breaking amounts on the borders \nis not backed up by the facts. But still we need to make sure we are \ndoing everything we can to keep the borders safe and to reduce illegal \nimmigration. That is the first thing.\n  The second thing is to say that those who are here, if they want to \nbe legal, have to earn their way to legal status. How do they earn it? \nFirst they go through a criminal background check. We do not want \nanyone here who is a threat to our Nation or to the people who live \nhere. They will be asked to leave. In fact, they will be forced to \nleave.\n  But for those who pass the criminal background check, they will need \nto pay a fine, they have to pay their taxes, and then they can stay and \nwork in a probationary legal status while we make the borders safe. \nUltimately, they have to be able to speak English, learn our history \nand civics, and then go through a lengthy process before they are \ngranted--even possibly granted--citizenship.\n  We also say at the same time that we are going to build into this \nsystem enforcement for the workplace. What brings most people to \nAmerica? Jobs. It is all about a job. If in the workplace we have real \nenforcement, where we have an identification card from those who are \nseeking a job, and an obligation on the part of the employer to make \nsure they are registered in this country, then we can start to have a \nsystem of enforceability.\n  We also need--and Senator Rubio of Florida has been pushing this--we \nalso need to make sure that when it comes to visas in the United \nStates, when we allow people to travel here to be tourists or students \nor for business purposes, and they have an expiring visa, they leave \nwhen they are supposed to. Our system now is not as good as it should \nbe. We want to strengthen that system. That is part of what we need to \ndo.\n  I think immigration reform is long overdue. This immigration system \nwe have is badly broken and needs to be fixed.\n  We need to take the leadership in Washington. This bipartisan group \nof Senators has started an effort in that direction. We have a long way \nto go. We have to write the bill. We hope to have it done by March. We \nhope to bring it through the committee process for regular hearings, \nfor the amendment process and everything that entails. That, to me, \nwill make sense in the long run. In the meantime, I want to say a word \nabout the DREAM Act.\n  I introduced that bill 12 years ago. It was referred to on the Senate \nfloor. It is worth a minute or two to recount why I introduced the \nbill.\n  We received a phone call in our office from a program in Chicago \nknown as the Merit Music Program. It is a wonderful program. A lady \nleft some money for it and said to use the money to buy musical \ninstruments for kids in poor schools and to give them music lessons.\n  What an amazing transformation it has created in their lives. One \nhundred percent of the graduates of the Merit Music Program go to \ncollege, all of them. It is an amazing thing what a musical experience \nwill do for a young person.\n  Well, there was a young Korean girl named Tereza Lee who came from an \nextremely poor family. She became part of the Merit Music Program and \nturned out to be an accomplished pianist. She was encouraged to apply \nto go to Julliard School of Music and Manhattan Conservatory of Music \nshe was so good.\n  As she started to fill out the application, she stopped and turned to \nthe person at the program and said: I don't know why I am doing this. I \nam undocumented. I have never told anybody that. But I do not know why \nI am wasting my time with this--at which point they called our office \nand said: What can we do for Tereza?\n  Well, it turned out the law was very clear. She had to leave the \nUnited States for 10 years, go back to Brazil, which was the last \ncountry she was in, and then apply to come to the United States. That \nseemed unfair. She was brought here when she was 2 years old. She did \nnot vote on that. Her parents picked her up and brought her here.\n  I started thinking: I bet there are others just like her. It turns \nout there are--hundreds of thousands. So I introduced the DREAM Act.\n  Here is what it said: If you were brought to the United States before \nthe age of 16, you finish high school, you have no serious criminal \nissues, and you are prepared to either enlist in our military or finish \nat least 2 years of college, we will give you a chance to become a \ncitizen. I introduced it 12 years ago.\n  I have called it up on the Senate floor over and over. The Senator \nfrom Louisiana is correct; the Senate did not pass it. We could not get \n60 votes to break the Republican filibuster on the DREAM Act. We had a \nmajority, we just did not have 60. That was several years ago.\n  So President Barrack Obama, who was my colleague in the Senate before \nhe was elected President and was a cosponsor of the DREAM Act, said: I \nam going to suspend the deportation of those young people who would be \neligible under the DREAM Act. He did. It went into effect last August.\n  Congressman Luis Gutierrez of Chicago is a great leader on \nimmigration reform. He and I held a workshop in August at Navy Pier, \nwhich is a big gathering place in Chicago, for those who would be \neligible for this deferral of deportation under the DREAM Act. We never \ndreamed they would start lining up at midnight the night before. They \nwould stay out there all night long with their families waiting for a \nchance to sign up. It was such a heart-warming experience to know how \nmuch this meant not only to the young persons but many times to their \nundocumented parents who thought: At least my child will get this \nchance.\n  So some criticized the President for making this decision. But two-\nthirds of the American people, Democrats and Republicans alike, think \nit was the right decision. I do too. I have met those Dreamers. I have \ntalked about them on the floor of the Senate over and over. I will \ncontinue. But these young people will make this a better country. They \ndeserve a chance to do just that.\n  So those who are critical of the DREAM Act are basically saying these \nyoung people are not needed in this country. I think they are. They \nhave spent their whole life being educated here. They have gotten up \nevery morning and in school put their hands on their hearts and pledged \nallegiance to that great flag, believing this is their country too. \nThey deserve a chance to make it such.\n  Marco Rubio of Florida and I have worked on this DREAM Act issue. He\n\n[[Page S311]]\n\nsaid something I remember and would like to recount. He said: This is \nnot an immigration issue; this is an issue of compassion, \nhumanitarianism. These people were kids when they were brought here. \nThey deserve this chance. So I know this will be included in any \nimmigration reform. I certainly hope we will pass it and pass it soon.\n  We spoke to the President last night. Senator Schumer and I had a \nconversation with him. Tomorrow he will be making a statement in Nevada \nabout immigration. He is committed to immigration reform. He is \ncommitted to fixing this system. He told us what we are setting out to \ndo is generally consistent with what he wants to see done. But he did \ntell us: Get it done. Do not let this drag out again. Seize the moment \nand move forward with it.\n  Well, we have that chance. We have to do it. We have to do it because \nthis Nation of immigrants, this Nation that will still attract \nimmigrants, needs a legal system that works for those who are here and \nfor those who want to come here. We have to make sure we are sensitive \nto the fact that Americans should receive the first preference for \njobs, and that will be included in our bill, but also beyond that jobs \nthat some Americans do not want. In agriculture, for example, and in \nother areas, we need some people coming in to help. They can be part of \nthis immigration reform as well.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll:\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I want to speak on one of the topics of \nthe day. A group of bipartisan Senators has had a press conference \ntoday announcing their support for a comprehensive immigration reform \npiece of legislation. This is a significant step. Perhaps the biggest \nstep was--on the way to immigration reform--the result of the November \n6 election. As a matter of fact, it has been chronicled in all of the \nnewspapers that the Hispanic community in every State voted \noverwhelmingly for the candidate that was perceived to be fair on the \nimmigration issue.\n  I think that has propelled political motivation to address this issue \nand to address it fairly. I want to commend that bipartisan group of \nSenators for doing this. There are a number of key elements that as we \nget into the specifics of the legislation are going to be important. \nNotice they want to lay everything on the predicate that there is going \nto be the essence of a real border security effort done.\n  It is hard to patrol a border of thousands and thousands of miles \nlike we have, particularly where there is no geographical barrier and \npeople can merely walk across the border. But it has to be done in the \ncontext of overall immigration reform. Another interesting part that \nhas been very thorny in the business community is the fact of \nverification by employers.\n  When this Senator was a young congressman and voting on immigration \nback in the 1980s, as a matter of fact there was supposed to be \nverification by employers of those they were hiring that they were here \nin a documented status. Well, that never happened. As a result, you see \nall of these head fakes in implementing the law about whether somebody \nwas here in a documented status. Then when they were found not to be, \neverybody was pointing like this: Well, it is the other guy's fault.\n  There has to be a verification system put in place. Some have \nsuggested electronic verification. That needs to be explored. They are \ngoing to have to be a lot of new things being explored in order to make \nsure, if we are going to have comprehensive immigration reform, those \nwho are being employed here, in fact, are in a documented status. But \nthe big question in the past politically has been, What about the 11 \nmillion who are estimated to be in this country working and in an \nundocumented status?\n  I think the principles laid out by the group earlier today are very \ngood: They must play by the rules; they must not have a criminal \nrecord; they must pay back taxes; They must pay a fine; and then go to \nthe end of the line. Even though they would be allowed a legal status \nto stay here and to continue working--and that is another one of the \nelements--they must have a job and demonstrate they have had a job in \nthe past. It would not be fair for all of them to suddenly get at the \nhead of the line when others have been waiting patiently in the legal \nprocess to get a green card. Thus, we would not have this economic \nupheaval as some here have approached this issue in the past year.\n  We have not heard a lot about this since the election, but previous \nto that we heard a lot about, for example, sending them all home, self-\ndeportation, deporting all of the illegals. Well, first of all, there \nwould be an economic collapse of part of the economy of this country if \nwe suddenly eliminated all of those workers upon whom the economy \ncertainly is dependent. It, also, in many cases would not be fair.\n  There is another part of this that needs to be added. This is the \nfairness question for the children who came here through no fault of \ntheir own. They have grown up thinking they are only an American, and \nthen the current law is they have to be deported. Well, this Senator \nhas intervened in a number of cases for children who wanted to go into \nthe military after high school, wanted to go on to college. They were \nat the point of being deported.\n  As a matter of fact, we had a Bahamian child who came when he was 6 \nmonths old. He only knew he was American. He served two tours in Iraq \nin the U.S. Army, came back, went into the Navy Reserve, had a top \nsecret clearance and was a photographer for the Navy at Guantanamo \nprison. When he came back, the authorities put him in jail--a veteran, \nsomeone who was still Active-Duty U.S. Navy Reserve.\n  A U.S. Federal judge of Cuban-American descent made a very harsh \nstatement in Miami toward the prosecutors for them putting a child, now \nan adult, now a veteran, having served both the Army and the Navy, with \na top secret clearance, putting that Bahamian, now adult, in jail.\n  This is how ridiculous the system has gotten. This Senator had to \nintervene in this case, and once we raised enough Cain, finally people \ncame to their senses and said: What is the commonsense thing to do?\n  The commonsense thing now for us to do is all to pass a comprehensive \nimmigration reform law and, hopefully, that is going to occur.\n  The question is, though, what is going to happen at the other end of \nthe hall, down there in the House of Representatives? Because there are \na lot of people in the other party down there who haven't changed their \nattitude since the election. They still are expressing that they don't \nwant anything but deportation. I think we are just going to have to use \ncommon sense and moderation and try to explain why this is the fair \nthing to do.\n  As a young Congressman, I favored this comprehensive approach decades \nago. I voted for it as a Senator. I will gladly, once they knit \ntogether the legislation, be one of the cosponsors of this legislation.\n  I wish to thank the bipartisan group of Senators who got together, \nwhich includes my colleague from Florida, Mr. Rubio, for their \nwillingness to take the initiative and to start plowing new ground of \nlegislation that ought to be able to be passed this year.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/28/senate-section/article/S311-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S311-S323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nMAKING SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING SEPTEMBER \n                                30, 2013\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 152, which the clerk will report \nby title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 152) making supplemental appropriations for \n     the fiscal year ending September 30, 2013, to improve and \n     streamline disaster assistance.\n\n\n[[Page S312]]\n\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to urge my colleagues to \nimmediately pass this urgent supplemental bill without further delay. I \nremind my colleagues and those who are watching us on global C-SPAN, \nthis is the bill that will pay for disaster relief to help our \ncitizens, both as individuals, businesses, and communities, rebuild \ntheir lives after the devastating, horrific impact of Hurricane Sandy. \nParticularly, it will impact the residents of New York and New Jersey.\n  My own State was affected also. In my own State, we had two things \nhappen: a hurricane in the old-fashioned definition of that word, where \nit hit the Eastern Shore; and up in western Maryland, right up in our \nAppalachian part; we had a blizzard, and it took the National Guard to \nbe able to go into the streets. We had people being rescued on Swift \nBoats and on snowmobiles. It was something.\n  At the same time, I think all America watched what was going on up \nthe coast but particularly in New Jersey and New York.\n  Many other States were also impacted by this storm. Homes and \nbusinesses were damaged and destroyed, and they have been waiting for \n90 days for help from their government to help them rebuild their lives \nand rebuild their livelihoods.\n  I, therefore, tonight ask immediate, urgent action to move this bill. \nIt is not perfect, but it is a very sound bill. The bill that was \npassed by the Senate in December was a superior bill. The House bill, \nwhich is before us, eliminates many important provisions that the \nSenate passed.\n  I will go into that, but I urge my colleagues, let's not make the \nperfect the enemy of the good. We have to get started. We have to help \nour communities. They have been waiting, waiting, waiting. Governor \nCuomo, Governor Christie, Governor O'Malley have all said move it. We \nneed help to move it. We need to.\n  I say there are things that came back from the House on the Senate-\npassed bill that I am not too excited about. They reduced the cost-\nshare requirements for Army Corps projects. In other words, the \ngovernment, the local government, will have to pay more. They reduced \nfunding for fisheries, for flexibility to help our State Department. In \na perfect world, I would seek to amend this bill and ask for a \nconference with the House so we could work out these differences. But \neven though this House bill is not perfect, it does give critical \nrelief to the people who need it; therefore, passing this bill is my \ntop priority.\n\n  This bill totals $50.5 billion for Hurricane Sandy recovery efforts. \nWhen combined with the $9.7 billion of flood insurance we passed \nearlier this month, along with assistance for Hurricane Sandy related \nto recovery, this bill meets the current needs of the recovery efforts \nand should be approved without delay.\n  Let me take a few minutes to discuss some of the important issues. \nThere is $16 billion in there for community development block grant \nfunding to restore infrastructure and housing to help people rebuild \ntheir lives. There is $11.5 billion in the FEMA disaster fund for \nongoing disaster response. There is $10 billion for public \ntransportation--particularly crucial in the New York and New Jersey \narea--and $5.3 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers to help protect \ncommunities along our shorelines, as well as $500 million for the \nsocial services block grants to help meet compelling human needs such \nas childcare, mental health services, and also for programs that will \nhelp with very damaged facilities that meet a compelling need.\n  As I said, Governors Cuomo and Christie have identified needs \ntotaling billions of dollars more than this legislation provides, and \nthat doesn't even include other States such as my own State of \nMaryland. The funding in this bill is urgently needed. Every dollar has \nbeen examined.\n  Hurricane Sandy was one of the most destructive storms to have hit \nthe United States. Hundreds of thousands of families have seen their \nlives turned upside down. They have waited far too long for this \nlegislation to reach the President. I strongly urge the support of this \nlegislation.\n  This is the very first bill that, as the full chair of the \nAppropriations Committee, I am moving. I would like to acknowledge the \nrole of the subcommittee chairmen because in that committee, the \nsubcommittees really carry the bulk of the work. Senator Landrieu of \nthe Subcommittee on Homeland Security has FEMA in her jurisdiction, and \nshe has done an outstanding job of making sure we meet compelling human \nneed at the same time we get value for our dollar. Senator Patty Murray \nchairs the subcommittee that funds housing and transportation, again \nmaking sure we are rebuilding homes and livelihoods. Senator Feinstein, \nwhose subcommittee oversees the Army Corps of Engineers, which has been \ndoing a heroic job keeping the Mississippi River open, wants to make \nsure the shorelines of New York and New Jersey and Maryland are open \nfor business as well. I could name all of them, but those three have \ndone an outstanding job.\n  I particularly wish to acknowledge the help of my colleagues from New \nYork and New Jersey. Senator Schumer led the way, particularly when \nthere was this difficult time with Senator Inouye's illness, to move \nthis bill, but Senators Gillibrand, Menendez, and Lautenberg have \nreally been outstanding.\n  This is about colleagues, and I thank my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle who helped us.\n  I would now like to yield the floor to Senator Landrieu, who has done \nsuch a great job through her subcommittee, and ask her to elaborate \nparticularly on the aspects of the disaster response and recovery.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank my colleague for her extraordinary, robust, and \nenthusiastic leadership on this important piece of legislation that \nwill send hope and help to the Northeast, to the dozens of counties \nthroughout New York, New Jersey, and even the State of Maryland and \nother States that are waiting on pins and needles for our action.\n  It has been too long. We have sent too many different signals out \nfrom this Capitol. The people following this debate--the mayors, the \ncounty commissioners, the school board members, the citizens, the \npastors of churches, the principals of schools--need to hear today a \nbig yes from Congress and a yes from the President that help is on the \nway.\n  Believe me, as a Senator from Louisiana, I have unfortunately become \nan expert on disasters and disaster recovery, and I can tell you from \npersonal experience and testimony the importance of every action we \ntake regarding this recovery so that the private sector--and I want my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to hear this--not taxpayer \nmoney but the private sector will have the confidence that the \ngovernment will be there, and they themselves will begin to invest.\n  This is a big effort, and we have already delayed this far longer \nthan it should have been because we have been arguing over offsets.\n  I want to put in the Record this statement:\n  When our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan needed ammunition, equipment, \nand better protection against roadside bombs, we sent them what they \nneeded as quickly as we could get it there. We didn't make them wait, \nsitting around bandaging their wounds, while we debated about offsets \nand how we were going to deal with those explosives. We should respond \nwith the same sense of urgency to our fellow citizens and address \nemergency needs on U.S. soil.\n  It has already been 3 months since Hurricane Sandy. If this Lee \namendment is adopted, it will be delayed further. I strongly oppose the \nLee amendment, and I wish to talk a minute more about why, and then I \nwill turn it over to Senator Schumer and others on the floor.\n  We should not use disasters as an excuse to push ideology, and that \nis, I am afraid, what the other side is doing. They want to look for \nany excuse to cut the budget. I want to say again that we have already \ncut this budget by $1.5 trillion. And I want to say for the 11th, 12th, \n13th time that we are never going to cut our way to a balanced budget. \nI want my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to hear it. We are \nnot going to cut our way to a balanced budget. It is going to be a \ncombination of revenue increases and cuts, which I am all for. And the \nlast negotiation we did was exactly that. Vice President Biden and \nPresident\n\n[[Page S313]]\n\nObama negotiated a combination of revenues and reductions.\n  All the Lee amendment does is reduce again. He does not offer one new \npenny to pay for this. He wants to cut it from veterans, he wants to \ncut it from firefighters, he wants to cut it from police officers. I am \nnot going to join him. It is a wrongheaded approach. If we want to find \na way to pay for disasters, I will show up and negotiate with anybody, \nbut it is not going to be just by cutting the defense budget or \ndiscretionary budgets. If it is going to be about raising additional \nrevenues and cutting, you will have me. Until then, put me down as a \nno.\n  I suggest to all my colleagues today that they vote no on the Lee \namendment, if we get to these votes, and yes on the underlying bill.\n  One more word about the underlying bill because the Senators from the \nregion know it much better than I do. I agree with our chairman, the \nSenator from Maryland. The Senate bill was far better in some ways. Not \nonly did it have a little more money in it, but it had some important \ntools for reform. Unfortunately, the House stripped some of those out, \nand some of them will affect the gulf coast in a negative way.\n  There were commonsense things, such as a loan modification provision \nthat would have forced FEMA to actually calculate the repayment in a \nrational way instead of an irrational way, which would have helped some \nof the parishes in Louisiana. Senator Vitter and I fought very hard for \nthat. We think it is fiscally responsible. We think it is the right \nthing to do. But the House stripped it. We are still going to vote--I \nhope he will, and I know I will--for this bill because, again, we can't \nmake perfect the enemy of the good. This is a good bill which the \npeople need. We are not going to get every reform we had sought, but we \nare going to get the bulk of them.\n  I thank Republicans and Democrats on the House side--Peter King, Nita \nLowey--who came together to preserve some of the reforms because it \nwould have been like sending money with dull tools. That is a waste of \ntaxpayer money. We want to send the money and the toolbox with sharp \ntools that people can use, and that is what we put in this bill. So I \nam proud to have worked on that part.\n  There are many other parts. No leader was better than Senator \nSchumer, Senator Gillibrand, Senator Menendez, and Senator Lautenberg, \nbut I am proud of the part we worked on, preserving the reforms we \nlearned we needed. Now I am happy to be able to give some of that help \nto the people of the Northeast even though some of our provisions were \nstripped out.\n  So again, Madam President, I oppose the Lee amendment that is made in \norder in the consent agreement. I want to re-state my position that we \nshould not insist on budget offsets as a pre-requisite for helping \ndisaster victims in this country.\n  Since 2011, Congress has already approved $1.5 trillion of spending \ncuts on discretionary programs over 10 years. We approved cuts in the \nfiscal year 2011 Continuing Resolution and in the fiscal year 2012 \nOmnibus spending bill. We established long-term caps on discretionary \nspending in the Budget Control Act of 2011 and we further reduced those \ncaps in the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.\n  For fiscal year 2013 alone, we have cut discretionary spending by \nover $109 billion, or over 9 percent.\n  The Lee amendment would lay on another $6.3 billion cut in fiscal \nyear 2013, including cuts in defense, veterans programs, homeland \nsecurity programs, critical infrastructure programs that will generate \njob growth, cuts in small business programs, and even $250 million of \ncuts in the Hurricane Sandy response and rebuilding funding that is now \nbefore us. On top of those cuts, the Lee amendment would require \ncutting another $44.9 billion by fiscal year 2021.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the Lee amendment.\n  I support H.R. 152 and urge Members to oppose the Lee amendment. The \nbill includes $50.5 billion of critical and timely assistance following \nHurricane Sandy. If approved, Congress will have provided $60.2 billion \nto help the victims of Hurricane Sandy rebuild their homes and \nbusinesses and to make their communities more resilient from future \ndisasters.\n  This is no status quo bill. The victims of Hurricane Katrina and Rita \nlearned the hard way that some of our Nation's disaster rebuilding laws \nare needlessly bureaucratic. Having learned these lessons, the Stafford \nAct reforms contained in this bill will help ensure that the victims of \nHurricane Sandy will not have to repeat this history. The key reforms \nincluded in the bill will dramatically improve our Nation's ability to \ncope with catastrophic events like Hurricane Sandy. In addition to \nthese reforms, this bill contains significant funding to mitigate \nfuture losses of life and property.\n  It has now been more than 3 months since Hurricane Sandy claimed the \nlives of more than 130 Americans, severely impacting over 340,000 homes \nand 200,000 businesses, and leaving more than 8.5 million families \nwithout power, heat, or running water. The scale of this disaster has \ncreated significant housing and transportation challenges, and \nsuccessful recovery will require a sustained effort at the Federal, \nState, and local level, from government, private businesses, and \nvoluntary organizations.\n  By and large, the Federal Government's response to Hurricane Sandy \nhas been robust. Over 525,000 people have registered for temporary \nhousing and other individual assistance, FEMA has provided 14 million \nmeals, over 16 million liters of water, over 1.6 million blankets, and \nover 100,000 tarps. DOD delivered over 9.3 million gallons of gasoline \nto 300 gas stations. Over 470 million gallons of salt water were pumped \nout of transit and highway tunnels and other structures. At the peak of \nthe response, 17,000 Federal personnel and over 11,000 National \nGuardsmen were involved: I commend the thousands of first responders, \nvolunteers, and neighbors who have worked tirelessly to help those in \nneed.\n  Twelve States and the District of Columbia have been declared major \ndisaster areas as a result of Hurricane Sandy, and their citizens will \nrequire significant resources to recover.\n  While FEMA has sufficient funds in the Disaster Relief Fund to make \nit to March--the current balance is $3.4 billion--the victims of \nHurricane Sandy should not have to wait any longer to know that \nCongress is committed to rebuilding their communities and helping small \nbusinesses come back to life. FEMA has already spent over $3.3 billion \nresponding to Hurricane Sandy and as we move from the response and \nrecovery phases to the rebuilding phase, there will be significant \ncosts for housing, highways, transit, hospitals, beach restoration and \nother public infrastructure, and for mitigation efforts to reduce loss \nof life and damage to property from future disasters, by backing up \npower supplies, strengthening flood protection infrastructure, \nretrofitting facilities, and other measures. The bill that is before us \ncontains $11.5 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund to continue these \nefforts.\n  SBA has approved more than $1.2 billion in loans to more than 16,000 \nhomeowners and small businesses. Funding provided in the supplemental \nwill enable SBA to continue processing and approving loan applications \nat the pace of over 1,000 new loan closings per week. H.R. 152 contains \nover $800 million to continue this assistance.\n  The Federal funding contained in this bill is necessary, appropriate, \nand important to helping the victims of Hurricane Sandy recover. But \nmoney isn't the only thing our government must provide. Effective tools \nand smartly designed programs will be equally vital to the northeast \nregion's recovery.\n  I co-authored these reforms to facilitate a faster, smarter, more \nstrategic, and more cost-effective recovery process. FEMA has estimated \nthey will save hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars and reduce \nconstruction delays, protracted funding disputes, and bureaucratic \nwaste.\n  They are the product of dozens of hearings I held over the course of \n6 years as chair of the Subcommittee on Disaster Recovery and the \nSubcommittee on Homeland Security Appropriations, as well as extensive \nconsultation with State and local officials across the country, private \nand nonprofit organizations, engaged in disaster relief, numerous \nFederal agencies\n\n[[Page S314]]\n\nincluding FEMA and HUD, and stakeholders throughout the emergency \nmanagement community.\n  Many were drawn from legislation I introduced in 2011 with my friend \nand colleague from the State of Mississippi, Senator Cochran, who has \nendured the same disasters as my own State of Louisiana, and whose \ncontributions to the gulf coast's recovery and the development of this \nlegislation have been tremendous. I am grateful for his partnership in \nthis endeavor.\n  I would also like to note the considerable contributions of the House \nof Representatives, which passed FEMA reform legislation last year that \nincluded several of these provisions. Following Senate passage of these \nreforms on December 28 by a vote of 62-32, the House adopted the \npackage by a vote of 403-0 and agreed to include it in the \ncomprehensive Supplemental legislation that is now before us.\n  I am particularly grateful to Senator Cochran, Senator Lieberman, \nSenator Collins, and Congressmen Shuster, Rahall, Denham, Congresswoman \nHolmes Norton, Congressman Mica, Congresswomen Slaughter, Lowey, and \nCongressmen Alexander, and Richmond for their considerable efforts to \nadvance these critical reforms.\n  The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act \nauthorizes the majority of FEMA's disaster assistance programs. It was \nenacted in 1988, amended in 2000 to incorporate several mitigation \nprograms, and revised again in 2006 to address response failures after \nHurricane Katrina.\n  These were important changes, but the law has never been re-visited \nto address recovery, and our emergency management system remains \nwoefully inadequate in that respect.\n  Senator Cochran and I succeeded in enacting several key reforms in \nthe months and years that followed Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to \nfacilitate a smarter approach to recovery, but those reforms only \napplied to the 2005 hurricanes.\n  The State I represent has been battered by disasters during my time \nin the Senate. We endured Hurricane Katrina and Rita in 2005, Hurricane \nGustav and Ike in 2008, the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill in 2010, \nhistoric Mississippi River flooding and Tropical Storm Lee in 2011, and \nHurricane Isaac last August. Through the course of these harrowing \nevents, I have witnessed numerous systemic failures, misguided \npolicies, bottlenecks, management gaps, and squandered opportunities in \nthe way we go about facilitating community recovery after a disaster.\n  As a result of those experiences, I have dedicated a significant \namount of my time and energy in the Senate to fixing these problems so \nthe people of the gulf coast and Americans everywhere can rely on \nFederal programs that are sensibly designed and effectively managed to \nhelp families and communities in their time of need.\n  That time has come for millions in the northeastern United States \nstill reeling from the devastating impacts of Hurricane Sandy. For \ntheir sake, we cannot afford to wait any longer for these critical \nreforms.\n  Let me highlight these reforms:\n  Reauthorization of two expired pilot programs from the Post-Katrina \nEmergency Management Reform Act that allow FEMA to repair rental units \nas a cost-effective temporary housing alternative to trailers and \nmobile homes and to utilize expedited debris removal procedures. Both \nprograms were determined by FEMA to speed recovery and save taxpayers \nmillions of dollars; allowing a State to draw down a portion of its \nhazard mitigation funding from FEMA, in order to leverage mitigation \nopportunities earlier in the reconstruction process. Under the current \nprogram, it typically takes 18 to 36 months for funding to become \navailable. By then, most reconstruction is already complete or \nunderway, and numerous mitigation opportunities have been lost; \nproviding grants on the basis of reliable fixed estimates for expedited \nremoval of storm-related debris and reconstruction of damaged \nfacilities and infrastructure. This approach will be faster, cheaper, \nand more effective for everyone involved. The Public Assistance program \nas currently designed may be the most dysfunctional program in the \nentire Federal Government, and it simply will not work for this \ndisaster. Under the current approach, initial damage estimates are \noften incomplete, projects must be re-versioned multiple times, \ndecisions are often not made in writing, frequent staff turnover leads \nto decision reversals, hundreds of meetings result in incalculable \nadministrative waste, and it takes years for a project to be completed. \nIndividual paper tickets are filled out for each tree limb collected \noff a roadway, which are measured and photographed by debris \ncontractors, who are in turn followed around by monitoring contractors. \nA $1.2 million Youth Study Center in New Orleans that was damaged by \nKatrina has been the subject of 182 meetings over the course of 8 \nyears. The process is severely broken. FEMA and communities across the \ngulf coast, who have suffered through this bureaucratic quagmire, are \nin agreement that there is a better way to clean-up and rebuild. It's \nup to the Congress to provide that smarter approach; codifying \ntemporary legislative measures that were enacted to facilitate a \nsmarter recovery after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, including third-\nparty arbitration of disputes over project eligibility and cost, \neliminating the penalty on alternate projects that stifles smarter \nrebuilding, and authority to consolidate facilities into a single \nproject so school districts, police, fire, and public works departments \ncan strategically plan reconstruction without having to rebuild \neverything exactly as it was before. After Rita for example, these \nreforms allowed the Iberia Parish School Board in Louisiana to relocate \nPeebles Elementary School to a new location outside the floodplain \nwithout paying a Federal penalty for rebuilding safer and smarter. It \nalso allowed the Orleans Parish School Board to reduce the number of \nschools in New Orleans by one-third after determining through its \nMaster Plan that dozens were no longer needed; allowing families to use \nFEMA Individual Assistance funds for disaster-related child care \nexpenses so parents can get back to work and rebuilt their home or \nbusiness sooner;  reducing bureaucratic waste by eliminating \nduplicative agency reviews for the same project and the same set of \nlaws governing environmental, historic preservation, and benefit-cost \nrequirements; helping the environment by incentivizing recycling of \ndebris and allowing locals to keep the proceeds; eliminating a perverse \nincentive in the law to use high-priced contract labor for emergency \nwork instead of local government employees, such as firefighters and \npolice officers, which will save the Federal Government millions of \ndollars; correcting a gap in current law that prohibits tribal \ngovernments from requesting Federal assistance after a disaster in the \nsame way that States are authorized to do.\n\n  This legislation does not eliminate State or local cost-share \nrequirements, establish new grant programs, or provide Stafford Act \nassistance to private sector entities. Instead, it sharpens the tools \nin the Federal Government's toolbox so that disaster-affected \ncommunities can recover more quickly.\n  The legislation's potential to reduce future property damage, \nstrengthen local capacity, expedite rebuilding, and eliminate \nduplication and administrative waste, will save taxpayers a tremendous \namount of money on Hurricane Sandy as well as future disasters. It will \nalso save communities in the northeast a tremendous amount of time, \npaperwork, and unnecessary agony.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these important reforms and the \nsupplemental appropriations measure now before the Senate.\n  While I commend the House of Representatives for providing robust \nfunding for Sandy recovery efforts and including important reforms to \nthe Stafford Act, I am disappointed that the House leadership decided \nto strip out provisions to help disaster-affected communities in other \nparts of the country.\n  Some people have referred to those provisions as ``pork.'' I think we \nshould be careful what we refer to as ``pork'' around here. The \nSenate's provisions were all disaster-related, and this was a disaster \nassistance bill. For communities around the country that have been \nfailed by Federal programs that ignore legitimate disaster-related \nneeds, and failed also by a Congress that continues to underfund or \nzero out Federal disaster accounts, they expect\n\n[[Page S315]]\n\ntheir representatives in Congress to stand up and fight for them to \ndeliver relief.\n  The House of Representatives blocked that relief when it stripped out \n97 percent of the fisheries assistance money, struck language \nauthorizing the Corps of Engineers to address critical needs along the \nMississippi River, and eliminated a provision to correct FEMA's deeply \nflawed Federal formula for local governments' disaster-related debt \nrelief. It was wrong of the House leadership to turn their backs on the \nrest of the country by terminating these provisions, and the record \nshould reflect that fact very clearly.\n  Finally, Madam President, I thank Senator Mikulski for her support of \nthis critical legislation and urge a ``yea'' vote on the bill. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I know there is a lot of passion here on \nthe floor regarding this particular legislation. There is probably not \na Member on this floor who has not had some semblance of a disaster in \nthe State and for the people they represent. Sandy clearly rises to one \nof the top categories of something truly catastrophic, but many of us \nhave experienced tornadoes and destruction and floods and a number of \nother disasters.\n  One of the essential functions of government is to address those in \nimmediate need and meet some of those emergency needs. With the \ncooperation of local and State and Federal authorities stepping up, we \nhave been able to assure the American people that help is on the way, \nand hopefully help is on the way in an expeditious manner so that it \ngets to those who need that emergency help quickly.\n  It is regrettable it has taken this long for some of this money to be \nappropriated. I personally think we could have expedited this had we \ngained support for an amendment I offered in December which would have \nimmediately met those emergency needs, yet given the Congress time to \nwork through the process of examining other aspects of the bill that, \nNo. 1, were not related to Sandy and, No. 2, that fell on various \nMembers' wish lists of things they wanted done for their States. Of \ncourse, that is their responsibility to do so, but we all know that \nwhen we see a train moving out of the station--a bill that is going to \nbe passed and going to become law, there has been a temptation through \nthe years to add unrelated matters in these types of bills knowing it \nis a train leaving the station and ultimately will be supported. We saw \nwhat happened during the fiscal cliff debate. At the last minute, all \nof these egregious examples of spending that had nothing to do with the \nissue itself were tacked on to the final bill.\n  So really what we were trying to talk about here is a process that I \nbelieve and I think a number of Members believe is necessary to vet \nevery spending appropriation that comes before this body to ensure that \nit meets the essential function of government, to ensure that it is not \nloaded with extraneous matters, and to ensure that we are careful with \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  This is not about ideology. This is about some very basic math that \nshows us that we have a decreasing capacity to address these types of \nemergencies and other necessary items like education, medical research, \ntransportation to pave roads and rebuild bridges, and any number of \ndiscretionary items whose value we can debate. That is shrinking \ndramatically. So if we don't apply at least some discipline to how we \nevaluate and examine our spending, we will continue to plunge into debt \nand to borrow money, which is ultimately unsustainable. If we continue \nthis type of spending without proper oversight, I think we are shirking \nour duty to the public.\n  I am not down here to talk against funding for this disaster. I am \ndown here to discuss how we, together, Republicans and Democrats, need \nto apply some discipline to how we make decisions. It has been a time-\nhonored practice here to load up necessary bills with extraneous \nmatters, and it has been a time-honored practice not to provide the \noversight necessary to go back and look at how effectively we have \nspent the taxpayers' dollars in the past and what kinds of things we \ncan do to ensure we don't make those mistakes in the future.\n  I think it is also worthwhile to at least examine the possibility of \npaying for expenditures, particularly when we are borrowing 40 cents of \nevery dollar, when we are careening deeper into debt that the younger \ngenerations are not going to be able to pay off without serious adverse \nconsequences. There is a moral issue here about what kind of country we \nare leaving for the future and what we are turning over to our \nchildren.\n  I think it is worthwhile to at least acknowledge that those of us who \nraise these kinds of questions should not be labeled or targeted as \ntrying to throw people on the street or not respond to legitimate needs \nbut are simply trying to say that we need some standards here to apply \nto a situation where our spending is out of control. Every business in \nAmerica has to do this and has had to do this these past 4 or 5 years \nin order to survive.\n  Families have had to do this in order to make sure they could make \ntheir mortgage payments, or Dad has lost his job. There has been \nenforced discipline on the basis of an economy that has been stagnant \nfor about 4 years. In the meantime, the Federal Government keeps \nplunging into debt.\n  So if someone brings forward an alternative to at least give us the \nopportunity to provide effective oversight and to make sure this money \ndoes go to emergency needs and doesn't just fulfill a wish list for \nwhat some cities would like to do in the future to prevent against \nfuture storms--not that we shouldn't be debating that, but it doesn't \nqualify as the emergency need of getting money to the people who need \nit now. These are future decisions, and we haven't had time to assess \nthose. We haven't had time to examine those in detail, and we haven't \nused a process that is in place in the Senate to go through committees \nand let the committees work through, Is this essential to meeting the \nemergency needs or can we set this aside and spend a little more time \nexamining it and looking at it to make sure this is how we want to go \nforward?\n  We have a habit here of throwing money at things under an emergency \ncategory, and then later finding out that, one, it wasn't an emergency \nwhere the money went; and, two, it was misspent and not effective. We \njust simply can't afford to keep doing this.\n  Once again, I want to state we are not here trying to undermine \nfunding that is needed for Sandy. So I think some of the things the \nHouse did are legitimate in terms of saying let's set aside unrelated \nmatters. It doesn't mean we cast them into the dust bin never to be \nseen again. It simply means let's let those that are not emergency \nsituations be more carefully examined in terms of whether we need that. \nIf someone does come to the floor--as I understand Senator Lee is going \nto do--and offers a potential offset, let's at least look at that \npossibility.\n  The debt clock is ticking, and ticking ever faster, and it is \ndestroying the hopes and dreams of future generations. I think we have \na moral responsibility to at least be as conscious and effective with \ndealing with the taxpayers' dollars in terms of how they are spent, \nwhether it is an emergency supplemental related to a disaster or \nwhether it is just a normal appropriation that comes along every year \nthrough our appropriations process.\n  We haven't exercised that kind of discipline, and our country is \ngoing to pay a very serious series of consequences as a result of that. \nMost importantly, we are denying young people in this country a future \nthat we have enjoyed but we are not going to be able to pass on to \nothers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the chair of the Appropriations \nCommittee for the wonderful job she has done. We have worked together \nas a team, and she has been great. This is her first major bill as \nchair of the Appropriations Committee, and I think it bodes well for \nthe future, if you will, of the strengthening of that committee on into \nthe year as we do appropriations bills.\n  I thank my colleague from Alabama, my gym mate, Senator Shelby, for \nhis help and support. I think he and Senator Mikulski will make a great \nteam\n\n[[Page S316]]\n\nas chair and ranking member on the Appropriations Committee.\n  I thank Mary Landrieu and the other subcommittee chairs. They did an \namazing job for us, and I thank them. Mary's assistance and advice, \ngiven what she went through several years ago in Louisiana with \nKatrina, was invaluable to those of us in New York and New Jersey.\n  Finally, I see Senator Gillibrand is here; Senator Blumenthal is in \nthe chair; in addition, Senator Murphy, Senator Menendez, Senator \nLautenberg--we have all worked as a team, and I thank them for their \nefforts.\n  It has been 91 days since Sandy struck. It has taken far too long, \nbut we are finally one vote away from getting the much needed aid we so \ndesperately depend on in New York and New Jersey. It was 3 months ago \nthat Superstorm Sandy tore up the east coast, obliterating hundreds of \nthousands of homes in New York. It was 91 days ago that this hurricane, \ncoupled with a cold front, uprooted small businesses that are the \nlifeblood of middle-class communities on Long Island, Staten Island, \nQueens, Brooklyn, and Lower Manhattan.\n  As you may recall, Sandy's wrath was wide, and it was deep. Nearly \n300,000 families had their homes damaged or destroyed by Sandy; 131 \npeople were killed, 60 in New York; 2 million individuals lost power; \nand our Nation's public transportation system witnessed catastrophic \nflooding. Despite overwhelming damage from wind and water, snow, and in \nsome neighborhoods even fire, New Yorkers are ready to move forward.\n  Not one day has passed since Sandy made landfall that I haven't heard \nfrom my constituents wondering when Washington will remember them. I \nheard the words of my good friend from Indiana. I know he is a caring \nperson. But for decades, taxpayers from New York have sent their money \nwhen disasters occurred, such as fires on the west coast or floods in \nthe Missouri and Mississippi Valleys, hurricanes in Louisiana or \nFlorida, and other disasters. We have sent our tax dollars--billions of \nthem--and now, all of a sudden, some are suggesting we should change \nthe rules when we are hit by the first major disaster to hit the New \nYork City region in a very long time? That is not fair. That is not \nright. We have argued against it, and I hope my colleagues will defeat \nthe Lee amendment.\n  I also say to my colleagues that this is not just about dollars and \ncents. This is about people who care and are waiting--homeowners who \nare waiting to rebuild their homes so they can move back into them. \nThis is about small business owners who are hanging on by a thread \nafter building a business for 25 years. We know when the hand of God \nstrikes, it is overwhelming.\n  Take Rita from Emerald Magic Lawn Care. Her company helps local \nfamilies, schools, and businesses with lawn care in the spring and \nsummer, and around the holidays they help with decorations and \nlights. But Emerald Magic's business was interrupted for many weeks, \nand the client base dried up. Rita's business will be in huge trouble. \nIt may not survive if she doesn't get a lifeline--and get one now. So \nthis is very important.\n\n  Week after week, month after month, New Yorkers have been told this \nis ``a waiting game.'' That is not an answer we can live with, and \nneither can they. We can't wait any longer because nothing about this \ndisaster was a game for the family in Breezy Point or in Rockaway or in \nLong Island or in Queens or Staten Island. It wasn't a game for them or \nfor the more than 265,000 small businesses whose doors are currently \nshuttered or the hundreds of thousands of homeowners who have severe \ndamage to their homes. Many don't have their homes anymore. They can't \nwait either.\n  And they are not the only ones. Our schools and hospitals are still \ncombating Sandy-related repairs. The damage to our roads and transit \nsystems hasn't gone away in 3 months. Our coastline must be rebuilt so \nwe are not naked if, God forbid, another Sandy occurs. New York has \nwaited, but we can't wait any longer.\n  We know too well that when a major disaster strikes, it is too much \nfor any one State or any one region to tackle. But that is what we have \nbeen left to do so far in New York, and I know the same goes for my \ncolleagues in New Jersey. So Senators Lautenberg, Menendez, Gillibrand, \nand I are making a plea to our colleagues: Please, we have waited 91 \nlong days. We can't wait any longer. Simply put, we must pass this bill \ntoday. Ninety-one days ago, Sandy struck a body blow against New York. \nToday, finally, we can strike back and give our people the help they \nneed to get back on their feet and rebuild our communities.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to continue this discussion about \nSuperstorm Sandy.\n  I start by saying there isn't any doubt whatsoever about the severity \nof this tragedy or about the human suffering. It is absolutely the case \nthat the needed emergency money should have been there already. There \nis a real, genuine need, and that need needs to be met. That is part of \nthe reason I voted in favor of spending $24 billion, which could \nlegitimately prescribe the kind of emergency funding that suffering \npeople needed.\n  But I am concerned about two things: One is the fact that some people \nhave used the occasion of the misery these people are suffering through \nto add on all kinds of spending that has absolutely nothing to do with \nSuperstorm Sandy, and none of it is offset. So we have a $1.1 trillion \nbudget deficit, and we are just adding another $60 billion right on top \nof that.\n  These are the items I would suggest that certainly don't have much to \ndo with Superstorm Sandy: $15 million for NASA repairs at the Kennedy \nSpace Center in Florida; $274 million for the Coast Guard acquisitions \nin the Bahamas and Great Lakes; $2 million for Smithsonian repairs. \nThen there is another whole category of items, which is tens of \nbillions of dollars, which is long-term construction projects for the \nmitigation against future storms and disasters.\n  Is that an important expenditure by the Federal Government? It \nprobably is. It probably should be a high priority. But is it an \nemergency? Of course not. It is infrastructure. It is going to be spent \nover years, maybe decades, as we build seawalls to protect beaches off \nthe coast from future storms which are years away.\n  Is that an important consideration? I think it is. But when we are \nrunning trillion-dollar deficits, I think it has to compete with the \nother legitimate demands for long-term spending and infrastructure \nspending and the ways that we are going to protect our country as well. \nBut we have no such process here. And that is part of what is wrong. \nThat is part of what is wrong with this town and why we are in such a \nmess. It is because this body--and Congress generally--just refuses to \nmake choices.\n  So I can understand completely all of this money being spent, if that \nis the determination that every one of these projects that have nothing \nto do with Sandy still nevertheless need to be funded. But couldn't we \noffset that by trimming spending elsewhere so that we don't further \naccelerate this decline? We are heading toward a fiscal crisis. \nUnfortunately, I guess not--unless we adopt the Lee amendment.\n  The Lee amendment says let's trim all discretionary spending by one-\nhalf of 1 percent over the next 9 years. So can we find half a penny of \nevery dollar that we would otherwise spend so that we would fully fund \neverything in this bill. Not a dime would get cut from this bill, but \nwe wouldn't add to our deficit and further accelerate this path we are \non to a fiscal crisis.\n  We don't have to wait any longer. We can do this right now. We don't \nhave to cut a dime from this bill; we can fully fund this bill. But at \nsome point we need to start making choices around here. At some point \nwe can't just have everything. That is how you get trillion-dollar \ndeficits. That is how you end up like Greece.\n  So I would just suggest, let's pass this bill. Let's spend all the \nmoney in the Sandy supplemental. But let's offset it with a cut of one-\nhalf of 1 percent in discretionary spending over the next 9 years. That \nis what the Lee amendment does, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n[[Page S317]]\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I thank Senator Mikulski for her \nleadership, not only leading the charge for aid that our families in \nNew York so desperately need but, as chair of the Appropriations \nCommittee, making sure this bill is as strong as it possibly can be. I \nagree with her remarks that the bill would have been better if they \nleft in place what the Senate had written, but I thank the chairwoman \nfor her dedication to helping our families and businesses recover. It \nhas made such a difference.\n  I also thank Senator Landrieu for her experience and expertise in \nmeeting the needs of States devastated by natural disasters. She has \nhad to live through these tragedies before. She knows what it is like \nto talk to constituents whose loved ones have been lost, whose families \nand businesses have been destroyed and torn apart, and whose lives are \njust in the beginning of being rebuilt. I thank her for what she has \ndone.\n  I thank Senator Menendez, who will be following me with remarks, and \nSenator Lautenberg, and Senator Chuck Schumer for the work he has done \non behalf of New Yorkers, being a clarion call for common sense and \nimmediate action and for bringing our colleagues together to meet the \nneeds of so many families who are so much in need.\n  I rise today to urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to \nsupport our efforts to finally come to the relief of millions of \nAmericans who are suffering in the wake of Superstorm Sandy. New \nYorkers in my home State have had to wait far too long for Congress to \nact.\n  Superstorm Sandy was a weather event unlike anything we in New York \nhave ever seen before. It claimed the lives of 60 New Yorkers, left \nhundreds of thousands with significant damage to their homes and their \nbusinesses, their neighborhoods and their families. This body came \ntogether just before the New Year to provide the desperately needed aid \nfamilies require to rebuild their homes, their businesses, and their \nlives; the aid our small businesses so desperately need to get their \nbusinesses up and running, the lifeblood of our communities flowing \nagain, and getting our families back on their feet.\n  This bill should be neither controversial nor partisan. We have \nalready debated and passed an almost identical package that was passed \nby the Republican-led House of Representatives. Once again, the \nAmerican people are watching us to see if we can come together and \nstand by families in need, just as we have done for every natural \ndisaster in our Nation's history. They are watching once again to see \nif this body will do the right thing or turn its back on them and not \ngive them the support they need to rebuild.\n  This was always an emergency spending bill. It is an emergency, it is \nurgent, and it needs our action now. We have to seize the opportunity \nwithout causing any further delay and we have to show the American \npeople that we can rise on an occasion such as this, when duty calls, \nto do the right thing. I assure you, there is no one who wants to spend \na single cent more than is actually necessary, which is why we took \nsuch pains and effort to make sure this bill was transparent, had \naccountability and the right kind of oversight. We are urging that we \nfully fund this proposal that was so carefully put together.\n  Since 1989, Congress has passed 36 emergency appropriations bills for \ndisaster relief without specifically designating any offsets. There is \nno reason why we should treat this disaster, this emergency, this \nhorror, any differently than we have past disasters.\n  When disasters do strike, we have always found the good will and the \ncare for one another to do what is right. Protecting people, looking \nafter them, making sure they are safe, allowing businesses to grow is \nwhat we should be doing. Our Federal Government's role is to protect \nthe people first. It is our duty as public servants.\n  I urge my colleagues once again, find that good will, help others, do \nthe right thing.\n\n\n                            Working Together\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to engage in a colloquy with the Senator from \nMaryland, the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, as well as \nthe Senator from New Jersey, Senator Menendez.\n  I thank the chairwoman for her leadership in bringing the disaster \nsupplemental appropriations bill to the Senate floor to address the \nurgent recovery needs of New York, New Jersey, and the rest of the \nNortheast that was affected by Superstorm Sandy. It is my hope we will \npass this bill quickly so that our communities can begin to rebuild.\n  It is also important that as we rebuild, agencies of the Federal \nGovernment work in a collaborative way, across agencies and in concert \nwith our State and local governments. We should not have multiple \nagencies studying the same problem separately, but rather the Federal \nGovernment should be working together to develop the best models for \nrebuilding our battered coasts as well as planning for the long-term \nsustainability and resilience of these vulnerable areas.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I agree completely with Senator \nGillibrand's sense of urgency regarding this vitally needed plan. I \nalso know that my good friend from New York and I agree on the need to \nrecognize and, to the greatest extent possible, to enhance the value of \nour coastal natural resources to the recovery of our storm-ravaged \ncommunities.\n  It is our understanding--and we request the Chair's clarification--\nthat the language we have before us directs the Army Corps of Engineers \nto take the integrated, collaborative approach discussed by the Senator \nfrom New York. It is our hope and expectation that the Corps will go \nwell beyond the usual level of coordination in order to take maximum \nadvantage of the expertise and commitment its Federal and non-Federal \npartners bring to this legislation's explicit goals of flood risk \nreduction and ecological sustainability.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I appreciate the Senators from New York and New Jersey \nraising this issue. The language in the bill we currently have before \nus directs the Army Corps to conduct their study in coordination with \nother Federal agencies, and State, local and Tribal officials. It is \nthe intent of Congress for the Army Corps of Engineers to adopt a \nmultiagency approach and work in close collaboration with other \nrelevant agencies in studying and planning for the reconstruction of \nthe coastal areas destroyed by Superstorm Sandy. In making its \nsupplemental funding request to Congress, the Administration \nspecifically requested funding for an ``inter-agency planning process \nin conjunction with State, local, and Tribal officials, and to develop \nplans to address long-standing challenges and ensure the health and \nprosperity of the areas affected by Sandy . . . for innovative \napproaches to reduce the future flood risk, in ways that will promote \nthe long-term sustainability of the coastal ecosystem and \ncommunities.'' It is our expectation that the administration would \nadopt that approach with the funding provided in this legislation.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I thank the chairwoman for making this \nclarification. It is my hope that as the Army Corps and other agencies \nwork to assess the region's needs post-Sandy, they will work \ncollaboratively to develop the best techniques to rebuild our coasts to \nreduce flood risks and provide for long-term sustainability of the \ncoastal ecosystem.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Again, I agree with my friend from New York. I would \nalso note that this collaborative study should take into account the \nparticular needs of disadvantaged communities within our States, many \nof which face unique challenges as they seek to reverse the damages of \nthis storm and to prevent future catastrophes. These communities were \namong the most damaged by this storm and the Army Corps, the Department \nof Housing and Urban Development, and other Federal agencies would be \nremiss not to carefully consider, and balance, the needs of these \nunderserved residents with the need to rebuild commercial areas and \ncritical infrastructure, including industrial facilities, along our \ncoastline. I would urge all agencies funded in this bill to provide for \nthe special needs of these neighborhoods and the shorelines which they \ndepend on.\n\n\n                         Great Lakes Navigation\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Hurricane Sandy was one of the costliest \nstorms in our Nation's history, resulting in at least 125 deaths, the \ndestruction of tens\n\n[[Page S318]]\n\nof thousands of homes and businesses, electricity losses for millions \nof people, disruption of fuel supplies, and devastating damage to \npublic infrastructure. When Hurricane Sandy struck land on October 29, \nhurricane-force winds covered 900 miles, wreaking havoc across a broad \nstretch of the Eastern seaboard. While the impact of Hurricane Sandy \nwas most severe in New Jersey and New York, the storm impacted 24 \nStates, including Michigan. Across the Great Lakes, gale force winds \ncaused damage to breakwaters and silted in harbors and channels. On \nLake Huron, wave heights reached 23 feet, in Lake Michigan the waves \npeaked at 22 feet, and the storm caused waves of 14 feet in Lake Erie.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The storm was one of the most devastating in our \nNation's history, and the assistance that is so needed to address the \nwidespread damage is long past due.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The supplemental appropriations bill before us today \nincludes $821 million for necessary expenses related to Hurricane Sandy \nto dredge Federal navigation channels and repair damage to Corps \nprojects. Great Lakes channels, harbors, breakwaters, and piers were \ndamaged by gale-force winds caused by Hurricane Sandy. The Army Corps \nof Engineers estimates damage to the Great Lakes System of $17 million, \nincluding in my State of Michigan. This system transports over 160 \nmillion tons of commodities and hundreds of thousands of jobs are tied \nto the system. It is vital that repairs be made promptly. Madam \nChairwoman, will these Great Lakes navigational projects damaged by \nHurricane Sandy be eligible for some of the $821 million in funding?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes. The funding is for necessary expenses related to \nthe consequences of Hurricane Sandy, and since Great Lakes Federal \nnavigation projects were damaged as a result of that storm, they would \nindeed be eligible.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator for her assurances.\n  Mr. President, I will vote in support of the disaster assistance bill \nto aid the victims of Hurricane Sandy, who number in the millions. \nHurricane Sandy covered over 900 miles, took over 125 lives, destroyed \nhomes and businesses, demolished breakwaters, piers, boardwalks, and \nother infrastructure, and left millions without transportation. This \nsuperstorm occurred nearly 3 months ago, and assistance is long past \ndue for the victims who remain homeless and communities trying to \nrebuild.\n  Hurricane Sandy left such far-reaching devastation that its \ndestruction reached into the Great Lakes. Gale force winds across the \nGreat Lakes caused damage to breakwaters and silted in harbors and \nchannels. The bill before us provides $821 million to dredge Federal \nnavigation channels and repair damage to Corps projects impacted by \nHurricane Sandy. I entered into a colloquy with Chairwoman Mikulski to \nensure that the damage incurred to Great Lakes harbors as a result of \nHurricane Sandy would be eligible for that funding. I thank Senator \nMikulski for clarifying that funding could go to the Great Lakes, and I \nhope the Corps will prioritize funding for those Great Lakes projects, \nwhich are estimated to require about $17 million in repairs.\n  We have a responsibility to help our fellow Americans who have lost \nhomes and businesses through no fault of their own, and I hope we will \npass this bill and immediately send it to the President for his \nsignature. Hurricane Sandy is estimated to be the second or third most \ncostly disaster in U.S. history. We need to provide the assistance \npromptly to those affected by Hurricane Sandy.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of efforts to restore \nto the supplemental appropriations bill $150 million in disaster \nfunding for officially declared fisheries disasters. The bill that the \nSenate passed in December, with overwhelming bipartisan support, \nincluded this $150 million in necessary disaster funding to address \nfederally declared fisheries disasters. Unfortunately, the bill before \nus, passed by the House, did not include this critical funding.\n  It is important to note that this funding would be used to respond to \nfishery disasters declared by the Acting Commerce Secretary in 2012 \nunder the authority provided by the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries \nConservation and Management Act and the Interjurisdictional Fisheries \nAct. This is authorized funding in response to declared disasters.\n  The funding for declared fisheries disasters is necessary to address \nthe devastating economic consequences of significant projected \nreductions in the total allowable catch for critical groundfish stocks. \nIn September of last year, the Acting Secretary of Commerce, \nrecognizing the economic difficulty that fishing communities have and \nwill continue to face, declared a Federal fisheries disaster for Maine, \nRhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, and Connecticut \nfor the 2013 fishing year.\n  Fishing is more than just a profession in New England. Fishing is a \nway of life and a significant part of Maine's heritage. There are 45 \nvessels based in Maine that are actively fishing with Federal \ngroundfish permits. Last year, more than 5 million pounds of \ngroundfish, with a dockside value approaching $5.8 million, were landed \nin Maine. The projected reductions, which may be as high as 73 percent, \ncould devastate these fishing communities and come despite strict \nadherence to rigorous management practices by fishermen.\n  The requested funding would be used to provide economic relief to the \nregion's struggling groundfish industry and to make targeted \ninvestments that will allow the fleet to survive and become more \nsustainable in the years ahead. These funds could also be productively \nused to fully cover the costs of at-sea monitoring and to address long-\nterm overcapacity in the fishing industry. This is critical to \nrebuilding fish stocks and preserving a thriving fishing industry well \ninto the future.\n  Slow recovery and declining fish stocks continue to have a negative \nimpact on commercial fishing, harming local communities and economies. \nThis Federal disaster assistance is vital to the long-term success and \nshort-term survival of fishing communities throughout the region.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, after so much time has passed due to the \ndelay in consideration by the other body, it is critical that we move \nahead to provide needed assistance to communities in the Northeast that \nwere affected by Superstorm Sandy.\n  I want to commend Chairwoman Mikulski, as well as our late colleague, \nChairman Inouye, for their leadership in developing a bipartisan bill \nthat would have provided critical assistance to respond to the \nhurricane and its aftermath, as well as other disasters. Indeed, the \nbill that passed the Senate last year was a superior product. It is \nregrettable that bill is not before us again today.\n  The Senate bill would have delivered a significant amount of relief \nto communities in New York and New Jersey, while recognizing the \nsubstantial challenges faced by the other ten States that received \nmajor disaster declarations due to the storm. For example, the Senate \nbill included $810 million in water infrastructure grants to address \nthe $2.8 billion in Sandy-related water infrastructure needs identified \nby the Environmental Protection Agency, allocating a minimum of 2 \npercent to each affected State.\n  In addition, the Senate bill would have required the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development--HUD--to establish minimum allocations of \nCommunity Development Block Grant--CDBG--funds so that every State that \nwas hit by Sandy would receive funding to address its impacts. Finally, \nthe bill included $150 million to address a series of fisheries \ndisasters that were declared in 2012.\n  Regrettably, the House, after failing to bring a bill to the floor \nbefore the end of the 112th Congress, went in a different direction on \nthese matters. The House bill cuts funding for water infrastructure by \n$210 million and limits funding to only two States, setting a dangerous \nprecedent that Congress will provide assistance to some States that are \naffected by a disaster but not to others. With respect to CDBG funding, \nthe House bill provides no minimum allocation and no assurance that \nStates with significant damages from Sandy will receive the assistance \nthey need. Paradoxically, the bill threatens to dilute assistance for \nSandy by making the CDBG funding available for all disasters that \noccurred in 2011, 2012, and\n\n[[Page S319]]\n\n2013 even though funding had been provided for some of these disasters \nin earlier appropriations laws. Finally, as fishermen from New York to \nMaine face dramatic catch reductions, the House bill strips the $150 \nmillion in fisheries disaster funding from the bill.\n  While it is unfortunate that the House bill makes these changes, the \npeople of the Northeast should not be forced to wait any longer for the \nhelp this bill does provide. This includes much needed funds for \nhighway, port and harbor repairs, as well as repairs to national parks \nand wildlife refuges. Equally important is funding to begin the long-\nterm analysis and work to help prevent this kind of damage from \noccurring again. Even as I continue to believe we should be able to do \nmore, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, when we debated the Hurricane Sandy \nSupplemental bill in the Senate prior to Christmas, I was unable to \nsupport the spending bill because much of the taxpayer funding in the \nbill had little or nothing to do with meeting the immediate needs of \nindividuals misplaced by Hurricane Sandy. Unfortunately, not much has \nchanged with the House bill that we will soon vote on. At a time when \nwe face ongoing trillion-dollar deficits and a $16.4 trillion debt, we \ncannot justify this type of spending.\n  While some of the projects included in this bill may hold merit on \ntheir own, many of the projects included should go through the normal \nbudget and appropriations process, where Congress has time to vet the \nneed for such spending requests. To drive home this point, the \nCongressional Budget Office--CBO--analysis of the bill tells us that \nonly 7 percent of the funding in this bill will be spent this year--FY \n2013--and roughly 70 percent of the funding will not be spent until FY \n2015 and beyond.\n  After examining this bill, I have found numerous examples of \nquestionable spending:\n  Millions to replace automobiles owned by the Federal Government, \nincluding:\n  $1 million for DEA to replace 15 vehicles;\n   $230,000 for ATF to replace three vehicles;\n  $300,000 for the Secret Service vehicles; and\n  $855,000 for ICE vehicles.\n  The Federal Government currently owns or leases over 660,000 \nvehicles--surely we can find replacements within our current inventory. \nShouldn't we focus on providing relief directly to those still trying \nto rebuild their lives before replacing a bureaucrat's car?\n  There is $16 billion for Community Development Block Grant funds for \n47 States and Puerto Rico that can be used for events in 2011, 2012 and \n2013.\n  There is $2 million to repair damage to the roofs of museums in \nWashington, D.C., while many in Hurricane Sandy's path still have no \npermanent roof over their own heads.\n  The bill includes $50 million for National Park Service Historic \nPreservation grants, which was not included in the President's request; \n$180 million for the Department of Agriculture's Emergency Watershed \nProtection program, which helps restore watersheds damaged by wildfires \nand droughts for areas including Colorado; highway funding for the \nVirgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the \nNorthern Mariana Islands; $15 million for NASA facilities, though NASA \nitself has called its damage from the hurricane ``minimal.'' On the day \nafter the storm hit, NASA's Wallops Island put out a statement stating \nthat ``an initial assessment team surveyed roads and facilities at \nNASA's Wallops Flight Facility today reporting a number of downed trees \nbut otherwise minimal impact in the wake of Hurricane Sandy.''\n  The bill includes $111 million for a weather satellite data \nmitigation gap reserve fund, a controversial program created by \nPresident Obama by executive order for ocean zoning planning; $8.5 \nmillion for weather forecasting equipment; $23 million for the USDA \n``Forest Restoration Program'' for planting trees on private property. \nThis program is actually a Farm Bill subsidy program that's run by a \nrelatively unknown agency called the ``Farm Service Administration'' \nwhich is primarily responsible for managing crop insurance. Under this \nprogram, private landowners with about 50 acres of land can apply for \nup to $500,000 in free grants for tree planting activities.\n  The bill also includes $118 million for taxpayer-supported AMTRAK, \n$86 million more than the President's request. While some of the \nfunding will go for repairs, money will also go to increasing passenger \ncapacity to New York and future mitigation efforts. In a 2-page letter \nfrom AMTRAK that gives a broad description of how the money will be \nspent, almost all of it falls under funding for future capital \nprojects. This includes funding for the ``Gateway Program.''\n  According to AMTRAK, the Gateway Program, which was started in 2011 \nand is projected to cost over $13 billion, is ``a comprehensive program \nof infrastructure improvements to increase track, tunnel, bridge, and \nstation capacity serving New York City that will improve current assets \nand allow the eventual doubling of passenger trains into Manhattan.'' I \nam not here to debate the merits or the need for new tunnels, but this \nis clearly a capital improvement project--unrelated to Hurricane Sandy.\n  AMTRAK is up and running so it is not apparent why this funding is \ndeemed ``emergency'' spending and included in this spending package. \nKeep in mind, AMTRAK receives roughly $1 billion in annual funding. \nFuture mitigation projects should be debated in next year's budget \nprocess.\n  The bill includes $100 million for Head Start; $1 million for Legal \nServices Corporation; $3.5 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers--\nwith little clarity on how the money will be spent. More projects are \nnot something the Army Corps can handle. They are currently \nexperiencing a backlog of construction and maintenance projects of \napproximately $70 billion. Furthermore, a 2010 report released by the \nGovernment Accountability Office noted that carryover funds have \nincreased ``due to the large amount of supplemental funding the Corps \nhas received in recent years.'' Clearly, supplemental spending on the \nArmy Corps has not paid off.\n  As a nation, we are $16.4 trillion in debt and dealing with trillion-\ndollar deficits. We do need to come to the aid of those who lost \neverything in Hurricane Sandy and are struggling to get their lives \nback together. Congress, however, cannot continue down this road of \nirresponsible spending. We must pass a true disaster spending bill that \nonly spends money on disaster recovery and response, not pet projects.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, Hurricane Sandy was the most devastating \nstorm to hit the northeast United States in recorded history. \nRebuilding after the storm will be a formidable challenge and this aid \nbill will go a long way towards meeting that challenge.\n  When Hurricane Sandy struck the East Coast, it flooded electrical \nsubstations and knocked down trees onto power lines, shutting off power \nfor 8.2 million customers, and causing billions of dollars in damage. \nOver 300,000 homes in New York City and 72,000 homes and businesses in \nNew Jersey were damaged or destroyed. Four New York City hospitals had \nto shut their doors.\n  The storm sent floodwater gushing into New York's five boroughs, \nflooding tunnels and the subway system and making the equipment \ninoperable. In many hard-hit areas wireless networks suffered \nwidespread outages primarily due to lack of power.\n  When smart technologies are in place, power outages can be avoided \nand lives, homes and businesses are protected. As the massive \nrebuilding effort gets under way, decision makers should rebuild the \nsmart way by ensuring that reconstruction funds maximize the deployment \nof technologies to improve the resilience of the electric grid, \nmitigate future power outages and ensure continued operation of \nfacilities critical to public health, safety and welfare. Resilient and \nreliable power is critical for first responders, communications, health \ncare, transportation, financial systems, homeland security, water and \nwaste-water treatment, emergency food and shelter, and other vital \nservices.\n  Examples of relevant technologies include smart grid technologies to \nisolate problems and repair them remotely, such as smart meters, high-\ntech sensors, grid monitoring and control systems, and remote \nreconfiguration and redundancy systems;\n\n[[Page S320]]\n\nmicrogrids, energy storage, distributed and backup generation to power \ncritical facilities and operations; wiring, cabling, submersible and \nother distribution components and enclosures to prevent outages; and \nelectronic controlled re-closers and similar technologies for power \nrestoration.\n  The funding provided by the Hurricane Sandy disaster relief \nappropriations bill should enable these States to wisely make cost-\neffective investments in these technologies for their long-term \ninfrastructure resiliency. Rebuilding these essential infrastructure \nsystems with technology that is equipped to deal with extreme weather \nshould make recovery from any future storm faster, cheaper, and better.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, several weeks ago, before the end of the \n112th Congress, the Senate voted to help the victims of Hurricane Sandy \nwith a supplemental appropriations bill. The $60.4 billion supplemental \nemergency bill passed in the Senate by a vote of 62-32. Unfortunately, \nthe House did not pass the bill before the end of the 112th Congress, \nand we must pass this bill again.\n  This aid is desperately needed. Hurricane Sandy ranks second only to \nHurricane Katrina in terms of damage. Insurers estimate that the damage \nwill make the storm the sixth costliest in the world for their \nindustry.\n  In New York and New Jersey, more than 651,000 homes were damaged or \ndestroyed, 463,000 businesses were hurt and need assistance. Hundreds \nof miles of roads and rail were damaged and will need to be repaired. \nWe have a responsibility to help our fellow Americans recover from this \ndisaster. Congress has always stepped up and helped States and \ncommunities deal with natural disasters.\n  Hurricane Sandy is also a time for us to be honest, face facts, and \nstate the obvious: the climate is changing. The weather is getting \nworse extreme weather events are happening with increased frequency and \nintensity. It's time for Congress to get serious about addressing the \ncauses and effects of climate change we can no longer afford to ignore \nthis issue.\n  The vast majority of Americans view the recent extreme weather events \nas evidence that the problem of global warming is no longer some vague \nor distant threat. In a recent poll, nearly 4 out of 5 Americans stated \nthat they now think temperatures are rising and that global warming \nwill be a serious problem if nothing is done about it. The existence of \nmanmade climate change is not a debatable issue for the overwhelming \nmajority of scientists more than 98 percent of all working climate \nscientists believe that human activities have led to climate change.\n  Over the previous decades, scientists have measured a consistent \nincrease in global temperatures, which has led to rising sea levels, \nwarmer air and, as a result, more extreme weather. The National \nClimatic Data Center just announced 2012 was the hottest year on record \nin the continental United States. Our changing climate means that the \nstorms and heat waves we are seeing will become stronger and more \nextreme in the future causing greater amounts of damage.\n  The insurance and defense sectors have looked at this scientific data \nand are making some changes. They are adjusting their operations to \nprepare for worse weather and bigger losses. Nationwide, the financial \nconsequences of weather-related disasters and climate change hit a \nhistoric new high last year U.S. disasters caused over $55 billion in \ndamages.\n  The federal government needs to re-think how we protect federal \nassets and provide disaster assistance to communities on a more regular \nbasis. And right now, passing this bill for supplemental appropriations \nfor Sandy victims is a great first step. Because in addition to \nproviding aid to help re-build houses, schools, and business, the bill \nalso includes billions for mitigation programs. Mitigation programs \nhelp us rebuild in a way that's smarter than the first time, adding \ndefenses against storms and protecting property by moving it out of \nflood zones or rebuilding with flood protection features.\n  These policies make sense. They better prepare us for the next big \nstorm, and they will save a lot of taxpayer money by reducing the \ndamage of the next disaster.\n  After that, we in the Senate need to face the reality of greenhouse \ngas emissions and create energy and environmental policies that reduce \ntheir destructive impact, including investments in renewable energy and \npollution control technologies.\n  The President challenged all of us in his inaugural address to \nrespond to the threat of climate change, ``knowing that the failure to \ndo so would betray our children and future generations.'' We need to \nanswer the President's challenge by passing this bill now and passing \nclimate change legislation soon that will help us leave a sustainable \nplanet to our children and grandchildren.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 4\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk. I ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To offset the cost of the bill with rescissions and \n                     discretionary cap reductions)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. ____. (a)(1) There is hereby rescinded an amount equal \n     to .49 percent of--\n       (A) the budget authority provided (or obligation limitation \n     imposed) for fiscal year 2013 for any discretionary account \n     in any fiscal year 2013 appropriation Act;\n       (B) the budget authority provided in any advance \n     appropriation for fiscal year 2013 for any discretionary \n     account in any prior fiscal year appropriation Act; and\n       (C) the contract authority provided in fiscal year 2013 for \n     any program that is subject to a limitation contained in any \n     fiscal year 2013 appropriation Act for any discretionary \n     account.\n       (2) Any rescission made by paragraph (1) shall be applied \n     proportionately--\n       (A) to each discretionary account and each item of budget \n     authority described in such paragraph; and\n       (B) within each such account and item, to each program, \n     project, and activity (with programs, projects, and \n     activities as delineated in the appropriation Act or \n     accompanying reports for the relevant fiscal year covering \n     such account or item, or for accounts and items not included \n     in appropriation Acts, as delineated in the most recently \n     submitted President's budget).\n       (3) In the case of any fiscal year 2013 appropriation Act \n     enacted after the date of enactment of this section, any \n     rescission required by paragraph (1) shall take effect \n     immediately after the enactment of such Act.\n       (4) Within 30 days after the date of enactment of this \n     subsection (or, if later, 30 days after the enactment of any \n     fiscal year 2013 appropriation Act), the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget shall submit to the \n     Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives \n     and the Senate a report specifying the account and amount of \n     each rescission made pursuant to paragraph (1).\n       (b) The discretionary caps provided in section 251(c) of \n     the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of \n     1985, as modified by section 251A of such Act, are reduced as \n     follows for the respective fiscal year and the respective \n     category:\n       (1) for fiscal year 2014--\n       (A) $2,704,800,000 in security; and\n       (B) $2,497,400,000 in non-security;\n       (2) for fiscal year 2015--\n       (A) $2,773,400,000 in security; and\n       (B) $2,548,000,000 in non-security;\n       (3) for fiscal year 2016--\n       (A) $2,827,300,000 in security; and\n       (B) $2,597,000,000 in non-security;\n       (4) fiscal year 2017--\n       (A) $2,891,000,000 in security; and\n       (B) $2,650,900,000 in non-security;\n       (5) for fiscal year 2018--\n       (A) $2,954,700,000 in security; and\n       (B) $2,709,700,000 in non-security;\n       (6) for fiscal year 2019--\n       (A) $3,018,400,000 in security; and\n       (B) $2,773,400,000 in non-security;\n       (7) for fiscal year 2020--\n       (A) $3,087,000,000 in security; and\n       (B) $2,832,200,000 in non-security; and\n       (8) for fiscal year 2021--\n       (A) $3,155,600,000 in security; and\n       (B) $2,891,000,000 in non-security;\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I stand today and urge my colleagues' support \nfor my amendment to this bill. I appreciate the eloquent arguments made \nby my friend and colleague, the Senator from New York, a moment ago. \nShe is correct to point out that people have suffered as a result of \nthis storm. My heart goes out to them. Anytime my fellow Americans find \nthemselves in a position of need, we want to address that situation \nvery carefully and make sure we do the right thing, make sure people \nare not overlooked.\n\n[[Page S321]]\n\n  As we do that, and especially as we do something such as that in the \nway we are being asked to do it here, we must also consider how our \nactions here might have other implications down the road. We have to \nstop and consider that we are more than $16 trillion in debt and we are \nadding to that debt at a rate of more than $1 trillion every single \nyear. The amount of money we spend in interest on our national debt now \nstands at a little over $200 billion a year and is expected to grow \nsignificantly in the next few years, such that by the end of this \ndecade--perhaps much sooner--we are likely to be paying close to $1 \ntrillion a year just to pay the interest on our national debt.\n  It is because of considerations such as these that we put in place \ncertain spending caps, in connection with the Budget Control Act, in \nthe summer of 2011. It is for this same reason I am asking that we \nconsider capping this, subjecting this same amount, this money we are \nbeing asked to spend here, to the same caps. In other words, what I am \nsuggesting is that we find a way to offset our spending for this bill \nby stretching it out over the next 9 years, capping what we spend. All \nwe have to do to offset what we are being asked to spend here is to cut \nour discretionary spending by one-half of 1 percent over the next 9 \nyears.\n  As we look at our economic realities, as we look at the fact it is \ngoing to be very difficult in coming years to fund everything we need \nto do through the Federal Government, this is the approach we have to \ntake with regard to new spending. If we are being asked to spend money, \nno matter how important the cause, to the tune of more than $50 billion \nin one fell swoop, I think we owe it to the good people of the United \nStates of America, the good people who depend on so many things the \nFederal Government does--things as wide ranging as defense at one end \nof the spectrum and entitlements at the other end of the spectrum and \neverything in between--we owe it to them to consider how our actions \ntoday might forestall, might complicate, might impair our ability to \nfund those programs down the road. It is for this reason I think we \nneed to offset this spending. We can do it by cutting only one-half of \n1 percent of our discretionary spending over the next 9 years. For that \nreason I urge each of my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the distinguished \nchair of the Appropriations Committee for all of her incredible work \nand help here, as well as that of the staff, in bringing us to this \nmoment. We would not be here without her tremendous work, especially in \nlight of Chairman Inouye's passing. I appreciate the ranking member, \nsomeone who understands the challenges, having come from a Gulf State \nthat saw the consequences of disasters.\n  There are a couple of important dates here. The first one is 91 days, \n91 days since Superstorm Sandy hit the Northeast; 91 days we have been \nlanguishing, waiting for our Government to respond to the critical \nissues, life-and-death situations, of fellow Americans. It is 91 days \nin which people who largely lost their home, or at least the ability to \nbe back in their home, have been waiting for their government to say: \nHere is how we are going to help you. It is 91 days in which we now \nhave the biting cold of the winter and the defenselessness of a \ncoastline that cannot be subject to a northeaster that will ultimately \nhave real-life consequences to people's lives, to people's properties, \nto repetitive loss.\n  It is 91 days compared to what happened during Hurricane Katrina, \nwhere $60 billion was moved in 11; 91 days in which people have not \nbeen able to get their lives back on track, looking to their \ngovernment--people who are good citizens, pay their taxes, obey the \nrules, follow the law, and ultimately say: We have been left behind. It \nis enough.\n  Another 118 days. That is all we have left to Memorial Day and the \nbeginning of a critically important season for New Jersey's economy, a \n$37 billion tourism industry that cannot get back on its feet unless \nthe Federal Government says here is how we are going to help businesses \nreopen, here is how we are going to help people get back into their \nhomes, here is how we are going to help you rebuild the infrastructure \nthat is not only important to the economy of the State but to the \nnational economy, for which New Jersey and of course New York are such \nbig drivers--well over 10 to 11 percent. We only have 118 days and we \nhave been languishing.\n  I personally am tired of listening to the voices for patience and \ndelay, suggesting that somehow we as citizens of the United States are \nsecond-class citizens waiting for this government to respond to the \nneeds of fellow Americans. That is not what I envision when I think \nabout the United States of America.\n  Another number: 36 times; 36 times in which we in fact have looked at \nan emergency in this Nation squarely in the face and said it is an \nemergency. An emergency is an emergency is an emergency. For over two \ndecades the Congress has looked at this set of disasters and said it is \nan emergency. But when it comes to the Northeast, somehow it is not an \nemergency, 91 days later.\n  Offsets? We didn't have offsets for those over two decades. And when \nwe talk about these offsets we use the words discretionary spending. I \nthink America should know what it means. It means education, it means \nhealth care, it means the National Institutes of Health, it means law \nenforcement, it means a whole host of things we care about in our lives \nevery day, across-the-board cuts, indiscriminate, without anything \nabout what the consequences are--only when it comes to the Northeast.\n  I want my colleagues to understand that personally this Senator will \njudge the future by how we are ultimately responded to. We already feel \nchagrined but it is what it is. We need to act today. Adoption of this \namendment would not only create an across-the-board cut that has \nconsequences to critical things Americans broadly depend on and does it \nindiscriminately, but also sets us farther back because we would have \nto go back to the House again, delays and more delays. I cannot look in \nthe face of any American, whether in my State or any State in the \ncountry, and say, no, your government has abandoned you, you will have \nto wait. I cannot look at business owners who are making a life \ndecision about whether what little they have they can reinvest and \nwhether they will get any help from the government to open, hire \npeople, and contribute to our economy. I cannot look in the face of a \nfellow New Jerseyan and say I still can't tell you what the Government \nwill do to get you back in your home. I suggest to any of my colleagues \nthat you would not want to look in the face of your citizens and have \nto be in the same position.\n  The time has come to pass this bill without amendment in an up-or-\ndown vote in what I hope will be the same bipartisan vote that we had \nwhen we originally passed the Senate bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we are just moments from voting on both \nthe Lee amendment and on final passage. I rise to oppose the Lee \namendment, the amendment of the junior Senator from Utah. His amendment \nwould cut $6.3 billion from fiscal year 2013. That is $6 billion that \nis in addition to the $3.4 billion we already have as an offset in the \nbill that is charged against the Corps of Engineers, plus he wants to \nreduce spending by another $44 billion over an 8-year period by \nlowering the discretionary budget caps that were agreed to in the to \n2011 Budget Control Act.\n  Overall, he pays for $50.5 billion in emergency aid with $51.2 \nbillion in cuts. That is $700 million more in cuts than the disaster \nrate in this bill. I think that is going too far. I think when we cut \nmore than we are going to spend, that is going too far. The $6.3 \nbillion is an unspecified cut in discretionary programs in the middle \nof fiscal year 2013. It will cut national defense, it will cut law \nenforcement, housing assistance, agricultural assistance, and, guess \nwhat. The way it is written, it will even cut veterans' benefits, which \nare ordinarily viewed as mandatory spending.\n  This $44.9 billion is a reduction to the caps set by the Budget \nControl Act of 2011. For my colleagues who don't seem\n\n[[Page S322]]\n\nto remember, we actually did pass a Budget Control Act. It says we in \nthe Appropriations Committee will cut $1 trillion over the next 9 \nyears. So the cap is already on us on what we could spend, and that is \n$100 billion a year. The Lee amendment would add even more to that.\n  They cannot tell us to pass a budget the way they did in the House \nbill on the debt limit and then say: Pass the budget. We did pass the \nBudget Control Act, and now the Lee amendment will shred that \nagreement. It will just shred it. Every time something comes up--while \nwe are working to pass a budget--are they going to shred it?\n  I would like to follow what Senator Coats has talked about: Let's get \nback to regular order. Let's not be kind of doing cuts de jour, cuts on \nthe fly, and who can outcut whom. Senator Coats has many good ideas in \nhis presentation. As an appropriator and a gentleman on my committee, I \nlook forward to working with him.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If I could just finish my remarks, and I will turn to \nthe gentlelady from Louisiana.\n  Also, this amendment is terrible in terms of process. If we pass the \nLee amendment, not only will it shred the Budget Control Act of 2011--\njust shred it--it will then send this bill, which meets compelling \nhuman need, back to the House. The House has already shrunk this bill. \nIt will further embroil this process, and very likely this bill may die \ndue to some of the extreme elements in the House.\n  To me, the answer is obvious: Let's defeat the Lee amendment and pass \nthis bill. There are people who are suffering in New York, New Jersey, \nMaryland, and Connecticut. Let's acknowledge the validity of the \narguments that have been raised by many Members on the other side about \nhow we look at disaster assistance, and I am more than open to it on \nour committee.\n  I hope we can defeat the Lee amendment and pass the urgent \nsupplemental that is pending before us even though it already has an \nadditional $3.4 billion offset, which is essentially a cut of fiscal \nyear 2013--cutting the Army Corps of Engineers--which, by the way, has \nonly $5 billion. If they are going to cut, learn math and learn how to \nread the bills and the chart. Math is good. I like math. We are going \nto follow math.\n  With that, I ask that we pass the bill. Let's not cut more than is in \nthe bill. Let's do the math and know we are already cutting. Let's do \nthe job the American people want.\n  This concludes my remarks. But before I yield the floor to the \ngentlelady from Louisiana, there are two sunshine issues I am going to \nmention.\n  First, I see the return of Senator Mark Kirk. I cannot share with my \ncolleagues the pleasure I have in seeing him. He is a member of the \nAppropriations Committee. We have worked together on many issues. We \nhave disagreed, we have duked it out, and we have had some good times. \nIt is just a pleasure to see him back on the Senate floor and ready to \nvote.\n  Also, I note that now joining us as the ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee is Senator Shelby of Alabama. I have worked \nwith the Senator from Alabama over the years. I think we can pledge--\nthough we will differ on policy or matters--there will be more on which \nwe can agree in this Appropriations Committee. There will be an effort \nfor bipartisanship, civility, intellectual rigger, robust debate, and \ntransparency. We look forward to working together and with our \ncolleagues.\n  With that, I yield for the gentlelady from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the chairlady. Is it not the \nopinion of the Senator from Maryland that if the Lee amendment gets on \nthis bill, it will, in fact, kill the Sandy supplemental? Isn't that \nthe Senator's understanding of what will happen if the Lee amendment is \nadopted?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the Senator from Louisiana was asking me \na question while I was getting a copy of my speech. What was the \nquestion?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Is it not the understanding of the Senator from \nMaryland that if the Lee amendment gets adopted--which I don't believe \nit will--the bill will be either killed or in serious danger of \npassing?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I think it will be in very serious danger of passing \nbecause the impact of the cuts is significant, severe, even Armageddon, \nand it would send it back to the House for further negotiation. The \nHouse is out this week, and then they kind of come back. I think this \nbill very likely will die in a conference, and that cannot happen as it \nwill affect the economy and lives of the people in our States.\n  I know the gentlelady has had a history of looking at how to have a \nmore frugal and sensible government. We funded two wars on a credit \ncard, and that is part of the reason we are in this mess. We have \nplenty of money to rebuild Iraq, and now we are debating and nickel-\nand-diming over rebuilding New York, New Jersey, parts of Connecticut, \nand little, poor rural parts of Maryland.\n  So, yes, I think it will have a terrible effect.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time is remaining on the Democratic side. \nThe Republicans have 5 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 of those 5 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank my colleagues.\n  Let me say that it is my clear view and opinion that if the Lee \namendment is passed, the Sandy supplemental will die. There is strong \nfeeling--led by this Senator from Louisiana, to the Senators who are \narguing for that position--that if we want to debate about how to pay \nfor a disaster, I will do that. We will do 50 percent cuts and 50 \npercent revenue, but they never will offer one penny of new revenues to \npay for anything. I am not budging on this point. This amendment, if \nadopted, will kill this bill.\n  I will go 50 percent revenue. We will raise $25 billion, and $25 \nbillion we will cut, but I am not going to keep cutting the \ndiscretionary budget--which, by the way, is not out of control despite \nwhat we hear on Fox News. It is mandatory spending that is rising \nrapidly because the ``greatest generation,'' which gave us the greatest \nNation the world has ever heard of, is aging, and they need hospice \ncare, Social Security, and hospitals. If they want to cut them, go \nright ahead. I am going to be a little more gentle.\n  No. 2, we can do this together if we want. So just know this argument \nis not a small argument for the chair of the Homeland Security \nSubcommittee of the Appropriations Committee nor for our colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the bill we just passed out of the \nSenate, a bill to aid the victims of Superstorm Sandy, is important. It \nis important when we are faced with a disaster--whether it is a \nhurricane, whether it is an earthquake, whether it is a drought, \nwhether it is a flood--that we step forward and find those ways that we \ncan help citizens who have faced immeasurable loss. The effort that has \ngone back and forth between two bodies now, and will, hopefully, move \nforward, is one which will certainly help to address the needs of those \nfamilies who lost so much in Superstorm Sandy.\n  I think we all recognize this was not the only disaster this country \nfaced last year. In my State of Alaska we faced a fish disaster. For \nthose of you who are from States that do not rely on your fisheries as \na source of income, a source of jobs or a source of daily sustenance, \nyou might think: Fish disasters; well, that is not really much to talk \nabout. That is not a true disaster.\n  In my State, when fisheries have declined to the extent we have \nseen--the loss of the Chinook salmon on the Yukon River, the Kuskokwim \nRiver, the Upper Cook Inlet--this has a dramatic impact on our State's \neconomy, a dramatic impact on the livelihoods of so many Alaskans. \nWhether they be commercial fishermen, sport fishermen, our subsistence-\nbased fisheries, our fisheries communities, those businesses that are \ndependent on our salmon fisheries, these were all impacted this past \nyear.\n  As I had gone around the State, basically from about midsummer \nthrough the end of the year, everywhere I went, whether I was in an \nurban center such as Anchorage, Homer, or down in Seward, up in the \nMatanuska Valley, or out in the rural parts of the State up along the \nYukon, out along the Kuskokwim out in the southwest, people were \ntalking about two things: People were talking about our cost of energy \nbecause our energy costs remained the highest in the Nation, but they \nwere also talking about fish. Pretty basic stuff: fuel, fish, and food. \nWhen we had a disaster this summer, it was an imperative around our \nState.\n  We, in September of this past year, had an official declaration from \nthe Secretary of Commerce--actually the Acting Secretary of Commerce, \nRebecca Blank--that recognized this fish disaster, and this is a \ndisaster that is statutorily authorized by section 308 of the \nInterjurisdictional Fisheries Act and section 31 of the Magnuson-\nStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.\n  These are designations that are statutorily authorized. These are not \nearmarks. They are not to be labeled as pork or something special for \nan area. These are disasters subject to a statutory authorization, a \nprocess that has been clearly laid out. They are authorized in law for \nfish failures that require affirmative action from the Secretary of \nCommerce. The Secretary has taken that action. Congress then needs to \ndo its part by funding for these disasters.\n  I mentioned at the outset that some of my colleagues might not \nappreciate the importance of these fish disasters. But, again, these \ndisasters are no less important than disasters for which we provide for \nother industries, such as drought disaster or drought assistance for \nour farmers. I think the Acting Secretary, when she signed these \nfisheries designations, recognized them for essentially what they are: \nfish droughts, fish droughts in our rivers and our oceans. She \nresponded to the fisheries disasters not only in my State of Alaska, \nbut she also moved forward with disaster determinations for Rhode \nIsland, for New York, for Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, \nConnecticut, and Mississippi. The disaster declaration the Acting \nSecretary advanced opens the door, then, for the financial assistance \nfrom the Federal Government.\n  You might notice those funds were not included in this disaster \nrelief bill. That does not mean I will back down from attempting to do \nmy best to make sure the disaster that Alaska faced with its fisheries, \nand that so many of our other States faced with their fisheries, that \nthese needs will not be addressed.\n  We didn't advance it in this package. It is important that the Sandy \nprovision move forward, and that is why I eventually cast my vote in \nsupport of it. I know many of my colleagues--the Senator from Rhode \nIsland is with me tonight. I know the Senator from New Hampshire is \nvery concerned about it. The Senator from Maine is very concerned about \nit. I think it is fair to say we will continue our efforts to ensure \nthe disasters that our fishermen have faced will be addressed as is \nstatutorily provided in law. We will work to find that funding to make \nsure that disasters, however they present themselves in this country--\nwhether it is storm, flood, drought, hurricane, or earthquake--are \naddressed.\n  I commit to working with my colleagues to continue to find those \nsources of funding so we address these revenues.\n\n[[Page S324]]\n\n  I note that my colleague from Rhode Island is here, and I know he too \nwishes to address this important issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the remarks of \nmy friend, the Senator from Alaska. This is truly a bipartisan concern. \nThere are Senators on both sides who feel very aggrieved by what took \nplace, Senators from Alaska and Maine, on the two sides of the country, \nand a great number of us.\n  The sheet that rests on the front table during the votes to make sure \npeople coming in know what the current measure is describes the last \nvote as passage of H.R. 152, the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of \n2013--not the Hurricane Sandy Relief Appropriations Act of 2013 but the \nDisaster Relief Appropriations Act.\n  We have had a disaster. We didn't make this up. This wasn't something \nthat was snuck into the bill or we tried to do an earmark on.\n  The Governors of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, \nNew York, Connecticut--six Governors petitioned the government for a \nfisheries disaster declaration, and they received one. The Secretary of \nCommerce declared the New England Multispecies Groundfish Fishery \ndisaster. The Senator from Alaska described it as a drought.\n  It is like a drought. What has happened in our waters is that they \nhave warmed. They have had some chemical changes. Fisheries have moved \nnorthward, and some of them have moved clean out of the U.S. \ncontinental waters. The result is that Georges Bank cod, Yellowtail \nflounder, Gulf of Maine cod and haddock have all had to face Draconian \ncatch reductions to try to keep those species alive.\n  We have a fishing tradition that goes back even longer than Alaska's, \nI will guess. Certainly, we started fishing back in the 17th century, \nthe 1600s, in Rhode Island. It is a long tradition. But the changes we \nare wreaking on this planet are moving the fish around. They are \ncreating these localized disasters for our fishermen who have worked \nhard all their lives, who have invested their life savings into \nexpensive boats they have to take care of, the maintenance and the \nrepair, and they risk their health and their lives and their limbs out \nat sea in all kinds of weather in order to bring in the catch to us. \nWhen the catch isn't there, it is a disaster.\n  This is what the Governors have asked for, all six of them. That is \nwhat the U.S. Government, through the Secretary of Commerce, declared. \nWhy on Earth the fisheries disaster that affects our fishermen doesn't \nmatter--$150 million; it was not a big piece in a $60 billion bill. Yet \nwe were left out. We were completely left out.\n  I will continue to fight to get this done. I think there has been a \nwrong committed in this body, and I intend to make sure it gets \nrighted. I will work hard with the Senator from Alaska. I see the \nSenator from New Hampshire, who is equally affected by this, on the \nSenate floor. It makes no sense to let people in the House of \nRepresentatives pick and choose among disasters in a bill and strip out \ndisasters that have been declared by the U.S. Government and the \nGovernors of six States.\n  Do they know better? I don't think so. But they took it out. For \nwhatever reason, we weren't able to get it in back here. I have had \nstrong conversations with some of the lead supporters of the Sandy bill \nand the States that most benefit, with the chairman of the committee \nand the floor manager of the bill and with colleagues from nearby \nStates. This is not over, but I am extremely upset that we would pass \nsomething called a Disaster Relief Appropriations Act and leave out of \nit the disaster that has befallen fisheries up and down the east coast, \nfrom Maine down through New Hampshire, through Massachusetts, through \nRhode Island, through Connecticut and New York. That is a pretty wide-\nscale disaster.\n  For the men and the women who go out and put their boats and \nthemselves at risk for this catch when it is not there, you bet it is a \ndisaster. It is just as much of a disaster as a farmer who looks out at \nparched fields and can't grow what he needs to grow. We are not there \nfor them, not when it is fishermen, for some reason. We are not there \nfor them. We have done it over and over. Since 1994 Federal fishery \nfailures have been declared on 29 different occasions, and nearly $827 \nmillion has been appropriated for relief. But not now. For some reason, \nnot now.\n  I yield now for the Senator from New Hampshire, who I know feels \nstrongly about this issue. The Senator from Massachusetts was speaking \nwith me earlier. She feels very strongly about this, and we need to get \nthis set right. This is a day for celebration in some quarters but not \nin all.\n  For those of us who have a responsibility to the men and women who \nhave fished the waters off of our States, this is not an acceptable \nresult.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am here to join my colleagues, Senator \nMurkowski from Alaska and Senator Whitehouse from Rhode Island, to \nexpress my disappointment and frustration along with them that the \ndisaster relief funding for our Nation's fishermen has been stripped \nfrom this emergency relief bill. I agree with all of those who want to \nmake sure the victims of Hurricane Sandy along the east coast get the \nhelp they need. I think that is something to which we all are \ncommitted. But the fact is that fishermen in New England and Alaska and \nother parts of this country are also facing hard times. They are \ngrappling with onerous regulations that are designed to end \noverfishing, and in spite of these restrictions, the amount of codfish \nin the Gulf of Maine has declined drastically. It has a huge impact on \nNew Hampshire, and the problem for fishermen in my State is now one of \nsurvival.\n  Our fishermen have already seen their incomes decrease significantly \nin recent years. They depend on cod more than fishermen from any other \nState in New England. Cod accounts for more than 90 percent of the \nrevenues of the fishing industry in New Hampshire. This is because our \nfishermen use small day boats, they fish close to shore, and most don't \nhave the boats or equipment to catch other deep-sea species to \ncompensate for the lack of cod. Our fishing businesses are small, and \nthey are mostly owned by families who have been fishing for \ngenerations.\n  For 400 years, we have been fishing in New Hampshire. Generations of \nfishermen in New Hampshire have continued this proud tradition. Yet, \nunder what is happening with the fishing regulations, we are going to \nlose this industry. Our coastline is short in New Hampshire--it is only \n18 miles--but the fishing industry is still a crucial driver of the \neconomy. It generates $106 million in economic activity, it supports \n5,000 full-time and part-time jobs in the State, and it provides our \nstores and our restaurants with a local and fresh supply of fish, just \nas it does in Alaska and Rhode Island. This historic way of life is \ngoing to become extinct if we don't help the fishing industry.\n  I welcomed the decision of the Secretary of Commerce back in \nSeptember to declare a Federal disaster for the Northeast fishing \nindustry for the upcoming fishing year, but this declaration, as well \nas those already provided for Alaska, Mississippi, New Jersey, New \nYork, Rhode Island, and other States, is meaningless if Congress does \nnot provide relief funding to these fishing communities.\n  As my colleagues have said so eloquently, the Senate voted last month \nto appropriate $150 million in funding for these disasters, and as \nSenator Whitehouse said, it was not a large percentage of the emergency \nrelief bill. I am disappointed and, like the fisher men and women in \nNew Hampshire who depend on this industry, frustrated that this funding \nhas been taken out of the bill we voted on today.\n  It is critical that we provide relief to the fishermen and to the \ncoastal economies in New England--and in New Hampshire as a part of the \nNew England economy--and Mississippi and New Jersey and New York and \nAlaska and the other States that are affected. We have to work to \nensure the long-term sustainability of these vital resources and of \nthis historic way of life. I intend to continue to work with my \ncolleagues from those States that are affected to make sure the fishing \nindustry gets the help it needs to survive.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S325]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. As I heard the compilation from the distinguished \nSenator from New Hampshire, it was a pretty small percentage of the \nbill, and I was going through the math in my head. If it was a $60 \nbillion bill, with a $150 million appropriation that would have \nsupported the disaster for the fishermen, I think that is 0.25 percent \nof the total of the bill--one-quarter of 1 percent. Yet somebody over \non the House side had to target that and take it out and leave the \nfishermen high and dry while the rest all went through?\n  I think it is really important that we as a group stand for the \nfishermen and try to force some recognition in this body that the \ndisaster they are facing is a real one.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Yes.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. It is not just the people who are fishing directly who \nare affected by this, it is also all of the other jobs that depend on \nthat fishing industry that are going to be lost.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The engine repair people, the net repair people, the \nfolks who process the fish that are caught, the folks who sell fuel to \nthe fishermen, the people who do maintenance on the boats--there is an \nentire economic ecosystem that is knocked down when the fishermen can't \nbring the catch home. Yes, the Senator is absolutely correct.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. And in my small State of New Hampshire, where we only \nhave 18 miles of coastline, we have 5,000 jobs dependent on this \nindustry. So in Rhode Island and Alaska, I am sure my colleagues have a \nsignificant number of jobs dependent on the fishing industry. What \nhappens to those jobs if the industry doesn't survive? They are gone.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I think Alaska may actually have more coastline than \nRhode Island.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I think we have 33,000 miles of coastline, not to be \nbragging on a coastline. But what is so important as part of this \ndiscussion--and my colleague Senator Shaheen has stated this--our \nfishermen often are not included when we think about areas of disaster. \nYet, in terms of those industries, those parts of our economy that are \nmaking things happen as folks are kind of chugging along, it is our \nfisheries that for decades--and for centuries, as Senator Whitehouse \nnoted--have been producing good jobs and providing a source of \nsustenance for our families.\n  Alaska is in somewhat of a unique situation in that we still have so \nmany families who rely on their fisheries for subsistence. This is not \njust an income source for many. For so many in rural Alaska, this means \nwhether or not you are going to be able to eat this winter. The \nsituation on the Yukon and on the Kuskokwim--when those rivers were \nshut down to fishing, we had actions of civil disobedience, where \nindividuals just came to the river and said: We have to put our nets in \nbecause we have to be able to feed our families. Down in the Cook Inlet \nregion, it is not so much a subsistence lifestyle there but a \ncommercial fishery as well as sport fishing. So sport guides who are \nrequired to be off the river cannot take that tourist who has come to \nAlaska for their dream fishing trip. They have to cancel that and lose \ntheir revenue, and so guides can no longer stay in place.\n\n  So Senator Shaheen is correct about the ripple effect to the economy. \nIt affects all of our fishing communities and those who support them. \nSo when we talk about disasters in areas and $150 million that was to \nbe split between all of these different regions and States, it is a \nrecognition that it is quite slight in comparison to the true loss to \nour economies, the true loss to our families who have suffered.\n  Again, I appreciate the commitment we have from so many who have been \nimpacted that we don't give up on this. We have gone through the \nprocess, we have jumped the hurdles to get the designation that is \nrequired by our government through the Secretary of Commerce. We have \ndone that. Now the step is for Congress to provide that funding that \nmakes the difference. It is one thing to get a disaster declaration on \npaper; it is another to be able to provide the relief. And I certainly \nintend to push until that relief is provided not only for the families \nin Alaska but for those who have been impacted by fisheries disasters \nthroughout the country.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. And I will certainly join my colleague in that effort.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank my colleague.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/28/senate-section/article/S325-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DATA PRIVACY DAY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I join privacy advocates, industry \nleaders and National, State and local government officials from across \nour Nation in celebrating Data Privacy Day--a day to recognize the need \nto better secure our privacy and security in cyberspace. I am also \npleased to join Senators on both sides of the aisle in cosponsoring a \nSenate resolution to commemorate Data Privacy Day.\n  In the Digital Age, Americans face new threats to their digital \nprivacy and security as consumers and businesses alike collect, share \nand store more and more information in cyberspace. Data Privacy Day is \nan important reminder about the need to improve data privacy as we reap \nthe many benefits of new technologies.\n  Last year the Judiciary Committee approved digital privacy \nlegislation that I authored to update the Electronic Communications \nPrivacy Act, ECPA, to improve the privacy protections for Americans' \nemail and other electronic communications. That bill would, among other \nthings, require that the Government obtain a search warrant, based upon \nprobable cause, before obtaining email and other electronic \ncommunications from a third-party service provider. When I and others \nin Congress authored ECPA in 1986, email was a novelty and most \nAmericans had never heard of the Internet. Today, communication by \nemail is commonplace and many of us store email and other electronic \ncommunications with service providers or ``in the cloud'' for extended \nperiods of time.\n  After 3 decades, it is essential that Congress update ECPA to ensure \nthat this critical law keeps pace with new technologies and the way \nAmericans use and store email today. Digital privacy is important to \nall Americans, regardless of party affiliation or ideology. That is why \nwhen Congress first enacted ECPA, we did so with strong bipartisan \nsupport. I appreciate the willingness of House Judiciary Committee \nChairman Goodlatte to work in partnership with me to examine and update \nthis critical privacy law. I look forward to working closely with \nChairman Goodlatte and others in Congress to update this law so that it \nkeeps pace with the many new threats to our privacy.\n  I again thank and commend the many stakeholders and leaders from \nacross the Nation who are holding events to commemorate Data Privacy \nDay. I look forward to working with them and with Members of Congress \non both sides of the aisle, in both Chambers, to enact reforms to the \nElectronic Communications Privacy Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/28/senate-section/article/S325-2", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S325-S326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO JUDGE CHARLES ROMANI, JR.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge recently \nretired Illinois Judge Charles Romani, Jr., who served on the bench for \n30 years in Illinois' third circuit. Among many achievements over those \nyears of service, Judge Romani's work setting up a veterans' court \nstands out.\n  Veterans' issues have always been close to Judge Romani's heart. \nHaving served in the U.S. Army himself, as a sergeant during the \nVietnam War, Judge Romani knows firsthand the difficulties that \nveterans face when returning home from war.\n  Judge Romani was born and raised in Greenville, IL. He attended \nWestern Illinois University, before continuing on to law school at St. \nLouis University. Upon graduation, Romani accepted a position as \nAssistant State's Attorney for Madison County. Two years later, in \n1974, he ran for State's Attorney in Bond County. He was elected and \nserved with great distinction for 7 years.\n  Romani first became an associate judge of the Third Judicial Circuit \nin 1983. Five years later, he became a circuit court judge. And, in \n1989, Judge Romani became Chief Judge of the Third Judicial Circuit in \nIllinois.\n\n[[Page S326]]\n\n  In 2009, a growing number of veterans of the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan began appearing on court dockets around the country. Many \nof these veterans have special needs, including mental health needs, \nand many of them greatly benefit from specialized services. It was then \nthat Judge Romani began modeling an innovative, new veteran's court \nbased on a successful model in Buffalo.\n  Since 2009, the court that Judge Romani created has helped \ninnumerable veterans turn their lives around. The Court consistently \nsees between 30 and 40 veterans go through its program at a time. There \nare now approximately 104 veteran's courts, like Judge Romani's, around \nthe country helping those who served the United States in its time of \nneed.\n  Judge Romani identifies this court as his ``most rewarding \nachievement as a judge.''\n  Judge Romani's last day on the court was November 5, when he \ncompleted an impressive career that spanned 39 years. He has been \nmarried to his lovely wife Karen for 38 years. They have three \nchildren, two of whom were recently married.\n  I add my voice to many others when I say thank you, Judge Romani, for \nyour years of distinguished public service and the indelible mark you \nhave left on Madison County.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/28/senate-section/article/S326-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

GOLDBERG\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Senator Hatch and I would like to \nrecognize the outstanding career of Mr. Larry J. Goldberg, Principal \nDeputy Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human \nServices, HHS. Mr. Goldberg retired on January 3, after more than 35 \nyears of distinguished government service.\n  Mr. Goldberg began his career of government service in 1976 as \nAssociate Legal Director for the National Center for Law and Deafness \nat Gallaudet College. He continued his work defending civil rights for \npersons with disabilities as a trial attorney in the Justice Department \nand later as an Assistant Attorney General for the State of Maryland's \nDepartment of Health and Mental Hygiene. In 1989, Mr. Goldberg joined \nHHS in the Inspector General Division of the Office of General Counsel. \nHe transferred to the HHS Office of Inspector General, OIG, at the \ninception of its independent Office of Counsel in 1996, and has risen \nthrough the ranks to Principal Deputy Inspector General, managing a \nstaff of more than 1,700 auditors, criminal investigators, analysts, \nand attorneys, and a budget of more than $300 million.\n  Throughout his career, Mr. Goldberg has demonstrated the essence of \nwhat it means to serve and protect the public. Most notably, he has \naccomplished systemic and institutional reforms that have enhanced HHS \nprograms by strengthening protections against fraud, waste, and abuse \nand promoting efficient and effective program operations. His visionary \nleadership and perseverance in driving change has resulted in billions \nof dollars of erroneously paid and misused funds being returned to the \ncritical programs that serve our most needy. Mr. Goldberg's career \nachievements also include establishing landmark legal rights for people \nwith disabilities in employment, education, health care, and social \nservices. His many contributions have had a far-reaching and lasting \nimpact.\n  During his 23 years with OIG, Mr. Goldberg's efforts and skill in \nfostering collaboration within OIG and with government partners have \npositioned OIG to meet vastly expanded responsibilities and to achieve \nresults in priority areas. The depth and range of his professional \nknowledge and expertise are appreciated and respected throughout HHS, \nby the larger OIG community, by Congress, and by the health care \nindustry. His dynamic leadership has had a direct and measurable effect \non OIG's ability to align its resources, work plans and products, \ncompliance initiatives, and investigative and enforcement activities to \ncarry out its mission.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I join with Senator Baucus in commending \nMr. Goldberg for his service. As Principal Deputy Inspector General, \nand throughout his career with OIG, Mr. Goldberg's efforts have \ndirectly benefited the American people by protecting Federal health \ncare, public health, and social programs from waste, fraud, and abuse, \nand recommending to HHS actions to improve program effectiveness. Mr. \nGoldberg has led OIG to achieve unprecedented results in combating \nhealth care fraud and abuse. He has marshaled OIG's resources to \ncounter this epidemic through a sophisticated, multifaceted, and \ninnovative strategy.\n  For example, Mr. Goldberg has spearheaded OIG's efforts to join with \nthe Justice Department to establish Medicare Fraud ``Strike Force'' \noperations--elite teams of investigators and prosecutors, supported by \nadvanced data analysis--in 9 key locations. These Strike Forces have \ncharged more than 1,400 defendants, who collectively have billed \nMedicare for more than $4 billion. Simultaneously, OIG has pursued more \ntraditional civil, administrative, and criminal cases. Under Mr. \nGoldberg's leadership, OIG has generated record-breaking returns for \nthe Medicare Trust Fund and taxpayers--including court-ordered \nrecoveries, fines, restitution, and settlements totaling more than $6 \nbillion in 2012.\n  But not all of his results can be measured in dollars. During Mr. \nGoldberg's tenure, OIG produced a landmark measurement of adverse \nevents from hospital stays; reported and testified on overutilization \nof antipsychotic drugs for nursing home patients; and recommended \nactions to protect the safety of the Nation's food supply.

Mr. President, today I wish to remember Carol Walter. \nCarol was known throughout Connecticut and the Nation as a force for \ngood and a supporter of the homeless. I worked with her for many years \nto address the homeless population in Connecticut, and no one advocated \nmore relentlessly and tirelessly for this cause.\n  An ambassador for social justice, she took positions at various \nnonprofits, including homeless shelters throughout the State as well as \nat the Connecticut AIDS Resource Coalition. In 2006, she was named \nexecutive director of the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness.\n  At the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness, Carol introduced a \nnew way of approaching homelessness. Carol regarded this unacceptable \nhuman condition as something that could be prevented and addressed it \non a national scale through community organizing, advocacy, research, \nleadership, and education. She empowered the greater community, \nbuilding grassroots leadership, advocating for new research and \npolicies, and leading these efforts with grace and resolve. According \nto her colleagues at the Coalition, Carol truly listened to the voices \nof people who experience homelessness.\n  She did not stop at the prevention and cessation of homelessness, but \nrather took the next step towards long-term sustainability. Carol \ndedicated most of her career to efforts to include securing permanent \naffordable housing and housing subsidies for the afflicted, providing \nsupport systems in the community, and offering career services to \nsupport independence and self-help. She worked to prevent and eliminate \nhomelessness on local, State, and Federal levels. She partnered with \nlocal communities and Statewide organizations, such as Supportive \nHousing\n\n[[Page S327]]\n\nWORKS and Opening Doors Connecticut, to unify everyone in this \ncollective effort.\n  Carol was beloved by her family and friends, and will always be \nremembered as a beacon of light and hope. Her exuberance for her \nmission will be carried on by her colleagues, and her charity will \ninspire many others. I invite my colleagues to join me in honoring the \ntremendous work of Carol Walter and preserving her legacy so that \nothers may see her tremendous importance and continue her efforts. \nIndeed, it is through the good works of others in the fight against \nhomelessness that she would choose to be remembered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/28/senate-section/article/S327-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        AMERICAN RED CROSS MONTH\n\n Mr. BEGICH.

It provides 24-hour \nsupport to members of the military, veterans and their families, and \nprovides training in CPR, aquatics safety, and first aid.\n  Across the country, the American Red Cross responds to nearly 70,000 \ndisasters a year. It provides some 400,000 services to military \nmembers, veterans and civilians, collects and distributes about 40 \npercent of the Nation's blood supply and trains more than seven million \npeople in first aid, water safety and other lifesaving skills every \nyear.\n  Alaska, and the rest of the country, relies on the American Red Cross \nand the work of their supporters. I hope that by recognizing March as \nAmerican Red Cross Month we can highlight their exemplary work and \nensure they can continue to help Americans for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/28/senate-section/article/S327-2", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FEBRUARY HOCKEY IN ALASKA\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, ice hockey is a popular activity in \nAlaska year round and especially in the winter. Today, I want to \nhighlight hockey in my home State.\n  You can find someone passing the puck around in nearly any community \nor military installation with a frozen lake, pond or ice rink, whether \nit's organized play or a pickup game. There are dozens of leagues and \ncamps for players of all ages from the squirts and midgets to \nAnchorage's Aces and Seawolves and Fairbanks' Ice Dogs and Nanooks.\n  At the professional level, the National Hockey League recognizes the \nimportance of hockey in the lower ranks by sponsoring the ``Hockey Is \nfor Everyone'' program in February. This program helps young girls and \nboys learn essential life skills such as commitment and perseverance.\n  The NHL, along with USA Hockey, participates in the Presidential \nActive Lifestyle Award program, to promote activity and good nutrition. \nAnyone who has ever skated hard for more than a few minutes knows how \nhealthy it can be, whether your goal is to have fun, stay fit or to \nplay in the NHL, on the U.S. Olympic team or at the 2014 Arctic Winter \nGames in Fairbanks.\n  Not only does playing hockey teach the ideals of teamwork, fair play \nand loyalty, when Alaskans get involved in fund raising, coaching, and \nevent chaperoning, they are practicing good civics and citizenship.\n  And it's exciting to watch live or broadcasted games because the \nsport is so fast paced, yet graceful and athletic at the same time.\n  Three cheers for the players, coaches and supporters of hockey in \nAlaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/28/senate-section/article/S327-3", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING CHESTER REITEN\n\n Mr. HOEVEN.

Mr. President, I want to thank a young Kansan for \nsharing her thoughts and opinions regarding the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture's implementation of new school meal requirements.\n  Ms. Lindsey Heward wrote to me last fall to express her and fellow \nOsage City High School students' frustrations with the amount of food \nthey were getting to eat at lunch and their choices for food. She \noutlined several areas that the USDA could focus on to prevent obesity \nrather than solely school meal programs. Among her suggestions were to \nhave the USDA encourage families to share meals together, develop \nbudgeting skills for shoppers, and encourage nutritious meal planning. \nI would like to submit a copy of her letter into the Congressional \nRecord.\n  After hearing from parents, school administrators, and students like \nLindsey, I shared the concerns I was receiving with USDA Secretary Tom \nVilsack. These comments and concerns were heard by the USDA and the \nadministration ultimately provided additional flexibility in \nimplementing changes to school meals.\n  I am still concerned USDA doesn't fully understand the estimated \ncosts to schools and plate waste. I will continue to monitor the \nimplementation of this rule, and its impact on schools in Kansas as \nwell as the rest of the country. I look forward to working with \nSecretary Vilsack to continue to improve school nutrition while \nensuring our students are adequately fed.\n  I ask that Ms. Lindsey Heward's letter be printed in the Record.\n  The letter follows.\n\n\n[[Page S328]]\n\n\n\n\n                                               Lindsey Heward,\n\n                             Osage City, Kansas, October 15, 2012.\n     Pat Roberts,\n     U.S. Senator for Kansas, Frank Carlson Federal Building, \n         Topeka, KS.\n       Dear Senator Roberts: There is a lot of talk going on in \n     our community of Osage City, Kansas about all of the changes \n     in our school food service program due to the Healthy, \n     Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. When the changes in the \n     nutrition of the available vending machine items in our \n     school took out pop, any type of sugar drinks, candy bars, \n     cookies, most chips, pastries, etc., I could agree with that. \n     A lot of those items aren't going to help a student in their \n     day; it's not going to be what gives them the fuel they need. \n     I didn't have a problem with that because the lunches that we \n     were having always satisfied me for the day, it would \n     actually get me through after school practice until supper \n     time. But now that the school lunch program has been greatly \n     altered, the majority of the students, especially in the high \n     school, are not receiving enough calories to sustain them \n     through school, after school practices, and events.\n       What really frustrates me is that the Healthy, Hunger-Free \n     Kids Act of 2010 is not correctly addressing the reduction of \n     our nation's obesity rate. What is not being addressed is \n     education of the parents who are the main consumers of the \n     family's grocery items or parents modeling healthy eating \n     habits. As an employee of Jerry's Thriftway, this is \n     something that I witness daily. I especially see the \n     purchasing of unhealthy food choices by welfare recipients \n     when using their Vision cards. For example, this last \n     Saturday, a customer was at my check-out line with a cart of \n     hot dogs, chips, pizza, pop, and a lot of frozen items loaded \n     with preservatives. These items were purchased with funds \n     provided by our tax payers. It is obvious that this parent \n     does not go home to prepare a healthy meal for her children \n     and she certainly doesn't model healthy eating habits. This \n     is something that occurs regularly throughout my six hour \n     shift. No matter what takes place at school, it is not \n     changing the way these parents are providing (through \n     somebody else's money) for their children's meals. I fear \n     that there isn't even a family meal time in those homes, but \n     rather a time to binge on junk food throughout the evenings \n     or on weekends. This is where nutrition needs to change to \n     reduce the obesity in our nation, not by unrealistically \n     restricting our school breakfast and lunch program.\n       Instead of focusing on school meal programs, I strongly \n     feel that it's time to focus on the following:\n\n       1. Creating a greater work ethic in all citizens\n       2. Developing budgeting skills for shoppers\n       3. Nutritious meal planning\n       4. Food preparation skills\n       5. Valuing family togetherness at the dinner table\n       6. Family physical fitness\n\n       The family is the basic unit in every community. Let's \n     start with changes in the daily life of families . . . that's \n     the ground level. Once that happens, then we will see true, \n     positive changes in the health of our nation.\n       I would appreciate hearing your thoughts on my suggestions \n     of how this change needs to start with each family instead of \n     through the restricted school meal service. Do you have any \n     ideas on how my concerns can be put into action to make real, \n     meaningful change happen?\n       Sincerely yours,\n                                                   Lindsey Heward,\n     Osage City High School Senior.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/28/senate-section/article/S328-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING VICTORIA HANZO\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I recognize Ms. Victoria \nMichelle Hanzo, a bright and talented young Louisianian.\n  Each year since 1743, the carnival celebration known as Mardi Gras, \nFrench for ``Fat Tuesday,'' has been celebrated by the people of New \nOrleans. The season officially begins on January 5, the Twelfth Night \nof Christmas and the Feast of the Epiphany. Also recognized in many \ncountries around the world with large Roman Catholic populations, Mardi \nGras is the final party prior to the ritual fasting of the Lenten \nSeason, which begins on Ash Wednesday.\n  Over the many decades that New Orleanians have celebrated Mardi Gras, \n``krewes'' or private Mardi Gras social organizations have also \ncontributed to the merriment and glee surrounding the festive season. \nIn Greek mythology, Endymion was known for his everlasting youth and \nbeauty. In 1966, the Krewe of Endymion was established and has annually \nparaded through the streets of New Orleans. Today, Endymion is known \nfor being the largest parade in New Orleans, both for the number of \nmembers--more than 2,600--and also for the incredible size and \nspectacle of its floats. This krewe has meant a lot to me since I had \none of my first jobs as a high school student painting Endymion's \nfloats--white primer only, as I wasn't trusted with colors.\n  During the Krewe of Endymion's 47th year, Ms. Victoria Michelle Hanzo \nwill reign as queen. Ms. Hanzo is a senior at Archbishop Chapelle High \nSchool and has been on the distinguished honor roll each year while a \nstudent at Chapelle. She is also a member of the National Society of \nHigh of High School scholars, has been a student ambassador for 4 \nyears, is a student representative for her senior class on the student \ncouncil, and is an active member in Health Nuts, an organization that \npromotes fitness and nutrition. Lastly, Victoria is a member of the \nprolife club and has traveled to Washington, DC, recently with over 600 \nhigh school students from the New Orleans area for the March for Life \nRally, an occasion and cause for which I will continue to be a strong \nadvocate.\n  She is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. James Hanzo and the granddaughter \nMr. and Mrs. Edmond J. Muniz, the founder and captain of the Krewe of \nEndymion. Next year she plans to continue her education at Louisiana \nState University in Baton Rouge. It is exciting for such an \naccomplished young person to have this honor and will be something she \nwill cherish for a lifetime. She joins a long line of family members \nwho have also had the honor of serving as queen of Endymion: her mother \nMichelle in 1986, her Aunt Mary in 1984, her aunt Margie in 1991, and \nher cousin Erica in 2012.\n  As we celebrate the 2013 Mardi Gras season, it is my pleasure to \nhonor Ms. Victoria Michelle Hanzo as the 47th queen of the Krewe of \nEndymion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/28/senate-section/article/S328-2", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CATHOLIC SCHOOLS WEEK\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize and \nhonor the valuable contributions of Catholic schools in educating our \nyouth throughout our great Nation. From January 27 to February 2, we \nwill celebrate Catholic Schools Week to bring attention to the \nexceptional work and contributions to society that Catholic education \nprograms across the country provide.\n  These schools provide a comprehensive education that emphasizes \nmoral, intellectual, and physical development in our youth and that \nfosters responsible individuals who positively contribute to our \ncommunities while leading lives grounded in the Catholic tradition. \nThis year's theme, ``Catholic Schools Raise the Standards,'' \ndemonstrates the high standard to which the Catholic schools of our \nNation hold themselves and their unwavering commitment to promoting \nacademic excellence and Catholic identity.\n  Catholic schools in Louisiana have continued to support this \ntradition of academic excellence and physical and spiritual well-bring, \nwhile allowing families to be involved and supportive in the \neducational process. Today, more than 2 million students attend \nCatholic schools around the country. More than 99 percent of attending \nstudents graduate, with more than 85 percent pursuing college degrees \nat 4-year institutions.\n  I am in strong agreement with the U.S. Conference of Catholic \nBishops, which stated:\n\n       Education remains critically important in the formation of \n     the human person by teaching how to live well now so as to be \n     able to live with God for all eternity . . . Our schools \n     serve both the faith community and society by educating \n     children, young people and adults to contribute to the common \n     good by becoming active and caring members of the \n     communities, cities, and nation in which they live.\n\n  As a Catholic school alumnus, I know that Catholic school educators \nand administrators deserve recognition for their steadfast commitment \nnot only to educating minds, but also to shaping hearts and cultivating \nthe virtues that make our country and local communities stronger. In \nthat respect, I am hopeful that the Senate will again pass my \nbipartisan resolution recognizing the valuable contributions of \nCatholic schools in the United States.\n  This week, we recognize the students, their families, teachers, \nadministrators, all of our parish leaders, and our communities for \ntheir efforts to support our Catholic schools and continued achievement \ntoward the education of our young people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/28/senate-section/article/S328-3", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S328-S329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to\n\n[[Page S329]]\n\nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/28/senate-section/article/S329-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nprivileged nominations which were placed on the Executive Calendar.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/28/senate-section/article/S329-2", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bills were read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 47.

A bill to designate a mountain in the State of Alaska as \nDenali; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would officially rename Mount McKinley in Alaska, simply, Denali.\n  Mount McKinley is one of the most iconic geographical features in the \ncountry, and certainly Alaska. It is the tallest mountain in the United \nStates, and we Alaskans are not all that shy about reminding folks the \nmountain is ours.\n  Here is the problem: In Alaska, Mount McKinley is referred to as \nsomething else. We just call it ``Denali.'' That is what we have always \ncalled it. Denali is an Alaska Native word, an Athabaskan word, and its \nmeaning is fairly straightforward. The High One. All my bill does is \nmake the name official. I know the name Mount McKinley has a special \nmeaning of its own to some folks, specifically the good people of Ohio, \nthe home State of our 25th President, William McKinley. My response to \nthose people is this: You are more than welcome to go right on \nreferring to the mountain as Mount McKinley, just as Alaskans have long \ncalled it Denali. All that is changing is that the Alaskan name is \nbecoming, technically, correct for an Alaskan landmark.\n  In the big picture, this is a little bill. I understand that. But I \nalso understand, as I know my colleagues do, that it is the little \nthings that sometimes matter a great deal to communities. Making \nDenali, the name all Alaskans use anyway, the official name of \nAmerica's tallest mountain means something to Alaska. Officially being \nable to call an Alaskan landmark by its Alaskan name means something to \nAlaskans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 156. A bill to allow for the harvest of gull eggs by the Huna \nTlingit people within Glacier Bay National Park in the State of Alaska; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nthe Huna Tlingit Traditional Gull Egg Use Act which represents an \nimportant step forward in allowing the Huna Tlingit people access to \nenjoy their traditional subsistence activity of gull egg collection.\n  The collection and consumption of gull eggs is an integral part of \nthe culture of the Tlingit people of Southeast Alaska, and eggs were \ngathered at rookeries long before Glacier Bay National Park and \nPreserve's establishment in 1925. A Legislative Environmental Impact \nStatement was completed in 2010 regarding this proposal to allow \nlimited harvests of gull eggs in Glacier Bay National Park and \nPreserve, and the preferred alternative authorized the implementation \nof a cooperative management program for gull egg collection and \nemphasized a traditional harvest strategy for the collections.\n  My bill will authorize this harvest of gull eggs at five nesting \nareas on two separate days each calendar year within the Park. This \nwould allow a large number of tribal members to interact with their \ntraditional homeland and provide an opportunity for as many as 12 young \npeople to participate annually and spend time with elders learning \nabout traditional egg harvest practices in addition to other aspects \nTlingit culture.\n  This bill is widely supported throughout the environmental and \nconservation communities, as well as the Alaska Native community. The \nharvesting of gull eggs would only have minor effects on the gulls, but \nthe cultural benefits that would be realized by the Native community \nwould be great.\n  It is my hope that this bill will receive quick but careful \nconsideration as the local tribe members have been eagerly awaiting \npassage of this measure for quite a long time.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 157. A bill to provide for certain improvements to the Denali \nNational Park and Preserve in the State of Alaska, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce legislation \nthat represents an important step in the conversion to renewable energy \nsources in rural Alaska and towards honoring the first individual to \nreach the summit of our Nation's tallest peak, Denali.\n  Today I introduce the Denali National Park Improvement Act of 2013, \ncomprised of three important provisions relating to Denali National \nPark and Preserve.\n  The first provision is the Kantishna Hills Renewable Energy Act.\n  The Kantishna Roadhouse, owned by Doyon Tourism, Inc., is located 100 \nmiles inside Denali National Park and Preserve. The settlement of \nKantishna was founded in 1905 as a mining camp near the juncture of \nEureka and Moose Creeks. Gold in the region brought a flurry of \nprospectors in the early days, but as the gold began to run out, so did \ninterest in mining the Kantishna Hills. The original roadhouse at \nKantishna was built in the early 1900s, serving as a private residence, \na community center, post office, and informal hotel accommodations for \nthose who visited Kantishna in Denali Park.\n  The Roadhouse, like many structures within Denali National Park, is \nentirely off the grid and generates all of\n\n[[Page S331]]\n\nits electricity needs with a diesel generator. As a result, all guests \nand supplies, including diesel, are trucked through the park to the \nRoadhouse over National Park roads. The construction of the micro hydro \nproject would allow the Roadhouse to cut down their diesel usage by \napproximately 50 percent, which would result in a decrease in diesel \ntruck traffic on the Park Road, improved local air quality, and less \nsound pollution in this remote area, as well as reduce disturbance and \nvehicle impacts on park wildlife, allowing for an enhanced visitor \nexperience for tourists within the National Park.\n  My bill will authorize the National Park Service to exchange roughly \n10 acres of National Park land for an equivalent amount of land \ncurrently owned by Doyon Tourism, and would allow the National Park \nService to obtain the highly desired Galena tract of land, located just \noff the Park Road in the Kantishna region. Doyon Tourism would obtain \nland over which the hydro project would be implemented. In the interim \nperiod, prior to completion of the land exchange, the National Park \nService will issue a permit to allow Doyon Tourism, Inc., to construct \nthe micro hydro unit.\n  I want to emphasize how important I believe that this bill is. The \nbenefit to the citizens of Alaska, especially rural Alaska, of reducing \ntheir dependence on expensive diesel generation through access to \nrenewable and clean sources of energy is enormous. This type of Micro-\nHydro project within Denali provides an excellent blueprint for others \naround the State to follow suit.\n  The next portion of my bill will allow a natural gas pipeline to be \nplaced inside Denali National Park. I am reintroducing legislation that \nI first offered in 2009 and that passed the Senate, but not the House \nof Representatives in the 112 Congress, which will authorize a right-\nof-way for construction of an Alaska instate natural gas pipeline to \nrun along the State's main highway from Fairbanks to Anchorage. This \nbill will provide a right-of-way for a natural gas pipeline near the \nshoulder of the Parks Highway for the roughly 7 miles that the highway \nruns through Denali National Park and Preserve.\n  I wish to explain why I am introducing the bill now, and why, rather \nthan being an infringement on Alaska's most famous national park, the \nmeasure is actually the favored route by many in the environmental \ncommunity to bring natural gas from the foothills of Alaska's North \nSlope to Southcentral and coastal Alaska.\n  While many in this body have heard about plans for a large-volume \nnatural gas pipeline to run from the Prudhoe Bay oil fields to the \nLower 48 States, the project for which many in this body voted to \napprove a loan guarantee, tax credits and permitting improvements in \n2004, there is concern that the big pipeline will not be finished in \ntime to get gas to Southcentral Alaska, gas that is vital for electric \ngeneration in Fairbanks, Anchorage, the Mat-Su Borough and Kenai \nPeninsula. Currently electricity in Alaska's southern Railbelt, as it \nis called, is largely generated by burning natural gas that has been \nproduced since the 1960s from the gas fields in Cook Inlet, south of \nAnchorage. But production from Cook Inlet, while the province \ntheoretically holds far more gas, has been falling for years, currently \nby about 10 percent annually. A major fertilizer plant near Kenai, for \nexample, had to close in 2007 because there was not enough natural gas \nbeing produced to allow it to obtain the raw product it needed for urea \nproduction at a reasonable price.\n  While there are contract issues and storage concerns involving \ngetting sufficient gas quantities for Railbelt utilities starting as \nearly as next year, there are serious concerns about the ability of the \nregion to produce sufficient gas for electric generation and home \nheating for Alaska's most populated area as early as the winter of \n2014-15, and especially by the winter of 2015-2016.\n  To provide a new, reliable natural gas supply, one proposal, is the \nso-called ``bullet'' gas pipeline that involves constructing a \nrelatively small diameter-natural gas line, probably 24-inches in size, \nto run from Alaska's North Slope region, past Fairbanks along the Parks \nHighway, and terminate near Wasilla, Alaska. This pipeline would tie \ninto existing transmission systems and would bring about 500 million \ncubic feet of gas a day to Southcentral Alaska. This project could be \ncompleted well in advance of when a larger-diameter pipeline might be \nin service to deliver 4 to 4.5 billion cubic feet a day to Lower 48 \nmarkets or a different project could bring between 3 and 4.5 billion \ncubic feet a day to tidewater in Alaska before the gas could be \nliquefied for water-borne deliveries. Given the pace of planning for \nconstruction of a larger line project, it is unlikely that a larger \nAlaska natural gas pipeline will be able to deliver gas until 2022 or \nlater 6 or more years too late to aid Southcentral Alaska's growing \nneed for natural gas.\n\n  There are several potentially competing proposals for a small-\ndiameter, in-state gas pipeline. I have just described the ``bullet'' \nline proposal along the Parks Highway. A second proposal would run a \nsimilarly sized pipeline along the Richardson and Glenn Highways to the \neast, also tying into existing transmission systems near Palmer, \nAlaska. There are advantages to both routes, the Parks route delivering \ngas to communities along the Parks Highway while perhaps providing \nclean natural gas to Denali National Park, while the Richardson/Glenn \nproject would help provide economic activity to differing towns, such \nas Delta and Glennallen to the east. Now there is a third proposal by \nFairbanks Pipeline Co. based on the assumption that routes for either \nof the two larger ``bullet'' lines won't be available in time to meet \ngas demand. That project would build a ``mini'' 12-inch line from the \nNorth Slope to Fairbanks to supply the Interior with natural gas and \nnot attempt to provide any gas for use in southern areas of the state.\n  It is not my desire to prejudge the outcome of which project or route \nshould be selected, since that decision will be made by Alaska state \nregulators and financial markets. It is my desire, however, to \nreintroduce legislation that would clear the lone legal impediment to \nplanning for the Parks Highway route, that being how to get the gas \neconomically through the mountainous central region of the State past \nDenali National Park and Preserve.\n  According to a 2008 analysis of routing options through this area, \nthere are three feasible routes for a pipeline through or around the \nroughly 10-mile bottleneck of the Nenana River Canyon and Denali \nNational Park and Preserve. The shortest and most logical route follows \nthe existing highway through this entire area, 7-miles of which passes \nthrough Denali National Park. This route causes the least environmental \nand visual impact due to its location in an existing corridor, and \nprovides a route that is easily accessible for routine pipeline \nmaintenance. A second feasible pipeline route diverts from the highway \nto stay outside of the national park boundaries on the east, but in so \ndoing skirts along a steep hillside that dominates a park visitor's \nview. A third route proposed in 2009 would travel far to the west \naround the national park, increasing costs, and potentially moving \nnatural gas closer to proposed mineral ventures in southwest Alaska. \nEither of the latter two proposals will create a new disturbed corridor \nin remote locations, and will cause pipeline operation issues and \nreliability challenges due to the remoteness and the ruggedness of the \nroutes. The route that avoids the park to the east is estimated to cost \ntwice as much as the route along the highway and through the park. The \nwestern route's cost has been harder to quantify.\n  Besides being less expensive to construct and operate, the pipeline \nalong the existing, previously disturbed Parks Highway right-of-way, \ncould well allow electricity generation for the park facilities at \nDenali to come from natural gas. And for the first time reasonably \npriced compressed natural gas, CNG, could become available to power \npark vehicles, another environmental benefit of the Parks Highway \nroute. Currently National Park Service permitted diesel tour buses \ntravel 1 million road miles annually taking visitors into the park. \nConverting the buses to operate on CNG can significantly reduce air \nemissions in the park. A third benefit is that for the pipe to cross \nthe Nenana River, not far from the park's entrance, will require a\n\n[[Page S332]]\n\nnew bridge to be built that could carry not just the pipe, but provide \na new pedestrian access/bicycle path for visitors that today need to \nwalk along the heavily traveled highway rather than on separated, \npedestrian path toward visitors attractions and nearby hotels. In all \nprobability the installation work will be conducted in the shoulder \nseasons to make sure there are no visitor dislocations for tourists \nvisiting the park.\n  For those reasons and others, a group of eight environmental groups: \nThe National Parks and Conservation Association, the Alaska \nConservation Alliance, the Denali Citizens Council, The Wilderness \nSociety, Cook Inlet Keeper, the Alaska Center for the Environment, the \nWrangell Mountain Center and the Alaska Wildlife Alliance in 2009 \ngenerally supported the granting of a gas line right-of-way through \nDenali Park, along the existing highway right-of-way.\n  The granting of a permanent 20-foot easement, and probably a 100-foot \nconstruction easement, is not precedent setting. The National Park \nService already has granted a permit for an installed fiber-optic cable \nalong the same basic alignment for an Alaska communications company. \nObviously the exact right-of-way will have to be delineated to avoid \nthe existing cable and to accommodate park goals, such as routing \naround a vernal pond viewing area located along the general right-of-\nway. Just earlier this year the 112 Congress gave approval for a \nsimilar bill that allows a gas line to pass through Glacier National \nPark in Montana.\n  I am proposing this bill simply to authorize the right-of-way for a \nParks Highway route soon so that the decision on which route is best \nfor the state and its citizens--if the ``bullet line option is chosen--\ncan be made based on greater certainty in the cost estimates and the \ntiming for a project. Removing the uncertainty of permitting and \nregulatory delays will at least permit the Parks Highway route to be on \na level playing field with the Richardson and Glenn Highway or other \npotential projects. The State of Alaska in 2010 finished a preliminary \nstudy of the project and continues to consider whether to permit and \nfinance a ``bullet'' line project, compared to other options, including \nimporting liquefied natural gas or building other renewable energy \nproject to attempt to meet Southcentral power needs in the future. But \napproval of the right-of-way would remove a key unknown and allow the \ndecision on which project makes the most sense for all Alaskans to be \nmade without fear that right-of-way acquisition delays could inflate \ncosts unreasonably.\n\n  If the Parks route is chosen and the project proceeds, then the \nnational park may well benefit from the environmental benefits of \nnatural gas and compressed natural gas being more readily available for \npark activities, cutting air quality concerns, and improving pedestrian \naccess--depending upon final economic considerations involving the cost \nand location for a gas conditioning plant.\n  In 2009 when this bill was first introduced, it was modified after \ninitial introduction to meet all concerns voiced by the environmental \ncommunity and congressional staff and the National Parks Service. The \nversion being reintroduced in this joint bill was approved unanimously \nby the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and added to the \nAmerican Clean Energy Leadership Act that passed from the Committee on \nJune 17, 2009, and again on Dec. 17, 2011. The provision, according to \nthe Congressional Budget Office, had nominal--less than $5,000 in cost \nimpacts--when scored.\n  I truly believe there are no environmental issues with this \nlegislation. I think anyone who has ever traveled on the Parks Highway \nin Alaska through Denali National Park would agree, and I hope it can \nbe approved by Congress early in the 113 session given the increasing \nseverity of the need for power generation in the Alaska Railroad in \ncoming years.\n  The third and final section of my bill is the Walter Harper Talkeetna \nRanger Station Renaming Act.\n  The Talkeetna Ranger Station, which is the home of Denali National \nPark's mountaineering rangers, sits just about 100 miles south of the \nentrance to the park. Of course, the landmark that's most commonly \nlinked to both the park and the ranger station itself happens to be the \nmountain that features a summit which represents the highest point in \nNorth America: Denali. In fact, anybody who intends to attempt a climb \nof Mt. McKinley is required to first stop at the Talkeetna Ranger \nStation for their permit and mountain orientation.\n  It is only fitting, then, that we honor the memory of Alaska Native \nWalter Harper by forever linking his name with this specific ranger \nstation. It was Mr. Harper that 100 years ago next year became the \nfirst person to reach the summit of Mt. McKinley.\n  My bill is a simple one, and it is not likely to gain much notice \noutside of Alaska. Within my home state, however, this small gesture \nmeans a great deal. Alaskans, like the people who call any other state \nhome, are proud of the historical accomplishments of their fellow \nAlaskans. Walter Harper was one such Alaskan, and his feat is one that \nwill always be remembered.\n  Certainly, officially designating the Talkeetna Ranger Station--the \nvery building where any hiker today planning to climb Mt. McKinley is \nrequired to first stop--the Walter Harper Talkeetna Ranger Station is a \nfitting tribute to the man himself, as well as his spot in our state's \nhistory books.\n  June 7 of next year, 2013, will mark the 100 year anniversary of Mr. \nHarper's historic climb. It would truly be special for Alaska and \nAlaskans to have this designation in place by that date.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/28/senate-section/article/S332-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S332-S333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 19--CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA CRIMSON \n      TIDE FOR WINNING THE 2012 BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES NATIONAL \n                              CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. SHELBY (for himself and Mr. Sessions) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.
