Madam President, it is very hard to find, on occasion, \ncommon ground in Washington. Of late, it has been hard all the time.\n  There is one thing on which Republicans and Democrats should be able \nto agree: there is no more important issue before Congress than to \nprevent a catastrophic default on our debt. Default would put our \neconomy in grave danger, and that is a gross understatement. I have \nsaid it, so many of my Republican colleagues have said it, and the \nbusiness community is shouting it from the rooftops.\n  Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein said this about averting default--\nhe is not known as a great liberal or outstanding Democrat, but he is \nknown as a great businessman. He said:\n\n       While the current government shutdown is unfortunate, the \n     impacts of a debt default would be magnitudes worse and \n     should not even be considered a viable option. The economic \n     damage associated with default or near default would be \n     severe and have serious consequences for the recovery of the \n     U.S. and global economy.\n\n  That was amplified the last couple of days by Christine Lagarde, head \nof IMF, who says this is just awful for the world economy.\n  The world economy affects us. We affect it. No country in the world \naffects the world economy more than we do. We are going to affect it in \na very negative fashion, which will have tremendous negative \nconsequences for us.\n  There are some Republicans in Congress threatening default, even \nelated that we are going to have one, saying it doesn't really matter.\n  Warren Buffett said that using the threat of default to extract \npolitical payment ``ought to be banned as a weapon. . . . It should be \nlike nuclear bombs, basically too horrible to use.'' Warren Buffett \nsaid this, and his father was a Republican Member of Congress.\n  Business leaders are begging us to do the right thing and to do it \nnow, quickly. In addition to America's reputation in the world, the \nbedrock of the global economy is at stake, as I have already stated.\n  Yesterday a bill was introduced that would remove the specter of \ndefault and allow the United States to pay its bills with no \npreconditions or strings\n\n[[Page S7312]]\n\nattached. Republicans and Democrats may have our differences, but \nneither side should hold the full faith and credit of the United States \nhostage while we resolve them.\n  Let's reopen the government. Speaker Boehner could end this \ngovernment shutdown today, an hour from now, by letting the House--the \nentire House--vote on the Senate's clean bill and reopen the \ngovernment. When the Speaker is on national TV and other places saying: \nWe don't have the votes, he will never know that because he won't let \nthe measure come to the floor. Of course it has enough votes.\n  Let's reopen the government and pay our bills. There is no reason for \nRepublicans to drag out this process and force the Nation's economy \never closer to an economically catastrophic default. Then let's \nnegotiate. Two hundred days ago to the day, Senate Democrats passed a \nbudget, led by Senator Murray, that reflects our priorities. Since then \nwe have asked 20 times to negotiate a compromise within our budget and \nthe one passed by Republicans in the House. We are not afraid to \nnegotiate, but we need someone to negotiate with. We need a dancing \npartner. If Republicans end this irresponsible, as it appears now, \ngovernment shutdown, remove the threat of a cataclysmic default, and \nstop objecting to a budget conference, we could start negotiating now.\n  Republicans have already been so harsh on rhetoric. Republicans have \nalready done enough harm to our economy with a reckless shutdown \ndesigned to undermine the law of the land, ObamaCare. But the \nconsequences of a first-in-history default on the debt would be far \nworse--even worse than the 2008 financial crisis from which we are \nstill recovering. Two years ago, the last time the Republicans flirted \nwith this terrible idea, America's credit rating was downgraded for the \nfirst time in the history of our great country. The stock market \ndropped 2,000 points. It has already dropped 7 or 8 percent over the \nlast few weeks.\n  Raising the debt limit doesn't cost taxpayers a single dime, and \nRepublicans shouldn't claim it does because it doesn't. That is \ncertainly not what they claimed when George W. Bush raised the debt \nceiling seven times. Congress has raised the debt limit more than 90 \ntimes since it was created in 1939, the majority of those times with \nRepublican Presidents. Ronald Reagan asked Congress to raise the limit \n18 times--twice as many as any other President. He, being the great \norator he was, said that to do what is being done now, to use an \nexample of why someone should never do that, he called it \n``outrageous.''\n  Raising the debt ceiling simply allows payment of bills we have \nalready incurred--bills for wars and tax breaks paid for with borrowed \nmoney--and basically the simple operation of our government.\n  I heard one Republican Senator today--I read about it--he said: Well, \nwe have enough money coming in to pay the interest.\n  Social Security payments would not go forward, and that is only the \nbeginning.\n  To even consider defaulting on these obligations or to use the threat \nof default to extract concessions is terribly irresponsible in a \nnegative fashion.\n  Republican Governor Jon Huntsman, Governor of Utah, an extremely \nliberal State, said this about the current Republican brinkmanship over \ndefault:\n\n       It's pretty sad, pretty pathetic for the greatest economy \n     on Earth to be experiencing this . . . Russian roulette with \n     our . . . economy.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       We have to see it as an economic issue. . . . If you think \n     the government shutdown is a big deal, that's a hand grenade \n     compared to a thermonuclear weapon that would be hitting the \n     debt ceiling.\n\n  Yesterday the minority leader suggested that the only way to disarm \nthis weapon is for me to engage in one-on-one talks with the Speaker of \nthe House. I am happy to talk to John Boehner anytime. We have talked. \nBut it is obvious to me that no amount of talking will make Speaker \nBoehner either willing or able to end this shutdown and prevent a \ncatastrophic default.\n  In fact, as my friend the senior Senator from Arizona said yesterday, \nit is time for the Senate to deal and to lead. He is right. We have an \nissue coming before us momentarily--the debt ceiling. We have to be the \nSenate, lead, get that passed, and send it over to the House of \nRepresentatives. We have already passed a bill to reopen the \ngovernment. We have already done that. We are going to go a step \nfurther. Senate Democrats have introduced legislation to avert a \ndefault on this Nation's obligations.\n  I say to my Republican colleagues in the Senate, the time for \nmisleading rhetoric is through, and the time for responsible leadership \nis here. We are happy to work with our Republican colleagues, open the \ngovernment, pay our bills, and negotiate anything--anything they wish \nto talk about.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/09/senate-section/article/S7312-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

Each morning, the Senate opens with the customary prayer \nby our Chaplain and the Pledge of Allegiance. This is an opportunity \nfor Members of the Senate to reflect on two important things: first, \nour mission on Earth not only as elected officials but as human beings \nand, second, our devotion and loyalty to this great country.\n  I have listened to most of the prayers that have been offered over \nthe past 9 days of the government shutdown by Dr. Barry Black. He is a \nretired admiral from the U.S. Navy and came again before us this \nmorning to offer a prayer. This prayer had a very important message. It \nwas short and direct. He talked about this government shutdown. He \nreflected on the fact that we literally have families who in the last \nfew days had that awful knock on the door where they were told their \nson or daughter had died in service to his country in the U.S. \nmilitary. There were 5 over the weekend and I understand 17 over the \ncourse of this government shutdown.\n  Sadly, the support we always give to these families is not there. It \nis not there. Customarily, within 24 to 36 hours they are given a sum \nof money in advance on the benefits that soldier earned so they can \ntake care of funeral expenses and the obvious needs of their family. We \ncan't do that because the government is shut down. That awful knock on \nthe door was not followed by the consolation of this government helping \nthese families. We offered to many of these families an opportunity to \ncome and to be there to welcome, at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, \nthe return of their fallen hero. We can't offer them that benefit \nbecause the government is shut down.\n  Dr. Black said to all of us this morning, all of those who believe a \ngovernment shutdown is just another political gambit--what he said, we \nshould remember, and his words were direct and simple: Enough is \nenough. Enough is enough.\n  It isn't only a matter of these families losing that loving son, \ndaughter, husband, wife, brother, or sister; it is a matter that our \ngovernment that asked them to risk their lives for this great Nation \nwill not stand by them in this moment of grief.\n  Yesterday, the junior Senator from Texas came in and said: Oh, I \nthink we have already voted to take care of that. It is not true. What \nis happening now is the House of Representatives--the House of \nRepresentatives, which refuses to reopen the government--is scurrying \nto pass a little bill that will take care of these families. Let's get \nthat bill in, they said. We don't want to face the embarrassment of \nanother headline like this.\n  That isn't enough. It isn't nearly enough because the embarrassment \nof this government shutdown goes beyond this grievous situation with \nthese bereaving families. It goes to so many different levels.\n  Think about this for a moment: In the United States of America, when \nit\n\n[[Page S7313]]\n\ncomes to infant formula for babies, 60 percent of the infant formula is \nsold through one government program called WIC--Women, Infants, and \nChildren Program. It is a program that brings in pregnant mothers and \nmoms with new babies and does its level best to make sure those babies \nare healthy and off to a good start in life.\n  In my State of Illinois, in the largest county, Cook County, 50,000 \nmothers depend on WIC--the WIC Program that provides the basics for \nhealthy moms and healthy babies. The WIC Program runs out of money this \nmonth. When it does, the support for these families, for these moms, \nand for these babies is in danger.\n  Why are we doing this? Is this part of the Republican strategy--sick \nbabies, mothers unprepared to deliver? Is that part of their strategy? \nIs that their leverage for what they want to achieve? If it is, I have \nthree words for them: Enough is enough.\n  I just left my office where I had a group of people from my State \nvisiting for whom I have a special affection. They are with what is \nknown as the Primary Health Care Association, and I will bet the Chair \nhas a similar association of some type in her State of North Dakota. \nThese are the folks who open the clinics in the neighborhoods and small \ntowns so that people who aren't wealthy have access to a doctor and a \nnurse. I love them, I just love them to pieces because they have \ninvested their whole lives in helping folks who are often ignored. They \ntold me that despite the sadness they feel, and even the anger over \nthis government shutdown, there is a feeling of elation now that the \ninsurance exchanges are open under the Affordable Care Act. They say \npeople are coming in and saying: You won't believe it, but I qualify \nfor health insurance for the first time in my life. These are the \nclients, these are the people they help every day, and now these people \nhave the peace of mind of health insurance.\n  That drives some on the other side crazy--to think ObamaCare will go \nforward and provide this kind of help. In my State, over 250,000 people \nhave already visited the Web sites. They are signing up now for health \ninsurance, many of them for the first time. Ours isn't the most \nsuccessful State. It appears that per capita the State of Kentucky is \none of the most successful, with some 10,000 people already signing up \nfor health insurance--health insurance they otherwise can't afford or \ndon't have.\n  This is part of the debate in Washington. The Republicans, many of \nthem, are arguing we have to shut down the government, we have to shut \ndown ObamaCare, we have to stop these people from signing up for health \ninsurance. It is not going to work. They cannot reverse history. This \nis a law that has been on the books almost 4 years, enacted by \nCongress, signed by the President, judged constitutional by the U.S. \nSupreme Court--a law on which we have had a referendum in a \nPresidential election. When President Obama stood up and said: I am \ngoing to fight for affordable health care and health care reform, and \nthe Republican candidate said: I will abolish it, President Obama won \nthat reelection by 5 million votes. That is the verdict of history. \nThat is the judgment of the American people. That is how we guide a \ndemocracy.\n  There are some very wealthy, very extreme who will never accept the \nresults of an election. They think with enough money they can overcome \nthe voice of democracy. They are wrong, and that is why what we are \nsetting about to do here is to reopen this government, pay our debts, \nand then work out whatever remains in terms of issues.\n  I ask my staff each morning to give me a list of what is happening \nbecause of this government shutdown. I can't keep up with it--I mean, \npage after page, issue after issue. Here is one. There is a major \nsalmonella outbreak affecting hundreds of people in many States right \nnow. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection \nService has announced an estimated 278 people across 18 States, mostly \nin California, have been reported ill. They are working with the \nCenters for Disease Control, along with State and local officials, to \ntrack that. But that said, we have to understand that with a government \nshutdown these agencies are not fully staffed.\n  Families and children across America are vulnerable because of this \nRepublican shutdown strategy. For some, it will mean an illness they \nwill get over in a few days. For others, it could be more serious. The \nwords of the chaplain ring in my ears: Enough is enough.\n  We keep hearing about this piecemeal approach of the House of \nRepresentatives, where when they see these ghastly headlines of \nbereaving families who are denied the basic benefits that we offer \nfamilies of those who have fallen in service to America--when they face \nthat embarrassment--they quickly manufacture a little spending bill to \ncover it, saying: Oh, we will take care of that one. Chuck E. Cheese's \ncalls it whack-a-mole. And that is what they are doing. Each time a \nstory pops up, they try to knock it back down.\n  The Center for American Progress has done a review of the 14 bills \npassed by the House. They find approximately $83 billion in funding--\njust about $6 billion a bill. The total amount of nondefense funding in \nthe original House-passed continuing resolution was $469 billion. \nTherefore, the House bills that already have passed and are currently \nunder consideration make up less than 18 percent of the total. So for \nall the efforts of the House of Representatives, sending over these \nbills to react to embarrassments from their government shutdown, they \ncan't keep up with it.\n  The simple honest answer is to open the government. We have passed \nthe bill and sent it to Speaker Boehner. He is living in political fear \nof calling that bill because he knows it will pass. The Democrats \noverwhelmingly will support it, and enough moderate Republicans will \nstep up to reopen this government, and Speaker Boehner cannot accept \nthat reality. He is afraid to call a vote.\n  How many more embarrassing moments will we have, reporting on \nsituations such as these poor families who have given their all, who \nhave lost their loved ones, and now they are asked to suffer because of \nthe Republican shutdown? It has to come to an end.\n  Yesterday on the floor I appealed to moderate Republicans in the \nSenate to step up--step up and join us. We are going to have a bill \nbefore us in a short time--I hope sooner rather than later--that is \ngoing to avoid a default on America's debt. If we default on October \n17, it will be the first time in the history of the United States that \nwill have occurred. It will have a devastating impact on businesses, on \njobs, and on the savings of Americans.\n  If you have a savings account, if you have a retirement account, have \nyou been watching it over the last several days? Have you seen what the \nRepublican shutdown has done for your plans, for your future and your \nfamily? This is unacceptable, and it will get dramatically worse unless \nwe pass, in a bipartisan fashion, this extension of the debt limit for \nthe United States of America. This will be a chance for moderate \nRepublicans in the Senate to speak up and stand up.\n  Before I close, I want to say a special word about my colleague, my \nRepublican Senate colleague Mark Kirk, who announced this week he would \nvote for a clean debt ceiling. I have said it back home, and I will say \nit here on the floor. It is the right thing to do for my colleague. It \nis the right thing to do for America. But I want to express my \nappreciation for his leadership. I hope his example of stepping up and \nsaying he is going to put the country first before his party is one \nthat will be followed by other Members on his side of the aisle.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/09/senate-section/article/S7313-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7313-S7314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HEALTH CARE EXCHANGES\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of my \ncolleague from Illinois, and I have heard him make reference to the \ninsurance exchanges that opened last week. It was 1 week ago President \nObama's health insurance exchanges opened, and by all accounts it was a \ncomplete disaster.\n  The administration had 3\\1/2\\ years to prepare for the big launch. It \nspent months and millions of dollars advertising the start date. Yet on \nOctober 1, the American people had their first chance to sign up, and \nthe exchanges flopped. It was a complete fiasco.\n\n[[Page S7314]]\n\n  The administration tried to say it was caught off guard. They said \nthey were caught off guard by too many people going to the Web site on \nthe first day. Even Saturday Night Live ridiculed the excuse. They \nsaid: That is like 1-800-Flowers getting caught off guard on \nValentine's Day.\n  There were glitches the first day, but they lasted the whole week--\nthe entire first week. The question is, Did the administration finally \nget its act together? Well, actually, no, it didn't. The past weekend \nthey had to pull down the Web site to try to fix some of the worst \nproblems. USA TODAY, a newspaper whose editorials have actually in the \npast supported the health care law, had as yesterday's headline: \n``Health sites generate more error messages than coverage.'' That was \nthe headline. The subheadline: ``Exchange launch turns into an \ninexcusable mess.''\n  An inexcusable mess. And they go on:\n\n       . . . the administration managed to turn the experience for \n     most of those visitors into a nightmare. Websites crashed, \n     refused to load, or offered bizarre and incomprehensible \n     choices. Even though the system was shut down for repairs \n     over the weekend, Monday's early reports continued to suggest \n     an epic screw-up.\n\n  The front page of the Wall Street Journal on Monday read: ``Software, \nDesign Defects Cripple Health-Care Website.''\n  One does not take down a Web site for minor glitches. These are signs \nof major trouble. Some of us have been warning that the administration \nhas failed to prepare properly. We said there would be security holes \nthat would expose people to fraud and identity theft. It turns out the \nadministration didn't even get to the point where the security flaws \nwould actually matter early on because people couldn't even start \nentering their personal information. The exchanges were failing to \nlaunch. People got repeated error messages, and they couldn't fill out \nforms or applications. They couldn't create an account to start looking \nat the most basic of information to even make comparisons. When they \ntried to telephone to get help, they found long wait times and they got \ndisconnected entirely. Even the administration's biggest cheerleaders \nadmitted defeat. One reporter at MSNBC spent so much time trying to \nshow viewers how to sign up for the exchange Web site on line that she \nactually gave up. They were playing this on television. She finally \nthrew in the towel saying:\n\n       If I were signing up for myself, this is where my patience \n     would be exhausted.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal tried to find out what went wrong. It talked \nto computer experts, who looked at the healthcare.gov Web site, and \nwhat the computer experts said is, ``The site appeared to be built on a \nsloppy software foundation.'' According to those experts, ``such a \nhastily constructed website''--and, of course, they had 3\\1/2\\ years--\n``may not have been able to withstand the online demand last week.''\n  Even the far-left Wonkblog at the Washington Post couldn't believe \nhow badly the administration had failed. One of its columnists wrote:\n\n       The Obama administration did itself--and the millions of \n     people who wanted to explore signing up--a terrible \n     disservice by building a Web site that, four days into \n     launch, is still unusable for most Americans.\n\n  It wasn't supposed to happen this way. President Obama promised using \nthe exchanges would be like, in his words, shopping on amazon.com. \nWell, Amazon can handle 13 or 14 million transactions every day with no \nproblem. There are over 5,000 Web sites generating more traffic than \nhealth care.gov.\n  So how many people were able to successfully enroll in the health \ncare exchanges on the first day? We have no idea. The administration \ndoesn't want to talk about it. First, they said: We are thrilled so \nmany people were checking out the Web site. By Sunday, Treasury \nSecretary Jack Lew was on multiple television shows refusing to answer \nquestions about how many people had enrolled and just repeating the \nWhite House talking points. He claimed 4.7 million people had visited.\n  If they are willing to tell us how many people have visited the Web \nsite, why won't they tell us how many people actually got coverage?\n  The administration says they won't provide any data to back up its \nclaims until at least November.\n  Remember, California claimed 5 million people visited their Web site \nfor its own State exchange for the first day. They later had to back up \nand say that wasn't true. It turns out they had 645,000 visitors--less \nthan 1 million, not the 5 million they claimed. That is a State that \nspent $313 million on their site and it couldn't handle even that many \npeople, because they had trouble.\n  President Obama said he was going to have the most transparent \nadministration in history. The health care law is this administration's \nsignature accomplishment. October 1 was the day they had been working \ntoward for more than 3 years, and now the President won't tell the \nAmerican people--won't tell any of us how many people have even signed \nup for health insurance. Why not? What is the President trying to hide?\n  CNN looked into the 24 States that set up their own insurance \nexchanges under the law. They found that as of last Friday, about \n52,000 applications had been started. That is not how many people have \nactually completed their application successfully; it is just they have \nstarted. It is not how many people have gotten insurance; that is just \nhow many people get to the point of starting their application.\n  Even if the Obama administration fixes the technical problems with \nits health insurance Web site, it will not have fixed the many problems \nwith its health care law. The law will still not give people the lower \ncost, high-quality care they wanted--which is the reason we needed \nhealth care reform in the first place. But I think the American people \nwill hold the President to his promises and hold the Washington \nDemocrats who voted for this law to their promises.\n  The President, right before the exchanges opened, said coverage in \nthe exchanges should cost less than your cell phone bill. He said you \nshould be able to keep your doctor. And he said it would be as easy and \nsecure as amazon.com. So far, the President's health care law has \nfailed on all of these. That was exactly what many of us warned would \nhappen.\n  It doesn't matter if the ObamaCare exchange system failures happened \nbecause of heavy traffic or because of design flaws. The administration \nofficials should be embarrassed, but they should not be surprised. \nRepublicans warned the exchanges were not ready for prime time, but the \nPresident and Democrats ignored calls for a delay.\n  Why is the administration insisting now on fining people--fining \npeople who don't have insurance, even though they can't sign up on the \nWeb site successfully? The President unilaterally gave big businesses a \n1-year delay in the employer mandate. Workers should get the same break \nthat bosses get. If bosses get a 1-year delay in penalties, why \nshouldn't hard-working men and women all across the country get a 1-\nyear delay of the individual mandate?\n  President Obama should have delayed the launch of his insurance \nexchange until it was ready. That would have been the fair thing to do. \nIt is still the right thing to do. It is also the fair and right thing \nto give individual Americans the same delay of the mandate that the \nPresident has unilaterally--without the action of Congress--given to \nbusinesses all around this country.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/09/senate-section/article/S7314-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7314-S7324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, yesterday the Veterans Affairs \nAdministration announced it would furlough 7,000 Veterans Benefits \nAdministration employees, and as a result activities and services in \nthe following areas would be suspended: The education call center, \npersonal interviews and hearings at regional offices, education and \nvocational counseling, outreach programs including at military \nfacilities, the VetSuccess Program on campuses.\n  But this announcement is only the beginning of the contraction in the\n\n[[Page S7315]]\n\nservices and activities of the VA. In fact, VA also announced that at \nthe end of the month it will run out of funding for compensation, \npension, educational and vocational rehabilitation, and employment \nbenefits.\n  What does that mean for America? What are the consequences of the VA \nsaying this shutdown means we are shutting our doors to processing and \npaying the claims of men and women who have served this country, who \nhave been disabled as a consequence of that service, who have earned \neducational benefits so they can come back and continue to contribute \nto this country? What that means to America is we are in effect \ndefaulting and failing on a core obligation this country has to men and \nwomen who serve and sacrifice. America is failing to keep faith with \nits veterans, and America is failing on one of its most essential \nobligations.\n  We ought to be ashamed and embarrassed that 7,000 men and women, who \nwant nothing more than to help their fellow veterans--in fact, half of \nthose 7,000 men and women at the VA are themselves veterans--have been \ntold: Go home. In fact, at the end of the month the benefits, pensions, \nand educational benefits that are received by veterans will have to be \nsuspended because the VA is running out of money. Right now it is in \neffect continuing on the leftover money, which will last only through \nthe end of this month.\n  I spoke this morning to a veteran named Jordan Massa, a native of \nBridgeport, who served for 6 years in the U.S. Army as an infantryman, \nincluding two tours in Iraq. Jordan Massa was injured in an IED \nexplosion, a roadside bomb, that left him severely disabled with ear \nand back wounds as well as posttraumatic stress. Jordan Massa waited \nfor 2 years after he applied for the benefits he needs and deserves, \nuntil October 1--just days ago--when he heard the good news that he \nwould be receiving the disability benefits to which he is entitled--not \nas an act of charity or beneficence; he is entitled to those disability \nbenefits. Now Jordan Massa is on the verge of being denied the benefits \nhe needs and deserves because of this shutdown. A Connecticut native, \nawarded the Purple Heart, he has been a student at Tunxis, and has \nsought to help other veterans as a counselor--giving back to this \ncountry even after his service in uniform.\n  I spoke also to Aaron Jones, who works at the South Park Inn Shelter, \nwhich serves homeless veterans in Hartford. That shelter is full.\n  There are thousands of homeless veterans in Connecticut and millions \nacross the country who also are a mark of shame and embarrassment for \nthis country. The greatest Nation in the history of the world is \nfailing to provide for men and women who have worn the uniform and now \nare homeless.\n  He is telling me the government shutdown has created an additional \nobstacle to those veterans who want to leave that shelter to find \npermanent housing. Some are there for emergency, about 7; some are \nthere in transitional housing, about 10; and they want to resume \nproductive and constructive lives. This shutdown has created an \nadditional obstacle to their doing so. In fact, for Aaron himself, who \nis a veteran and served in the National Guard, a tour in Bosnia, a tour \nin Iraq, this shutdown is a horrendous obstacle.\n  At this moment as I speak on the floor there is a House hearing. The \nHouse Committee on Veterans' Affairs has, as its principal witness, the \nhead of the VA, General Shinseki, who has served this Nation with \ndistinction and dedication and has sought valiantly to reduce the \nbacklog in disability claims and to provide benefits more efficiently \nand effectively to our veterans.\n  Rather than using General Shinseki as a political punching bag, the \nHouse should simply have a vote. They should vote on a simple, \nstraightforward, no-strings-attached funding resolution that would \nenable those 7,000 VA employees to come back to work and serve the \npeople they love. It would provide for other essential services, \nwhether at NIH serving cancer victims or the other agencies that work \nwith the VA to help serve our veterans, such as the Department of Labor \nand the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The piecemeal \napproach the House is taking, a ``cause du jour'' approach to \ngoverning, is simply inadequate and irresponsible. The bill they have \nsent to us, while it deals with the VA, would not provide for those \nother agencies that are essential to the VA's work, whether in training \nor housing or processing claims.\n  This Nation should by embarrassed and ashamed. This legislature ought \nto be embarrassed and ashamed that it is failing to keep faith with \nJordan Massa, with the folks who live at the South Park Inn Shelter, \nand countless other veterans in Connecticut and across this country who \nare entitled to benefits, pensions, and processing of their disability \nclaims so they can receive what they deserve and need. If the House \nvotes it will pass a simple, straightforward funding resolution, if the \nHouse is permitted to simply say yea or nay to that very \nstraightforward, simple measure, this Nation will keep faith with \nJordan Massa, with Aaron Jones, and with the countless millions of \nother veterans who at the end of this month will lose the benefits and \npensions they are entitled to receive as a result of their service and \nsacrifice to this Nation.\n  I ask the Speaker of the House to simply allow a vote. Let the House \nvote so we can open government, pay our debts, and then reach a budget \nthat is comprehensive and responsible and meets the needs of those \nveterans and many other Americans who are harmed and handicapped, \nenduring hardship as a result of the failure of that body. It is a \nsmall minority in one branch of the legislature, one branch of our \ngovernment that is failing our Nation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I understand we are in morning business. I ask consent \nto speak for 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I wish to talk a little bit about the \ngovernment shutdown--what else. It is my understanding that my \ncolleagues across the aisle, I understand I will not have the \nopportunity to speak to any one of them, but should they come out on \nthe floor--they are out on the Senate Capitol steps exhorting the House \nto send something they prefer over or to simply end the shutdown with a \nclean bill. I however would have suggested they would go over to the \nHouse steps as a gesture of good will. I am not sure any Member of the \nHouse--I know when I was in the House, I am not sure I would have \nappreciated either party getting on the Capitol steps and urging me to \ndoing something when I was in the House. But be that as it may, perhaps \nit is a good will effort as opposed to further demands.\n  I want to make sure everybody in Kansas is aware--and I know I speak \nfor everybody on our side--the Republican side of the aisle did not \nwant to shut down the government. As everybody knows, we have the \ncurrent continuing resolution. I am sorry we have to continue to go \nthrough continuing resolutions. This is where we bundle up everything \nfrom appropriations bills, some of which have already been worked \nthrough, and then simply meld them together into a continuing \nresolution. We do not do appropriations bills anymore. That would be \ncalled regular order. I truly resent this. I find this most \nunfortunate.\n  So here we are, trying to consider how to fund the government. Many \nof us believe this funding measure should do everything possible to \nalso control spending. That seems to be the real issue. Chief among \nthese proposals would be to defund or at least delay the health care \nreform law. My colleagues and I have supported multiple measures to try \nto avoid a shutdown.\n  In the past few weeks Republicans have offered no fewer than three \nsolutions to avoid the government shutdown, and I voted to keep the \ngovernment open every single time. Most recently, the House is passing \nmini-CRs to open the government piece by piece because we cannot come \nto an agreement on a continuing resolution. Most\n\n[[Page S7316]]\n\npeople, if they pay attention to the media--or if the media even covers \nthis--understand what the House is trying to do, which is to open the \ngovernment piece by piece. The first item of business would be to \ncertainly fund the Veterans' Administration. We have all seen what is \ngoing on down at the World War II Memorial and, unfortunately, at the \nMarine Corps War Memorial as well, where we have yet to break the \nbarrier. Being the senior marine in the Congress, I may lead a charge \nat the memorial sometime later this week. I have not made up my mind \nyet.\n  At any rate, that is just not reasonable. There are a lot of things \nbeing done, including no death benefits for people who have paid the \nultimate sacrifice recently in the current wars that continue to go on. \nThat is abhorrent. Why that decision was made by the Department of \nDefense I do not know.\n  At any rate, the House is trying to target these particular items, \nmost of which have been identified by the President. So these mini-CRs \nby the House mirror what the President says in regards to the hurt that \nis being caused by the shutdown. What the President identifies, the \nHouse is trying to fix and then send over to the Senate. It is very \nunclear whether the majority leader will even allow a vote in regard to \nthese measures. Senator Cruz spoke to this in regards to a plan A, when \nwe were discussing this in the Republican conference.\n  At any rate, the majority leader has refused to consider a single \none. So this debate is not about shutting down the government, it is \nactually in part to protect Americans from what I call the disastrous \nhealth care law that is damaging our economy, raising taxes, and \ncosting people their jobs. It is about a President who is unwilling to \nlead, unwilling to even come to the table to negotiate.\n  The President is now indicating he might want to negotiate on a \nshort-term continuing resolution, but we do not have an agenda. We have \nhad quite a few people offer plans. The distinguished Senator from \nMaine, Susan Collins, has a plan--it should be a bipartisan plan--that \ncalls for a short continuing resolution, repeal of the medical device \ntax, and then fixing the sequester so the different agencies would have \nthe authority to pick and choose how to meet the guidelines with regard \nto the Budget Control Act. Then it allows oversight responsibility to \nthe Appropriations Committee to take a look at what the various \nSecretaries would do and make sure that is all right. This would be \nplan B.\n  We have a plan C by Paul Ryan that I just read about in the Wall \nStreet Journal. So we are not lacking in plans. What we are lacking is \na room. We don't have a room, we don't have a table, we don't have \nchairs, and we don't have anybody in the chairs, they don't want \nanybody in the chairs. By the way, I would just as soon not have \nanother supercommittee that turned out to be not very super, selected \nby leadership. We could have the Finance Committee, which has \njurisdiction, and the Ways and Means Committee in the House, which has \njurisdiction, and I will bet we could come up with something that would \nbe reasonable. At any rate, it is still about the majority leader \ninsisting, no, he is not going to consider something like this. Unless, \nof course, the President would change his mind--and I hope he does.\n  My colleagues across the aisle have refused to consider even the most \nmoderate proposals such as repealing the medical device tax as \nrecommended by Senator Collins and ensuring that Members of Congress \nand their staff are treated the same as the average American in the \nObamaCare exchanges.\n  Let me repeat that: that Members of Congress and their staff are \ntreated the same as average Americans in the ObamaCare exchanges. When \nthat came up in the Finance Committee, long before ObamaCare was passed \nor, for that matter, before it left the Finance Committee to go behind \nclosed doors, in the majority leader's office--where I think he was \nsinging with Mr. Rich, in terms of singing behind closed doors, but \nthat is another story--at any rate, that first time I think it was \nSenator Grassley who said he thinks it is only right that Members of \nCongress and their staff live under the same rules. He proposed that \namendment. I voted for it then and I would again. It did pass then and, \nof course, now it is defeated by those across the aisle.\n  After failing to pass a budget last year and the 3 years prior to \nthat or to pass a single funding measure this year, the Federal \nGovernment has been operating under a stopgap measure, as I mentioned \nbefore, called a continuing resolution. This is not what the people of \nKansas expect from their government.\n  Despite multiple disruptions and critical delays, the exchanges \nbecame active as of October 1, about a week ago. However, since then we \nhave heard feedback that the exchanges are off to a rocky start, are \nunusable or totally disappointing, fraught with frequent error and \nmessages from a failure of a major software component. That is also not \nwhat people expected from any government program, and certainly not \nwhat has been sold as the President's signature domestic achievement.\n  Unfortunately, this was not unexpected for those of us who have \nopposed the law since the beginning, but it does bring up an issue. If \nyou watch the news media--and for that matter, the comedy shows that \nfollow later in the evening--there is always somebody who is trying to \nsign up on a computer and following the instructions given by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\n  After you log on, the first page shows a smiling face, and then you \nget maybe three questions. I was interested in one of the questions I \nheard had been asked: What do you eat? What is your favorite food?\n  If that's true what on Earth does that have to do with signing up for \nObamaCare? Maybe they are concerned with somebody they feel might be \nobese or something like that, and maybe that is the person who ought to \nbe signing up. I just don't know.\n  I know when I went through the first 16 pages--when I was reviewing \nas a member of the Finance Committee--of the draft on how you sign up, \nI got to page 3, and must say I would not give any database that kind \nof personal information. I think part of the delay is probably caught \nup on that. But you can't even get past page 3, and then it says you \nmust wait.\n  I don't know how long we are going to wait. I know the President has \ncalled it simply glitches and bumps in the road. I think the front page \nof the Washington Post saying that many people had warned the \nadministration that this was not going to work is certainly pertinent \nwith regards to this discussion. I would offer up that these are system \nfailures as opposed to bumps and glitches. I don't know when this is \ngoing to be worked out.\n  Despite a government shutdown, my colleagues across the aisle will \nnot even consider solutions which acknowledge the widespread concerns \nexpressed by the American people have with ObamaCare.\n  Let me also point out something else. The nominee to be the new head \nof the IRS--I asked him first why on Earth he would want to take on \nthat job. He said, I am Mr. Fix-it, and that is what his resume says. I \nasked him a couple of questions, and I wished him well. I said: How are \nyou going to implement and enforce this fine that is going to be on \neverybody if they don't sign up? I understand, from the administration, \nthat nobody has to submit their eligibility requirements with regards \nto income. This is going to lead to fraud, abuse, and scamming. Second, \nyou can't even sign up to begin with, and third, how on Earth is the \nIRS going to find anybody when they do not have the information or \ncapability to do that?\n  I asked the distinguished nominee, who will come before the Finance \nCommittee, where I will ask him again: How are you going to do that? He \nsaid: I need 8,000 more people. I said: What do you think the chances \nof that happening are around here? They would have to be trained, \nright? He said: Right.\n  They don't even have the people to enforce this if, in fact, they are \ngoing to enforce the fine. So why not just tell the American people: I \nam sorry, but we are not ready to fine people. We are not ready to have \npeople declare their eligibility with regards to income, and we are not \nready to sign people up yet because of the glitches, bumps, or failures \nin the system. So just delay it. Maybe they could delay it--as one \nprominent newscaster has proposed--\n\n[[Page S7317]]\n\nand just say: Look, if you want it, sign up for it, do. If you don't, \nyou don't have to. You won't have to anyway because you are not going \nto get fined because the IRS has no capability to fine people. How are \nthey going to do that? Are they going to cut your rebate check? Most of \nthe people don't even get rebate checks. This is a mess that is just \nfalling apart.\n  I, for one, am going to do everything I can to not let this stalemate \nstand. I am a senior member on the Finance Committee. I would encourage \nmy colleagues basically that we meet, and that we discuss a continuing \nresolution that would extend funding out and allow us to try to work \ntogether on the systemic problems that face us with regards to the \nnational debt.\n  I want to work toward a solution. I am going to do everything in my \npower to bring my colleagues to the table. I think they want to come to \nthe table. We have a lot of responsible and good people interested who \nwant this to end just like this side wants it to end. But we race \nheadlong into another debt ceiling debate with the President in the \nexact same position as he is in the shutdown--unwilling to lead, \nunwilling to even come to the table, and we still have the majority \nleader saying no. We have White House officials running to the media \ndeclaring that we will default on our debt, the sky will fall, and this \nwill be the fault of Republicans. These claims of inevitable default \nare false given the operation of the government and the cash flowing \ninto the Treasury each month. They are clearly posturing--and \ndangerously posturing at that. No one wants a default or a shutdown by \nshotgun. Nobody wants a default--least of all me. It is the height of \nirresponsibility to make these claims and all along the way refuse to \nnegotiate.\n  What we are asking for, and what we must do, is very simple: Consider \na debt limit extension and budget changes at the same time, which would \nallow us to address our debt problem. Contrary to what Secretary Lew \nand other administration officials say, this is how these issues are \nhandled. This is regular order. The debt limit, for at least the last \n27 years, except for one small extension, has been attached to larger \nspending cuts and budget reforms. This is not unprecedented. This is \nhow we do business. This is regular order.\n  The President's position is at odds with the stance taken by his \npredecessors from both parties. They saw the common sense of coupling \ndeficit reduction with the extension of the debt limit. It is hard to \nfigure out the President's thinking on this. Maybe now that a huge \nportion of Federal spending is on autopilot, he simply wants a blank \ncheck to fund the government with automatic increases in the debt \nlimit. I want to mention something else that bothers me. I would like \nto go into negotiations with at least certain things that are \nguarantees, things which have been guaranteed before. I am talking \nabout guarantees in the Budget Control Act, and I am talking about the \nso-called fiscal cliff. The fiscal cliff protected 99 percent of \nAmericans from a tax increase and had an estate tax reform that made \nsense and some real progress on capital gains.\n\n  The Budget Control Act, as we all know, led to the sequester. Again, \nSenator Collins has a plan that would fix the sequester and would give \npeople more flexibility on how to do it, but also with oversight by the \nappropriations committees to make sure it is done right.\n  In meeting with the President--and he indicated in a press conference \nthe other day that maybe he would invite more people to the White \nHouse. I appreciated being invited to the White House about 6 months \nago. The subject came to a grand bargain. We were asking how this would \nwork out.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I ask for an additional 5 minutes if I \nmay have it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Thank you, Madam President. I will try to wrap up. I \nappreciate the courtesy of the Senator who wishes to speak. I will try \nto get this done.\n  We were meeting with the President. I was bringing up the issue of \nregulations, but the rest of the people were talking about a grand \nbargain and what could happen. The President said on tax reform: Why \ncan't we start with a clean page? Basically everybody agreed. And then \nhe said we could also take mortgage interest, charitable giving, \nretirement, and we can means-test those and start from there. I \nthought, oh boy, here we go again--income redistribution. That is not \nthe answer.\n  I would just say that before we enter into any negotiations, we ought \nto make sure that the Budget Control Act and the fiscal cliff bill, \nwhich were negotiated in good faith with the Vice President and which \nhave resulted in lower spending, in the first actual decreases in \nspending by the Federal Government since the Korean War. That is \nunbelievable.\n  So in going to negotiate, I don't want to give up in regards to those \ndecreases, and I don't want a situation where the President has said: I \ngave to you on CPI so I need $800 billion in revenue. The distinguished \nmajority leader has said it is $1 trillion. So if we are going to raise \n$1 trillion in revenue, then here we go again and whatever negotiations \ncome down the pike are going to be more spending and more taxes. People \nare just figuring out what their tax bill is going to be with \nObamaCare. We don't need a situation where we sit down and negotiate \nsimply for more taxes and spending. Without going into the \nconstitutional implications of granting any authority on autopilot to \nthe President, I would say I am adamantly opposed to giving any \nPresident that much control over the budget.\n  Why does all of this matter? Why am I making this speech? Why is my \nfriend across the aisle going to make her speech? The debt limit is \ncurrently $16.7 trillion. The debt has increased about $6 trillion \nsince the President took office--more than any other President in our \nhistory. The main source of this tremendous growth in our debt is \nentitlement spending, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. Paul Ryan \nhas a plan to fix that. It ought to at least be on the table, and that \nway we can see a path for where we can go with it.\n  Without changes, spending on these programs is expected to grow by 79 \npercent over the next 10 years. In fact, by law, there is no upper \nlimit on how much we spend on these programs. This spending--added to \ninterest payments on the debt--will make up close to 65 percent of the \nbudget in 10 years. By then we won't have any discretionary spending.\n  The Congressional Budget Office reports that we remain on an \nunsustainable path. All we are asking--prudently, I hope--is that any \nincrease in the Federal debt limit needs to be coupled with real, \ntangible cuts in discretionary spending and meaningful, structural \nreform to entitlement spending. We need to get this done to rein in our \nunsustainable debt and to ensure that these programs are there for our \nchildren and our grandchildren.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that an article by Thomas \nSowell, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution from Stanford \nUniversity be printed in the Record at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                [From the Standard Times, Oct. 6, 2013]\n\n                 Who Shut Down the Federal Government?\n\n                           (By Thomas Sowell)\n\n       San Angelo, TX.--Even when it comes to something as basic, \n     and apparently as simple and straightforward, as the question \n     of who shut down the federal government, there are \n     diametrically opposite answers, depending on whether you talk \n     to Democrats or to Republicans.\n       There is really nothing complicated about the facts. The \n     Republican-controlled House of Representatives voted all the \n     money required to keep all government activities going--\n     except for Obamacare. This is not a matter of opinion. You \n     can check the Congressional Record.\n       As for the House of Representatives' right to grant or \n     withhold money, that is not a matter of opinion either. You \n     can check the Constitution of the United States. All spending \n     bills must originate in the House of Representatives, which \n     means that congressmen there have a right to decide whether \n     or not they want to spend money on a particular government \n     activity.\n       Whether Obamacare is good, bad or indifferent is a matter \n     of opinion. But it is a matter of fact that members of the \n     House of Representatives have a right to make spending \n     decisions based on their opinion.\n\n[[Page S7318]]\n\n       Obamacare is indeed ``the law of the land,'' as its \n     supporters keep saying, and the Supreme Court has upheld its \n     constitutionality. But the whole point of having a division \n     of powers within the federal government is that each branch \n     can decide independently what it wants to do or not do, \n     regardless of what the other branches do, when exercising the \n     powers specifically granted to that branch by the \n     Constitution.\n       The hundreds of thousands of government workers who have \n     been laid off are not idle because the House of \n     Representatives did not vote enough money to pay their \n     salaries or the other expenses of their agencies--unless they \n     are in an agency that would administer Obamacare.\n       Since we cannot read minds, we cannot say who--if anybody--\n     ``wants to shut down the government.'' But we do know who had \n     the option to keep the government running and chose not to.\n       The money voted by the House of Representatives covered \n     everything that the government does, except for Obamacare. \n     The Senate chose not to vote to authorize that money to be \n     spent, because it did not include money for Obamacare.\n       Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says that he wants a \n     ``clean'' bill from the House of Representatives, and some in \n     the media keep repeating the word ``clean'' like a mantra. \n     But what is unclean about not giving Reid everything he \n     wants?\n       If Reid and President Barack Obama refuse to accept the \n     money required to run the government, because it leaves out \n     the money they want to run Obamacare, that is their right. \n     But that is also their responsibility. You cannot blame other \n     people for not giving you everything you want. And it is a \n     fraud to blame them when you refuse to use the money they did \n     vote, even when it is ample to pay for everything else in the \n     government.\n       When Obama keeps claiming that it is some new outrage for \n     those who control the money to try to change government \n     policy by granting or withholding money, that is simply a \n     baldfaced lie. You can check the history of other examples of \n     ``legislation by appropriation,'' as it used to be called.\n       Whether legislation by appropriation is a good idea or a \n     bad idea is a matter of opinion. But whether it is both legal \n     and not unprecedented is a matter of fact.\n       Perhaps the biggest of the big lies is that the government \n     will not be able to pay what it owes on the national debt, \n     creating a danger of default. Tax money keeps coming into the \n     treasury during the shutdown, and it vastly exceeds the \n     interest that has to be paid on the national debt.\n       Even if the debt ceiling is not lifted, that only means \n     that government is not allowed to run up new debt. But that \n     does not mean that it is unable to pay the interest on \n     existing debt.\n       None of this is rocket science. But unless the Republicans \n     get their side of the story out--and articulation has never \n     been their strong suit--the lies will win. More important, \n     the whole country will lose.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I yield back any time I may have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, as my colleague from Kansas said, I \nalso came to the floor today to talk about the unnecessary government \nshutdown that is continuing and is having widespread ramifications in \nNew Hampshire and across the country.\n  I would like to respond to some of what he said about the Budget \nControl Act and about the current state of the deficit. The fact is the \ndeficit, under this President, has been reduced by more than 50 percent \nsince he took office. It is on course to reach a little over 4 percent \nof GDP by the end of 2015, I believe. By 2023 it is expected to get \neven lower--down to a little over 2 percent. There is no doubt that we \nneed a plan to deal with the long-term debt and deficits of this \ncountry.\n  Most of us who supported the Budget Control Act thought that was what \nwe had done. We put a committee in place that was actually going to \ncome up with an agreement on how we could get to a long-term plan to \ndeal with this country's debt and deficits. It is really unfortunate \nthat some of the people who were appointed to that committee didn't \nshare in that commitment.\n  I think it is important to remind us all where we are. We have made \nsignificant improvements on reducing the deficit in this country. We \nhave been willing to look at a long-term agreement to deal with the \ndebt and deficit, and I think that is what we ought to do. I would hope \nthat as the result of this government shutdown, we can get some \nagreement from both sides of the aisle to actually do this.\n  My main purpose in coming to the floor today is to talk again about \nthe impact of the shutdown on too many people who were caught in the \nmiddle between this unnecessary inflicted crisis that we are seeing in \nWashington and the impact that it is having on families, small \nbusinesses, the economy of New Hampshire, and the country.\n  We are now in the ninth day of the shutdown. In New Hampshire we have \nseen hundreds of Federal workers who have been furloughed. Some of \nthose workers are back to work. Fortunately, at the Portsmouth Naval \nShipyard most of those people are back to work, and that is very good \nnews. We still have people at the Forest Service, and we have people \nwho work for the Federal Government in other capacities all over the \nState who have not been fortunate enough to be called back to work.\n  I would just remind everybody that even for those people who are back \nat work, they are not being paid. They are working without pay.\n  In New Hampshire Small Business Administration loans have been \nhalted, and that is true across the country. The Federal Housing \nAdministration and VA loans have been slowed down. At the White \nMountain National Forest, which is a Federal forest that hosts more \nvisitors than Yosemite and Yellowstone National Parks combined, people \nwho are traveling through our beautiful White Mountain National Forest \nat this time of the year so they can look at the foliage are not even \nable to use the restrooms because of the shutdown.\n  This morning I wanted to speak about some of those businesses I have \nheard from who are being hurt by the shutdown. New Hampshire is truly a \nsmall business State. Ninety-six percent of employers in the Granite \nState are considered small businesses and they are the backbone of our \neconomy. They are also where most of the new jobs are going to come \nfrom.\n  Two out of every three new jobs in the United States is created by a \nsmall business, but the shutdown is hitting them hard. I heard this \nmorning from two of our businesses that have been established in the \nState for a long time. They have national reputations.\n  Titeflex, which is an aerospace company in the lakes region, does a \nlot of business for the Department of Defense and they also provide \nsupplies to larger companies. They told me their inventory is piling up \non their docks now because they don't have anybody to inspect it, \nbecause those Federal officials who do that are not working. They are \nfurloughed. They said it is really going to be a problem in 10 days if \nthey don't get this resolved, when they have to report to the \ncorporation their bottom line numbers, which will show on their \nreports, and that will affect their company.\n  Then I also heard from some representatives of Smith Tubular, which \nis a medical device equipment company that does business with the VA \nand with the military, and they also do a lot of work with the FDA. \nThey said they are seeing their contracts affected, and they have heard \nfrom FDA that they couldn't provide the payments they normally provide \nto them because there is nobody at FDA to process those payments. So \nthat is having an effect on the ability of businesses to innovate, to \nprovide the products that are needed.\n  We have seen an impact on lending in New Hampshire. The Small \nBusiness Administration has reported that loans are not being \noriginated. One does not need a Ph.D. in economics to understand that \nif small businesses can't access capital and credit, there are real \neconomic consequences. One of our largest SBA lenders in New Hampshire \nis a company called the Granite State Development Corporation. Twenty \nof their loans are on hold already because of the shutdown.\n  Then this morning I heard from a community bank in New Hampshire \ncalled Provident Bank that it has about half a dozen SBA loans being \nheld up right now. One of those loans is for a newly starting up \nentrepreneur who wants to open an Orange Leaf Frozen Yogurt franchise \nin New Hampshire. All the paperwork is ready to go, but Provident Bank \ncan't get the final approval for the loan until the SBA is up and \nrunning again. So if the shutdown continues, Provident Bank is \nconcerned that interest rates are going to rise, and if interest rates \nrise, the cost of borrowing for small businesses is going to go up.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, because her State is much like New \nHampshire with a lot of small businesses, access to credit is the \nlifeblood\n\n[[Page S7319]]\n\nof those small businesses. Right now, we are preventing them from \ngetting the help they need.\n  Then we have small businesses in New Hampshire that rely on consumer \ndemand. I heard from Charles Moulton, who is the owner of a New \nHampshire maple syrup company called New Hampshire Gold. This is the \ntime of year when people are coming to see the foliage and sample our \nmaple syrup in New Hampshire. He has four employees and his maple syrup \ncompany has a storefront in New Hampshire, but it also sells one of \ntheir signature products, their maple syrup, to Zion National Park in \nUtah--kind of an unlikely location for a New Hampshire maple syrup, but \nNew Hampshire Gold sells to tourists who come there from all over the \nworld during the summer and early fall. But now, because Zion National \nPark is shut down, as are all of our national parks, New Hampshire Gold \nsales have dried up. While they continue to sell in Concord, NH, in \ntheir retail store, much of the cushion they needed to get through the \nwinter into next year comes from that location at Zion. They can't \nafford to lose those dollars as they are thinking about how to get \nthrough the rest of this year.\n  New Hampshire Gold is just one of the thousands of small businesses \nthat have been hurt by the shutdown of our national parks. Visitors to \nthe parks spend nearly $13 billion a year in regions within 60 miles of \nthe parks. This shutdown is hurting not just visitors to those parks; \nit is hurting small businesses such as New Hampshire Gold and all of \nthe other small businesses around our parks who depend on that tourism \nbusiness.\n  There is no doubt this shutdown is hurting our economy. Economist \nMark Zandi projected that a 3-to-4-week shutdown would reduce gross \ndomestic product by 1.4 percent during the fourth quarter. He noted \nthat the projection likely underestimates the economic fallout, since \nit doesn't fully account for the impact of such a lengthy shutdown on \nconsumers, businesses, and investor psychology.\n  The bottom line is clear: The shutdown is bad for our economy, it is \nbad for middle-class families, and it is bad for the country.\n  As we look at the looming deadline for when we need to raise the debt \nceiling so we can pay the bills this country has incurred, there is \npotentially even greater fallout for America. Holding the economy and \ncritical services hostage to score political points is irresponsible. \nWe need to open the government. We need to raise the debt ceiling so we \ncan pay our bills. With the economy finally showing signs of \nimprovement, the last thing we should be doing is what is happening \nright now.\n  I am hopeful the House will do what is right. I am hopeful they will \npass a short-term funding bill. That action will get our government \nrunning again, and then we can continue to negotiate on what we need to \ndo to address the long-term debt and deficits in the country, as well \nas talk about where we need to invest to make sure this country stays \ncompetitive in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                              Quorum Call\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll and the following Senators \nentered the Chamber and answered to their names:\n\n                             [Quorum No. 4]\n\n     Baldwin\n     Bennet\n     Blumenthal\n     Boxer\n     Casey\n     Coons\n     Durbin\n     Franken\n     Heinrich\n     Heitkamp\n     Hirono\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kaine\n     Klobuchar\n     Leahy\n     Merkley\n     Murphy\n     Murray\n     Nelson\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Sanders\n     Schatz\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Warner\n     Warren\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

A quorum is present.\n  The senior Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, when a house is on fire, the reasonable \nthing to do is put it out and then figure out what happened to prevent \nthe next one.\n  When a ship is headed toward rocks, the reasonable thing is to steer \naway and then work on charting a better course.\n  When a government is shut down and is headed toward a default that \neconomists would say is catastrophic, the reasonable thing to do is end \nthe crisis, steer away from the next one, and work together on a long-\nterm plan to avoid these crises in the future.\n  We are now in the second week of this absolutely unnecessary \ngovernment shutdown. Every day we are hearing more and more about the \ntremendous impact this is having on our families and our communities \nacross the country. It is only going to get worse.\n  We can end this today. It does not have to continue. We are holding \nthe door open for our Republican colleagues to join us in putting a \nstop to this madness. All they need to do is come in. Senate Democrats \nhave spent the past 6 months trying to get Republicans to join us at \nthe table in a budget conference. We knew there were two options: \nconference or crisis--working together toward a bipartisan budget deal \nor lurching separately into a completely avoidable government shutdown.\n\n  A number of Republicans joined us in a push for negotiations, but no \nmatter how many times we tried, we were blocked. We were pushed to this \npoint by a refusal to negotiate, and now the only path forward is for \nthe House to end the crisis and then join us at the table at which we \nhave been waiting to sit for 6 months.\n  Democrats want to negotiate. We want to have this conversation. We \nthink the only way out of this cycle of constant crisis is for the two \nsides to work together, to make some compromises and get to a fair and \nresponsible long-term deal. But it does not make sense to do that while \nour families and our communities are being hurt by this government \nshutdown and while the threat of a default hangs over their heads.\n  I served on the supercommittee. I worked with my colleagues to write \nand pass our budget here in the Senate. I know Democrats and \nRepublicans have some serious differences when it comes to our budget \nvalues and our priorities, and I absolutely believe we owe it to the \nAmerican people to try to\n\n[[Page S7320]]\n\nbridge that divide and to find common ground. But are we really going \nto ask them to wait patiently, continue suffering through this \nshutdown, keep watching as we cruise toward an economic calamity while \nanother supercommittee gets together and has a conversation? That does \nnot make sense. Let's have those conversations, let's have those \nnegotiations, but let's end this crisis and get to work.\n  Yesterday I heard something from the Speaker. He said he didn't want \nto end the shutdown or address the debt limit now because that would be \n``unconditional surrender to the President.'' Have we really come to \nthe point where simply allowing the government to open is considered by \none party to be a political loss? Are we really in a place where the \nmajority of one Chamber in one branch of government believes allowing \nthe United States of America to pay its bills is a major concession?\n  I say to my Republican friends who are here today, imagine if our \nroles were reversed. For example, I have been working very hard this \nyear to write an early childhood education bill that I am passionate \nabout, and I believe it will really help our children and our families. \nI suspect there are a few people in this Chamber today, including \nseveral on the Republican side, who could one day see themselves in the \nWhite House. If that day were to come, what would my Republican \ncolleagues do if I said to them that if they did not pass my bill to \nexpand pre-K, I would get all the Democrats together and we would \nrefuse to pass any spending bills until we got what we wanted? And if \nthat led to a government shutdown because they refused to let my bill \npass, what would they do if I demanded a supercommittee to discuss ways \nto invest in our children before I allowed a vote to open the \ngovernment again? I would humbly suggest that my Republican colleagues \nwould say exactly what Democrats are saying now: This is not a \nlegitimate way to negotiate, and the only path forward is to end this \ncrisis and then have a conversation.\n  The great American system we hold so dear--our democracy that is the \nenvy of the world--simply cannot work if a minority of Members can \nthreaten to shut down the government or devastate the economy if they \ndo not get their way on an issue--any issue. That is not what Democrats \ndid when we were in the minority, and it is not what we should do \nshould that day come again. Our system was designed to push both sides \ntoward negotiations in a divided government, to encourage negotiation \nand movement toward common ground. It breaks down when one side refuses \nto negotiate in advance of a crisis, and it falls apart when a minority \nrefuses to allow the basic functions of our government to perform \nunless their demands are met.\n  I know all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, came here to \nfight for their constituents, to solve problems, to make this country \nwork better. I know there is nobody here today--not a single Senator--\nwho was sent here to shut the government down or to push this country \ntoward an unprecedented default on our loans. And I know so many of my \ncolleagues, Democrats and Republicans, are sick of the constant crises. \nThey hate seeing their constituents get hurt.\n  As my friend the Senator from Arizona said yesterday, I think we \nshould find a way to sit down and find a way out of these dead ends. \nThat is what I am here today to offer--a way out, a path forward. It is \nnot a defeat of one side or the other, it is certainly not any kind of \nsurrender, but it would allow us to get out of this mess that has been \ncreated and open a path to negotiations so we can avoid the next one. I \nam going to ask consent once again to start a budget conference as soon \nas the current crisis has ended. Democrats have made it clear we want \nto negotiate. We couldn't have made it more clear. We will sit down and \nnegotiate over anything the Republicans want, and we pledge to work as \nhard as we can for as long as it takes until we get a fair long-term \nbudget deal to end these constant crises. But first this current crisis \nneeds to end and the threat of the next one needs to be lifted.\n  Republicans don't need a hostage. There are plenty of things \nDemocrats want out of a long-term deal for which we are very interested \nin making some compromises. So I urge my Republican colleagues to \nplease consider taking us up on this offer. We can end this today. We \ncan do the right thing for our families and the communities we \nrepresent, and we can get back to work helping people, solving \nproblems, and working together.\n\n\n               Unanimous Consent Request--H. Con. Res. 25\n\n  I respectfully ask unanimous consent that when the Senate receives a \nmessage from the House that they have receded from their amendment and \nconcurred in the amendment of the Senate with respect to H.J. Res. 59, \nthe Senate then proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 33, H. \nCon. Res. 25; that the amendment at the desk, which is the text of S. \nCon. Res. 8, the budget resolution passed by the Senate, be inserted in \nlieu thereof; that H. Con. Res. 25, as amended, be agreed to; that the \nmotion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that \nthe Senate proceed to vote on a motion to insist on its amendment, \nrequest a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two \nHouses, and authorize the Chair to appoint conferees on the part of the \nSenate; with all of the above occurring with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). Is there objection?\n  The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, on this \nside of the aisle we agree it is good to negotiate, and we should. I \nwould only hope the President of the United States would be a part of \nthat negotiation in order to make it successful.\n  But I would ask my friend why the request is contingent on passage of \nthe House continuing resolution. The Democrats have already rejected \nthe House's request to go to conference on the CR, seemingly in \ncontrast to what they are now asking for, which is a negotiation.\n  Hopefully, we will pass H.R. 3273, the Deficit Reduction and Economic \nGrowth Working Group Act, which will create a bicameral, bipartisan \ngroup to address the CR and the debt limit situation.\n  But on the Republican side, again I would say to our friends that we \nhave a longstanding request to make sure reconciliation instructions \nare not in order in a budget conference so that the debt limit can be \nincreased on a strictly party-line vote.\n  We happen to think it is a problem if the debt ceiling is raised as \nthe Democrats are requesting, that we would see the debt go up by 68 \npercent under this President--more than all other Presidents in \nAmerican history who preceded him. We think that is a bad idea.\n  So I would ask the distinguished Senator from Washington whether she \nwould consider an amended unanimous consent request, and we would ask \nthat the Senate, by way of amendment to her request, proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 33, H. Con. Res. 25; that the amendment \nat the desk, which is the text of S. Con. Res. 8, the budget resolution \npassed by the Senate, be inserted in lieu thereof; that H. Con. Res. 25 \nbe amended, be agreed to; that the motion to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table; that the Senate proceed to a vote on the \nmotion to insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House \non the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and authorize the Chair to \nappoint conferees on the part of the Senate; with all of the above \noccurring with no intervening action or debate; and I would further ask \nunanimous consent that it not be in order for the Senate to consider a \nconference report that includes reconciliation instructions to raise \nthe debt limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Washington so modify her \nrequest?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Reserving the right to object, let me make one \nobservation, which is that sometimes I think those who have been \nobjecting now 21 times to our request to go to conference have \nforgotten whom I would be conferencing with, which is the Republican \nHouse majority. What they fight so adamantly and strongly for here in \nthe Senate will be well and ably represented in a conference committee. \nThat is the point of a conference committee. That is what our democracy \nwas set up to do in a divided government, where we have the opportunity \nto do that.\n\n[[Page S7321]]\n\n  Having a conference committee to work out our budget agreement is \nexactly what I have asked for, but I will object because what the \nSenator's request does is simply say: We are going to keep our \ngovernment closed. We are not going to allow people to do the functions \nthat are so desperately needed. We are going to stay closed, and we are \ngoing to hold that hostage.\n  As I said so clearly when I spoke before, we need to open the \ngovernment, we need to pay our bills, and we need to negotiate. That is \nwhat our request does, that is what the Republican request does not do, \nand so I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the modified request.\n  Is there objection to the original unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nher 21st time in coming to the floor of the Senate and asking the \nRepublicans to join us in a conference committee to resolve budget \ndifferences between the House and the Senate. Twenty-one times Senator \nMurray has come to this floor simply asking to negotiate, and the \nRepublicans, who have been arguing that we don't negotiate, turned her \ndown 21 times--the latest by the senior Senator from Texas. The junior \nSenator from Texas shut down the government over the notion of \ndefunding ObamaCare, and now the senior Senator from Texas has said he \nobjects to going to a conference committee to resolve our differences, \nRepublicans and Democrats, between the House and the Senate.\n  If we are going to restore this Senate to the orderly process, what \nthe Senator from Washington has asked for is very basic--open the \ngovernment.\n  This morning the Chaplain of the Senate started by acknowledging the \nfive families who were notified, after they had lost a military \nmember--a son, a husband, a brother in Afghanistan over the weekend--he \nnoted that in their bereavement they were being denied the basic \nbenefits this government gives to these grieving families after they \nhave lost someone in uniform. The Chaplain of the Senate said it this \nmorning: Enough is enough.\n  This notion that closing down our government and keeping it closed is \nsomehow acceptable political conduct is outrageous. We just left a \npress conference where Maryland Senators Mikulski and Cardin, and \nSenator Kaine and Senator Warner of Virginia, spoke about the impact to \ntheir local economies and the loss of these jobs with this government \nshutdown. I can tell stories of Illinois, with 50,000 Federal workers \nwho have either been furloughed or their checks are being withheld for \nthe most part. This is unnecessary, and it is unacceptable.\n  We were in the midst of a terrible accident last week, right before \nOctober 1. A train ran into one of our Metro trains coming back from \nthe airport, and 30 people were sent to the hospital. The National \nTransportation Safety Board went out to investigate the accident to \nfind out what led to this terrible thing. They had to leave at midnight \non October 1, after having collected what evidence they could, because \nthe government was shut down. The investigation was suspended. That is \none small example. There are the five families who are grieving. And it \ngoes on and on.\n  What we hear from the Republicans is we will take care of each of \nthese as it arises. We will pick out the vital functions of government. \nSo far, all of the bills passed by the House of Representatives \ncombined represent only 18 percent of the domestic discretionary budget \nof the United States.\n  So each day, as another tragedy occurs, as another embarrassment to \nthis Republican strategy emerges, they will try to find a way to fix \nthat story, to fix that problem. It is time for us to fix our sights on \na solution that is befitting the great Nation of America: Open the \ngovernment and pay our bills while we negotiate.\n  That is the only responsible way to approach it. I am sorry that for \nthe 21st time the Republicans have come to the floor and denied the \nrequest by the Senate Budget Committee chair, Senator Murray of \nWashington, to sit down and negotiate. Twenty-one times Republicans \nhave refused to allow us to enter into a bipartisan negotiation. That \nis why we face the problems we do today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, it is a good thing that Democrats for \nthe first time in 4 years passed a budget--at least brought one to the \nfloor and passed it on a strictly partisan basis. Before that, they not \nonly didn't pass one, they didn't bring one to the floor for 4 years \nand refused to do so, even though a specific provision of the United \nStates Code actually required them to do so. It was a stunning \ndevelopment.\n  Senator Conrad, then the Democratic chair of the Budget Committee, \nwanted to bring up budgets, fought to bring up budgets, and one time \nsaid he was going to bring up a budget. But Senator Durbin and others \nin the leadership apparently had a vote, and they voted against him. \nSenator Murray, to her credit, has gotten a budget through. The \nPresiding Officer is a member of that committee, and they got a budget \nthrough this year, which was a good thing. I am not sure, but I suspect \nSenator Murray was one of those who blocked Senator Conrad from even \nbringing up a budget for 4 years. So I think it is a bit aggressive to \nsay Republicans are blocking a budget when the history is they haven't \neven voted on one.\n  Secondly, there are Members on this side of the aisle who simply say \nthe legislation necessary to raise the debt ceiling again should be \npassed--like legislation should be passed--on the floor of the Senate, \nand it would require a 60-vote point of order where you have to have 60 \nvotes to pass.\n  In conference, a raising of the debt ceiling would be put on the \nbudget which only requires 51 votes for passage. We have simply said we \nwould allow the budget to go to conference and agree to conference, but \nwe want a commitment that our Democratic colleagues will not try to \nsneak through raising the debt ceiling on the budget--which doesn't \nrequire but 51 votes. Our colleagues have flatly refused. If they would \nmake that agreement, we would go to conference.\n  I think our Democratic majority should agree to that. They have \nindicated they don't intend to put it on the budget. One time Senator \nDurbin said he didn't think it was appropriate to put it on the budget. \nIf so, let's make clear we are not going to gimmick it up and add that \nto it.\n  The reason we have had such contention at this point in history is \nthat we are facing fundamental challenges relevant to the whole future \nof America financially. It is a time of great importance. The American \npeople understand this. The American people want us to take action to \nplace this country on a sound financial path.\n  So we are heading to the debt ceiling. By law we limit the amount of \nmoney Congress can borrow and how much money we can spend above our \ncurrent level. We are now spending about $3,500 billion a year and we \nare taking in about $2,800 billion a year. Think about it. That is what \nwe are doing every year, and it is unsustainable.\n  In August of 2011 we faced a debt ceiling, and the American people \ntold Congress: We want to clip back on your credit card. You are not \ngoing to continue to borrow this much money every year. Before you \nraise the debt ceiling, we want you to show that you are going to be \nmore frugal and are going to manage our money better.\n  Republicans dug their heels in and said, Mr. President, we are not \ngoing to raise the debt ceiling until you agree to some financial \nconstraints and that you are not going to keep spending recklessly \nevery year.\n  After a tense time, a committee was formed and an agreement was \nreached, and this is what we agreed to: First, we would raise the debt \nceiling $2.1 trillion. Then, over the next 10 years we would reduce the \nprojected growth of spending by $2.1 trillion--one for one, as Speaker \nBoehner said.\n  So it gave Congress 10 years to find cuts. But in a little over 2 \nyears, we have already borrowed another $2 trillion. We have hit the \ndebt ceiling cap again, and we have not yet come close to saving the $2 \ntrillion we promised to save.\n  And by the way, these are not really cuts. When you look at the U.S. \nbudget, the budget was projected to increase spending from $37 trillion \nover\n\n[[Page S7322]]\n\n10 years to $47 trillion over 10 years. With the Budget Control Act, \nspending would increase from $37 trillion to $45 trillion over 10 \nyears. That is not really a cut in spending, is it?\n  Yes, the way it has been carried out hits some departments more than \nothers--particularly the Defense Department--and we need to adjust \nthat. But fundamentally, the reduction in the growth of spending that \nwas part of the BCA last year was not extreme, not irresponsible, and \nshould and must be preserved.\n  But colleagues, the President of the United States, after signing \nthat agreement in August--the sequester is part of the BCA. It was all \npart of the same deal that created the $2.1 trillion in savings. In \nJanuary, after that August, he proposed a budget that would increase \nspending another $1 trillion and would raise taxes $1 trillion. That is \nbasically what our colleagues passed in their budget this year: to \nspend $1 trillion more than the Budget Control Act said we should spend \nand raise taxes another $1 trillion over 10 years.\n  This is a total abdication of the promise we made to the American \npeople. We said, OK, American people, we are going to vote to raise the \ndebt ceiling. A lot of people didn't like any raising of the debt \nceiling. Phone calls to my office were against any raising. People \nsaid, It is time for you guys to live within your means like I have to \ndo in my house.\n  So we raised it. But we promised we wouldn't spend so much. We \npromised we would reduce spending by $2.1 trillion, but over 10 years. \nDo you know what a lot of cynics around here said? They said, Congress \nwon't adhere to that. That is just a bunch of baloney. They promise \nthat all the time, and then they breach their promises all the time. \nThat is why the country is going broke.\n  That is exactly what the President did in January of 2012, 6 months \nafter the agreement--he proposed to spend another $1 trillion above the \namount of money we agreed to spend 6 months before. Why?\n  I didn't really want to sign that agreement. I didn't really want to \ncut that much money. So I am not bound by it. I didn't make a promise \nto the American people. I forgot all about that. That was 6 months ago. \nOh, a 10-year promise, that we are going to contain the growth of \nspending for 10 years? Forget that. I don't want to do that. I want to \nspend more. I have investments I want to make. I have taxes I want to \nincrease.\n  This is fundamentally what is occurring here. So we have got to stand \nfirm and adhere at least to the containment of growth in spending in \nthe Budget Control Act. We have to. Failure to do that is a \ncapitulation in our promises to the American people, a total \nabandonment of any pretension that we will be fiscally responsible in \nthis body. It is just unthinkable that we would abandon the limits we \nhad in the Budget Control Act.\n  The sad truth is the Budget Control Act reductions in the growth of \nspending do not come close to putting us on a firm financial footing. \nWe are still on an unsustainable debt course, as our Congressional \nBudget Office has told us.\n  Yes, we have seen a reduction in the deficits this year of $600 \nbillion. People say that is great.\n  George Bush has been called profligate, and sometimes he was. The \nhighest deficit he ever had was $470 billion. The year before his last \nyear in office was $167 billion.\n  President Obama in his 6 years will have averaged almost $1 trillion \na year in deficits. We have never, ever come close to that kind of \ndeficit before in the history of the Republic.\n  So what does a budget say that says we want to tax people $1 trillion \nmore and spend more money under these circumstances? I will tell you \nwhat it says.\n  From the President and the majority here in the Senate, it says: It \nis not our problem. We can't find any more ways to reduce the growth of \nspending. We can't save another dime. You people just don't understand. \nThere is no way we can save any more money. We have a problem, though. \nAnd do you know who is responsible for it? You, the American people. It \nis your fault. You won't give us enough money. If you would just send \nmore money, another $1 trillion, another $2 trillion, another $600 \nbillion which was passed in January, just another few hundred billion \nmore or a trillion here and a trillion there in taxes, why, we could \nsolve all of the problems. Send us more money. And by the way, we will \nuse that money to create government programs and government \nbureaucracies that impose great costs on the American economy and have \nin fact resulted in the declining wages of American workers to a degree \nthat is not acceptable.\n  We need a growth-oriented, lean government--a lean government that \nserves the people for the least possible cost and reduces these \ndeficits. Deficits themselves are pulling down the economic growth in \nour country. The size of our debt is so large, we have never had \nanything like it, it is already beginning to diminish the prospects for \ngrowth in our economy and reduces job creation and reduces wages.\n  I know we are in a tough time now. We certainly need to work our way \nout of this. But the President negotiated over the debt ceiling in \nAugust of 2011, and we made at least a step forward. In fact, it was \nthe most significant fiscal step this country has taken, maybe in \ndecades, and for the last 2 years we have actually spent less money \nthan the year before. Think about it. To hear people talk, they would \nthink the country is going to collapse.\n  But we have had a modest reduction in spending, and that has been \ngood. It has been good. But it is not nearly enough to put us on a \nsustained path.\n  We need to save Social Security, we need to strengthen and save \nMedicare, we cannot afford the Affordable Care Act. We have witnessed a \ntotal misrepresentation on the Affordable Care Act with regard to its \ncost. The Government Accounting Office, an independent auditor, has \ntold us it is going to add at least $6 trillion to the debt of the \nUnited States over the long term under its likely set of assumptions. \nIt does not pay for itself--nowhere close. It is as unstable \nfinancially as Social Security is over the long term.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Let's keep working. Maybe we can develop some ways to \nconfront our financial problems. It is absolutely critical that we do \nthat. We have a moral responsibility to do that and we have to start \nworking together to achieve it. I think the President needs to back off \nhis statements that he will not negotiate on the continuing resolution \nor the debt ceiling.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask my colleague from Alabama, if he \nhas a moment or two more, after I read an official consent request, if \nhe might stay for a moment and answer a question about how that budget \nconference committee works?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I have a moment.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, through the Chair, I want to pose a \nquestion about the budget conference committee. I think it is something \nthat has puzzled a lot of people across America.\n  We hear some folks standing and giving speeches saying for 6 months \nwe have been trying to get a conference committee and we have other \nfolks who are standing and saying we will be glad to go to conference \nas long as there is a deal beforehand on exactly what is done in the \nconference committee.\n  In that regard, I thought it would be useful to have a little bit of \nperspective here. My understanding is that anything that comes out of \nthe budget conference committee would have to have agreement of both \nthe team of delegates from the House side and the team of delegates \nfrom the Senate side. That is a question I ask of the ranking member of \nthe Budget Committee, to clarify that process?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator. Of course that is correct. I \nunderstand the Speaker has indicated there is no guarantee that the \nincrease in the debt ceiling would not be a part of a conference report \nthat came out of conference committee. We have independent Senators in \nthis body who simply said we do not think we should be subjected to \nhaving the debt ceiling increase without a full debate and the normal \nprocesses of 60 votes in the Senate. That is where the disagreement \nlies. People can have disagreements about the validity of their \nconcern, but\n\n[[Page S7323]]\n\nit is a legitimate concern. If there is no intention to move a debt \nceiling increase at 51 votes, why wouldn't my colleagues agree not to \ndo it? That is the disagreement I think that now exists.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, might I ask about a couple of other \npieces to this puzzle. Why not, with that concern--I pass this question \nthrough the Chair to my colleague--why not, with that concern, simply \nask the House delegates to carry that concern, rather than blocking the \nstart of the conference committee?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I say to my colleague, through the \nChair, it is very simple. Senators have rights. They have a right to \nassert those privileges on the floor of the Senate. We have Senators \nwho say you should not do this, you should not raise the debt ceiling \non the budget and we do not want to go to conference unless you do \nagree not to sneak that through without a full debate and 60-vote \nthreshold on the floor of the Senate. Attaching it to a bill that is a \nbudget deal that is huge and would have a lot of interest in it would \nmake it even more difficult to separate that question out. Rightly or \nwrongly, that is their view.\n  I say I don't see any problem and I am amazed at the intransigence of \nthe majority of not just accepting that. I don't think it is likely, as \nthe Senator indicated, that the House would add that to it, frankly. I \nam not too worried about it. But some are and that is causing the \ndisagreement right now. I think it would be great to go to conference. \nI would like to see a conference occur, frankly. I think it is an \nunusual and positive development that after 4 years of not even \nbringing a budget to the floor, that we now have the majority here \npassing a budget so we can try to do something with it in conference--\nalthough I have to tell you, all of our colleagues, there is a big \ndifference in the budgets. The budget passed out of the Senate with our \nmajority that every Republican opposed completely busted the Budget \nControl Act. It is nowhere close to what was agreed to in that Act 2 \nyears ago.\n  I think we have a huge gap to cover in conference. It is not \nimpossible and it would probably be a healthy thing to start that \nprocess. I wish my colleagues would relent and commit not to try to \nsneak the debt ceiling increase in on the budget.\n  I thank the Chair. I appreciate my colleague, a member of the Budget \nCommittee, who contributes ably and works hard to try to do the right \nthing around here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, the thing that puzzles me, if my \ncolleague would still consider responding, is that there is a process \non the floor of giving instructions to a conference committee.\n  My colleague has left the floor, but the question I would have \nfollowed up with is, given that there is a specific process in the \nSenate for doing budget instructions to a conference committee, why not \nutilize that specific process, hold a vote on the conference committee \ninstructions, rather than blockading the conference committee from \nstarting?\n  I guess I will have to rhetorically answer the question, that there \nis no good explanation for why not go through the normal process and \npropose a Budget Committee instruction for our conferees.\n  Then the question becomes, couldn't we resolve this today? Couldn't \nwe resolve this today, have a proposal put forward to instruct the \nconferees, vote on it on the floor of this Senate, and it either passes \nor it does not? Isn't the whole budget process designed specifically to \nbe a simple majority process under the Budget Act so we can indeed get \nthe job done and not be paralyzed?\n  I think--I believe the story--and I would have liked to have had the \nperspective of my colleague--but I think the story is a determination \nto not allow a majority determination of the budget instructions, to, \ninstead, allow a minority to do so. I believe also that is an \nabsolutely unprecedented situation, but I wanted to clarify that and \nunderstand whether there was in fact precedent for this type of \ndetermination that in a simple majority budget process, a minority \nwould blockade a budget conference.\n  It is very strange that this should become such a central issue. But \nI want Americans to understand that essentially it boils down to this: \nFor 6 months we have been trying to start a budget conference \ncommittee. A small group, a couple of individuals have wanted to \ninstruct that Budget Committee but to do so without going through the \nnormal process on the floor so they could do it as a minority rather \nthan as a discussion and decision of the Senate as a whole. It is that \nprecedent that seems unacceptable. I think if the tables were turned it \nwould be felt strongly on the other side.\n  I hope to keep exploring these questions, because this 6-month \nobstruction of being able to get the budget that provides a framework \nfor spending is deeply damaging. This body absolutely has to be able to \ndo its fundamental work in determining the budget, getting a budget \nconference, getting a budget number, doing the spending bills, all \nappropriations bills--because otherwise we are careening from crisis to \ncrisis.\n  I am going to shift gears here. I am going to step back from what is \ngoing on immediately with the shutdown and ask where did the seeds of \nthis come from? If we turn back to about April of 2009, shortly after I \nfirst came to the Senate, there was a memo put out by an individual \nnamed Frank Luntz. Frank Luntz was providing a roadmap on how to block \nany sort of improvement in our health care system. Frank Luntz said, \nand he was specifically instructing my colleagues across the aisle--he \nsaid it doesn't matter what is in the health care bill. It doesn't \nmatter what good it does. Whatever it is, let's attack it and call it a \ngovernment takeover.\n  This was long before anyone even knew what was going to be in the \nbill. So this strategy of poisonous partisanship rather than problem \nsolving has been with us since at least April of 2009. Therefore, a \nseries of myths were generated. As the process proceeded, those who \nwere behind the myths kind of doubled down on them. For example, we \nhave in the health care reform a process by which small businesses can \njoin together and get the marketing clout of a large group to negotiate \nlower rates and get a better deal. But under the Frank Luntz ``let's \ndemonize and deceive'' strategy, instead of honoring the fact that the \nsmall businesses will be able to get a better rate, there has been an \nassertion this would hurt small businesses.\n  In the health care reform bill we have a process by which individuals \nwho have no market clout can band together and get a much better deal. \nWe are seeing significant drops in rates for individuals across this \ncountry under the marketplaces that are just now opening for signup. \nBut indeed, under the Frank Luntz ``deceive and demonize'' strategy, it \nbecame: Let's tell people insurance rates will go up instead of down.\n  We have a bill before us--not a bill but a health care reform law \ncoming into effect--that ends abuses in the insurance industry. There \nwas a situation where you could not get a policy if you had a \npreexisting condition; the sort of situation where if you had insurance \nand you got sick you would be thrown off the policy; the fact that your \nchildren were not able to stay on your policy until they were able to \nget health care insurance of their own.\n  These bills of rights are reforms that are deeply sought by Americans \nacross this country, urban and rural. But under the Frank Luntz \n``deceive and demonize'' strategy, there was simply an assertion, \nunfounded, that this would destroy the insurance system.\n  You have a process whereby, under the marketplaces, insurance \ncompanies will have to compete, private insurance companies. Yet under \nthe Frank Luntz strategy adopted by some of my colleagues across the \naisle, they decided to say this would hurt competition even though it \nstrengthens competition. It puts before people, apples to apples, \ncompanies having to lay out their rates and benefits under these \ndifferent levels of insurance. We are seeing that competition from \nprivate companies proceed to lower rates.\n  Let's fast forward. We had that phase of the ``demonize the plan'' \neven though we have to mischaracterize it and deceive and delude \nAmericans about what is in it.\n\n[[Page S7324]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I will wrap up with a sentence or two \nand yield to my colleagues. Thank you for coming to the floor to \ncontinue the conversation.\n  I think it is so important that we proceed to put our government back \non track and quit careening from crisis to crisis, doing damage to \ncommunities and families across our Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, today is day 9 of the government \nshutdown. House Republicans piously blame everyone except themselves, \nbut there is no mystery about what is happening.\n  It is very simple: They continue to refuse to permit a vote on a \ncontinuing resolution to keep the government operating for one reason--\nthey disagree with one law, the Affordable Care Act.\n  That law, debated for months, voted on dozens of times, signed into \nlaw by the President, and ruled constitutional by the Supreme Court, \nwill finally make it possible for tens of millions of uninsured \nAmericans to obtain affordable health insurance, including those with \npre-existing conditions.\n  House Republicans and a handful of tea party Senators don't like it, \nand they have used all kinds of scare tactics to try to derail it. Yet, \nmillions of Americans who know better, who want to protect their \nfamilies, have already shown that they want to sign up.\n  Unyielding in their opposition, tea party members of Congress, for \nwhom ``compromise'' is a dirty word, are on a crusade to hold the \nFederal government hostage until the Affordable Care Act is repealed. \nIt is a form of extortion that has no place in a democracy.\n  Then, after a couple of days of angry phone calls from outraged \nconstituents, in an attempt to blunt the criticism, the House \nRepublican leadership abruptly changed course and decided to pick and \nchoose which government agencies and programs to fund.\n  This latest ploy is revealing for what it says about tea party \nRepublicans. It is as if they suddenly learned for the first time that \nthe Federal Government is comprised of millions of hardworking \nAmericans, in every State, who perform countless tasks the rest of the \ncountry depends on.\n  Did they not realize that many of the people who sent them to \nWashington depend on the Federal Government for their monthly pay \nchecks? That every American depends on the Federal Government to \ninspect the safety of the food they eat, the water they drink, and the \nair they breathe? That America's students and farmers depend on loans \nfrom the Federal Government?\n  That countless needy families depend on Federally funded Head Start \nprograms? That the Department of Health and Human Services pays for the \nvaccines that protect American children from polio, measles, and other \ndiseases?\n  It has been interesting to hear the Speaker of the House. He wants \nthe President to, ``sit down and have a conversation.''\n  President Obama has shown time and again he is willing to compromise, \nsometimes more than some would like. He sat down with the Speaker last \nweek. But no President should negotiate the terms of keeping the \nFederal government operating. And no Member of Congress should \nrecklessly toy with the United States defaulting on its debt payments \nfor the first time in history, and when the world is finally recovering \nfrom a devastating global recession.\n  The Senior Senator from Maryland, the Chairwoman of the \nAppropriations Committee, has done an excellent job of explaining what \nis at stake--not only for American families but for the reputation of \nthe United States, the world's oldest democracy. Senators should be \naware of the impact of the shutdown on thousands of American companies \nthat depend on financing from the Federal Government to export their \nproducts and invest overseas.\n  During this shutdown, the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation cannot provide new loans or insurance to U.S. \ncompanies. This means that every month those companies--U.S. \ncompanies--lose $2 to $4 billion in revenues, jeopardizing some 30,000 \nAmerican jobs.\n  If the shutdown continues, the Department of State, which conducts \nall kinds of services for Americans and programs overseas, will be \nseverely affected. In fiscal year 2011, when the Federal Government \ncame close to shutting down, the Department estimated that 70 percent \nof its Washington staff would be furloughed.\n  Do our Tea Party friends think these Federal workers just sit idly at \ntheir desks doing nothing? That they are some kind of luxury we cannot \nafford? Wait until one of their constituents is falsely arrested and \nimprisoned overseas, or robbed, or badly injured, and there is no one \nat the State Department to help them. Almost 800,000 children under the \nage of 5 die of diarrhea annually, mostly due to unsafe drinking water \nand poor sanitation. Those deaths are entirely preventable. A prolonged \ngovernment shutdown would mean curtailing water and sanitation programs \nfor millions of people in the world's poorest countries--programs that \nhave always had strong bipartisan support.\n  Malaria causes half a billion deaths a year, 90 percent of them \nchildren. A continued shutdown would force the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development to stop funding malaria prevention programs, \nputting tens of thousands of lives at risk.\n  Speaker Boehner is right. Shutting down the Federal Government is \n``not a damned game.'' But what the House is doing is playing Russian \nroulette with the U.S. economy and people's lives. There is no excuse \nfor it, and the Speaker has two choices: stop it, or continue to roll \nthe dice with the U.S. economy and the lives of millions of American \nfamilies and programs that protect our Nation's security.\n  At the State Department, the shutdown has already forced the \ncancelation of International visitors programs that enable future \nforeign leaders to experience this country first hand. Instead of \nseeing what a great country this is, they see our political system in \ndisarray. It is embarrassing for our embassies and should be \nembarrassing to all of us.\n  Despite the shutdown, the State Department still must ensure the \nhealth, safety, and welfare of nearly 10,000 academic exchange \nparticipants in the United States and abroad. Either those students and \nscholars will have to return home, or the organizations and \nuniversities that are responsible for implementing the exchanges \ncontinue operating without knowing if, or when, their costs will be \npaid.\n  We have heard about the impact of the shutdown on the U.S. national \nsecurity establishment, including the Department of Defense and the \nintelligence community. But the shutdown may also affect the State \nDepartment's anti-terrorism programs that support law enforcement and \nborder controls in countries highly vulnerable to terrorist threats, \nsuch as Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Kenya, and Niger.\n  The shutdown has halted trade talks between the EU and the United \nStates on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Plan. This deal would \nharmonize U.S. and EU regulatory standards, and eliminate trade \nbarriers. It would bring real benefits to the U.S. economy. Yet the Tea \nParty shutdown has prevented U.S. trade officials from traveling to \nBrussels to negotiate with their EU counterparts. Instead, EU diplomats \nremain at the ready to talk to nobody.\n  Because of the shutdown, President Obama had to cancel his trip to \nAsia this week. We hear quite a bit about the Administration's ``pivot \nto Asia,'' but it is hard to pivot in another direction if you can't \neven get one foot out of your own country.\n  Who made it to the Summit instead? China's President Xi filled \nPresident\n\n[[Page S7325]]\n\nObama's seat next to Vladimir Putin. Is this who the tea party wants to \nlead in the lower income Asian countries? For the sake of our economy \nand national security, we need our President to have a seat at the \ntable.\n  The list goes on and on, but these are just a few of the impacts of \nthe shutdown that are only beginning to be felt. As this needless work \nstoppage drags on and more people are furloughed and programs are \ncancelled, our diplomats, our international development programs, our \nleadership in international organizations, and our national security \nwill suffer.\n  It is as foolhardy as it is wasteful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I am pleased to be here on the Senate \nfloor this afternoon. I am saddened by the circumstances we find \nourselves in and look for a solid, responsible, and quick resolution to \nour differences in regard to continuing resolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from California Mrs. Boxer \nfollow me upon the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, again, under the circumstances we find \nourselves in, I look forward to a quick and responsible resolution to \nthe differences we have and that we move forward with the funding of \nour Federal Government.\n  I would point out that a reason we are at this point is we need a \ncontinuing resolution because the Senate failed to do its work in the \nfirst place. While, for the first time in 4 years, the Senate passed a \nbudget, it was never reconciled in conference with the House. I am \ncertainly a Republican who would be supportive of that reconciliation \nof the conference committee to work out the differences between a \nHouse-passed budget and the Senate-passed budget.\n  The reality is that there are 12 appropriations bills--and I am a \nmember of the Senate Appropriations Committee. I take that \nresponsibility very seriously. I was excited to become a member of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee when I arrived here at the Senate. I \nsaw it as an opportunity for us to establish our priorities and \ndetermine what we should be spending money on. Yet not 1 of the 12 \nbills that are required for us to pass across the Senate floor has been \npassed this year; therefore, on September 30 we ended up with no \nfunding in place, and it creates this opportunity for us to have this \ndebate and discussion about a continuing resolution at a time in which \nthere is great leverage on that issue.\n  What I lament and what I wish would have happened is we would have \npassed 12 appropriations bills and then worked out the differences with \nthe appropriations process in the House.\n  Today I want to speak about a particular issue related to the \nshutdown of the Federal Government--the lack of funding. Prior to that \noccurring--prior to September 30--both the House and Senate and the \nPresident signed legislation called Pay Our Military Act. It was \ndesigned to make certain that our military men and women had \ncompensation should there be a shutdown. I appreciate that legislation \npassing and am pleased it is in place now we are in the circumstance we \nare in. There were rumors and concerns about how that bill would be \nimplemented by the Department of Defense. The Senator from West \nVirginia Mr. Manchin and I led an effort in which we had 50 Senators in \na highly bipartisan way ask the Secretary of Defense to interpret that \nlegislation in a broad way that would make certain our furloughed \ncivilian employees who support our military men and women, as well as \nour Reserve component--those who serve in the National Guard and \nReserve--would be put back to work for the benefit of the Nation's \nsecurity.\n  I thank Secretary of Defense Hagel for his decision to implement that \nlegislation in a broad way that did exactly that--returned furloughed \ncivilian workers at DOD, the Department of Defense, back to work, and \ngave the ability for our National Guard and Reserve members to continue \nin their responsibilities for defending our country. Again, I thank \nSecretary Hagel.\n  I am here today to point out that we have an additional problem, in \nfact, one that is equally, if not more, serious than that, and that is \nthat we have read and heard that those who die in the active service of \nour country are not now able to receive the death benefits that come to \ntheir families upon their death. I can't imagine that there is a \nSenator of any political party or persuasion who thinks that is a \ndesirable outcome.\n\n  With Senator Manchin and others, we worked at bringing this issue to \nthe attention of the Department of Defense, asking Secretary Hagel, in \na letter that was led by Senator Coons and Senator Blunt, to use every \nopportunity, full authority, wide flexibility--whatever circumstances \nthe Department of Defense could find--to provide the benefits to those \nwho died in service to our country.\n  There is a special tax-free payment of $100,000 to eligible survivors \nof members of the armed forces who are killed in action. Those benefits \nusually arrive within the first 3 days following the death of a service \nman or woman. This helps the family--certainly not overcome their \nloss--to have the necessary funds for funeral services, to travel in \nthis case to Dover Air Force Base to meet their loved one as he or she \nreturns home, and to overcome the lack of a regular paycheck. This \ndeath gratuity is such a small price to pay to honor and recognize \nsomeone's family who has lost a member of their family in service to \nour country.\n  At least the stories are, the reports are that this situation is due \nto the inability of us to resolve--to work with the President, \nRepublicans and Democrats, House and Senate--the continuing resolution, \nand so work is being done so that the death benefit will be available. \nMy understanding is that the House of Representatives is poised to pass \nlegislation to make certain that the Department of Defense has the \nauthority to immediately pay those benefits. I hope that is a piece of \nlegislation that is met with unanimity of support here in the Senate.\n  We have asked Secretary of Defense Hagel if he has the ability to do \nthat within his current legal jurisdiction, within the law--if he has \nthe ability to do that within the law that he does have--and we \nanxiously await and hope the Secretary can do that. But, if not, I hope \nthis Senate will unanimously confirm that legislation that would allow \nthe Secretary to pay those benefits immediately.\n  Again, I just can't imagine any of my colleagues ever thinking that \nunder any circumstance, we ought not step forward to resolve this \nissue. Just because we can't resolve everything--it seems to me there \nis a method of operation too often here in the Senate that if we can't \nsolve every problem, we are unwilling to solve any problem. On those \nthings on which there is such significant agreement, we ought not let \nanything stand in the way of coming to the aid and rescue of a family \nwho now so desperately grieves the loss of their loved one.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n                        Sergeant Patrick Hawkins\n\n  We know over the weekend there were five soldiers killed in \nAfghanistan. There are five families as of today who would be in this \ncircumstance. I would like to pay tribute to one of those five: SGT \nPatrick Hawkins. He was born October 1, 1988. He graduated from high \nschool and enlisted in the Army in his hometown of Carlisle, PA.\n  SGT Patrick Hawkins, according to his Italian commander, was \ndescribed as a brave and incredibly talented Ranger. The description of \nhis death revolved around the fact that he was moving to aid another \nwounded Ranger when he was killed. His actions, according to, again, \nhis commander, were in keeping with the epitome of the Ranger creed, \nwhich is, ``I will never leave a fallen comrade.''\n  Sergeant Hawkins dedicated himself to serving us--to serving our \nfamilies, to serving all Americans--and he ultimately paid for that \nservice with the loss of his life. I pay tribute to this soldier as an \nexample of many who have sacrificed in similar ways over a long period \nof time, but especially for those five who this weekend lost their \nlives in Afghanistan.\n  Sergeant Hawkins was awarded the Bronze Star and the Meritorious \nService Medal. He was awarded a Purple Heart. None of that replaces the \nloss of life. He is survived by his wife, who is\n\n[[Page S7326]]\n\na resident of Lansing, KS, and her parents, who are residents of my \nhometown of Plainville, KS.\n  So today, on behalf of my colleagues in the Senate, I pay tribute to \na soldier who in serving his country lost his life, who leaves behind \ngrieving family members and friends, and who epitomizes what we all \nshould know in service here in the Senate, which is what I spoke about \nearlier on the Senate floor this week. That is, if we need a reminder \nabout how this place should work, we should look to our service men and \nwomen who, for no partisan reason--no Republican or Democratic reason--\nvolunteered to serve their country. They concluded there were things \nmuch more important than life itself, and that being the ability to \nhave a country that we know and enjoy as the United States of America, \nthat has the freedom and liberties guaranteed to us by our \nConstitution, and creates the opportunity for every American to pursue \nwhat we all call the American dream.\n  Today, I pay tribute to one more hero, one more soldier, one more \nAmerican who, through service to others, was willing to sacrifice his \nlife for the betterment of his family back home and for the future of a \ncountry that we all love and call home, the United States of America.\n  I yield to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, would it be possible--because Senator \nCasey and I were each thinking we would get 10 minutes and we are \nwilling to cut that to 15 minutes between the two of us--could we ask \nunanimous consent, if the Republicans don't mind, just slipping a \nlittle bit, because people took extra time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you. So we will each have about 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, we are going to fix the injustice my \ncolleague spoke about--the injustice to the families who lost their \nloved ones. Let me be clear about one of those five families who were \ndenied the benefit and someone important to me a constituent of mine--\nArmy 1LT Jennifer Moreno from San Diego, who was killed this weekend in \nAfghanistan by a roadside bomb. Jennifer was 25 years old. Because of \nthis shutdown brought to us by the Republicans, those families have to \nsuffer even more than they are already suffering.\n  Let's be clear. This never had to happen. This government has been \nshut down by the Republicans for one reason, and John Boehner was \nhonest about it. He said:\n\n       The American people don't want to shut down the government, \n     but the American people don't want ObamaCare. They don't want \n     the Affordable Care Act.\n\n  Let me say that to close down the government because a person doesn't \nlike a law that was passed almost 4 years ago, to shut down the \ngovernment because a presidential election was lost and which was \nbased, in large part, on this--to shut down the government, to keep our \npeople--millions of them--from getting affordable care for the first \ntime, it is a disgrace. It is. There is no other way to say it, except \nmaybe it was said beautifully here. It was said beautifully here by the \nchaplain: ``Enough is enough.''\n  We are going to fix this problem; of course we are, this indignity \nour military families had to face. But let's be clear: It never would \nhave happened if the government had been open.\n  We have two things that are in our job description. I know the \nPresiding Officer knows that quite well. One is to keep the doors of \ngovernment open officially. We do our best, but we don't always \nsucceed. There are problems here and there. Keep the doors open. Just \nas a pilot has to fly a plane, just like a teacher has to teach a \nclass, just like a nurse has to give a vaccination, we have a basic \nresponsibility to keep this government open, and we know how to do it. \nThey pass a budget over in the House, we pass it in the Senate, the \nconference is called, they hammer it out, and we have a budget plan, \nand none of this would be happening. Let's be clear. The Republicans \nhave objected now 21 times--21 times--to Senator Murray, the chairman \nof our Budget Committee, so she can sit and confer with her \ncounterpart, Paul Ryan, and hammer out the details of a long-term \nbudget. But, no. The Republicans don't want to do that. They want to \nhold the country hostage. They want to put our backs up against the \nwall, or the backs of the American people. Why? They don't like the \nhealth care law.\n  If a person doesn't like a law, that person tries to repeal it. They \ntried to repeal it 43 times. It went nowhere. If you don't like a law, \ntry to replace the people who support the law. Oh, they tried. They \ntried and they failed. I served with five Presidents, three of them \nRepublican. I didn't like everything they did; believe me. But after \nthey won and they had an agenda, I did what I could, and so did my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, to carry it out the best I \ncould, to fix it where I could.\n  Let me just say this: We are in a shutdown because they are throwing \na temper tantrum about the health care law, the Affordable Care Act. I \nwish to share some news with them, because I went home to see how the \nhealth care law is working in my State. I want to say what I know. I \nknow it is working. By now we have had more than a million distinct \nvisitors to our site, coveredCA.com. We have tens of thousands of \napplications. We have completed more than 20,000. Small businesses by \nthe hundreds are coming on to the site.\n  In the time I have remaining, let me read to my colleagues about one \nwoman the Republicans want to stop from getting health care by shutting \ndown the government. According to the Associated Press, nothing could \ndissuade Rachel Mansfield of La Quinta, who sent in an application to \nCovered California last week. Rachel has been waiting for the exchange \nto start so she and her husband could get health insurance. Rachel is \nself-employed. Her parents currently pay a $530 monthly premium for her \ncoverage. Her husband has been rejected for health coverage because he \nwas diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Rachel's new \npremium, instead of it being $530 for just her, will be $400 for both \nof them, with higher quality coverage than she currently has.\n  That is why the Republicans are having a temper tantrum, to stop my \nconstituent from, for the first time, having peace of mind and having \ngood insurance? Come on. If you don't like the law, work with us. We \ncan make it better.\n  Then there is Melissa Harris. According to the Fresno Bee, Melissa \nstopped at a CoveredCA tent on campus. She is paying $600 a month with \nhelp from her family for insurance through her former employer. She has \ndiabetes and hypertension and, under the Affordable Care Act--which \nprevents insurance companies from denying coverage for preexisting \nconditions--she can now afford health insurance on her own. And the \nquote from her, from my constituent is, ``It's a Godsend for me--a \nblessing.''\n  It is a blessing. And that is why the Republicans are shutting down \nthe government, to stop my constituent from getting a blessing of \nhealth insurance.\n  There was another story of a man who waited on the phone for 40 \nminutes, and he finally got on. He signed up and he said: You know \nwhat, I have been waiting for years. Forty minutes was nothing.\n  So I say to my friends, the law is the law. Open the government, pay \nour bills, and we will negotiate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator's time is expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield the rest of the time to Senator \nCasey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, thank you very much. I know our time is \nlimited.\n  I want to start on an issue that I think all of us are coming \ntogether on no matter what party we are in, and that is what has been \nhappening to our military families.\n  On Sunday, as noted by the Senator from Kansas a few moments ago, SGT \nPatrick Hawkins from Carlisle, PA, was killed in action in Afghanistan \nwhen his unit was hit with an IED, an improvised explosive device. \nSergeant Hawkins was moving to the aid of a wounded Ranger when he was \nkilled. Due to the shutdown, Sergeant Hawkins' family cannot receive \nthe death\n\n[[Page S7327]]\n\nbenefit provided to soldiers to cover the funeral and burial expenses \nfor that family.\n  Today I am joining an effort with a number of Senators writing to \nurge Secretary Hagel to use whatever discretion he has to provide the \ndeath benefits to the Hawkins family as well as the other families so \nwe can meet the promise we made to those families. I know the President \nis working on this issue, is working with the Office of Management and \nBudget and the Defense Department on a solution to this problem.\n  Mr. President, I will move to the question of where we are now. This \nis a shutdown brought about by the tea party. We know that if Speaker \nBoehner would simply hold a vote on the bill that is before him, which \nwould fund the government, this crisis would be over.\n  So we should continue to take steps, No. 1, to open our government; \nNo. 2, to pay our bills and make sure we do not miss a bill and \ndefault; and No. 3, to negotiate--or I would argue to continue to \nnegotiate because we already negotiated a budget number which was much \nlower than our side of the aisle wanted. We agreed to $70 billion less \nfrom the other side. If that is not a compromise and a negotiation, I \ndo not know what is.\n  We know this sentiment and this position to make sure the government \nopens is a point of view that is shared by Democrats, Republicans, and \nIndependents across the country. By way of example, nine Members of the \nPennsylvania congressional delegation--four Republicans and five \nDemocrats--are supportive of a so-called clean bill that does not have \nattachments to it, to open the government, to make sure we can have a \nfunctioning government, to pay our bills, and then work together on \nlonger term solutions. Just a couple of examples--and I know our time \nis limited.\n  As this tea party shutdown moves into its second week, the Women, \nInfants and Children Program--we know it by the acronym WIC--will no \nlonger be able to be funded in many States across the country. We know \nthis program provides nutritional services to more than 8.9 million \nparticipants per month, including 4.7 million children and 2.1 million \ninfants. A quarter of a million of my constituents in Pennsylvania \ndepend upon this program. For now--for now--the State government is \nusing carryover funds to keep the WIC Program running in Pennsylvania. \nIf the government shutdown continues to stretch on, this may put the \nprogram in jeopardy.\n  We know the impact this shutdown is having on older citizens across \nPennsylvania and across the country. The Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services is no longer able to provide health care provider \noversight. While Medicare claims are still being paid, the shutdown has \ncaused a reduction in the number of initial surveys and \nrecertifications for Medicare and Medicaid providers. If providers are \nunable to be certified, then they cannot serve beneficiaries.\n  Home- and community-based services are adversely impacted. We know \nthat even though Social Security checks are going out, at the same time \nthose who are hoping to be enrolled in Social Security do not have that \nopportunity.\n  Let me read from a letter we got from a constituent in northeastern \nPennsylvania talking about this individual's parents.\n\n       Besides our personal difficulties due to the Budget \n     Impasse, my elderly parents live with the worry of when and \n     if they will receive their Social Security checks. At 85 and \n     83, they should not have this uncertainty. These should be \n     their golden years. It breaks my heart to hear my Mother \n     saying she can't sleep and has a stomach ache from the worry \n     about where our country is heading. Middle and low income \n     families cannot afford another economic downturn, we are just \n     barely recovering from the last one.\n\n  That entire passage came from one individual in northeastern \nPennsylvania writing about her parents, and I think that is the best \nsummation I have read about what this is doing to people. The worry and \nthe anxiety, in addition to the harsh impact, are things we should not \naccept.\n  Finally, I will conclude with some comments about national security.\n  I support--and I know this is widely shared--the passage of the Pay \nOur Military Act and welcome the Defense Department's decision to bring \nthe majority of furloughed staff back. We mentioned the death benefits \nfor families. We are all together on that. But all the while--all the \nwhile--that the Speaker does not put a bill on the floor that will open \nthe government, we see the impacts on our national security. Seventy \npercent of the intel community's workforce has been furloughed. These \nare people who work every day to keep us safe from terrorists, and they \nare not able to work. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset \nControl has a skeletal crew, and they are not able to do their work, \nwhich is part of our national security.\n  So if we are doing the right thing, and if the Speaker and his party \nin the House are doing the right thing, they would vote today to open \nthe government, to ensure that we pay our bills, and to continue to \nnegotiate. It is very simple. What they have in front of them is a 16-\npage bill. I think they could pass it this afternoon and reopen our \ngovernment and give that family in northeastern Pennsylvania some \nmeasure of peace of mind instead of the worry and the anxiety and the \nfear that are caused by both the government shutdown and efforts made \nto even contemplate defaulting on the full faith and credit of the \nUnited States of America.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Unanimous Consent Request--H. Con. Res. 58\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last Saturday the House voted 400 to 1 \nto express the view that a government shutdown should not interfere \nwith the ability of military chaplains to provide services for our \nservicemembers. The House took that vote amid reports that chaplains \nwere limited in their ability to minister to those who sought their \nservices even if ministers were doing so on a volunteer basis.\n  We have heard reports that those who have scheduled baptisms might \nnot be able to have them. Obviously, this is not a tolerable situation. \nWe have a very large military presence in Kentucky. The folks at Fort \nCampbell and Fort Knox do not need this. We need to remedy the \nsituation immediately and care for the troops who have volunteered to \ndefend us.\n  The House has already taken a stand, in an overwhelming, bipartisan \nbasis--only one vote against it. It is time for the Senate to do the \nsame. So I would call on the majority to allow a vote to express the \nSenate's views that servicemembers in my State and every other State or \noverseas should be able to receive religious services. This is one vote \nwe should have today. Some of my colleagues will talk this afternoon \nabout some of the other votes we should also have. The government may \nbe shut down, but our service men and women should not be caught in the \nmiddle of this impasse.\n  I had indicated to my colleague, the majority leader, that I would \nask unanimous consent after my remarks, which I will proceed to do now. \nI ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H. Con. Res. 58, which was received from the House; I \nfurther ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be considered made \nand laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, there is no question when we look across \nthe Senate or across the House, people of different political parties, \npeople of different faiths all support any kind of religious service \nfor members of the armed services. There is no question about that. Our \nbudgets indicate that every year. That is a widely held point of view.\n  Unfortunately, what we are seeing is a continuation of an effort to \npick and choose what areas of our government should be funded. We \nshould not have an exercise where we choose between our soldiers and \nour kids or between\n\n[[Page S7328]]\n\none priority versus the other. We should vote and work together to open \nthe government. It is as simple as that. Open every service that is \npart of the Federal Government.\n  Open the government, pay our bills, and continue negotiations which \nstarted a long time ago on the current budget. I come from a State \nwhich has well more than 1 million veterans. No State in the country \nhas contributed more to the armed services of the United States than \nPennsylvania. I will take a backseat to no one when it comes to \nsupporting our troops and supporting their families.\n  That is why we are all coming together to make sure the death benefit \nis paid for those who recently lost their lives, including Sergeant \nHawkins from Pennsylvania. But this process we are going through today \nis just another attempt to not deal directly with the question of how \nwe are going to operate the Federal Government.\n  We should urge our colleagues in the House to have a vote today. It \nwould take a matter of minutes for the House to vote on a bill that \nwill open the government, allow us to make sure we are paying our \nbills, and do everything we can to continue to work together on a \nlonger term budget agreement.\n  So I would first offer a modification and ask unanimous consent as \nfollows: that an amendment which is at the desk be agreed to, \nexpressing the sense of the Congress that the House should vote on the \nSenate amendment to H.J. Res. 59, the continuing resolution passed by \nthe Senate; that the concurrent resolution, as amended, be agreed to; \nthat the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the \ntable with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Republican leader so modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Is there objection to the \noriginal request?\n  Mr. CASEY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Republican whip.\n\n\n                Unanimous Consent Request--H.J. Res. 91\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, there are obviously differences in this \nChamber over the fiscal direction of our country, but we should be \nunited in our efforts to do right by our uniformed military and their \nfamilies and certainly their survivors. The way they have been treated \nis simply unacceptable--indeed, it is outrageous. The President's \nspokesman today said he is looking for a solution. We are here to offer \none to him. Washington has not gotten a lot right lately but now is our \nchance. The legislation I will be offering a unanimous consent request \non would right this wrong by ensuring that the families of the fallen \nreceive four essential benefits: the death gratuity benefit, the \ncoverage of funeral and burial expenses, coverage of travel to both the \nfuneral and the dignified transfer of their loved one's remains and the \ntemporary continuation of their housing allowance.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate receives H.J. Res. 91, \nmaking continuing appropriations for survivor benefits for survivors of \ndeceased military servicemembers for fiscal year 2014, the measure be \nread three times and passed, the motion to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, would my friend agree that \nwe have just learned that the President said he would solve this in the \nnext hour. Would my friend be willing to wait until 4 o'clock today and \nrenew his request at that time if it has not been done?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, responding to the distinguished majority \nleader, if that will help facilitate this getting done, we would be \nglad to work with him. Hopefully, we can find another area, as we did \nfor military pay for our uniformed military, where we can begin to \nmitigate the hardship caused by this shutdown.\n  Mr. REID. I think on this issue it would be the best way to proceed; \nthat we can do something together, and hopefully the White House will \nbe in on what we are trying to do. So I ask my friend to renew this at \n4 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                Unanimous Consent Request--H.J. Res. 70\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, if businesses ran their operations the same \nway the government is running this shutdown, they would be bankrupt. \nOh, that is right. That is kind of where we are, isn't it.\n  Our national parks, particularly the ones that are revenue producers, \nare shut down. Yellowstone Park is a revenue producer. You pay to go \ninto the park. You pay to travel through the park. The roads connect \nMontana, Idaho, and Wyoming. It is a thoroughfare. You have to pay to \nbe able to do that. But right now you cannot do that, which means you \nprobably have to travel an extra 300 miles to get to your destination.\n  The park does not get the revenue, and not only that, there are \npeople in the park who are visiting there and they have been made to \nleave. They were made to leave in a very ungracious way. One of the \ntours was from Japan, Australia, Canada, and some people from the \nUnited States. They had reservations at Old Faithful. That is one of \nthe historic places in the park, one place that everybody goes because \nthey like to see the geyser go off. It is probably the most famous \ngeyser in the world.\n  But they were told they had to leave. They had 2 days of \nreservations. They said: OK. You can stay for the 2 days. But an armed \nguard was outside of their room and they could not leave their room to \ngo watch the geyser go off, which they do not have any control over, \nnor can they harm. It has been written up as Gestapo tactics that met \nsenior citizens in Yellowstone Park.\n  So we are giving up the revenue and we are creating a bad impression. \nWe should not be doing that. We ought to be taking revenue. The revenue \nis a little more difficult than that because we have concessionaires in \nthe park, people who run the hotels and the stores and the filling \nstations and the other services in there. They pay a fee for doing that \nand a percentage of what they take in. So we are not getting that \npercentage now either.\n  They are losing about $4.9 million a week by not being able to be \nopen. There are a lot of other things I could say about the way the \nparks are being treated here and around the country, but the ones that \nare revenue-producing are particularly egregious.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 203, H.J. Res. 70, making continuing \nappropriations for National Park Service operations; I ask further that \nthe measure be read three times and passed and the motion to reconsider \nbe considered made and laid on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I appreciate the motion of my colleague, as someone who \ncomes from a State where tourism is the No. 3--and we have 38 million \npeople--it is the No. 3 business in our State. We have national parks. \nBut guess what. You fellows over there, you did not take care of all of \nmy recreation land under the Army Corps. You did not take care of all \nof the BLM land.\n  This whole notion of funding the government piecemeal is absurd. This \nis the greatest Nation on Earth. All you can do is come with these \nlittle, mini, piecemeal bills. Let's face it. We would not be going \nthrough any of this angst, and my friend would not have to have any of \nthat emotion if the Republicans had not shut down the government.\n  I wish to state the rest of my reservation. We certainly support the \nnotion that our parks should open, but we also support the notion that \nthis government should open. If the Senators don't like certain \nfunctions, let's duke it out and find out which ones we have the votes \nto do away with. I know a lot of you don't like the Clean Water Act, \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act. Fine, let's fight that out.\n  I see my colleague from Wyoming is here. He and I are constantly \ndebating the issue of what should be a priority, but we don't do it \nthis way. We need the entire Federal Government open. People need to \nget paid. The communities around the parks, around the\n\n[[Page S7329]]\n\nBLM land, around the Corps recreational lands, around our NASA Ames \nfacility, and I could go on and on--they need to be paid because the \nmom-and-pop shops are suffering. We don't do government by piecemeal, \nnot in the greatest Nation on Earth.\n  This reminds me of a woman who is drowning and someone goes to rescue \nher, but he only takes her halfway to the shore and leaves her to \ndrown. This is what this is about. We don't say: I will save this \nchild, but this one I don't have to save. I will save this community \nbecause I kind of like it, but this community, sorry. No one party has \na right to do it, not the Republican Party, not the Democratic Party. \nWe don't have the right to decide which kids live and which kids die, \nwhich families thrive and which sink, and which communities suffer and \nwhich communities don't. None should suffer, not in this Nation.\n  Open the government, pay our bills, and let's negotiate. Let's \nnegotiate on everything.\n  I have a modification to suggest to the unanimous consent request, if \nI might.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the consent be modified as follows: That \nan amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; that the joint \nresolution, as amended, then be read a third time and passed, and the \nmotions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with \nno intervening action or debate. This amendment is the text that passed \nthe Senate and is a clean continuing resolution for the entire \ngovernment and is something that is already over in the House and \nreportedly has the support of a majority of the Members of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Wyoming so modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. ENZI. Reserving the right to object, the reason we are in this \nmess right now is because we didn't do the budgets piecemeal. We are \nsupposed to do them piecemeal. We are supposed to do 12 separate \nspending bills. We are supposed to do them one at a time. We are \nsupposed to have the right to amend them. This way we can get into the \ndetails of what we are spending, instead of an Omnibus bill, which is \nwhat is being suggested by this amendment.\n  Had we gone through each of those, we could have had all of these \ndiscussions. This is how we should do it, which is our second most \nimportant task. Our most important one, of course, is the defense of \nour country, but the second most important one is the spending bills, \nand we are not doing the spending bills. I know the other side will \nsay: Well, we brought out one, it was filibustered, and we didn't get \ncloture on it. We only did that one time. There should have been every \none of these bills brought up with the right to amend and then they \nwouldn't have been filibustered. Then they could have been passed when \nthe House sent their companion bill. Since we didn't do the process \nright, we are stuck with the continuing resolution.\n  Piecemeal is one way we can get it through. There was a request for a \nconference between the two sides. That was turned down by the \nDemocrats. It would have been a chance to raise all of these things at \nonce. That was turned down.\n  I object to the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object to the original request.\n  I feel I must respond. Senator Murray and I looked at each other and \nsaid: It feels as though it is ``Alice in Wonderland.''\n  Where were my colleagues 21 times when the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee or her representatives asked to go to conference on the \nbudget resolution, in which the conferees would negotiate how to fund \nthe various parts of government, and that instruction would be sent to \nthe appropriators? I do not understand what is happening here.\n  All we hear on the other side is negotiate, negotiate. They won't \nremember--selective memory, perhaps--that they objected 21 times to \ngoing to negotiations on the budget.\n  I have to say, this is the saddest display coming from the \nRepublicans, who serve in the greatest legislative body in the world, \nto try to fund this government on a piecemeal basis, leaving some of \nour families winners and some of our families losers. It is pathetic, \nand they have caused this Republican shutdown. They can end it.\n  Because I feel my friend's narrow, piecemeal approach to running this \ncountry is very wrong for this country, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Does the Senator from Wyoming still have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator from Wyoming yield for a question?\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. My friend from Wyoming mentioned the fact that we should \nbring up appropriations bills. As someone who has been a member of the \nAppropriations Committee for quite a long time, I would remind my \nfriend from Wyoming that earlier this year, on the first appropriations \nbill that we passed out of committee under the leadership of Senator \nMikulski--it was the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development \nbill--if I am not mistaken, it had a number of Republican votes in \ncommittee. It was brought out onto the floor. An extraneous amendment \nwas offered by the Senator from Kentucky, whereupon I believe Senator \nMikulski, our leader, filed cloture on the bill so we could vote on the \nappropriations bill.\n  I say to my friend from Wyoming that all the Republicans on that side \nvoted against cloture, voted against taking up that one appropriations \nbill--I am sorry, I am reminded that we had one Republican, the \nRepublican from the State of Maine who did vote to go to cloture on \nthat bill, one Republican out of all those on the other side.\n  I say to my friend from Wyoming, we tried to bring up the \nappropriations bill. It was Republicans who objected to even dealing \nwith that appropriations bill. I would ask my friend from Wyoming if he \nhad looked at that history and understood what had happened on the bill \nthat came up at the time.\n  I thank my friend from Wyoming for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I have looked at both of the histories that have been \ndiscussed. One of them is the budget. The failure of the budget to not \nhave a conference committee did not stop the Appropriations Committee \nfrom going through and doing 12 appropriations bills. I think that is \nwhat I count on the calendar that could have been brought up. There was \nonly the one brought up.\n  The Senator has said, appropriately, that in committee there ought to \nbe some amendments, but on the floor there were none.\n  What we have spent a lot of time on around the body this year is try \nto negotiate how few amendments would be brought up. That has taken \nlonger than it would have taken to vote on the whole issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article \nfrom the Eagle Tribune.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Eagle Tribune, Oct. 8, 2013]\n\n         `Gestapo' Tactics Meet Senior Citizens at Yellowstone\n\n                            (By John Macone)\n\n       Newburyport.--Pat Vaillancourt went on a trip last week \n     that was intended to showcase some of America's greatest \n     treasures.\n       Instead, the Salisbury resident said she and others on her \n     tour bus witnessed an ugly spectacle that made her \n     embarrassed, angry and heartbroken for her country.\n       Vaillancourt was one of thousands of people who found \n     themselves in a national park as the federal government \n     shutdown went into effect on Oct. 1. For many hours her tour \n     group, which included senior citizen visitors from Japan, \n     Australia, Canada and the United States, were locked in a \n     Yellowstone National Park hotel under armed guard.\n       The tourists were treated harshly by armed park employees, \n     she said, so much so that some of the foreign tourists with \n     limited English skills thought they were under arrest.\n       When finally allowed to leave, the bus was not allowed to \n     halt at all along the 2.5-hour trip out of the park, not even \n     to stop at private bathrooms that were open along the route.\n       ``We've become a country of fear, guns and control,'' said \n     Vaillancourt, who grew up in\n\n[[Page S7330]]\n\n     Lawrence. ``It was like they brought out the armed forces. \n     Nobody was saying, `we're sorry,' it was all like--'' as she \n     clenched her fist and banged it against her forearm.\n       Vaillancourt took part in a nine-day tour of western parks \n     and sites along with about four dozen senior citizen \n     tourists. One of the highlights of the tour was to be \n     Yellowstone, where they arrived just as the shutdown went \n     into effect.\n       Rangers systematically sent visitors out of the park, \n     though some groups that had hotel reservations--such as \n     Vaillancourt's--were allowed to stay for two days. Those two \n     days started out on a sour note, she said.\n       The bus stopped along a road when a large herd of bison \n     passed nearby, and seniors filed out to take photos. Almost \n     immediately, an armed ranger came by and ordered them to get \n     back in, saying they couldn't ``recreate.'' The tour guide, \n     who had paid a $300 fee the day before to bring the group \n     into the park, argued that the seniors weren't \n     ``recreating,'' just taking photos.\n       ``She responded and said, `Sir, you are recreating,' and \n     her tone became very aggressive,'' Vaillancourt said.\n       The seniors quickly filed back onboard and the bus went to \n     the Old Faithful Inn, the park's premier lodge located \n     adjacent to the park's most famous site, Old Faithful geyser. \n     That was as close as they could get to the famous site--\n     barricades were erected around Old Faithful, and the seniors \n     were locked inside the hotel, where armed rangers stayed at \n     the door.\n       ``They looked like Hulk Hogans, armed. They told us you \n     can't go outside,'' she said. ``Some of the Asians who were \n     on the tour said, `Oh my God, are we under arrest?' They felt \n     like they were criminals.''\n       By Oct. 3 the park, which sees an average of 4,500 visitors \n     a day, was nearly empty. The remaining hotel visitors were \n     required to leave.\n       As the bus made its 2.5-hour journey out of Yellowstone, \n     the tour guide made arrangements to stop at a full-service \n     bathroom at an in-park dude ranch he had done business with \n     in the past. Though the bus had its own small bathroom, \n     Vaillancourt said seniors were looking for a more comfortable \n     place to stop. But no stop was made--Vaillancourt said the \n     dude ranch had been warned that its license to operate would \n     be revoked if it allowed the bus to stop. So the bus \n     continued on to Livingston, Mont., a gateway city to the \n     park.\n       The bus trip made headlines in Livingston, where the local \n     newspaper Livingston Enterprise interviewed the tour guide, \n     Gordon Hodgson, who accused the park service of ``Gestapo \n     tactics.''\n       ``The national parks belong to the people,'' he told the \n     Enterprise. ``This isn't right.''\n       Calls to Yellowstone's communications office were not \n     returned, as most of the personnel have been furloughed.\n       Many of the foreign visitors were shocked and dismayed by \n     what had happened and how they were treated, Vaillancourt \n     said.\n       ``A lot of people who were foreign said they wouldn't come \n     back (to America),'' she said.\n       The National Parks' aggressive actions have spawned \n     significant criticism in western states. Governors in park-\n     rich states such as Arizona have been thwarted in their \n     efforts to fund partial reopenings of parks. The Washington \n     Times quoted an unnamed Park Service official who said park \n     law enforcement personnel were instructed to ``make life as \n     difficult for people as we can. It's disgusting.''\n       The experience brought up many feelings in Vaillancourt. \n     What struck her most was a widely circulated story about a \n     group of World War II veterans who were on a trip to \n     Washington, D.C., to see the World War II memorial when the \n     shutdown began. The memorial was barricaded and guards were \n     posted, but the vets pushed their way in.\n       That reminded her of her father, a World War II veteran who \n     spent three years in a Japanese prisoner of war camp.\n       ``My father took a lot of crap from the Japanese,'' she \n     recalled, her eyes welling with tears. ``Every day they made \n     him bow to the Japanese flag. But he stood up to them.\n       ``He always said to stand up for what you believe in, and \n     don't let them push you around,'' she said, adding she was \n     sad to see ``fear, guns and control'' turned on citizens in \n     her own country.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I object, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. For the benefit of those on the other side of the \naisle, I am not going to end my remarks with the issue of a unanimous \nconsent, but I still have things I wish to say.\n  No one supports a government shutdown, not my side of the aisle or \nthe other side of the aisle. Could we have avoided this situation? \nSure. The government could be open and fully operating today but for \nthe majority. There was an unwillingness to engage in a legitimate \ndebate over proposals to amend ObamaCare or any other issues that have \ncome before us, not even having a debate on those pieces that have come \nover from the other body. Hiding behind a motion to table is a way of \navoiding debate.\n  As we know, the House passed and the Senate defeated three different \ncontinuing resolutions. Each one of those would have kept the \ngovernment open and prevented a shutdown, but they were rejected by the \nSenate majority.\n  We are in this position because the majority refused to give the \nAmerican people relief from the individual mandate and treat President \nObama and his political appointees the same as all other Americans or \nas we now in Congress will be treated when it comes to health \ninsurance.\n  We could have considered each of the 12 individual appropriations \nbills and passed them into law. But the Senate Democratic leadership \nhas been derelict in that responsibility.\n  The Senate did not get into debate on a single one of those bills \nprior to the end of the fiscal year. I heard what my colleague from \nIowa said, that one was brought up, then amendments were filed, and \nthere wasn't a motion to move ahead. The point is the Senate is a \ndeliberative body. Every Senator has a right to offer an amendment. We \nwere denied that right by the majority or at least weren't assured of \nthat right by the majority, and that is why cloture was not granted.\n  Of course, what the American people deserve is fair consideration of \nall the money we appropriate. We don't get that consideration on a \ncontinuing resolution, we get it lumped into one piece of legislation. \nWe should, as the Senator from Wyoming said, be considering separate \nappropriations bills.\n  I remember not too long ago that a chairman of an Appropriations \nCommittee on the other side of the aisle, when they were in the \nmajority, was bragging to the Senate that for the first time in a long \ntime the Senate passed every single appropriations bill before the end \nof the fiscal year. If it could be done then, why can't it be done now? \nBut it isn't going to be done if we aren't willing to debate the bills.\n  It seems to me the American people, the taxpayers, deserve a \nthoughtful and good-faith effort to find common ground on our spending \nmatters. It is a duty to pass spending bills.\n  Passing a continuing resolution has become a new normal around here. \nThat is not right. It is not acceptable. While we wait for the Senate \nmajority and the President of the United States to come to the \nnegotiating table and end their government shutdown, we should be \nworking to fund or reopen areas of government where there is agreement.\n  This is what we did when we passed the Pay Our Military Act, where we \nall agreed to pay those both in and out of uniform who defend our \nfreedom. We made a commitment to them because of their commitment to \nour country. The military people deserve that piece of legislation.\n  This is what we should be doing to open our national parks and \nmonuments. That is what we should be doing to ensure the critically \nimportant work of the National Institutes of Health.\n  Why hold these widely supported and critically necessary areas \nhostage? Why is the majority insisting on an all-or-nothing approach? \nWhy can't we agree to fund these things we agree on and negotiate the \nrest?\n  At the very least, a little bit of common sense ought to prevail. It \nwas common sense, for instance, when the minority leader made the point \nabout chaplains. It is common sense that chaplains have an obedience \nnot only to the government but to a higher authority, and they ought to \nbe able to exercise that wherever they are.\n  We have a situation that the parks aren't open. We have a situation \nwhere the World War II Memorial was closed down. Open-air memorials \nhave never been closed down when we had shutdowns in the past. A little \ncommon sense prevailing would avoid a lot of these situations we are \nbringing before the Senate for consideration.\n  Remember, the House of Representatives has passed legislation to keep \nthe government open, and the Senate has refused it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                Unanimous Consent Request--H.J. Res. 85\n\n  Mr. COATS. There is an interesting debate going on without achieving \nany results. Let me take a crack at trying to make a more persuasive \nargument to see if my colleagues across the aisle would agree.\n  We can disagree on what is an essential function of government, what \nis a\n\n[[Page S7331]]\n\nconstitutional function, what we ought to be funding and not funding. \nThat is some of the debate we are in today.\n  I don't think anyone can disagree that an essential function of \ngovernment is providing for our national defense, providing for \nhomeland security, protecting Americans from terrorist threats, and \nresponding to natural disasters. There is an organization in the \ngovernment called the Federal Emergency Management Agency--FEMA is the \ncommon name--which is there to provide support to first responders \nwhenever a natural disaster hits, whenever an intended disaster through \nan act of terrorism threatens this country or threatens Americans. \nThese are functions that have to be immediately responded to, and FEMA \nhas, over the years, improved significantly its ability to play a \ncritical, crucial role in responding to these types of efforts that put \nAmericans at risk.\n\n  What I am bringing forward, because we now know that while some \nfunctions of FEMA are being supported and funded and manned, many of \nthose who would be essential should a disaster hit, whether it is \nnatural or manmade, have been furloughed and are not available to \nassist in that first response. So I am simply asking that we consider \nseriously and gain support for the funding of FEMA to its full extent.\n  We have recently seen natural disasters in the United States. We had \ntornadoes roar through southern Indiana. FEMA was there just last year \nimmediately. We are still in hurricane season, though we have been very \nfortunate this year and have not had a major hurricane land on the \ncontinental United States. Karen was in the gulf, but it dissipated. I \nmight remind my colleagues hurricane season runs to November 30, so we \nare not out of the woods yet.\n  We have just seen a disaster in the Upper Midwest with an \nunprecedented amount of snow falling affecting ranchers, affecting \ncommunities; and some of our Northern States--South Dakota, Nebraska, \nColorado, and others--have seen massive flooding and wildfires \nthroughout the West. All of these are disasters that need to be \nresponded to and FEMA plays a major role in all of that.\n  Who knows what potential terrorist attacks or threats are out there \nwhere we may need to have an immediate response. So what I am asking is \nthat we consider funding FEMA at its current annual funding rate of \n$10.2 billion. This bill will extend funding for FEMA until December \n15, but funding in the bill could end sooner if Congress, hopefully, \nreaches a larger budget agreement before that time. Hurricane season \ndoesn't end until November 30, as I said. We can ensure this critical \ngovernment function is not in any way limited by passing this bill, \nwhich was supported by 23 Democrats in the House of Representatives. So \nit does have bipartisan support.\n  I, therefore, ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 210, H.J. Res. 85, making \ncontinuing appropriations for the Federal Emergency Management Agency; \nand I further ask unanimous consent that the measure be read three \ntimes and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and \nlaid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, I wish to commend my \ncolleague from Indiana for noting the important role the Federal \nGovernment plays when it comes to natural disasters. There is not a \nSenator on this floor who hasn't seen this Federal response in his or \nher own home State because of a natural disaster. The Senator from \nIndiana is proposing we respond to these natural disasters with the \ngovernment agencies that have been authorized, that are appropriated--\nusually appropriated--the funds to do so. He has picked one of them, \nFEMA, and he has picked it because of the possibility of a hurricane. \nThat is a legitimate observation.\n  Unfortunately, the Senator from Indiana is not telling the whole \nstory. FEMA plays an important role. Wouldn't the Senator like to have \nthe National Weather Service fully funded so we could see the hurricane \ncoming in advance? Sadly, it is a casualty of the Republican shutdown. \nWouldn't the Senator like to have the Coast Guard available to have \naerial observation of the oncoming hurricane and to provide that \ninformation to save lives? Sadly, it is not included in the unanimous \nconsent request of the Senator from Indiana, and many of their \nfunctions are the victims of the Republican government shutdown.\n  I am sorry too that when it comes to the actual damage done by a \ndisaster, FEMA plays an important role but not an exclusive role. The \nSenator from Indiana knows this, as I do from Illinois. Listen to the \nother agencies that are a critical part of responding to natural \ndisasters: The Small Business Administration, they are usually the \nfirst on the scene with the Red Cross. Sadly, they are closed down \nbecause of the Republican shutdown of the government, and the Senator \ndoesn't include them in his natural disaster request; DOT--Department \nof Transportation--and the need for emergency highways in the midst of \nhurricanes and tornadoes is not included in the request of the Senator \nfrom Indiana; the Corps of Engineers, the National Guard and Reserve, \nand the Public Health Service, none of these are included.\n  But the good news for the Senator from Indiana is we can take care of \nthis together. I am going to suggest a modest modification to his \nrequest that covers all of the disaster agencies of the Federal \nGovernment that respond and keep us safe and do everything to put \nfamilies back in their homes and businesses back in business. It is \njust a basic idea. Let's reopen the Federal Government.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the request of the Senator from Indiana \nbe modified: that an amendment which is at the desk be agreed to; that \nthe joint resolution, as amended, then be read a third time and passed; \nand the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate.\n  This amendment is the text that passed the Senate. It is a clean, no-\nstrings-attached continuing resolution for the entire government and \nevery disaster agency of the Federal Government. It is something that \nis already in the House of Representatives and has, reportedly, the \nsupport of a majority of the Members of the House of Representatives.\n  I hope the Senator from Indiana will stick with me. Let's get the job \ndone and accept this modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will Senator from Indiana so modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. COATS. Reserving the right to object, I think my colleague, the \nSenator from Illinois, has made an important point. There are agencies \nthat relate to the role FEMA plays when a natural disaster or our \nhomeland security is threatened. I don't disagree with that. Therefore, \nI would be willing to modify my amendment to include the Coast Guard, \nthe National Weather Service, and those agencies listed by the Senator \nfrom Illinois as a part of this. So directing this toward applying to \nnatural disasters and threats to our homeland security, I think we \nshould include those agencies. I think we could go forward with that \nrequest.\n  But I don't think that is what the Senator has offered. He offered a \ntotal CR, which we know is not going to go forward under the current \ncircumstances, even though all of us want to get to that point. But as \nwas discussed earlier by my colleagues, the regular order is usually to \ntake appropriations--pieces of appropriations--and pass them on an \nindividual basis. That simply is what we are doing, given the \nconstraints we have that prevent us from doing that and coming forward.\n\n  I would say this: Three times the House has sent over opportunities \nto take up the full CR that have been rejected by the other side and a \nfourth opportunity to sit down and negotiate how we would go forward, \nwhich has also been rejected. So it works both ways.\n  If the Senator would be able to acknowledge the addition of what was \nlisted directly related in his statement, then we could give that \nconsideration here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request, as \nmodified?\n  Mr. COATS. It is sort of a Ping-Pong game.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Which request, my request?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. As modified by the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me see if I can clarify.\n\n[[Page S7332]]\n\n  Reserving the right to object, I understand the Senator from Indiana \nacknowledges that just appropriating money for FEMA does not respond to \nnatural disasters in America. I have offered a continuing resolution \nwhich includes all of the disaster agencies. I think what he is asking \nme to do is to rewrite his original unanimous consent request.\n  I would just like a yes or no when it comes to my request to modify \nhis original request. I am not certain what he has asked of me for \nfurther modification. So I would ask for clarification either from the \nSenator from Indiana or from the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator from Indiana further modify \nhis request?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am not able to modify the request that \nhas been made, as I understand it, by the Senator from Illinois, \nbecause he goes beyond what he listed as being needed to just address \nnatural disasters and threats to homeland security. He listed a number \nof agencies that play into that role.\n  My understanding--and he can clarify this if I am wrong--is that he \nwanted to expand my request that he consent to adding the limited \nportion of what he mentioned relating to the role of FEMA and our \nnational security issues and homeland security issues that we are faced \nwith, but he added to that the request for funding of the entire \nfunctions of government, and that I cannot consent to.\n  Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, this is why this approach \nis so awful. Coming to the floor with 11 requests for 11 agencies, we \nestimate there are another 79 requests that need to be made for us to \nfund our government.\n  Grow up, Senate. You can't do this one agency at a time. We will be \nhere in December doing agency by agency. What we are offering is a \ncontinuing resolution to fund the government, including all of the \ndisaster agencies.\n  I object to the original request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 3230\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 206, H.R. 3230, \nmaking continuing appropriations during a government shutdown to \nprovide pay and allowances to members of the Reserve components of the \nArmed Forces; I further ask unanimous consent that the measure be read \nthree times and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made \nand laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Reserving the right to object, we are again seeing a \nrequest to fund a small part of our government. This request refers to \nour National Guard and Reserve. These are amazing members of our \nAmerican family who have given and sacrificed with great honor and who \nI find to a one are selfless. Not a one of them would say take care of \nme but do not take care of any of the other Americans who are home \ntoday or whose businesses have been hurt or who don't have the services \nthey need because of this government shutdown. I would think the \nNational Guard and Reserve would stand tall and say: Let's take care of \nevery American. It is what I have sworn my own life to do, and it is \nwhat this Federal Government should do.\n  So instead of just taking a piecemeal approach--again, just asking to \ntake care of the Guard and Reserve--I would say to the Senator that it \nis easy to do this. We can take up a unanimous consent request that has \nbeen offered a number of times on our side to simply open the \ngovernment for all the functions and not those we pick and choose at \nthe moment or by saying one American is more important than another \nAmerican or one function is more important than another function. It \nwould be like picking your children. We don't do that in our families \nand we shouldn't do it in the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an amendment which is at the desk be \nagreed to; that the joint resolution, as amended, then be read a third \ntime and passed; and the motions to reconsider be considered made and \nlaid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  This amendment is the text that passed the Senate--passed the \nSenate--and is a clean continuing resolution for the entire government. \nIt is something that is already over in the House and reportedly has \nthe support of a majority of the Members of the House of \nRepresentatives. I ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from North Dakota so modify \nhis request?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Reserving the right to object, the good Senator is \ntalking about a resolution that has already gone from the Senate to the \nHouse. That has already been done. Why do we keep going back to things \nwe don't have agreement on, rather than advancing on the things where \nwe can get agreement?\n  We have instances where our National Guard is not getting paid. We \nhave instances where our Reserve members are not being paid. We have \ninstances where death benefits are not being paid to members of the \nmilitary who made the ultimate sacrifice.\n  We passed the Pay Our Military Act. It went through the House, and it \nwent through the Senate. We passed the Pay Our Military Act. All of our \nmilitary members and the civilians who support them should be paid. We \npassed legislation to do that, whether it is Active Forces, Guard, or \nReserve. We have done that.\n  What we are simply asking for here is a measure that would make sure \nthat gets done. That is what we are asking for. Let's make sure they \nall get paid. We passed the legislation in both Houses. Let's start \nworking on the things we can agree on. That is why I have asked for \nconsent to proceed with the measure, and I object to the request to \nmodify it.\n  Again, I ask unanimous consent that my original measure, H.R. 3230, \nPay Our Guard and Reserve Act, be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Is there objection to the \noriginal request?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, because this request doesn't resupply the \nstocks for our Guard and Reserve, it doesn't buy the tools or spare \nparts, it doesn't provide the energy and support they need to keep \ntheir facilities open, their electric bills can't be paid, their base \nmaintenance can't be paid, they can't get their GI education benefits \nor mental health programs they need to make the transition home, \nbecause I believe--and I think all of us here believe--we should open \nall of those functions, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Request H.J. Res. 84\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, despite all the noise going on, despite the \nfight we are having, I think one thing we can all agree is the most \nimportant thing for our country is to restore and save the American \ndream.\n  With all this talk of an economic recovery, it would shock people \naround this country who are struggling to find a job or perhaps have a \njob but the job is a dead-end job and it doesn't pay enough that they \ncan't live off of what they are making--there are a lot of reasons that \nis happening, but one of the reasons that is happening is because in \nthe 21st century, the jobs we need in order to make it to the middle \nclass require a higher level of skill and education than they did in \nthe past. This is particularly chronic and is hurting people who are \ngrowing up disadvantaged, especially children growing up in dangerous \nneighborhoods, with little access to education and broken families. \nThey are struggling to get ahead, and we are seeing the impact of the \nsocietal breakdown every day.\n  We have a program called Head Start. This program helps children 5 \nyears of age and younger. There are about 1 million kids a year who \nbenefit from this program. It helps them get meals, it helps them get \naccess to medical screenings, physical therapy for children with \ndisabilities, and access to quality prekindergarten education for these \nchildren. This is not a perfect program. I would like to see reforms. I\n\n[[Page S7333]]\n\nwould like to see this program become portable so that children and \ntheir families can access the best provider possible. But now is not \nthe time for this debate. Now is the time to do everything we can to \nprotect this program in the short term because as we speak there are \nthousands of children around this country already being impacted. In my \nState of Florida, almost 400 children have already been cut off from \nthese services.\n  The reason I think this issue is different from the other ones that \nhave been debated here is because the one thing you can't get back is \ntime. Every day that goes by is one less day of education these \nchildren get. You can never give them back the time. You can always go \nback and pay somebody the money you owe them, but you can't give them \nback time.\n  So I would like to make a request that I hope will be accepted. I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.J. Res. 84, which makes continuing appropriations \nfor the Head Start Program, which was received from the House; I \nfurther ask that the measure be read three times and passed and that \nthe motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nspeak before I object to the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Florida, now wants to \nfund the Head Start Program. That is all well and good. We all \nrecognize how invaluable the Head Start Program is. But I must say that \nlistening to this request and the previous request and the other \nrequests that have come up reminds me of an analogy.\n  The Republicans, quite frankly, have torn down the wall of \ngovernment, and now they want to rebuild it brick by brick, but the way \nthey want to rebuild it is by stacking the bricks. Here is a stack of \nbricks here, here is another stack of bricks, and here is another stack \nof bricks. Anyone will tell you that if you build a wall like that, it \nwill be very weak. It won't hold together.\n  Our government is built from a wall of interconnected bricks. Look at \na brick wall sometime. See how the bricks are interconnected. It \nprovides strength. They all rely upon one another. They are \ninterconnected. They provide a bulwark. If you stack those bricks one \nafter the other, you will have a weak wall.\n  Now what the Republicans are saying is: Well, we have torn down that \nwall by shutting down the government. Now we want to build it brick by \nbrick, but we will just stack them. We will have a brick here and a \nbrick there.\n  This is what I am getting at with that analogy. The Senator from \nFlorida wants to fund the Head Start Program--all well and good--but \nthe Head Start Program is not a separate brick in that wall, it is \ninterconnected to so many others.\n  A variety of other Federal programs are used in the Head Start \nProgram. For example, States use the Child Care and Development Block \nGrant Program. They use the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families--\nTANF--Program. They use the social services block grants to provide \nwraparound services. In this way, for example, they can use some of \nthose funds to extend the Head Start day from half a day to a full day. \nThey can extend it from a full day to later hours for parents who have \ndifferent working hours and working conditions. Under a shutdown, we \ndon't have these other programs. So you might have the Head Start \nProgram, but these other ones are all shut down.\n  Head Start providers use funding from the Child and Adult Care Food \nProgram, which is funded under a whole different auspices of the \ngovernment, but this food program comes in to provide healthy meals and \nnutritious services. I say to the Senator from Florida, I have visited \na lot of Head Start centers, and they have nutritious food for these \nkids. That doesn't come under the Head Start Program, that comes from \nthe Child and Adult Care Food Program. That is also shut down right \nnow.\n  So, again, you could fund the Head Start Program, but all these other \nprograms interlock and provide the support necessary for a good Head \nStart Program.\n  I might also say that the Head Start Program is a need-based program. \nSo if someone wants to get their child into a Head Start Program, \nsometimes documentation is used and needed--documentation such as last \nyear's tax returns. What was your income? Well, as long as the IRS is \nclosed right now--out of 94,000 active IRS employees, 87,000 are \nfurloughed--the IRS is not processing those.\n  The point I make to all and to the Senator from Florida is that it is \nnot enough just to say: I want to reopen the Head Start Program. All of \nthese bricks are interlocked. That is why it is so important to get the \ngovernment running again.\n  If the Senator from Florida wants to cut funding for some of these \nother programs, there is plenty of opportunity to do that through the \nlegislative process and the appropriations process. But just to say we \nare going to fund the Head Start Program, I say, with all due respect, \nthat is a cruel irony to hold out to all of the families who use the \nHead Start Program that somehow, yes, we want to fund Head Start, but \nall the other things that go to support it and make it work, we are \ntaking that away, and like a wall built of stacked bricks, it will fall \nover because it won't have the other supports that are needed.\n  So I respectfully object to the request from the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                Unanimous Consent Request--H.J. Res. 70\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, let's be very clear here today. Republicans \nhave come to the floor to reopen the government. We have offered \nrequest after request to reopen the government. We have offered to \nnegotiate. From the other side, we hear: We will not negotiate, we will \nnot compromise, and we will not reopen the government.\n  We have offered 13 different compromises today to reopen the \ngovernment. We are willing to open the government.\n  They say: You must agree to everything or we will open nothing. We \nwill not compromise.\n  We say to them: Why don't we open the parts of government we agree \non?\n  Can we not end this farce of putting security guards in front of the \nWorld War II Memorial? My goodness, it is an open park. They spent more \nmoney closing it than we spend keeping it open. We spend more money \nguarding the World War II monument than we do protecting our Ambassador \nin Libya. It has become a farce.\n  Eighty-five percent of your government is open. We have offered today \nto open another 10 percent. Compromise means coming together and voting \non some of the things on which you agree.\n  Every program we have wanted to open today--the national parks, NIH, \nVeterans Affairs, allowing funerals, for goodness' sakes, for our \nmilitary heroes who have died in action--they say: We agree to it, but \nwe won't agree to it.\n  So let's be very clear. Republicans have offered today very specific \nproposals for opening the government. The Democrats have uniformly \nrejected every appeal to open the government. So when one of our heroes \ncan't have a funeral, when one of our people cannot be buried in \nArlington Cemetery, when a World War II veteran goes to the monument \nand is barricaded and kept from viewing the monument to celebrate their \nservice, be very clear that Republicans have asked to open the \ngovernment, and the Democrats have rejected opening it at every point. \nIn fact, they are very explicit with their strategy. We will not \nnegotiate, they say. The President says he will not negotiate under \npressure. My question is, When will he negotiate?\n  We have had one good thing happen for the American taxpayer in the \nlast 5 years. The bad thing is $7 trillion has been added to your kids' \nand your grandkids' tab. One good thing happened, and it happened under \nduress, and it happened with regard to the debt ceiling. The sequester \nactually cut the rate of growth of spending. It didn't cut spending, \nbut it is cutting the rate of growth of spending. The sequester\n\n[[Page S7334]]\n\nhappened under duress. The other side loves debt, loves spending, and \ndoesn't care how much your kids or grandkids will have. They don't \ncare. They have rejected every compromise.\n  What we are saying is that $7 trillion of debt under President Obama \nis too much. The country is struggling. Economists say 1 million people \nare out of work because of the economy and because of the debt and \nbecause of the burden. And what do they want to do? Heap more debt on \nyour kids and grandkids. I say enough is enough.\n  Let's reopen the government. Republicans today have said we will open \nthe government. Let's open the parts we can agree to.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to consideration of \nCalendar No. 207 for H.J. Res. 70 to open the national parks, to make \ncontinuing appropriations for the year 2014; that the measure be read \nthree times and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made \nand laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it was my \nunderstanding that the Senator from Kentucky was going to make a \nrequest relative to the Veterans' Administration. The request relative \nto the national parks has been made earlier today. Is the request for \nthe National Park Service?\n  Mr. PAUL. Yes. And I can go on. I want it to be very clear that the \nSenator is objecting to funding the national parks, so when people go \nto the national parks, they know they can call his office. We want to \nopen the national parks, and we want to make it very clear that the \nDemocratic side is objecting to funding the national parks.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to clarify a few points relative to \nstatements made by the junior Senator from Kentucky.\n  The first statement: The Democrats will not negotiate. Well, let me \nremind the Senator from Kentucky--and I am sure he has not forgotten \nthis--the spending level for the continuing resolution is the \nRepublican's spending level which we agreed to in negotiation, $978 \nbillion on an annual basis.\n  Mr. PAUL. It is the law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is the figure Republicans placed as part of the \nnegotiations, which the majority leader agreed to. That was a \nnegotiation which led to that number which Speaker Boehner agreed to.\n  Secondly, this argument by the Senator from Kentucky that the \nRepublicans are here today to open the government--let me at least \nremind the Senator from Kentucky that it is their failure to pass the \ncontinuing resolution by the Republican majority in the House that has \nclosed the government for 9 straight days. We passed the continuing \nresolution to keep the government open at Republican spending levels. \nThe House has refused. This is a Republican shutdown.\n\n  Point No. 3.\n  Mr. PAUL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me finish my statement. I reserved the right to \nobject and I have the floor--I stand corrected. The Senator from \nKentucky has the floor, but I can stand and speak reserving the right \nto object to his unanimous consent request. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The right is at the sufferance of the Senator \nwho has the floor.\n  Mr. PAUL. I will suffer longer.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Kentucky because I went through \na period of suffering a few moments ago.\n  The point I would like to make to the Senator from Kentucky about the \nnational parks is one I hope he will understand. We want to open the \nentire government including the national parks and other lands, \nrecreation facilities that are owned by the Federal Government beyond \nthe national parks. When it comes to the World War II memorial the \nSenator made reference to, I was just there. We had a group of honored \nveterans from World War II who came from Illinois last week and I met \nthem. They had access to the World War II Memorial. The reason there \nwas any restriction was because the Republican shutdown took the \nemployees away, which made it impossible for them to man their post.\n  Here is my offer to the Senator from Kentucky. It is not new, but it \ntells the story. Do the Republicans want to reopen the Government? Here \nis your chance.\n  I ask consent the Senator's request be modified as follows: That the \namendment which is at the desk be agreed to, the joint resolution, as \namended, be read a third time and passed; the motions to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid on the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate. This amendment is the text that has passed the Senate, it is a \nclean continuing, no-strings-attached resolution for the entire \ngovernment including the national parks and many other important \nthings. It is something that is already over in the House. It could be \ncalled in a matter of minutes and passed by a bipartisan majority in \nthe House.\n  Mr. PAUL. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. I am not opposed to a clean CR. If we want to have a clean \nCR at a level at which we can balance the budget, I am all for it. If \nthe Senator would accept a modification of a top-line number of $940 \nbillion to replace $988 billion where appropriate throughout the \ncontinuing resolution, I can support his unanimous consent for a \ncontinuing resolution to go back over to the House.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Does the Senator object to my modification?\n  Mr. PAUL. I am offering a new modification to your modification and \nasking unanimous consent that the Senator accept as a new top-line \nnumber, where 988 appears, that $988 billion appears throughout the \ncontinuing resolution, that if your objective is to have a clean CR, \nlet's have a clean CR. I am happy to do it. But we need to do it and \nrestrain the growth of spending in our government because your party \nhas added so much our country is drowning in a sea of debt.\n  If you will agree to a top-line number of $940 billion to replace \n$988 billion throughout the continuing resolution where appropriate, I \nwould agree to your consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Illinois so modify his \nmodification?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, holding the floor at the \nsufferance of the junior Senator from Kentucky, I would like to ask him \nto respond to a question without yielding the floor.\n  Mr. PAUL. Sure.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator tell us when was the last time our \nFederal Government had a surplus in the budget and who was the \nPresident at that time?\n  Mr. PAUL. Could I ask for a germane question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Not really.\n  Mr. PAUL. Part of the answer is it was divided government. The \ninteresting thing about divided government is divided government can \nwork better, and with more conversation, I think we could get beyond \nthis impasse. I think if we would negotiate--and here is the problem. I \nknow now there are some in your party saying you will negotiate but the \nPresident said at least, oh, 20, maybe 30, maybe 40 times on national \ntelevision he will not negotiate until he gets his way and that is \nstill essentially what you guys are saying. You will negotiate after \nyou get your way. The problem is, we think you will not negotiate \nunless there is a deadline, because the thing is, when you finally did \nnegotiate--and here is my question to the Senator from Illinois through \nthe Presiding Officer--did you vote for the sequester?\n  The sequester was not a Republican bill, it was voted on by many \nMembers of your party. The numbers are yours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Kentucky has \nexpired. Procedurally----\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object to the modification to reduce the top-line \nbudget number. This was a number negotiated between Speaker Boehner and \nthe majority leader. Speaker Boehner said this was a number he could \npass. I believe since we took a $70 billion cut in\n\n[[Page S7335]]\n\nthe budget resolution that has already passed in the Senate, I will not \nagree to further cuts in the programs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection to the request?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original request of \nthe Senator from Kentucky?\n  Mr. PAUL. Is there objection to the original--the modification of my \nmotion? I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I believe what is pending is the original unanimous \nconsent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. DURBIN. For the record, the last time we had a surplus was under \na Democratic President, President William Jefferson Clinton, and I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, what is the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 1 minute of my time to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. While the junior Senator from Kentucky is on the floor, I \nwant to make sure the American people know the answer to the question \nmy friend from Illinois asked him--who was President the last time \nthere was not only a balanced budget but a surplus? The answer is Bill \nClinton. And I was here when we had that vote. So, I think, was the \nSenator from Illinois. We did not get one Republican to join us in that \nbudget that actually worked so well that we had a surplus until the \nRepublicans put a huge tax cut for billionaires on the credit card, and \ntwo wars.\n  Let's be clear here, what this is about. We have to open the \ngovernment, we have to pay our bills, and then let the good Senator \nfrom Washington go negotiate with Congressman Ryan, the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, and yes, we can see our way to a balanced budget. But \nlet's not play these games of government by piecemeal spending.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as we now know, the government has been \nclosed for business for more than a week. Across the country, \nnewspapers are now filled with stories about how the shutdown is \ncosting us jobs and slashing paychecks and interfering with everything \nfrom Head Start to the VA claims. This shutdown has already cost \nAmerican workers and families a lot of pain and its impacts are only \ngoing to get worse. That is why what we heard this weekend from Speaker \nBoehner was so frustrating.\n  Speaker Boehner said:\n\n       The American people expect in Washington when we have a \n     crisis like this, that the leaders will sit down and have a \n     conversation.\n\n  Listening to Speaker Boehner, you would think a government shutdown \nfell out of the sky last week and caught everyone by surprise. The \ntruth is it was completely avoidable. Senate Democrats tried to start \nnegotiations to avoid this shutdown 18 times before October 1, and each \ntime an extreme minority of Republicans stood up and said no. Speaker \nBoehner himself even spoke out in favor of delaying negotiations.\n  This shutdown did not happen by accident. We did not have to have \nthis crisis. This shutdown happened because tea party Republicans and \nthe Republicans who would not stand up to them chose brinkmanship over \nnegotiations for 6 straight months. Now that we have reached this \npoint, Republicans say they are ready to have a conversation--but only \nif we allow the government shutdown to continue.\n  Democrats are more than happy to talk about the budget, but \nRepublican insistence on keeping the government closed during these \nnegotiations makes no sense at all. It suggests that they are not \nthinking about how this shutdown is impacting our families and our \nbusinesses, which cannot afford talk at the expense of action.\n  I would like to talk about some of those impacts today. At a time \nwhen we should be focused on creating jobs and growing our economy, \nthis shutdown is hurting workers and businesses and our recovery. From \nthe sandwich shops that rely on Federal employees who come by for lunch \nevery day to construction companies that cannot get contracts because \nof all the economic uncertainty to major corporations such as Boeing, \nthat are considering furloughs, it is clear the shutdown is putting \nboth public and private sector jobs at risk. Because Federal workers at \nagencies such as the IRS and Social Security Administration are out of \nwork, thousands of potential home buyers will be unable to get their \nmortgages approved, which could damage our housing recovery which has \nboosted our economy.\n  Our Nation's veterans deserve our gratitude and our respect and all \nthe support we can offer. But this shutdown is creating uncertainty for \nthese men and women who have heroically served our country.\n  Veterans make up nearly 30 percent of the Federal workforce--30 \npercent. They are feeling the effects of furloughs. The shutdown has \nworsened the backlog in disability claims at the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, and veterans across the country are now watching and waiting \nfor an end to this shutdown because, if it goes long enough, their \nbenefits could be threatened. Nearly 640,000 veterans in my home State \nof Washington alone are at risk of losing their VA benefits if this \nshutdown extends past October. It should not have to be said, but they \ndeserve much better. So do the struggling families who are now \nwondering how much longer they will be able to put food on their table.\n  This shutdown will stop funding for the Special Supplemental \nNutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, known as WIC, which \nhelps more than 8.9 million struggling moms and young children get \nhealthy food. Many of our States are now scrambling to find money to \nkeep those WIC operations going. The USDA now estimates that we will \nonly be able to continue as usual until the end of October, until their \nfunding runs out.\n  Other struggling parents wonder where they will send their children \nwhile they are at work. More than 7,000 children and their families \nhave lost access to Head Start due to this shutdown. And, by the way, \nthat is on top of the 57,000 slots as a result of the sequestration \nthat has impacted so many.\n  As much as Republicans may not want to acknowledge it, the effects of \nthis shutdown are far-reaching and severe and, should this government \nstay closed, it will only get harder for agencies to continue providing \nservices that are so crucial to our families and communities. So when \nSpeaker Boehner says the American people expect their leaders to sit \ndown and have a conversation--you know what. That is what I have been \nsaying for the last 6 months. But what I will not accept and what I \nstrongly believe the American people will not accept is starting a \nconversation while we are in this shutdown, which is hurting our \neconomy and some of our most vulnerable children and families, and does \neven more damage. Now is not the time to talk about avoiding a \nshutdown, it is the time to actually do it.\n  Speaker Boehner has said there are not votes in the House to pass a \nclean continuing resolution that will simply keep our government open. \nIf that is the case, I would like him to prove it. Speaker Boehner \nshould bring up the Senate's clean continuing resolution and allow \nDemocrats and Republicans to vote on it. Then he should join Democrats \nin preventing a default, without delay and without strings attached \nbecause, I want to be very clear, a default on U.S. debts would be \nunprecedented and devastating.\n  I held a hearing a few weeks ago in our Senate Budget Committee to \ntalk about the impact of brinkmanship and uncertainty on our economy. \nThe economists who joined us warned us that for families in my home \nState of Washington and across the country, default would mean mortgage \nrates and student loan costs would rise, making it harder to afford \nhome ownership or even afford tuition; that home prices and stock \nprices would fall and businesses of all sizes would have trouble \nfinancing their activities, which would of course lead to layoffs and \nsurging unemployment.\n\n[[Page S7336]]\n\n  I am not going to let the tea party cause Washington State families \nthat kind of hardship. But after we have reopened the government, \nprevented this default, and made sure our families and communities are \nno longer paying the price for tea party brinkmanship, I would be more \nthan happy to begin the negotiations that Democrats have been out here \nrequesting to have for months. It is clearer every day that there is \nbipartisan support for those responsible steps. Democrats and \nRepublicans may not agree on much, but I think a lot of us on both \nsides of this aisle have had enough of tea party brinkmanship and seen \nenough of governing by crisis.\n  We are ready, together, to resolve our differences in a way that \nworks for the American people and our economy, and I sincerely hope \nSpeaker Boehner will not let the tea party stand in our way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, the U.S. Treasury says that in exactly 8 \ndays it will not have enough money to pay the government's bills. We \nare not in this position because the Secretary of the Treasury or the \nPresident spent more than they were supposed to. The Constitution \nallows them to spend only what Congress tells them to spend, and that \nis exactly what they have done.\n  We are not in this position because investors refused to buy our \nbonds. Investors are lining up around the block to buy those. We are in \nthis position for one reason and one reason only: Congress told the \ngovernment to spend more money than we have. Congress told the Treasury \nto run up our debt to pay for it, but now Congress is threatening to \nrun out on the bill.\n  If that strikes you as bizarre, you are not alone. The United States \nis the only democracy in the world where the legislature debates \nwhether it should pay the bills it has already incurred. The United \nStates is the only democracy that regularly considers whether to run \nout on its bills; that is, to voluntarily default on its debt.\n  Congress exercises direct control over the amount the Federal \nGovernment spends and the amount the Federal Government brings in \nthrough taxes and fees. Our national debt is simply a function of those \ntwo things--the money coming in and the money going out--and so \nCongress exercises direct control over the amount of debt we have. If \nCongress is unhappy with the size of the debt, it should change how \nmuch it spends or how much it brings in. There is no other option. The \nidea that we can somehow renege on our debts without paying a huge \nprice is a fantasy, a dangerous fantasy.\n  Consider what happened in 2011, the last time the government came up \nto the edge of a voluntary default. Even the possibility that the \ngovernment would not make good on its debts spooked investors and \npushed up interest rates. According to the Bipartisan Policy Center, \nthe interest rate increase from the last time the United States even \ntalked about default will cost the government $19 billion over 10 \nyears. That is $19 billion that could have brought back funding for \nHead Start, Meals On Wheels or our military. That is $19 billion that \ncould have eased the interest rates on student loans or been invested \nin medical research. That is $19 billion that could have been used to \npay down the debt. Instead, that is $19 billion that was just flushed \ndown the drain. Does anyone here care about wasteful government? Well, \nthen, that is it.\n  The last time the government came to the edge of a voluntary default, \nconsumers and businesses got spooked too. The S dropped by more than \n17 percent, $800 billion in retirement assets vanished, mortgage rates \nwent up nearly three-quarters of a point, costing every new homeowner \nreal money. The net result was less consumer spending, fewer business \ninvestments, lower home ownership rates, and slower job growth.\n  That is what happened the last time Congress came to the edge of a \nvoluntary default. What happens if Congress actually defaults? If that \nhappens, there is widespread concern among economists of every \npolitical persuasion that we would plunge into another recession.\n  Government debt may seem to be an abstract and complicated thing, \nbut, in fact, it is pretty simple. The government owes money to two \nmain groups of people. It owes payments on U.S. bonds, which are mostly \nowned by foreign governments, and it owes money to the American people \nfor things such as Social Security payments and Medicare reimbursements \nfor hospitals and physicians. It owes paychecks to the military and \nretirement checks to veterans.\n  If the Treasury does not have enough money to make all of its \npayments, then it will likely try to minimize the damage to America's \ncredit rating, and that means making payments on the bonds held by \nforeign investors, leaving others to absorb the losses.\n  Who will not get paid? Will it be seniors who rely on Social Security \nto live? Will it be hospitals that rely on Medicare to operate? Will it \nbe our servicemembers who rely on paychecks to help their families back \nhome? Will it be Federal contractors, large and small, who support \nmillions of jobs nationwide?\n  The Treasury makes 80 million payments a month and many of them will \nbe delayed. As more time passes, unpaid bills will pile up. From there, \nit just gets worse. The Federal Government's inability to pay its bills \ncould set off a chain reaction of defaults, sending the financial \nsystem into turmoil. Millions of people who rely on Federal payments \nmight not have the money they need to keep current on their student \nloans or their mortgages or their small business loans. That could \ncause interest rates to spike, leading to a wave of further defaults, \nwhile the financial markets would be faced with the very real \npossibility that the United States would not have enough money to make \npayments on its bonds.\n  American Treasury bonds are considered safe investments. They are \nconsidered so safe that they are used as collateral in millions of \nfinancial transactions around the world. If the United States does not \nhave enough money to pay its bills, parties to these transactions will \ndemand more collateral or different forms of collateral. That has a \ndomino effect throughout the economy. The end result could be the kind \nof freeze of the credit markets that we saw after the failure of Lehman \nBrothers collapsed in 2008, the freeze that triggered the financial \ncrisis.\n  The idea that we can renege on our debts and not pay a huge price is \na dangerous fantasy. I have heard some extremists in Congress argue \nthat even if the United States runs out of money to pay all its bills, \nit will not be so bad because the Treasury will be able to keep current \non its bond payments and avoid a technical default.\n  That is a heck of a best case scenario, making bond payments to \nforeign governments, mostly China and Japan, while holding up Social \nSecurity payments, hospital payments, and military payments here at \nhome. It is a terrible idea. People count on those payments to live.\n  It is also a terrible idea that would not work. Just ask top Wall \nStreet executives, including the CEO of Goldman Sachs who said publicly \nand unequivocally that prioritizing bond payments would still create \n``insurmountable uncertainty for investors,'' causing a spike in \ninterest rates that would immediately increase monthly payments on \nstudent loans, mortgages, other personal debt, and would cripple job \ngrowth. Like it or not, the threat of default will cause this country a \nlot of pain.\n  I want to make this absolutely clear: If we run out of money to pay \nour bills, the world will view this as the first default in the history \nof the United States. Wall Street and the global financial markets will \nview this as the first default in the history of the United States.\n  This fight is about financial responsibility. Financially responsible \npeople don't charge thousands of dollars on their credit cards and then \ntear up the bill when it arrives. Financially responsible Nations don't \ndo that either. When we put our name on the line saying that a debt is \nbacked up by the full faith and credit of the United States, we follow \nthrough. We protect our good name. We protect our good credit.\n  For many things that we do in Congress, we can make a mistake and \nthen back up and fix it. A default on our national debt is not one of \nthose things. If we default and pay late, the damage could be \nirreversible.\n\n[[Page S7337]]\n\n  The first time we flirted with default was the first time in history \nthat America's credit rating fell. If we actually default, some \neconomists estimate we will add $75 billion a year to the debt in \nadditional interest payments. That is three-quarters of $1 trillion \nover the next 10 years. There are a lot of good things to do with that \nmoney. Flushing it down the drain is not one of them.\n  If we default on our debt, we could bring on a worldwide recession, a \nrecession that would pummel hard-working middle-class people, people \nwho lost their homes and jobs and retirement savings and who are barely \ngetting back on their feet. Maybe we can escape a recession--maybe--but \nwe are playing with the lives of every American, and it is not what the \nAmerican people sent us to do. This is no time to act out dangerous \nfantasies.\n  We must raise the debt ceiling. We must raise it now. A bedrock \nfinancial principle of government is to tell the world that the United \nStates always pays its debts in full and on time. That is who we are.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in taking the floor \nto stress the urgency of action. I agree with my colleague from \nMassachusetts and her comments about the devastating impact the failure \nto pay our bills would have on our economy, on our Nation's reputation, \nand on the worldwide economy. That would make absolutely no sense at \nall and would put our Nation at great risk.\n  I thank the Senator for taking the time to explain the specific \nconsequences if we were to allow the U.S. Treasury to be put in the \nposition where it could not honor all of the obligations that have \nalready been incurred.\n  This is not about increasing spending. This is about paying the bills \nwe have already incurred. Whether it is for those who hold our bonds, \nthose who are entitled to a payroll check or those who are entitled to \na contractor's check, we have to honor our bills. That is what \nAmerica's great reputation is all about.\n  I thank the Senator for bringing that up.\n  The combination of a government shutdown combined with not paying our \nbills will have an impact on our economy that will be very hard for us \nto overcome. We have already been harmed. This government shutdown has \nalready hurt America. It has hurt us internationally.\n  This past week President Obama was supposed to be at the Asian \neconomic summit. The Presiding Officer--the Senator from Delaware who \nserves on the Foreign Relations Committee--knows very well the \nimportance of that particular conference.\n  The headliner of that conference should have been President Obama \npointing out how important the rebalanced Asia is to America's economy \nand that we are open for business; instead, America was closed for \nbusiness. The headliner at that economic summit was President Xi of \nChina. That is not what this Nation needed. We were harmed by that \ngovernment shutdown and the President's inability to travel to Asia. \nMake no mistake about it, it hurt America.\n  Our economy has already been hurt by the shutdown. Every day that the \ngovernment is shut down, it hurts our economy. I can give a lot of \nspecific examples. For instance, there was a report in this morning's \npaper about the State of Colorado and how it recently experienced one \nof the worst floods in its history which caused a devastating impact on \nits economy. They are now telling us that this shutdown is approaching \nthe economic damage to Colorado that nature did to it a couple of weeks \nago by the floods. However, there is a major difference: We can't stop \nwhat nature does--we can try to mitigate it--but we can stop this \ngovernment shutdown. This is a government problem that we have imposed \non the people of Colorado, the people of Maryland, the people of \nDelaware, and the people of our entire country.\n  This shutdown has hurt the taxpayers of this country. I have heard my \nconservative friends say that we want to make sure we don't spend so \nmuch money. We want to help the taxpayers. In this short period of time \nalready the shutdown has cost the taxpayers of this country a reported \n$2 billion. That is just wasted taxpayer dollars. We have a \nresponsibility to care for the public funds. The way to do that right \nnow is to open government and stop wasting taxpayer dollars.\n  I have been on this floor many times to talk about the harm we are \ndoing to the Federal workforce. Yes, we are harming the Federal \nworkforce; there is no question about it. I am particularly sensitive \nbecause this region has more Federal workers--of the 800,000 who have \nbeen furloughed, over 300,000 come from this region. By the way, 30 \npercent are veterans. The people who have served our Nation are now \nbeing furloughed because of this government shutdown. Maryland's \nworkforce is about 10 percent of Federal workers. So this has had a \nreal impact on the State I have the honor of representing in the \nSenate. Each one of those 800,000 people whom we represent is real. \nThey are not just numbers. These are real people who have been harmed \nby the closing of the Federal Government.\n\n  Let me speak about a couple of people whom I have heard about or who \nhave called me. Kayla is a 15-year-old who I spoke to on the telephone. \nShe told me about how her parents are worried. Both of her parents are \nFederal workers, and she, a 15-year-old, sensed the fear in her parents \nas to whether they will be able to pay their bills. We put that family \nat risk by failing to keep government open.\n  Melissa Ayres is a furloughed Federal worker at the Social Security \nAdministration. Her husband was unemployed for 2\\1/2\\ years as a result \nof our economic downturn. Now his company is recovering, but Melissa \nwas the principal wage earner. She stated:\n\n       I have always been the primary earner until Monday. Now I \n     think: What do I do to support my family?\n\n  The government shutdown has hurt Melissa Ayres and her family.\n  I heard from a farmer on the eastern shore of Maryland's Cecil \nCounty. He is part of the conservation stewardship program. I know the \nPresiding Officer, the Senator from Delaware, is well aware of that. \nBut what this person has done is taken some income away from his \nfarming activities by planting buffer crops. Those buffer crops help \nwith reducing the amount of pollutants that run off into the Chester \nRiver, in this case, which will flow into the Chesapeake Bay. So he is \nbeing a good steward of the environment, and he enrolled in the \nconservation stewardship program. As part of that, he gets a payment \nfrom that fund, because he is giving up some of the income of his \nfarming activities in order to help us preserve the Chesapeake Bay. \nDuring this shutdown, that payment is not being made.\n  He has put himself in a tough position. He did the right thing. He \nhas put his family at risk. He told me he has a young child who is \nundergoing certain treatment for his eye. He doesn't know whether he \nhas the money for his child to continue in that medical treatment. He \nneeds the check for his participation in this program.\n  This government shutdown has had a real impact on real people.\n  Johnny Zuagar who works at the Census Bureau--I should say used to \nwork at the Census Bureau because he has been furloughed. Of the 5,000 \nemployees at the Census Bureau, less than 40 are currently working--\nforty out of 5,000. The budget he has for his family is based upon his \npaycheck. If he doesn't get his full paycheck, he can't pay his bills. \nSo his question is which bills should he pay and which not pay.\n  That is the situation we are putting people in as a result of this \ngovernment shutdown.\n  Marcelo Del Canto was here earlier this week. He works with helping \nin the fight against substance abuse. He has been a Federal worker for \n8 years. He is in the unenviable position that he and his wife both \nwork for the Federal Government, and they have both been furloughed. He \nis a Marylander and just recently bought a home in Maryland. He has a \nmortgage. If he doesn't get a paycheck, how does he pay his mortgage? \nThe mortgage company is not going to say: Oh, government shutdown. You \ndon't have to pay your mortgage payments.\n  This shutdown is having a real impact on real families in my State of \nMaryland and in every State in this Nation.\n\n[[Page S7338]]\n\n  Then there are agencies that just can't do their work that will hurt \nour country. The Environmental Protection Agency currently has 93 \npercent of its workforce on furlough. That means we are at risk with \nour public health--clean air, clean water. Our environment is at risk. \nThe Chesapeake Bay is at greater risk because the people out there \ndoing the monitoring and doing the enforcement are not there. \nScientists are not doing what they need to be doing in order to help us \nwith public health and to deal with our environment.\n  Let me tell my colleagues that it is also directly hurting our \neconomy. In Baltimore, one of the most important economic development \nsites, Harbor Point, in downtown Baltimore, which is being developed is \na RCRA site, which requires the approval of the Environmental \nProtection Agency in order to move forward with the economic \ndevelopment plan. The people who would do that approval process are on \nfurlough. That project is now on hold and the economic development that \nwould help Baltimore and our State economy is now on hold.\n  The shutdown is having a real effect on real people.\n  The National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, which is \nlocated in the State of Maryland, does work that is so important for \ninnovation, for science, and technology. They do work to help us have a \ncompetitive edge internationally. Ninety-one percent of their workforce \nis on furlough. How do we expect to be competitive?\n  This year, the SAMMI Awards were recently given out. The SAMMI Awards \nare given to Federal workers who excel in public service. These are our \nfrontliners. These are the people who are serving their nation, and we \nwant to honor them. I want to recognize some of the people who were \nbeing honored at the SAMMI Awards this year. One is Daniel \nMadrzykowski. He works at NIST. I mention him because he has been there \nfor 28 years. The work he does is to figure out how he can keep our \nfirst responders who fight fires safe. He does the research as to how \nthey can go into a building in a safer way. Well, he is furloughed, and \nour first responders are at a little bit greater risk today as a result \nof the government shutdown.\n  The shutdown is having an effect on real people.\n  I read with interest how we celebrated the Nobel Prize in medicine \ngoing to James Rothman and Randy Schekman for the incredible work they \ndid. I don't know if I can explain what they did, but I will tell my \ncolleagues that it is incredible. They were able to reach that pinnacle \nin their careers and reach their accomplishments because during their \ncareer they were supported by the National Institutes of Health. NIH \ndoes basic research which is so important--the building blocks for \ndiscovery in America. It provides incentives for young people to go \ninto science and to go into research.\n  Will we have the next group of Nobel laureates? Today it is less \ncertain than it was a week ago. NIH cannot support those types of \nresearch grants today. Their people are on furlough. America is not \nopen for business. Real people are being hurt by what is happening.\n  It is not just in government employment. I can talk about private \nsector employment.\n  It was just reported today that Lockheed will be laying off 400 \nMaryland workers as a result of the shutdown. I can give many more \nexamples of private companies that are laying off people as a result of \nthis shutdown.\n  The bottom line is this: We hear from some of our Republican \ncolleagues in the House that we have to negotiate, we have to pick \nwinners and losers; we have to wait for a crisis to occur in a \nparticular agency before they will consider a special bill to open some \nof those agencies. So let me just conclude by the quote I cited once \nbefore on the floor of the Senate from the Baltimore Sunpapers. It \nsays, in regards to negotiations and what we should do:\n\n       The gun isn't raised to Mr. Obama's head or to the \n     Senate's. The Democrats have no particular stake in passing a \n     continuing resolution or in raising the debt ceiling other \n     than keeping public order and doing what any reasonable \n     person expects Congress to do. No, the gun is raised at the \n     nation as a whole. That's why descriptions like ``ransom'' \n     and ``hostage'' are not mere hyperbole, they are as close as \n     the English language gets to accurately describing the GOP \n     strategy.\n\n  It is time for Speaker Boehner to put down the gun. It is time for us \nto open government and to make sure we pay our bills, and then, yes, we \nwant to negotiate. For 6 months, we have been trying to negotiate a \nbudget. Open government, pay our bills, and then let's negotiate a \nresponsible budget for this Nation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the twin \nmanufactured crises that are facing the country: A hobbled government \nand the threat of default.\n  I have seen some describe this as a game, and I have heard others say \nit is just partisanship posturing. But this situation is neither. This \nis serious business. In fact, I am deeply troubled about this--not only \nas a Senator representing the State of Rhode Island, but as an \nAmerican--about where my country is going.\n  I am dismayed that some on the other side have decided that for \nwhatever reason--and those reasons seem to keep changing--the only way \nto achieve their goal--and their goals seem to keep changing--is to \nshut the government down and suggest that defaulting on our debt will \nhave no consequences.\n  It would be a nice fiction if we could say: Well, America really \ndidn't have to pay its bills. That we don't have to pay for the \ntrillions we spent in Iraq and in Afghanistan, or for the significant \ntax cuts under President Bush that benefited the wealthiest Americans. \nI didn't support the operations in Iraq, and I didn't support those tax \ncuts. I think we could have invested the money much more wisely and \nhelped America.\n  But the reality is all these bills are coming due, and the United \nStates Treasury has to pay them.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side are suggesting: Well, we can \nprioritize payments. No one will be upset. No one will be hurt if we \ndon't pay the bills as they come due. We will just pick the ones we \nwant to pay.\n  But these are not Democratic bills. They are not Republican bills. \nThese are America's bills. They were approved by the Congress of the \nUnited States under Republican Presidents and Democrat Presidents, \nunder Republican Congresses and Democrat Congresses. And as they come \ndue, they must be paid.\n  But we are here today in this manufactured crisis that essentially \nlocks out and blocks the American people from accessing their \ngovernment--from accessing basic government services. Women and \nchildren receiving food under the WIC program, Head Start--a whole \npanoply of Americans who are literally being denied benefits they \nearned, or benefits that are necessary not just for their health, but \nfor the health and vitality of the fabric of America. Then, on top of \nthat, is the added threat of a default on our obligations--already \naccrued, already authorized, already appropriated obligations--not new \nborrowing for new expenditures. These bills are coming due.\n  We have seen this ever-changing theme from the other side about why \nthey have to do these things. At first it was an effort to repeal \nObamaCare. Then it was a 1-year delay of health insurance under the \nAffordable Care Act. Then it was just a delay of part of the law. Then \nit was repealing a tax that was part of the law. Now, we have heard \nabout Canadian oil pipelines, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, \nand cutting Medicaid. The rationale keeps changing and suggesting that \nthe reasons behind this lockout are not only unclear to the American \npublic, they are unclear to the proponents. In fact, some are \nsuggesting that this is also about cutting Social Security and Medicare \nand other programs that are central to every family in this country. \nIndeed, it seems as though they have transitioned from ``let's take \nObamaCare and repeal it'' to ``let's take the New Deal and repeal \nthat.'' In fact, one of our colleagues in the House apparently \nsuggested he didn't know what he wanted; he just knew he wanted \nsomething in exchange for an open government that is functioning and a \ngovernment that pays its bills.\n  It is hard not to draw the conclusion that many of my colleagues on \nthe other side have simply committed themselves to extracting major \npolicy\n\n[[Page S7339]]\n\nconcessions, whatever they can get, by threatening to default on our \ndebt and by continuing to lock out the American people from its \ngovernment. They are sadly using potential economic chaos to get their \nway.\n  Now I don't think Republicans are debating seriously--and we have \nheard this argument from them for years going back--for decades, in \nfact--to the initial debate on Medicare, that it is evil socialized \nmedicine. Now I am sure during the discussion of the New Deal, there \nwere criticisms of growing central government, but to seriously take \naway these programs I think would cause the American people to stand up \nand say no, since most if not every American fundamentally depends on \nthem. Particularly as they get to the point where they are retired or \nthey are approaching retirement.\n\n  So now the Republican story has shifted, as they have gotten closer \nand closer to what seems to be some of their real motivating factors: \nshrinking government dramatically, not just those parts that are \npopular. Now they are beginning to hint that this is about something \nmore fundamental. This is about tearing up the basic social contract \nwhere people have worked all their lives, paid into Social Security, \nand will get Social Security benefits. For them, this is about tearing \nup the social contract that if you have worked, you have paid into the \nMedicare system, you will get Medicare benefits.\n  Of course now they have shifted their current story again, and now it \nis all about negotiation, that we have not negotiated. That is why they \nhave to shut down the government and default on the debt of the United \nStates. The irony, of course, is that Democrats have been, indeed, \ntrying to go into serious and bipartisan negotiations about our budget \nfor many months. Indeed, months ago, in March, as I recall, the Senate, \nafter taking 47 rollcall votes, passed a solid, balanced, and sensible \nbudget plan and asked to negotiate with the other body in a conference. \nIndeed, at the beginning of the year, the Speaker called for following \nthe budget process, for following regular order.\n  At one point, the other side even demanded that Senators and \nCongresswomen and men should not be paid if there was no budget \nresolution. But, sadly, months later, after we had passed our budget, a \nhandful of colleagues in this body, on the Republican side, have been \nblocking us from going to conference. They are insisting that as any \nprecondition to a bipartisan conference we could not talk about raising \nrevenue, or take actions that will ensure the government be able to pay \nits bills. They have essentially stopped regular order.\n  For his part, the Speaker of the House refused to appoint conferees \nfor months, as well, apparently fearful that Republicans might have to \nactually vote on some of their proposals that have been incorporated \nover the years in various Republican budgets with respect to Medicare, \nMedicaid, and other programs.\n  But now as we approach default, my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle are saying: Oh, it is time to negotiate on the budget.\n  It was time months ago when we asked to go to conference. It was time \nweeks ago. Now it is time to ensure that we pay our bills and we open \nthe government.\n  We have come to the Senate floor 21 times so far to seek to go to \nconference to negotiate with the House on the budget. What do we hear? \nWhen we ask to go to negotiate, no. But, when we ask them to open the \ngovernment, to pay our bills, they say no let's negotiate. That is not \nthe way to conduct the business of this government. It is not the way \nto provide the confidence our economy needs to go forward. It is not \nthe way to provide families the confidence they need to face the rigors \nof daily life--of educating children, of taking care of their health \ncare, of contributing to their community.\n  We have had consistent and constant objections, which frustrate our \nability to go to conference and negotiate, over many, many, many \nmonths. But after all their other rationales--defund ObamaCare, delay \nObamaCare, delay the personal mandate--now it has come down to let's \nnegotiate, when indeed, Republicans have rejected that approach 21 \ntimes on the floor of the Senate.\n  It is time for the other Chamber to reopen the government and agree \nto pay our bills. They can do that by bringing to the floor very \nquickly--and they can procedurally: a clean CR--a term of art that was \nWashington speak until a week or two ago, but now everyone knows. It \nsimply sets for a few weeks the amount of money we can spend and allows \nus to open the government.\n  Americans are being hurt by the shutdown, and they will be hurt even \nmore grievously if we default on our debt. It is continually amazing to \nme that the other side persists in shutting down the government and \nthreatening to default on the debt.\n  But, you have a response by the other side, particularly, that is \nconsistent with what we heard during their primary campaign for the \nPresidency: Let's shut down some government agencies. Now it is the \nother side of that coin: Republicans will just open a few government \nagencies, not the whole government, but the ones--and they change or \nthey increase each day--that they think are important. Each day they \nseem to have another idea about: Well, we have to open this. It will be \na good headline. It will be a good talking point.\n  For example, they have talked about opening the national parks, the \nSmithsonian, and other museums. But, let's remember that in the House, \nRepublicans have proposed cutting the allocation for the Department of \nInterior Appropriations Bill by $5.5 billion from last year.\n  So we have to go forward and we have to resolve this situation. We \ncannot allow this lockout to continue. We have to do what Leader Reid \nhas said quite succinctly: open the government, pay our bills, go to \nconference on the budget, and then negotiate everything that is within \nreason to negotiate. Let's do that for the American people. We are \nready to do it. I hope our colleagues will agree to do it also.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I would like to start by reading a letter I \nreceived this week. So many of us in the Senate are operating with \nfurloughed staff, and we are doing our best to read and respond to the \nletters we are getting from home, the calls that are coming into our \noffices. This one touched me in particular. It began:\n\n       My name is MSgt Corey P DiLuzio. I am an Air Reserve \n     Technician at Dover AFB. I have served this great nation for \n     12 years without question or reservation. Every time I have \n     been called upon, I have answered the call, left my family \n     behind, and served proudly as maintainer for the C-17 \n     aircraft. I know you understand the reach and the mission \n     requirements for such an aircraft. I tell you this not for a \n     thank you or any type of acknowledgement. I tell you this--\n\n  Master Sergeant DiLuzio writes--\n\n     because I am also a husband to a woman who has stood by my \n     side in support for every deployment. I tell you this because \n     I am the father of a three-year-old boy who doesn't even \n     question the answer Daddy's at work. I understand a man in \n     your position has made . . . sacrifices as well, however, \n     today I had to tell my family I am unable to work. Not \n     because of anything I have control of, but because of \n     decisions made by individuals who will not miss a paycheck; \n     individuals who will always know when the next check is \n     coming. I write this understanding that it will fall on deaf \n     ears, and I am usually one that remains quiet and follows the \n     orders for those appointed above me, however, enough is \n     enough. Please do your part in resolving this issue so I can \n     get back to serving my country and my family.\n       Sincerely yours, MSgt Corey DiLuzio.\n\n  It pains me that the master sergeant thought his letter would fall on \ndeaf ears, that no one here--that neither I nor any of my colleagues--\nwould hear or care about the concerns of a man--his wife, his family--\nwho has served this country and who stands ready to continue serving \nthis country but whose family is being harmed by the mindless, \npurposeless shutdown of the government that is now in day 9--this first \ngovernment shutdown in 17 years, and by all indications one that will \ncontinue into another week.\n  I start by saying to Master Sergeant DiLuzio: I am sorry. I am sorry \nfor the needless pain and difficulty this shutdown is imposing on your \nfamily and so many other families across this country. Roughly 800,000 \nFederal employees have been furloughed at different times in the last 9 \ndays, and while some may be returning to Active service, they\n\n[[Page S7340]]\n\nwill be getting IOUs rather than regular paychecks. All over this \ncountry, private contractors, as we have heard from other colleagues \ntoday, are also laying off people because they cannot get the permits \nor work permission or the site access they need to move forward.\n  This shutdown is continuing to harm our country, our reputation, our \neconomy, our families. It is a needless, manufactured, self-imposed \nwound.\n  I wrestle with this because we are facing twin manufactured crises, \nas Senator Reed of Rhode Island just finished saying: hobbled \ngovernment due to this shutdown on the one hand and the steadily \nincreasing risk of default on the other--these twin manufactured crises \nseeking some purpose that is unclear from day-to-day. When this \ngovernment shutdown started, it seemed to be aimed at what, repealing \nthe Affordable Care Act, so-called ObamaCare, and then 1 day later it \nseemed to be aimed at delaying the Affordable Care Act, and then when \nthat clearly was unsuccessful, it seemed to be aimed at seeking some \npartial repeal of the Affordable Care Act and now it is an ongoing \ncrisis in search of a purpose. The menu of potential demands is \ngrowing, and the impact on our families and our communities is growing \nas well.\n  The House has been wasting its time on mini microappropriations bills \nin an attempt to give reporters and folks back home the sense that they \nare actually doing something, when it is just misdirection. They think \nall the activity will keep the American people from noticing that \nSpeaker Boehner is not bringing up the one bill that could reopen this \ngovernment in a matter of minutes--a so-called clean continuing \nresolution, a simple extension of current spending levels.\n  I know to all who watch--Master Sergeant DiLuzio and many others--we \nsometimes speak in language that is opaque, that is difficult to \nunderstand. We talk about sequester and continuing resolutions and so \nforth. So I am going to try and work through these issues in a way that \nis accessible and direct.\n  Let's be clear. This government is shut down right now because the \nHouse would not pass a 6-week extension--an extension to November 15--\nof what is required to keep us open. Today that would be just over 4 \nweeks. We are literally fighting over a 4-week funding bill. How absurd \nis it that all of this is over a measure that would have only funded \nthe government in the first case for another 4 weeks from now. There \nis, frankly, nothing about this situation that is not absurd.\n  Every day the House Republicans show up with a new strategy, a new \npress conference, a new message, and, as I said, all the while not \nexplaining exactly why the government is shut down. Initially, it was \nshut down to prevent the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, but \nthat is moving forward, as it was always going to be because it is an \nenacted program.\n  So what is the current message from the House? They say they are the \nonly ones ready to negotiate, that they are alone at the table, sitting \nthere with jackets off, in their bright, starched, white shirts, \nwaiting for Senate Democrats to meet them at the table and negotiate. \nAnother farce, another fantasy.\n  I am, frankly, tired and frustrated with the games that seem to be \nplayed here. I would like to highlight, if I could, a few of our real \nefforts to work collaboratively, to answer the question, why won't you \nnegotiate, by saying we have been negotiating.\n  Once the House votes to keep the lights on and to pay our bills, we \nwill continue to negotiate. I have a simple question. Does the House \nwant us to continue to be a closed-door nation, a nation where we have \nlocked out hundreds of thousands of Federal workers? Does the House \nwant to threaten that we will become a deadbeat nation, a nation that \nfails to meet its obligations built up over many administrations and \nmany Congresses, Republican and Democratic, or are we going to reopen \nthe government, become an open-door nation, and are we going to pay our \nbills and become a responsible nation, as we have been in the past?\n  How did we get here? As a member of the Budget Committee, let me \nfirst start, if I could, with the budget resolution. That is how our \nrules work. We are supposed to begin with a budget resolution that sets \na framework for what we are going to spend in the next fiscal year.\n  For the last 3 years I have been serving here as a Senator, over and \nover on this floor the call was: Why won't the Senate pass a budget? \nWell, this year this Senate passed a budget resolution with significant \nRepublican input. Between this floor, where we ultimately passed it, \nand the committee on which I serve, the Senate adopted more than 40 \namendments offered by my Republican colleagues.\n  We compromised. We worked toward a shared goal. Week after week, as I \nsaid, Republicans had asked in past years: When is the Senate going to \npass a budget? Yet we did, more than 6 months ago--200 days ago, to be \nprecise, we passed a budget in this Senate.\n  Our chair, Senator Murray of Washington, has tried to take our budget \nto conference with the House to do as the rules provide, to reconcile \nand to responsibly negotiate over our fiscal differences--18 times. She \nhas tried over and over and over to take us to conference and \nresponsibly open formal talks with the House to resolve our fiscal \ndifferences. Every time that motion has been blocked, denied, barred, \nall by a very small group of tea party Republicans in this Chamber who \nhave refused to let us go ahead and negotiate as the rules say we \nshould.\n  I also serve on the Appropriations Committee. Once the budget is \nframed, once the budget is resolved, we are then supposed to move to \nappropriations and set our spending levels. As a member of that \ncommittee, I have been a part of the process in which we have, in fact, \npassed 11 spending bills out of committee, 8 of them with bipartisan \nsupport.\n  In order to try to move that process forward, months after the budget \nwas passed, we brought the Transportation, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment bill to this floor. It passed out of committee by a vote of \n22 to 8, with 6 Republican votes, a strong bipartisan bill to be passed \nout here on the floor.\n  What happened? It was blocked. Again, a small number of the other \nparty came and objected and blocked the passage of that bill, a bill \nthat would put Americans to work and strengthen our infrastructure and \nhelp support the housing recovery, a bill that would have moved us \nforward.\n  Despite every attempt to fund this government through what we call \nregular order, the budget process and the appropriations process, we, \neven after that, came to the table, ready to compromise on this \ncontinuing resolution.\n  The Senate budget calls for a top-line spending number of $1.058 \ntrillion, a balanced approach that reduces Federal spending in some \nareas, raises revenue in others, and makes progress by replacing the \nsequester. That is the budget we passed in the Senate. It would call \nfor spending $1.058 trillion. The House budget instead called for $988 \nbillion. As you have heard our leader Senator Harry Reid say on the \nfloor this week, he compromised. He agreed to a short-term funding bill \nat $988 billion, a $70 billion cut for this fiscal year, a major and \npainful concession for Democrats, particularly those of us on the \nBudget Committee who had not voted for a $988 billion number.\n  We have already slashed spending. People are already suffering \nthrough the sequester, another thing that was enacted due to comparable \ntactics the last time there was a near default in 2011. The sequester \nhas resulted in across-the-board spending cuts. It has been dangerous \nand painful and which I have spoken about on this floor repeatedly, \nreading letters from Delawareans, such as the master sergeant, \ncommenting on how it is not the smart way to make cuts, it is an \nacross-the-board way, an irresponsible way to make cuts.\n  That same Air Force base, Dover Air Force Base, suffered furloughs \nfor hundreds of airmen and their families because of the sequester \ncuts. We had worked out a budget that would have replaced it and would \nhave avoided those sequester cuts in a balanced and responsible way. \nBut instead, in order to compromise, our majority leader agreed to a \n$70 billion cut for this fiscal year. It was tough for a lot of \nDemocrats to swallow. So, frankly, when I see House Republican leaders \ngo on TV and say Democrats will not negotiate, Democrats will not \ncompromise, I have\n\n[[Page S7341]]\n\nto say: That is not the case. That is not the facts I have before me. \nWe have compromised. We have negotiated. In fact, we have tried for \nmonths on this floor, more than 6 months, to get the compromise, to get \nthe negotiation to move this forward. Instead, we find when we give an \ninch, they take a yard.\n  Today there are some, some in the other party, suggesting that if \nthey are not granted a great big wish list, they will force us to \ndefault on our country's sovereign debt. We keep hearing from the other \nside about the need to compromise and negotiate. I could not agree \nmore. The whole way this body is supposed to work is by following the \nrules, following the process, going to conference, negotiating and \nachieving a responsible result.\n  We have repeatedly solicited Republican input, accepted Republican \namendments, and made painful compromises. Now my message is simple: We \nshould be following the rules. We should be following the process of \nthis body. We should turn on the lights. We should pay our bills. I \nwould be happy, honored to continue working with Republican colleagues \nto find real solutions to our fiscal problems, the way we are supposed \nto, in a conference negotiating over the budget that was passed here \nmore than 6 months ago.\n  To the colleagues with whom I share this Chamber but with whom we \nhave some differences over why this government is shut down today, I \nhope you will listen to Master Sergeant DiLuzio and his family and to \nthe thousands and thousands of other Americans who are writing in and \ncalling our offices. They deserve better. This country deserves better. \nWe need to show we can be the model of democracy that achieves \nresponsible principled compromise.\n  To my colleagues and my friends in the other party: Stop blocking \nprogress. Let's go to conference on the budget. Let's negotiate. But, \nfirst, let's get our folks back to work. Let's get the government open. \nLet's move forward in a way that honors the best of our traditions and \nour rules.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to add my remarks now for the third \ntime about this shutdown. I want to say this is not the way we ought to \nbe running our government, and enough ought to be enough.\n  For example, as you know, the Secretary of Defense has figured out a \nway he can bring back most of the furloughed civilian employees--there \nmay be a quarter of them who are still on furlough but most of them--by \na law that passed here that saw most unintended consequences. But there \nwas a little part of the law where he was able to bring them back for \nthe national security and defense of this country.\n  But there are still gaping holes. For example, although the active-\nduty National Guard is not furloughed, a lot of the civilian force and \nthe Reserve force of the Guard is furloughed.\n  I just talked to an F-22 pilot of the Virginia National Guard. He is \na long-time fighter pilot in the U.S. Air Force, flew F-15s, now F-22s. \nHe has transitioned to the National Guard, went to a unit that has the \nF-22s, which is the Virginia National Guard. All of those Reserve \nNational Guard pilots are still coming in and flying, because we still \nhave to protect the air defense of this country. They are flying, but \nthey are not getting paid. Some of their technicians are there, still \nsupporting the maintenance of the aircraft. Some of them are not \ngetting paid. All of the ancillary support staff is on furlough.\n  In this example of the protection of the national security, in this \nparticular case providing for our air defense through an Air National \nGuard unit, is this the way an air guard unit ought to be run?\n  Instead, it is not being run according to how it should be because of \na political tantrum by certain people trying to get their way, instead \nof allowing the government to be functioning through its \nappropriations.\n  There is now a salmonella outbreak, 278 cases in 18 States, including \nmy State of Florida. The Centers for Disease Control, which monitors at \none time 30 different diseases operating in this country--now 68 \npercent of the Centers for Disease Control employees have been \nfurloughed. So because of the salmonella outbreak that has occurred--it \nmay be in the Presiding Officer's State as well. I will look it up \nafterwards and tell the Presiding Officer. It is in my State. I know it \nstarted in California, where most of the cases are.\n  But had the CDC been there in full force, instead of 68 percent of \nthem being laid off, maybe we would not have had this outbreak, or they \nmay have been able to spot it and stem it quickly before it spread to \n17 other States.\n  I will give you another example: NASA. This little agency is the one \nthat has the most people furloughed as a percentage of the workforce. \nNow 97 percent of NASA employees are furloughed. Since most of NASA's \nwork is done by contractors, without the NASA supervisors there now, \nthe contractors are being laid off. You take a place such as the \nPresiding Officer's State of Ohio, the NASA Glenn Research Center, look \nat the impact to the people in that community.\n  You take a major space center elsewhere, such as the Johnson Space \nCenter in Houston, the Kennedy Space Center in my State, look at what \nit is doing to the lives of people. But remember that we have a mission \nthat is going to Mars that has a unique, one-time-in-2-years launch \nwindow, starting the middle of November into the first part of \nDecember. If that narrow 3-week launch window is missed because of the \nlack of preparation of this spacecraft to launch, there is not another \nlaunch window for 2 years. Because of that, we were able to get NASA to \nrecall that team. They are there continuing to prepare the spacecraft. \nThey are not getting paid. But at least we are not going to cause all \nof the additional delay of 2 years and all of the additional expense of \nkeeping that team of scientists together, along with the staging of the \nspacecraft for another 2 years.\n  There are three examples: the National Guard, and the defense of this \ncountry; the salmonella outbreak, because of the layoffs of the CDC, \nthe Centers for Disease Control; and NASA.\n  This should not be. Enough is enough. The political tantrum ought to \nstop. Let us get back to the business of governing.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                         SOUTH DAKOTA BLIZZARD\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the \ndevastation that has been inflicted on many in my home State. An early \nseason snowstorm has dumped 1 foot of snow and heavy winds on much of \nwestern South Dakota. The thoughts and prayers of Barbara and I are \nwith those affected by this disastrous storm.\n  Communities and residents are wrestling with the damage caused by \ndowned trees, and utility companies are facing power outages. County, \ncommunity, and emergency officials have shared with my office numerous \nstories of volunteers stepping in to help to transport medicines and \noxygen to residents stranded in their homes.\n  Neighbors are helping assist each other with cutting down tree limbs, \nsnow removal, and getting essential food items and medical supplies to \nthe elderly and disabled residents. There are countless reports of \npeople helping to move stuck drivers out of snowdrifts or helping to \nshovel the roofs and snow from the home of a senior citizen or disabled \nresidents. When people are in need, South Dakotans step up.\n\n[[Page S7342]]\n\n  One of the most significant impacts of the storm has been on my \nState's livestock producers. ``Tens of thousands of cattle killed in \nFriday's blizzard . . . '' proclaims the Rapid City Journal headline.\n  Silvia Christen, with the South Dakota Stockgrowers Association, has \nshared with me gut-wrenching stories of ranchers who have lost their \nherds. She said a man near Interior found his cows had pushed \nthemselves and their calves over a Badlands wall and killed many of \nthem. He estimates his loss at 50 percent of his total herd.\n  A young man east of Hermosa estimates he lost 30 percent of his 200 \nbreeding cows. He found them all in one pile in a draw covered in snow. \nHe saw the heads and hooves sticking out from the snow and can't bring \nhimself to go closer or dig them out. He stated:\n\n       I'm young, but I always thought I was a good rancher. I \n     thought I'd taken care of them but I guess I should have done \n     more.\n\n  He hung up the phone with an apology as his voice broke.\n  Our cowboys are resilient people, but this blizzard comes on the \nheels of a devastating drought last year from which ranchers still \nhaven't fully recovered.\n  I am very proud of our State and local officials who have taken \nimmediate action to assist those in need. The National Guard is \nconducting lifesaving safety operations to ensure folks without power \nare OK and to open roads. The State is working with a local rendering \ncompany to assist with finding, identifying, and dealing with livestock \nthat have been killed. Our ag organizations in the State are providing \nhelp and guidance to ranchers who were hit.\n  The one place where help is lacking is from the Federal Government. \nBecause of the government shutdown, producers can't rely on their FSA \noffices for assistance.\n  Since Congress hasn't finished the farm bill, West River ranchers may \nhave to wait for disaster assistance. The 2008 farm bill included \nseveral critical disaster assistance programs, including the Livestock \nIndemnity Program, which provides help to producers affected by natural \ndisasters. Unfortunately, that program expired in 2011, and because \nCongress hasn't yet completed a comprehensive farm bill, there \ncontinues to be no funding available for them.\n  We passed a good farm bill here in the Senate twice in the past 2 \nyears. I worked to include funding for these livestock disaster \nprograms, which are in both the Senate and House bills. The Senate is \nready to negotiate the farm bill, but the House hasn't appointed \nconferees. The longer they delay, the longer my constituents will \nsuffer without disaster aid.\n  The House needs to pass a clean continuing resolution, and they need \nto appoint conferees so that we can finally finish the farm bill.\n  It will take many months for the Black Hills communities to clean up \nfrom the October blizzard. For ranchers who lost livestock, it may take \nyears to recover. But whatever Mother Nature has to deliver, it cannot \ndampen the spirit of South Dakotans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/09/senate-section/article/S7342-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7342-S7352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise today to give voice to frustrated \nNebraskans. I rise to testify to the simple truth that a government \nshould not intentionally make life harder for its people. I rise to \nsay: Enough. Enough press conferences. Enough brinkmanship. Enough \ndividing people of good will against one another.\n  I am still pretty new here, but I can say that in Nebraska and in so \nmany other States across this Nation we actually work together--and not \njust on small bills but also on the big issues. I urge my colleagues to \nremember where we came from.\n  While I served in the Nebraska Legislature, we dealt with a major \nbudget shortfall. We didn't go on TV or Twitter or fight; we legislated \nand we fixed the problem. That is the Nebraska way. We roll up our \nsleeves, we cut through the talking points, and we get to work.\n  Nebraskans are pragmatic. They are well informed, and they expect \nresults. So when Nebraskans look at the dysfunction we have here in \nWashington, they are frustrated, and I am too. I am very frustrated. I \nam frustrated that this Congress can't pass appropriations bills that \ncomply with the law. I am frustrated that this Congress cannot agree on \na budget. I am frustrated with crisis management instead of responsible \ngovernance. I am frustrated with being told one thing only to learn it \nis just not true. I am frustrated with the willful ignorance that goes \non in Washington when it comes to our debt. And I am frustrated with \nthe lack of solutions.\n  The American people do not want us to just stand in opposition; they \nwant us to put forth constructive ideas to solve problems. As a result \nof Congress's failure to agree on a spending plan, the government is \nshut down. The result? Well, in yesterday's Omaha World Herald there \nwas a report that Nebraska farmers are unable to cash checks when they \nbring their grain in after harvest. The article noted:\n\n       State law requires elevators to include a lender's name on \n     a check when a farmer has a loan against the grain. With no \n     one at Farm Service Agency offices because of the shutdown, \n     checks can't be cashed when the lender is the FSA.\n       ``We've got millions of dollars of grain checks out there \n     that farmers need,'' said Dan Poppe, president of the Archer \n     (Neb.) Cooperative Credit Union, with locations in Archer, \n     Dannebrog and Central City.\n       He said entire rural economies count on the money.\n       ``It impacts not only our farmers, who are relying heavily \n     on the money, but also the local grocery store, hardware \n     store, the feed and seed,'' Poppe said.\n\n  It is not just farmers and ranchers, it is also our manufacturers and \nour investors. A constituent from Waco, NB, wrote:\n\n       I am a Dow employee living in your district. This impasse \n     is beginning to threaten Dow's investment in new U.S. \n     manufacturing. Not only will a continued delay push back \n     Dow's plans to create thousands of new American jobs, it will \n     harm Dow's competitiveness and directly impact me and my \n     family. Greater economic certainty will help Dow, its \n     employees, and our State thrive.\n\n  The wife of a Federal law enforcement officer from Gretna wrote:\n\n       We are a single income family. We have a 2 and 3 year old \n     and one more on the way. I am due in November. This shutdown \n     will leave us unable to pay our bills.\n\n  A 23-year-old Department of Agriculture employee emailed me saying:\n\n       My wife works two jobs to help make ends meet, but we still \n     live paycheck to paycheck. If this shutdown is not resolved \n     within the next few days, we will be devastated financially.\n\n  A U.S. Air Force veteran wrote to tell me:\n\n       I applied for Social Security disability assistance on the \n     15th of August and my claim had gone for medical review on \n     the 26th of August. I have no money, and I just found out \n     yesterday that because of the shutdown SSA claims are on \n     hold.\n\n  A furloughed Federal worker from Omaha called my office to say: We \nare all tired. We are tired of not getting a budget until the last \nminute. We are all tired. You guys need to do your job.\n  I agree. I hear these same messages over and over. Nebraskans are \ntired of the name calling and the blame games. They want to see \ngovernment work, and they want to see it work well. They are not fooled \nby the rhetoric, and they expect us to govern responsibly. I agree. \nThat is why I am talking with my colleagues--not publicly in front of \nthe cameras but privately--to see if we can forge a way forward. But I \nbelieve we have to do more than just open the government. That is just \nthe basics. We have to address our $17 trillion debt. It is smothering \nthis country, it is jeopardizing our national security, and it is a \nthreat to our children's future.\n  Congress will soon vote on increasing the debt ceiling--the sixth \ndebt limit increase in the past 5 years. Our national debt has almost \ndoubled since 2006, and our debt limit has grown twice as much as our \neconomy in the past 2 years. Shouldn't the opposite be true? Meanwhile, \nour economy's lethargic recovery continues sluggishly along at a rate \nof 1 to 2 percent. This is unacceptable.\n  Instead of growing our economy by reducing spending, cutting \nregulations, and overhauling an outdated tax code,\n\n[[Page S7343]]\n\nCongress has continued to spend money we just don't have.\n  I didn't run for office to shut down the government. I ran for office \nto help hard-working Americans get back to work. I ran for this office \nto stand for middle-class families who aren't asking government for a \nhand up, they are just asking that the government stop holding them \ndown. Nebraskans want to know they can provide for their families, and \nI don't think that is asking too much.\n  Make no mistake. High public debt depresses economic growth, which in \nturn dampens job creation. Ironically, our country's debt crisis comes \nas the Congressional Budget Office is predicting that tax revenues will \nbe at an alltime high--$2.7 trillion in tax revenues. The problem isn't \nthat we have too little revenue, the problem is that we are spending \ntoo much.\n  Part of why Nebraskans are frustrated is that our problems are so \nclear. We know exactly what they are. There is no mystery here. The \nAmerican people know you can't keep spending twice what you make. They \nlive within a budget--a budget that must balance--and they expect \ngovernment to do the same. Our government is a long way from a balanced \nbudget, but we can work at a minimum to try to get there.\n  Despite these realities, we are not moving forward. For the past \nseveral weeks, Members of Congress, the President, and the press have \nbeen participants in a circus. After 9 days, there is still no end in \nsight. Let me repeat that. After 9 days of a government shutdown, there \nis still no end in sight.\n  That is not to say there aren't some good ideas out there. Several of \nmy colleagues have offered a number of commonsense proposals that do \nhave broad support. These ideas include repeal of the medical device \ntax, which was adopted by the Senate as an amendment to its budget \nresolution by an overwhelming vote of 79 to 20. And this happened in \nMarch. Other ideas include a commitment to reducing spending, as \nrequired by current law, but we would increase the flexibility for \nFederal agencies to make smarter cuts. We all agree sequestration is a \nvery clumsy way to cut spending.\n  That is why we need to provide program managers with the ability to \ndetermine which programs are wasteful or less efficient.\n  It is a matter of setting priorities so we can make wise decisions. \nThat is the Nebraska way, and that is what we need to do in Washington \nas well.\n  Senator Collins' sequestration proposal would also allow Congress to \ncontinue to exercise oversight on all spending and related cuts. That \nis important. Even the President has put forth ideas to cut spending by \n$400 billion over the next 10 years. These offers could give us the \nframework for a real discussion.\n  Yet we remain at an impasse, unable to move forward. A nation of \nmovers, thinkers, innovators, and entrepreneurs should not be caught in \nneutral. We should move forward--always forward, and always building a \nbetter future. We are the single greatest nation the world has ever \nknown. We have stood as a sentinel of liberty and economic prosperity \nfor over 200 years, yet we find ourselves no longer able to perform \neven the most basic functions of government. That is not acceptable. \nOur forefathers, our constituents, and our children and our \ngrandchildren deserve better.\n  I am ready to move forward. I am tired of waiting, and I am willing \nto work with any of my colleagues to find a reasonable solution. So \nlet's get to work.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I am privileged to represent the State of \nOhio, as I know the Presiding Officer is to represent Connecticut, and \nthe previous speaker is to represent Nebraska.\n  We are home to several large research facilities--medical research \nfacilities, aeronautics research facilities, military research \nfacilities, some that are overwhelmingly represented to do research in \npure science. All of them have a major impact in their communities in \nterms of employment with usually very good-paying jobs--scientists, \nengineers, physicians, chemists, and all kinds of people in the \nnatural, medical, or aeronautic sciences and all of the support staff. \nThese research facilities are always good for communities. And they not \nonly provide employment, but they provide great wealth for our country. \nSo much of this research helps people in their daily lives and is \ncommercialized into businesses, and entrepreneurs take much of this \nresearch and applied science and create more economic activity, \nprosperity, and good-paying jobs. And that is where this shutdown is \nparticularly problematic.\n  There are 800,000 Federal employees that have lost jobs as a result \nof this ridiculous shutdown. I have spent much of the last several days \non the phone talking to people running these institutions, talking to \nsmalltown and big-city bankers, entrepreneurs, businesses, union \nofficials, and people who represent or run many of these organizations. \nAll of them think this shutdown is absolutely unnecessary.\n  Just a moment ago the Presiding Officer and I had a conversation, and \nwe both shake our heads: Why do radicals in the House of \nRepresentatives want to inflict this kind of pain--not just on the \n800,000 Federal workers, but on the contractors near these facilities, \nthe restaurants, hardware stores and businesses, and the school \ndistricts that are affected because people aren't bringing home the \nincome and aren't paying as much taxes--all that happens when this \nwillful government shutdown, orchestrated because a group of people \nwant to attach their political platform, ideas, gimmicks, or statements \nto legislation we need to pass?\n  It is pretty simple: Pass the continuing resolution. Keep the \ngovernment open. That is not a Democratic or Republican platform. That \nis what we need to do. Don't go around attaching political statements \nin a political platform to a simple ``keep the government open'' \nresolution.\n  The same on the debt ceiling. Nobody is wild about increasing the \ndebt ceiling. Nobody is wild about passing legislation so we don't \ndefault. It is not a part of the 2012 Democratic platform to raise the \ndebt ceiling, nor is it a part of the 2012 Republican platform. So when \nwe have a vote, it is not negotiated: Let's add a bunch of 2012 \nRepublican party platform rhetoric to something to raise the debt \nceiling so the government of the United States pays its bills. It is \nnot a Democratic or a Republican value to pay the bills this Congress \nran up. It is our duty.\n  We take an oath of office. I took the oath in January 2013. The \nPresiding Officer took his oath. We know running the government and \npaying our bills is what you do as an elected official. Those never \nused to be controversial, until some radicals in the House of \nRepresentatives decided that this is a political opportunity. We can \naccuse the President of not negotiating. We can tell the public the \nDemocrats are willing to shut down the government. The Republican \nGovernor of Nevada to the Democratic majority leader from Nevada this \nweek called it a Republican shutdown. So it is clearly a group \nof radicals.\n\n  Back to what I was saying about these great research facilities. The \nPresiding Officer has them in Connecticut, I have them in Ohio, and the \nSenator from Hawaii has them in her State. An administrator of one said \nit is asymmetrical, killing and building a major scientific endeavor. \nIt is a lot harder and takes a lot longer for a group of engineers, \ndoctors or scientists to construct a very important scientific endeavor \nthan it does to kill one.\n  Fifty years ago, Speaker of the House Rayburn from Texas at one time \nsaid--and I will clean this up: Any mule can kick down a barn. It takes \na carpenter to build one.\n  I will make it more personal. A dozen years ago I was involved in a \ncar accident and broke my back. I was in good health and exercised, but \nfor 3 days I didn't get out of bed. I remember the first day I got out \nof bed and tried to walk. My leg muscles had atrophied. It takes a lot \nof time to build up those leg muscles, and it took 3 days for them to\n\n[[Page S7344]]\n\natrophy. I was in my late 40s then and in good shape.\n  That is also the way science is, in the same sense that it takes a \nlong time and a lot of investment of public dollars and a lot of brain \npower and really high-quality, talented scientists, engineers, doctors, \nor medical researchers to do these projects. And then we are going to \nlay them off for 2 or 3 weeks because somebody has some political idea \nthey want to attach to a continuing resolution. Somebody wants to take \ntheir political platform and put it on legislation that the government \npay its bills for their political gain.\n  A leader of one of these major institutions in Ohio told me he had to \nbring in many of his managers and employees and tell them there were \ngoing to be layoffs and furloughs. In some cases, with no end in sight \nbecause of this government shutdown, what are they going to do? Their \nscientific endeavors get interrupted and in some cases may not be \nrepaired or rebuilt. So many of the best scientists and engineers are \ngoing to say: I am not coming back and doing this.\n  So the radical Republicans in the House of Representatives say: OK, \nwe can keep the government open if you repeal part of ObamaCare.\n  If the President had done that and said: OK, keep the government \nopen, and we will repeal this section of ObamaCare, what would have \nhappened next? Then there would have been another continuing resolution \nor another end of the fiscal year or another opportunity these \npoliticians would have seized to again threaten to shut the government \ndown and gut something else, some other law they don't like. In other \nwords, if there is a law they don't like, and they are in the position, \nthen they are going to say: I am going to shut the government down if \nyou don't change this law. If the President says yes to that, what \nhappens the next time? Then, I am going to ask the President to get rid \nof two laws I don't like or I will shut the government down or I am \ngoing to block the government from paying its bills because I don't \nlike a law passed back in 1993 or 2007. We can't operate the government \nlike that.\n  NASA Glenn Research facilities, one of the great NASA facilities in \nthe country; Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, a major research facility \nnear Dayton, OH; Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus--thousands of \nemployees, engineers, scientists, technicians, highly-skilled people, \nvery educated, run eight of the national energy labs. Case Western \nReserve University Medical School and Engineering School, Ohio State \nUniversity, University of Cincinnati--I could name one after another. \nThese places can't operate if every 6 months or 1 year they are subject \nto a potential government shutdown unless the President does what some \nradical Members of Congress want.\n  So when people say: First, open the government; second, pay our \nbills; and, third, let's negotiate--we have already negotiated the \ndollar figure on the continuing resolution. Every time the continuing \nresolution expires or the fiscal year ends, every time we have to pay \nour debts when the debt ceiling limit is reached--if we have to play \nthis game, it is going to mean a potential government shutdown or \ndisruption at Battelle, NASA Glenn, Ohio State's medical school funding \nand research funding, and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. If that is \nthe way this crowd believes we should run a government, they don't have \nmuch regard for government.\n  Every time they have had a chance, they tried to privatize Medicare, \nthey tried to privatize Social Security. They don't like EPA, Head \nStart, or Meals On Wheels. They don't like these government programs. I \nunderstand that, but play it right. Don't threaten to close the \ngovernment unless we change the law which Congress passed, the \nPresident signed, and the Supreme Court affirmed. But if it was my \npolitical platform in 2012--even though it was defeated in front of \ntens of millions of voters--and I don't like what you are doing, then I \nam going to threaten to shut down the government. Our country is too \nimportant and too big for that.\n  On an international scale, the President of the United States didn't \ngo to China for a major economic conference because he had to be here \nbecause the government was shut down. Other countries--particularly \nChina--made fun of us. Other countries basically were asking: Is the \nUnited States abdicating its leadership role? And the Peoples Republic \nof China is not slowing down in their investment in scientific research \nor modernizing their infrastructure.\n  If we allow this kind of government shutdown and this kind of \nactivity by radicals in the House of Representatives, this is not good \nfor our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, amid all the rhetoric and the blame games \nand, yes, even theatrics, I want to make sure the American people \nactually understand what President Obama and the majority leader are \nasking us to do. Their position is that Congress should raise the debt \nlimit--actually suspend the debt limit through the end of 2014 and \nincrease our national debt by another $1.1 trillion without doing \nanything to solve our underlying fiscal problems, including the $17 \ntrillion in debt we have already run up.\n  I cannot imagine there is anyone in this Chamber or within the sound \nof my voice who thinks that is a good idea. At some point, if we keep \nmaxing out our credit card rather than dealing with our debt problem, \nour spending problem, we come back to the bank, so to speak, and ask \nfor our debt limit to be increased another $1.1 trillion, where will \nthis end? I can tell you where I think it will end: It will end in \ndisaster. Ultimately, at some point our creditors will lose confidence \nin our ability to repay that money. At some point interest rates are \ngoing to not be zero or next to zero, they will be up around the \nhistoric average, 4 percent or 5 percent, and we will have to pay China \nand our other creditors more and more of our Federal budget just to pay \ninterest on the national debt.\n  At some point that becomes unsustainable. It will hurt our national \nsecurity. It will hurt the safety net programs we all care about, to \nprotect our most vulnerable. Unfortunately, the President and the \nmajority leader remain dug in. Notwithstanding the charts we have seen \non this floor that talk about negotiations, there have been no real \nnegotiations. The President called Speaker Boehner last night to tell \nhim: In case you missed the message, Mr. Speaker, from when we met at \nthe White House last week, we are still not negotiating.\n  What is that all about? The President could have sent him a text \nmessage with as much information as that conveyed.\n  I am told the President has invited the Republican Members of \nCongress to the White House to meet with him tomorrow. I hope that \nmeeting is more productive than the meetings he has already held or the \nphone conversations he has had with the Speaker. I can only hope the \nPresident has reconsidered his unsustainable position, that he is not \nwilling to negotiate.\n  The Founders of this great country created a Constitution for us with \ncoequal branches of government. Congress is not better or worse than \nthe executive branch. We are coequal. We cannot function without one \nanother. We can pass a law, but it cannot become the law unless the \nPresident signs it. The President cannot pass a law without Congress. \nSo we have to learn to work together.\n  In the context of the recent history I want to recount for everybody, \nthe President's refusal to negotiate is simply unsustainable and quite \nremarkable. Over the last 30 years, virtually every major domestic \npolicy reform has involved at least some kind of bipartisan compromise.\n  In 1983, a conservative Republican President worked with a liberal \nSpeaker of the House and Senate leaders from both parties to save and \npreserve Social Security. That was in 1983. At the time those Social \nSecurity amendments were signed into law, Republicans had the same \nSenate majority the Democrats have today, 54 Republicans then, 46 \nDemocrats. Meanwhile, the Democratic House majority was significantly \nlarger than the Republican House majority today. Yet both sides did \nwhat so far we have been unable to do and that is come together, \nnegotiate and reach an outcome. Ronald Reagan, back in 1983, then \nsigned that negotiated outcome into law. In the end, the majority \nSenate Democrats voted for those Social Security\n\n[[Page S7345]]\n\namendments, as did a majority of Senate Republicans.\n  Three years later, in 1986, liberal Democrats and conservative \nDemocrats joined together to enact another landmark reform bill. Once \nagain the President's party controlled the Senate but not the House. \nOnce again, there was not a refusal to negotiate; rather, there was a \nnegotiation and a bipartisan outcome--notwithstanding the normal \npartisan rivalries that will always exist. In June 1986, 97 Members of \nthis Chamber, a massive, overwhelming supermajority, voted in favor of \nthe Tax Reform Act which lowered Federal income tax rates and broadened \nthe base. The final version of that bill was supported by a majority of \nSenate Democrats and a majority of Senate Republicans as well. That was \nthe kind of historic accomplishment that seems to be slipping through \nour fingers today by virtue of the refusal to negotiate. That was a \nhistoric accomplishment that dramatically simplified the U.S. Tax Code \nand made it more conducive to economic growth--a lesson we would do \nwell to recall and emulate today.\n  Fast forward a decade to 1996. A Democratic President, Bill Clinton, \njoined together with the Republican House and Senate and, despite \npartisan pressure enough to go around and all sorts of heated rhetoric, \nDemocrats and Republicans joined together and reformed our welfare \nsystem, helping millions of disadvantaged people to get off welfare \nrolls and make the transition from dependency to work, dignity and \nself-reliance. That was a great accomplishment. In the end, 78 \nSenators, including most Senate Democrats and every single Senate \nRepublican, voted for that.\n  One more prominent example. In 2001, a conservative Republican \nPresident worked with a prominent liberal Democrat to enact a major \noverhaul to our education laws. Indeed, the No Child Left Behind Act \nwas a direct result of President Bush's negotiations and collaboration \nwith the late Senator Ted Kennedy. The final legislation 87 Senators \nvoted for, including a majority of Senate Democrats and a majority of \nSenate Republicans.\n  I am not necessarily saying every single one of those pieces of \nlegislation was something that was perfect in every way. I think we \nhave learned there are things that still needed to be done, \nparticularly when it came to education reform, but the three Presidents \nI mentioned, two Republicans and one Democrat, worked together to make \nsubstantial compromises in order to pass Social Security reform, tax \nreform, welfare reform, and education reform. But they also understood \nthat politics is the art of the possible and they did not treat the \nword negotiate as a dirty four-letter word.\n  I want to emphasize one more time that Republicans stand ready to \nwork with President Obama in addressing our country's most serious \nfiscal and economic challenges. Yet rather than to pursue serious good-\nfaith negotiations over things such as entitlement reform and tax \nreform, things that would actually be good for our economy and good for \nour country, President Obama decides to erect and then knock down \nstrawmen.\n\n  For example, when Republicans talk about entitlement reform, he says \nwe want to eliminate the safety net. When Republicans talk about tax \nreform, he says we want to give tax breaks to rich people. That is \ncampaigning, that is not governing.\n  Here is the reality, though. Republicans do not want to eliminate the \nsafety net, we want to improve the safety net, particularly Medicare \nand Social Security. We don't want to give special tax breaks just to \nthe wealthy, we want to give all Americans a simpler, flatter, fairer \nTax Code that is more conducive to economic growth. We want the type of \nTax Code the President's own bipartisan fiscal commission, Simpson-\nBowles--the recommendations they made in 2010. Yet the President \nignored it, walked away, and has done nothing to contribute to that \ndebate.\n  We understand, being elected officials ourselves, that all elected \npoliticians have to campaign for office. It goes with the territory. \nYou cannot get here unless you run for office and you win an election. \nBut at some point the campaign has to end. At some point we have to \ngovern. At some point the partisan rhetoric has to give way to actually \naccomplishing things and solving problems. At some point America's \nelected leadership needs to demonstrate real leadership and a \nwillingness to govern.\n  President Obama has now reached a critical point in his Presidency, \nin his second term. He will be remembered for one thing or another. He \nwill be remembered either as a President who was willing to step up \nwhen America needed that kind of leadership, when Congress needed \nbipartisan cooperation in order to solve our Nation's biggest \nchallenges, or he will leave a legacy, if he does not do that, of a \nPresident who refused to do his job in order to try to win the partisan \nbattles.\n  We need something better and America deserves better. We need a \nPresident who will govern and not campaign perpetually.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, our distinguished Republican whip referred \nto negotiations that occurred regarding welfare reform, tax reform, \neducation reform, No Child Left Behind. These negotiations occurred, \nyes, but they certainly occurred not in the context of a threat of a \ngovernment shutdown or the threat of government defaulting on our \nobligations. There is a very big difference in the context in which \nthese negotiations occurred. That is not what we have before us today.\n  This past Saturday I came to the floor to share some thoughts on the \nimpact of this government shutdown on Hawaii's Federal employees. In \nthose remarks, I tried to remind my colleagues that we have to think \nbeyond the most recent news cycle. Shutting down government hurts the \nconfidence of the American people in our institutions. It drives people \naway from public service and it undermines our national security and \nour economy. If we are going to live up to the legacy of our Nation as \nthe world's indispensable Nation, we have to rise above zero sum \npolitics. We have to show our allies and our adversaries that our \npolitical process can withstand grave disagreements. Our process is \nintended to allow for vigorous debate but to ultimately find common \nground.\n  Over 6 months ago, the Senate passed a budget. So did the House. A \nlittle over 6 days ago the U.S. Government shut down. How did this \nhappen? The reason is that Republicans have blocked now 21 attempts to \nnegotiate a Federal budget agreement in a timely fashion. That is how \nnegotiations are supposed to happen--not with the threat of a \ngovernment shutdown, not with the threat of defaulting on our \nobligations and debt.\n  Instead, after 6 months of failing to come to the table, tea party \nRepublicans are holding the U.S. Government--and, if we default on our \ndebts, the world economy--hostage.\n  Enough is enough. The Senate is prepared to negotiate on fiscal \nissues. The President is ready to negotiate on fiscal issues. We can \nfind a way forward so we can all agree on the path. But first Congress \nneeds to do its job. It needs to reopen the government and make sure \nthe United States pays its bills. These are fundamental \nresponsibilities.\n\n  Just to be clear, defaulting on our debt would be the most \nirresponsible action I can imagine. It is the most easily avoidable \ncatastrophe in history. We are not talking about a natural disaster, we \nare talking about a totally avoidable catastrophe. Yet some Republicans \nin the House believe a default would not be a big deal. In fact, one \nMember of the House actually said that a default would ``bring \nstability to world markets.''\n  That is an opinion that no one outside of the tea party bubble agrees \nwith. In fact, economists, small businesses, bankers, big businesses, \nrealtors, and nearly everyone in between have been clear: Default would \nbe a catastrophe for our economy--and not just our economy either. Our \ncurrency, our bonds, and the full faith and credit they are backed by \nare the linchpin of the global economy. How a default from the world's \nmost trusted Nation could possibly bring stability to world markets is \nincomprehensible.\n  We have to stop the ideological games and irresponsible rhetoric, and \nthen we can negotiate on fiscal issues and other policies--mindful of \nthe work\n\n[[Page S7346]]\n\nwe were elected to do and mindful of the people, families, and \ncommunities that elected us to serve them.\n  Today I would like to share some more stories from Hawaii families \nand businesses about how the government shutdown is impacting one of \nthe key drivers of Hawaii's economy--tourism.\n  Each year millions of people from all over the world flock to Hawaii. \nOur State has so much to offer. They come to enjoy our blue oceans and \nsandy beaches. They come to visit our breathtaking national parks and \nwildlife refugees. They also come to learn and pay respect at our \nhistorical attractions, such as Pearl Harbor.\n  Last year Hawaii welcomed over 8 million visitors--a record number. \nCombined, these visitors spent $42 million per day, of which $5 million \nsupports State and local government activities that benefit our \ncommunities. In 2012 about 20 percent of our State's gross domestic \nproduct was generated by tourism. That economic activity supports \n175,000 jobs in Hawaii.\n  Due to our location in the center of the Pacific Ocean, Hawaii's \ntourism industry relies on critical government services to keep people \nmoving and commerce flowing. These include the work done by our air \ntraffic controllers, our customs and TSA personnel, and agricultural \ninspectors. Many of these workers are on the job, but they are not \ngetting paid right now. Thanks to them, our transportation systems are \noperating safely and effectively. As a result, visitors are still \nflocking to our resorts, our beaches, and other attractions. Even with \nthe tea party shutdown, 2013 is on track to be another strong year for \ntourism in Hawaii.\n  Unfortunately, at the same time, there are small businesses around \nthe State that are being impacted by this shutdown. For the last 7 days \nour national parks, wildlife refugees, and historical sites have been \nclosed to the public. These Federal sites are critical to many small \nbusinesses, particularly in our rural communities.\n  Over the past week I have heard from many people--especially small \nbusiness owners--whose livelihoods are being impacted by the closure of \nthese Federal sites. One tour operator wrote to me:\n\n       Our business is losing money, as do our tour guides who \n     cannot perform the tours to the National Parks. We have to \n     return the money to a lot of our clients because their tours \n     have to be cancelled. Our tour guides are losing income as \n     well, as they will not be able to do the tours.\n\n  National parks are some of the main attractions in Hawaii. People \ntravel thousands of miles from all parts of the world, spend a lot of \nmoney to come and visit, and then the main things that attract them are \nclosed and they are not able to see them. For a lot of people, these \ntrips are once in a lifetime, and if they don't see them now, they will \nnever be able to see them again.\n  A restaurant owner from Hawaii Island wrote:\n\n       Well, we are in a small town on the Big Island of Hawaii. \n     Our economy is totally tourist driven. We are dependent on \n     people going to the National Park and stopping at our place \n     to eat. Since the shutdown, our revenue has dropped a lot and \n     we have had to cut hours for employees to compensate for the \n     lack of business.\n       I'm tired of all this Republican childish actions and wish \n     all politicians would drop the partisan nonsense and do what \n     is right for the American People.\n       Thank you for your concern.\n\n  One gentleman from Maui reminded me that private businesses don't get \nto pause on meeting their commitments when the government is closed. He \nwrote:\n\n       My daughter and son-in-law have a tourist based clientele \n     for their bicycle crater tour business on Maui. When \n     Haleakala National Park was closed down, they lost their \n     income and are still having to pay office expenses, etc., \n     etc., as well as their home expenses, but nothing is coming \n     in, as everything is going out.\n       They are losing hundreds to thousands of dollars a day, \n     their employees who have families aren't able to work with \n     the business closed, tourists who come to Maui to have a good \n     time, part of which was the bike ride down from Haleakala, \n     are angry and disappointed and some even think this is \n     somehow Maui government's fault!\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       My daughter has six children, mortgage payments. Money is \n     going out, but none is coming in. My family are diligent \n     middle class people who work hard, pay their taxes, vote in \n     every election--responsible citizens who do their part \n     always.\n       If this ridiculous federal government shutdown continues \n     for any length of time, my family will lose their business \n     and be at poverty level in no time, as will all their \n     employees. Everyone I know, on either side of the political \n     spectrum, thinks the shutdown is ridiculous and unnecessary.\n\n  I also heard about the impact of the shutdown on the visitors \nthemselves who go to Hawaii. One person from Hawaii whose family \nmembers traveled to Hawaii to visit wrote:\n\n       My family has travelled 6,000 miles on a once in a lifetime \n     trip--sorry--no Pearl Harbor (Dad was a lifer Navy man) no \n     Volcanoes National Park--no Puukohola--these sites are \n     essential to our culture and tourism alike--many are \n     without work--it is just ridiculous over a LAW that has \n     been declared Constitutional--their antics change \n     nothing--just hurt our country.\n\n  Another local bed-and-breakfast owner on the Big Island shared the \nperspective of some of her international guests:\n\n       Aloha, I have a bed and breakfast in Hilo and I feel sorry \n     for my guests who have saved for a once in a lifetime \n     vacation to Hawaii. They have come from all over the world to \n     see our Beautiful Volcano National Park! These Guests do not \n     understand how the government can CLOSE and deny them access \n     to the Park.\n       This week I have guests from Montreal, Canada; Singapore, \n     Germany, France and Japan! They may NEVER have the \n     opportunity to visit here again. This is Shameful for our \n     country. Not only is this behavior bad for our Country but \n     bad for the world.\n\n  The tea party shutdown is also impacting Hawaiian visitors to our \nNation's Capital. Yesterday I met with 81 students from Millilani \nMiddle School on Oahu. They made the long trip from Hawaii to \nWashington, DC, in hopes of seeing historical sites, visiting museums, \nand learning about their country and our democracy. The trip was saved \nfor and planned for months in advance. The sites and museums were \nscheduled. Their tickets and reservations were already paid for. They \ncould not rebook their travel even though the shutdown has closed many \nof the sites they planned to visit. I took them on a tour of the \nCapitol myself because it was the only way they could see these halls \nof government. These students are here to learn about our democracy. \nMany of them asked me about the shutdown and how we were going to get \ngovernment back on track. What kind of message will they take home with \nthem about how our government operates?\n  These are just some of the stories that illustrate the real impact of \nthe tea party shutdown on communities, families, and people in Hawaii. \nSo many of the folks whose letters I have shared work hard to earn an \nhonest living. They go to work each day, striving to show our visitors \naloha while building something for themselves and their families to be \nproud of. They play by the rules, meet their commitments, and do what \nthey can to be good community members. Yet, through no fault of their \nown, many of these Hawaii small businesses are losing income and their \nlivelihoods are being affected.\n  It is past time for the House to take the responsible action to pass \nthe Senate bill to keep government running and services going. It is \nnot fair to our veterans, our students, and their families when they \ncan't visit our Nation's historical and national treasures just because \na small minority in Congress has chosen recklessness over \nresponsibility. It is not fair that this shutdown and these senseless \ndefault threats have gone on for a week. This behavior is harming our \neconomy and undermining our credibility around the world. We need to \nstop the tea party temper tantrum, we need to open the government, we \nneed to pay our bills, and then we can negotiate on other matters.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I appreciate the time to be on the floor. \nI want to continue talking about what I think are the real problems \nwith where we are today.\n  What we are hearing in the press is that there is no agreement on a \ncontinuing resolution, that there is conflict and lack of discussion in \nWashington, that the debt limit is coming\n\n[[Page S7347]]\n\nup, yet Washington is not capable of solving its problems.\n  I made some points yesterday about the reason we are not capable of \nsolving our problems is that there is an absence of leadership. We are \nnot only bankrupt financially, we are bankrupt when it comes to our \nleadership.\n  I want to dispel the rumor that our problems are not insolvable. They \nare imminently solvable. We have $126 trillion worth of unfunded \nliabilities for which Americans are responsible. We have $17 trillion \nworth of debt, and we have $94 trillion of total assets in this country \nif you add what the Federal Government and everybody else owns. So the \ndifference between $128 trillion and $94 trillion is $34 trillion, and \nthen another $17 trillion--that is $51 trillion we are going to have to \naccount for. What is in front of us--and by the way, the Affordable \nCare Act will add $6.7 trillion to those outstanding liabilities net of \nany tax revenues and tax increases it collects.\n  So what are we to do? What are the American people to think? They see \nimpasse, lack of conversation, lack of compromise, lack of resolution, \nand no reconciliation. So I wanted to take a few minutes today to kind \nof give a little history, first of all, and then outline what is \npossible--I am not saying we must do it--over the next 10 years that we \ncould do that would put us on a pathway to where we would be solving \nthe problems and not leaving our children an inheritance of debt.\n  I made the point yesterday that the median family income in this \ncountry today in terms of real dollars is exactly where it was in 1989. \nWe are going backward. We are going to go backward this year. What that \nreally means is that the standard of living is declining. The American \npublic is getting further and further behind.\n  One of the quotes I use--and I don't know if it is accurate--has been \nattributed to Alexander Tytler, a Scottish historian. Let me read it:\n\n       A democracy--\n\n  In this case a constitutional Republic--\n\n     is always temporary in nature; it simply cannot exist as a \n     permanent form of government. It will continue to exist until \n     the time that voters discover that they can vote themselves \n     generous gifts from the public treasury. From that moment on, \n     the majority always votes with the candidates who promise the \n     most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that \n     every democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal \n     policy, which is always followed by a dictatorship.\n\n  Where are we in that line? Is $50 trillion in negative net worth not \na sign that we are going there? Is declining median family income not a \nsign that we are going there?\n  What we have seen in this last so-called recovery is the wealthy have \ndone very well but nobody else has. So what we are seeing is history \nrepeat itself in terms of what has been outlined and observed in the \npast.\n  Alexander Tytler was also accredited with this, but nobody can prove \nit:\n\n       The average age of the world's greatest civilizations from \n     the beginning of history has been about 200 years. During \n     these 200 years, these nations always progressed through the \n     following sequence: From bondage to spiritual faith; from \n     spiritual faith to great courage; from courage to liberty; \n     from liberty to abundance; from abundance to complacency; \n     from complacency to apathy; from apathy to dependence; from \n     dependence back into bondage.\n\n  I think we are somewhere in here, if history speaks accurately, or at \nleast his observation of history.\n  So what we ought to be about is making sure we cheat history--all of \nus, together, liberals, conservatives, Democrats, Republicans, \nIndependents--we ought to be about cheating history. How do we do that? \nAre the problems we have in front of us so big that we can't solve \nthem? I don't think so. Are positions so hardened that we can't think \nin a long-term way about solving the problems that are in front of our \ncountry?\n  When we talk about the debt ceiling--I have been accosted a lot in \nthe news media in the last 48 hours because I don't believe the debt \nceiling equals default on our obligations in terms of our sovereign \ndebt. It just so happens Moody's, the rating agency, agreed with me \ntoday; that, in fact, they are not the same thing and they say there \nshould be no effect. That doesn't mean we should. I am not proposing we \nshould. But the scare tactics of saying the Earth is going to collapse \nif we somehow fail on time to raise the debt limit is not true. The \nEarth will collapse for Americans if we don't address the underlying \nproblems facing our country--this $50 trillion in unfunded liability \nand negative net worth.\n  Here is what we know has happened in the last few years, and it \nproves the point. It is why median family income is going down. It is \nbecause our debt is growing twice as fast as our economy.\n  Here is our GDP increase over the last few years: $1.199 trillion. \nHere is our debt: It went up $2.405 trillion. To say that another way, \nthat is 2.4 billion millions. These numbers are unfathomable, but the \ngraph shows it all. Our GDP has increased. So what is happening is that \nfor every $1 in debt we go into, we are getting a deepening decrease in \nreturn in our economy, and it is continuing to go down. So the more we \nborrow, the less well off we are in terms of being able to grow our \neconomy. So the problems in front of us and what we see is what I would \nsay as careerists don't want to solve the problem because the thing \nthat comes to the careerist's mind is how does that effect the next \nelection.\n  I don't care what happens in the next election in this country; what \nI care about is whether we are going to address the real problems and \nsecure the future for the country. Whether they be Democrats or \nRepublicans, liberals or conservatives, I don't care. We are all in \nthis together. When our living standard goes down, we all go down \ntogether.\n  So how do we solve this problem? The first thing in any addiction--\nand we have an addiction to spending--is to recognize we have an \naddiction. We have an addiction to spending. We have an addiction to \nnot living within our means. We just passed $600 billion in January of \nincreased taxes on the American economy, most of that coming from the \npeople who are doing much better during this tepid recovery. Will that \nsolve our problems? Can we tax our way out of this? Can we have \nconfiscatory tax policies that will not hurt our economy and get us out \nof this? The answer is no, and everybody recognizes it.\n  What else does everybody recognize? They recognize that a big portion \nof the problem is entitlement spending, and no political party wants to \nbe blamed for being the person who ``fixed'' entitlement spending \nunless we do it together. So we have a great opportunity to, together, \nmodify our mandatory spending programs and make significant savings. \nBut having spent the last 9 years with my colleague from Delaware who \nis on the floor oversighting the Federal Government, I can tell my \ncolleagues there are more things we can do other than that.\n  So I thought I would spend a few minutes to go over a publication I \nput out a couple of summers ago, and it is called ``Back in Black.'' It \nis not perfect. I will be the first to admit it. I know we will not \never pass $9 trillion worth of savings over 10 years. But here is $9 \ntrillion worth of options we could look at and take half of them and \nactually get on the road to health.\n  What would getting on the road to health look like? It would be \nrising personal incomes, not declining personal incomes as we are \nseeing today. It would be rising median family incomes. It would be \nfaster economic growth.\n  Mr. President, am I out of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 10 minutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. My request was for 30 minutes when I came to the floor. \nEvidently, that wasn't made. Is the order of the day 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would ask for just a short period of additional time if \nmy colleague from Delaware would allow it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. May I ask unanimous consent that the doctor be afforded \nanother 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will spend some time tomorrow then going through what \nthis is. But it is solving our problem in such a way that it doesn't \nkick the can down the road, which is what we are getting ready to do.\n  What I would say in conclusion is by increasing the debt limit, we \nlet the politicians off the hook because then\n\n[[Page S7348]]\n\nthey don't have to make the hard choices required for us to live within \nour means.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry, if I may.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware will state his \ninquiry.\n  Mr. CARPER. I have no objection; I can stay 10 minutes, 20 minutes. I \nwould like for the Senator from Oklahoma Dr. Coburn to have a chance to \nexplain what he wanted to say. I don't mean to interrupt.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I would just inquire if there are other \nspeakers after Senator Carper.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no apparent order of speakers, and if \nthere is no objection, the Senator from Oklahoma can take an additional \n20 minutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Chair. I truly thank my colleague. He is a \ngreat colleague to work with. People are always telling stories about \nhow people don't work together. I can tell my colleagues that the \nSenator from Delaware Mr. Carper and I work together. He is my \nchairman, and I am the ranking member on the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, where most of this information came \nfrom, and he helped dig it up.\n  What I say is we have an opportunity to do that. We have an \nopportunity for Democrats and Republicans to come together, forge a \ncompromise, make major changes that are necessary and absolutely \nrequired if we are going to have a secure future. I think we ought to \nlook at it.\n  So we put together a plan that has $3 trillion--that is $300 billion \nover 10 years--in discretionary spending; that is nonmandatory. It has \n$1 trillion in defense spending, which is about what we already have. \nHealth care entitlements is $2.7 trillion, and we can go into the \ndetails of that. Tax Code simplification, $1 trillion to come back to \nthe Federal Government. Interest payment savings of $1.3 trillion, and \nSocial Security reform that says it will be healthy for the next 75 \nyears. That comes to $9 trillion that our kids aren't going to have to \npay back. That is $9 trillion in money we are not going to borrow. So \neven if we just took half of that--$4.5 trillion--and said we are going \nto get on the path to health, we are going to float that $3 trillion \nthat is sitting in cash in Americans' bank accounts and give them the \nconfidence back to invest it in our country, it would make a massive \ndifference in our country because what is going on right now is a \ncrisis of confidence.\n  The American people don't trust Congress. I think we got a pretty low \nrating this week and deservedly so. The approval rating of President \nObama is at his alltime low. So how do we fix that? We don't fix that \nindividually. We don't fix that by pointing out what is wrong with the \nother person. We fix that by coming together and solving real problems \nthat will give the American people confidence that we have their best \ninterests at heart--not in the short term, as Alexander Tytler was \ntalking about, but in the long term; that, in fact, we want to secure \nthe future for our kids and grandkids.\n  I think we ought to be about cutting up the credit card. I know I am \nin the minority in the Senate. I don't believe we should have another \ndebt limit increase. I think the thing to force us to make these hard \nchoices--because there is certainly not the political will to do it--is \nto put ourselves in the position where we are forced to make the hard \nchoices.\n  We are going to make them eventually. Everybody agrees with that. We \nare basically going to make these changes because there will come a \ntime when we will not be able to borrow money no matter what interest \nrate we pay. So we are not talking about defaulting on our sovereign \ndebt. We are not talking about not paying interest on our sovereign \ndebt. We are talking about forcing ourselves into a position where we \nhave to prioritize what we spend.\n  What do the GAO reports tell us? In the last 3 years, the GAO has \ngiven Congress wonderful information which Congress has not acted on. \nWhat have they told us? They have told us we have 91 different health \ncare workforce training programs--91. They have told us we have 679 \nrenewable energy initiatives, none of which have a metric on them. They \nhave told us we have 76 different drug abuse and prevention programs \nrun by the Federal Government. They have told us the Department of \nDefense has 159 different contracting organizations, none of them being \nheld accountable. They have told us that at Homeland Security, where \nSenator Carper and I chair and vice chair the committee, they have six \ndifferent R facilities, three of which are doing exactly the same \nthing. We have 209 science, technology, engineering, and math \nprograms--209. We have 200 different crime prevention programs. We have \n160 homeowners and renters assistance programs. We have 94 private \nsector green building assistance programs, none with a metric, and the \nagencies don't even know how much money they are spending on them. They \ntold us we have 82 teacher quality programs run by the Federal \nGovernment, half of which are not in the Department of Education. I \nwill not continue, but my colleagues get my point.\n  What have we done about those things? Nothing. Where is the oversight \non them? There is none. So the whole idea for me--I am thinking about \nthe future more than I am a political career--is I think we ought to be \nworking on those things. I think the American public expects us to work \non them.\n\n  I will finish by saying we have been running the credit card for a \nlong time. Do we, in fact, have the right or the privilege or the \nability to ask for an extension and a raising of our debt when, in \nfact, we have not acted responsibly with our spending? Nobody else in \nthe country gets their credit raised when they have not acted \nresponsibly. They actually check your credit score. They know what kind \nof bills you are paying, whether you are getting further behind. So \nshould we, in fact, tear up the credit card? Should we force some good \nold adult supervision on Congress, where we will actually be forced to \nmake difficult decisions about priorities on how we spend America's \nmoney? When I say ``America's money,'' I mean the people out there \nworking hard every day. They may not be the highest tax payers, but it \nis unconscionable to me that when we spend their money, we are wasting \n15 to 20 percent of it all the time.\n  So I think we ought to tear it up. The way we tear it up is we just \ntear it up. We tear the credit card up. We shred the credit card, and \nwe say: You are going to live within your means. You are going to start \nmaking the hard choices. You are addicted to spending. You are addicted \nto not being responsible with the dollars you have.\n  Congress needs to be in a 12-step program, and it should start with \nus.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague the Senator from Delaware for his \npatience and his friendship.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, Dr. Coburn is a tough act to follow, and I \nam not going to try to do that. But I am happy to serve with him. We \ncome from different parts of the country, different kinds of training, \nupbringing, and careers, but we have ended up here together in the \nSenate for the last 9 years and have had an opportunity to lead, first, \nthe subcommittee on Federal financial management--it is a subcommittee \nof the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee--and this \nyear to be the Democratic and Republican leaders of the committee. I \nenjoy working with him. I find that we have the opportunity to do some \nreally good for our country, and I thank him for letting me be his \nwingman.\n  I want to just follow on with what Dr. Coburn has said, by asking us \nto think of how we spend money and what we spend it for in this \ngovernment of ours. Then I actually have an op-ed that I read recently \nin our local paper in Delaware that I would like to read into the \nRecord from Dr. Bob Laskowski, who is the CEO and the president of \nChristiana Care Health System, one of the largest hospital systems not \njust in our State but one of the largest in our part of the country.\n  Before I do that, I want to follow on to some of Dr. Coburn's \ncomments by talking about our spending in the Federal Government. I \nwould like to think of it as a pie. It is a big pie. A little more than \nhalf of the spending pie goes for something we call entitlements--\nthings we are entitled to by virtue of our age, our station in life, or \nwe might\n\n[[Page S7349]]\n\nbe entitled to Medicare if we are 65 or older, or Medicare if we are \ndisabled and unable to work, or we may be entitled to early Social \nSecurity benefits at age 62, full retirement Medicare benefits 5 or so \nyears after that. We may be entitled to benefits because we served in \nthe military or we are a veteran or somebody with a disability. Those \nare all programs that are called entitlement programs. A lot of people \nsay they are uncontrollable, we cannot do anything to control them, and \nthey have grown like Topsy.\n  Today, if you think of the spending pie, over half of it is for \nentitlement. Roughly, closer to another 5 to 10 percent of spending \ntoday is for interest on the debt. If interest rates were not so low, \nit would be a lot more than 5 or 10 percent. Fortunately, we are \nblessed to have very low interest rates, but still our interest as a \npercentage of that pie is somewhere, I think, between 5 and 10 percent.\n  The whole rest of the Federal government is called discretionary \nspending, which means we actually have some discretion on how that \nmoney is spent. It is not an entitlement program, but we actually have \nto pass spending bills. We call them, usually, appropriations bills. \nThere are about a dozen of them that cover everything from agriculture \nto defense, to housing, to the environment, to education, to \ntransportation--you name it. That part of the budget--roughly, close to \n40 percent, 35 to 40 percent--is called discretionary spending. More \nthan half of that discretionary spending is for defense--I would say \nroughly 20 percent of the whole pie, maybe a little more than 20 \npercent. About 15 percent of the whole pie--a little less than half of \nthe discretionary spending--is for nondefense matters.\n  So if you think about it, it goes something like this: For the \nspending pie, over half of it is entitlements. Allegedly, those are \nthings we cannot reduce, control. I do not agree with that. Another 5 \nor 10 percent is for interest. Then we have roughly 40 percent for \ndiscretionary spending, the lion's share of which is for defense, and a \nlittle less than half of it is for nondefense spending. Think about \nthat--entitlements, interest, defense spending. You set that aside, and \nfor the whole rest of the government you have about 15 percent. That is \ndomestic or nondefense discretionary spending.\n  We could actually eliminate domestic discretionary spending in its \nentirety--get rid of everything, everything we do in government other \nthan entitlement programs, interest, and defense--and we would still \nhave a deficit.\n  For people who say we can only focus on domestic discretionary \nspending or squeeze that to reduce the deficit further, the deficit is \ndown from about $1.4 trillion about 4 years ago to about half that \ntoday. So we have made progress. It is still way too big, but we cannot \nget from here to where we want to go in terms of a balanced budget by \njust focusing on domestic discretionary spending.\n  I would like to say there are three things we need to do. Dr. Coburn \nhas heard me say this more times than he wants to remember. The \nPresiding Officer has heard me say it a time or two as well.\n  There are three things we need to do if we are serious about deficit \nreduction, facing the reality of today.\n  No. 1, entitlement reform. These are the President's words: \nentitlement reform that saves money, entitlement reform that saves \nthese programs for our kids and our grandchildren, and entitlement \nreform--these are my words--entitlement reform that does not savage old \npeople or poor people, but it is sensitive to the least of these in our \nsociety.\n\n  The second thing we need to do is to focus on revenues. We need some \nmore revenues. If you look at our country last year, when our deficit \nwas about $700 billion--the year we just finished--as I recall, revenue \nas a percentage of gross domestic product was somewhere in the area of \n17 percent, maybe 18 percent--revenue as a percentage of GDP. Spending \nas a percentage of GDP was over 20 percent, maybe around 21, 22, 23 \npercent.\n  The difference between revenues as a percentage of GDP down here at \n17, 18, 19 percent of GDP and spending at 21, 22, or 23 percent, that \ndifference right there is about a $700 billion deficit from the last \nyear.\n  At the end of the day we need to make the revenues come closer to, \nactually, the spending. I suggest that we need to take a page out of \nthe book they did in the second term of President Bill Clinton when we \nhad run chronic deficits since 1968. President Clinton asked Erskine \nBowles, who was then his Chief of Staff, to work with a Republican \nSenate and Republican House--a Republican Congress--to see if we could \ncome up with a budget plan that included revenues, included spending, \nto actually balance the budget.\n  As we all know the story, famously it worked. A Democratic President, \nworking with a Republican House and Senate, with the help of Erskine \nBowles and Sylvia Mathews--now Sylvia Mathews Burwell, who was \nErskine's Deputy Chief of Staff, later Deputy OMB Director--they got \nthe job done. They reached across the aisle and worked it out. The \ndeficit reduction plan was a 50-50 deal--50 percent on the revenue side \nand 50 percent on the spending side. They grew the heck out of the \neconomy. As a result, we had four balanced budgets in a row--I think \n1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001.\n  Harry Truman used to say: The only thing that is new in the world is \nthe history we forgot and never learned. I think as we try to figure \nout what to do with today's deficits and how to get on an even more \nfiscally responsible track, it would be smart to look back about 15 \nyears and see how it worked then.\n  For folks who might be watching this around the country, we actually \nhave a budget law. I think our budget law was adopted in 1974. There is \nan expectation in our Nation's budget law for the President to present \nus in the Congress with a budget--one budget, not a capital budget and \nan operating budget but one budget. It is different from the States. It \nis different from my State, where I was Governor of Delaware for 8 \nyears, where we have a capital budget and an operating budget. But we \nhave one budget.\n  The President usually submits a budget in January, maybe February. \nThis year it was a little late. The expectation here in the Congress, \nunder the law, is that by, say, the end of April--a couple months \nlater--the House and the Senate would have passed something called a \nbudget resolution.\n  A budget resolution--what is that? It is not a budget. A budget \nresolution is a framework for a budget. It includes not nitty-gritty \nline-item spending plans for everything--defense and nondefense--but it \nsays, roughly, we will spend this much in these programs, and \ngenerally, we will raise this much money in these ways from these \nrevenue sources. It is not very specific, but it is a framework for the \nbudget. I like to think of it as the skeleton, and later on, when we \npass appropriations bills, when we pass revenue measures, we put the \nmeat on the bones. That is where the real specificity comes along.\n  For a number of years we have not been able to pass in the Senate, in \nthe House, a budget resolution--they are usually different--and then go \nto conference, create a conference committee to create a compromise. We \nhave found it difficult to actually come up with a compromise budget \nresolution--a compromise, a spending plan, a framework for the \nappropriations bills and revenue measures.\n  This year started more promising because in the Senate here, in \nApril, under the leadership of our Senate Budget Committee chairman \nPatty Murray of Washington, we actually passed a budget resolution--\nsadly, without Republican support. We passed one, and it was one of \nthose like the Clinton years, a 50-50 deficit reduction deal. It did \nnot eliminate the deficit, but it kept it going in the right track. \nHalf of the deficit reduction was on the spending side, half on the \nrevenue side.\n  Over in the House, they passed a different kind of budget resolution. \nThe budget resolution they passed did a little entitlement reform. But \nthat 15 percent of the spending pie I was talking about--the 15 percent \nthat is domestic discretionary spending--was reduced, as I recall, from \n15 percent to like 5 percent. Think about that. We would be talking \nabout--aside from entitlement spending, interest on the debt, and \ndefense spending--having about the whole rest of the government be like \n5 percent of our spending. That is not my vision of what our government\n\n[[Page S7350]]\n\nshould be about. That is not my vision. And I do not think that is the \nvision of a lot of people in this body and in this country.\n  So the three things we need to do: No. 1, entitlement reform. It \nsaves money, saves the programs. It does not savage old people, poor \npeople. The second thing, we need some additional revenues.\n  I remember Kent Conrad, when he was our Budget Committee chairman, \ngave a presentation at a meeting a year or so ago. He talked about \nrevenues. He talked about tax expenditures. As to the tax expenditures \nthat he talked about, he said over the next 10 years we will see about \n$12 to $15 trillion go out of the Treasury because of tax breaks--tax \ncredits, tax deductions, tax loopholes, the tax gap--$12 to $15 \ntrillion go out of the Treasury for those tax expenditures. He said \nmore money will come out of the Treasury for those tax expenditures--\ntax breaks, tax credits, tax deductions, tax loopholes--than all the \nappropriations bills we are going to pass. Think about that.\n  He said we have a new way to appropriate money, we just do it through \nthe Tax Code. I would say to our Republican and Democratic friends, \nthis is where I think Senator Conrad was coming from. If we cannot \nfigure out how out of $12 or $15 trillion of tax expenditures a year, \nmaybe 5 percent of those that could be reduced or could be eliminated \nbecause they serve no useful purpose, something is wrong with us. If we \ncan do 5 percent of, say, just $12 trillion in those tax expenditures, \n5 percent would be about $600 billion over the next 10 years. Match \nthat with entitlement spending reductions, that is about $1.2 trillion. \nThat is a pretty good next step to take in narrowing our deficit on top \nof what we have already done.\n  The third piece, in addition to entitlement reform that saves money, \nsaves the programs for the long haul, and does not savage old people or \npoor people, some additional revenue, generally from eliminating or \nreducing tax expenditures, the third piece--and Dr. Coburn was talking \na little bit about this. He was talking about the way we spend money. \nWe have a culture in the Federal Government. We have had it for a long \ntime. Big companies have this culture too, and some States as well as \ncounties and cities. I call it a culture of spend thrifts as opposed to \na culture of thrift. What Dr. Coburn and I attempt to do with the folks \non our committee is look at everything we do in the Federal Government \nto the extent that one committee can. We like to work with the Office \nof Management and Budget, OMB, with the General Accountability Office, \nGAO, the Office of Personnel Management, with the General Services \nAdministration, all of the inspector generals across the agencies, \nthroughout the Federal Government. We like to work with nonprofit \ngroups such as Citizens Against Government Waste and others.\n  We do this in order to figure out what we are doing. How are we \nspending the taxpayers' money? Are there ways we can do those things, \nrealize the goals we are trying to achieve, by spending less money or \ngetting better results for the same amount of money? We need to do that \nin everything.\n  One of my colleagues said to me, when I said I was coming over to \nspeak tonight: What are you going to talk about?\n  I said I think I will talk about regular order. We talk a fair amount \nabout regular order around this place. We do not always follow it. \nRegular order, for the people watching who are tuned in wondering what \nis regular order, means following the rules. In this case, we have a \nBudget Act that says the President submits a budget the early part of \nthe calendar year. Congress adopts a budget resolution. We do that \nabout the beginning of May. Then we do our work on preparing \nappropriations bills and revenue measures. In order to go to a \nconference on a budget resolution, we have to get agreement. The \nmajority leader will come or the Budget Committee chair will come to \nthe floor and say: I ask unanimous consent to go to conference with the \nHouse and to name conferees and begin working out a compromise between \nthe House and the Senate.\n  For many years it was perfunctory. The unanimous consent request was \nmade. We would go to conference with the House. We would go to work on \na budget resolution between the two bodies. This year, every time that \nrequest has been made--and it has been made dozens of times by \nDemocrats and by at least one Republican--dozens of times--there has \nalways been an objection to keep us from going to conference to work \nout this compromise.\n  As much as anything, we need to create an environment where we can \nfocus on doing the three things I talked about: entitlement reform, tax \nreform that raises some revenues through deficit reduction, and try to \nfocus on everything we do and say how do we get a better result, how do \nwe get a better result for less money or the same amount of money.\n  I would say to my Republican colleagues who continue to object: Stop. \nPlease stop. Let us actually have a chance to gather in a room in this \nbuilding and see what we can hammer out to address, not a short-term \ncontinuing resolution but actually a thoughtful, comprehensive spending \nplan as we did 15, 16 years ago when the Republicans were in the \nmajority here, House and Senate, and we had a Democratic President. We \ngot the job done and helped to continue the longest running economic \nexpansion in the history of this country.\n  I mentioned Bob Laskowski, president and CEO of Christiana Care \nHealth System, a large regional health care system. He did a great job. \nWe are very proud of him in our State. They provide care to a lot of \npeople. He is a doctor and a health system leader. I thought his \nperspectives on health care reform and the Affordable Care Act were \nimportant enough to share on the floor.\n  This comes from an op-ed that appeared in one of our local statewide \npapers called the News Journal, a Gannett publication. His op-ed was in \nthe News Journal this past week. I am going to read it. It is not that \nlong. It goes like this:\n\n       With some in Washington promising to speak out against \n     implementation of the Affordable Care Act until they ``can no \n     longer stand,'' it might be a useful reality check to visit \n     an emergency room in any town or city across America.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       There you will find thousands of Americans each day that \n     really cannot stand. It is not just because an injury, \n     illness or disease has put them on their backs.\n       Too often, it is because an eminently treatable ailment has \n     been allowed to turn into something much worse--for the \n     simple reason that the patient doesn't have health insurance \n     and couldn't afford to see a doctor until things became so \n     bad that the emergency room was their only option.\n       In the continuing cacophony of criticism around so-called \n     ObamaCare, this crucial fact keeps being lost: Our health \n     care system remains badly broken--and in the absence of \n     reform, it will continue to get a lot worse.\n       I see this--as a physician and as a health care executive; \n     but more importantly, I experience this as the friend of too \n     many neighbors with no health insurance.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       I think that might be the reason why 3 in 4 Americans \n     surveyed in a recent Pew Research poll say they oppose \n     efforts to sabotage the law: because they know that the \n     people threatening to derail and defund the Affordable Care \n     Act are not offering a better solution.\n\n  Ironically, the part of the Affordable Care Act that we are \nattempting to implement and stand up across the country right now, the \nhealth exchanges or marketplaces, is a Republican idea. It was first \noffered as an alternative to HillaryCare back in the first term of \nPresident Clinton. It is a Republican idea, a business idea.\n  But I do not care whether it is a Democratic or Republican idea. It \nis a smart idea to use large purchasing pools, enable people who \notherwise would buy health insurance for one person or five people or \nfor a small business--it is a way for them to bring down the cost of \ntheir care, use competition to get better options. It is a smart idea.\n  The idea of another criticism, the individual mandates, people being \nindividually mandated to get health care and if they did not they would \nmaybe face some kind of fine--modest at first, it grows in time--that \nis not a Democratic idea. Ironically, that is an idea we got out of \nMassachusetts. The author, the Governor who signed it into law, was the \nRepublican nominee for President last year, Mitt Romney.\n  So what we have tried to do is take some Republican ideas and some \nDemocratic ideas and, frankly, some good ideas.\n\n\n[[Page S7351]]\n\n\n       And over half of those who ``oppose'' the law today, say \n     they want it fixed, not scrapped.\n\n  I agree with that--fixed, not scrapped.\n\n       They know that in the absence of reform, there are still \n     too many people who use the emergency room as their only \n     source of medical care; too many families and businesses who \n     cannot keep up with the ever-rising cost of health care \n     premiums; and too many Americans who find nothing but \n     frustration when navigating our health care system--who still \n     fill out too many forms, are prescribed too many tests that \n     do not help them and get passed from office to office without \n     anyone guiding them overall care.\n       Beginning [last week], millions of uninsured Americans \n     began to shop for quality, affordable health care through the \n     health insurance marketplaces. These marketplaces are a key \n     element of the Affordable Care Act and represent an important \n     step toward putting quality health care within reach of all \n     Americans.\n       Just as Medicare has enabled seniors to get the care they \n     need to live longer and healthier lives, increasing access to \n     health insurance is vital to unlocking a healthier country, \n     by ensuring something that millions of Americans do not have \n     today: The opportunity to stay healthy through regular doctor \n     visits rather than seeking help only when they get sick.\n\n  In some cases very sick.\n\n       It is worth remembering: Health care reform is not about \n     special interests. It is about people like us, our families \n     and our neighbors. It is about fellow parishioners and Little \n     League coaches. It is about a neighbor who cuts himself \n     making dinner and a spouse who finds a worrisome lump.\n       Everyone we know and everyone we love--will need our health \n     care system at some point. Three years after America debated \n     the need for health care reform, millions of Americans who \n     work hard, pay taxes, and raise families still cannot afford \n     to see a doctor. That is wrong.\n       And even though the resistance of some states to fully \n     adopt the Affordable Care Act will tragically still leave \n     some families in those states in the lurch, we now at long \n     last have the unprecedented opportunity to create a system \n     that will work better for us all.\n       We should also remember: Over time, the Affordable Care Act \n     promises to improve the system as much for the shrinking \n     majority of Americans who have health insurance as for those \n     who do not.\n       Access is just the first step. The act provides a blueprint \n     for a new model of care, one that rewards doctors for more \n     coordinated care. Here at Christiana Care [and throughout \n     Delaware] we have seen what happens when we provide that kind \n     of care through reengineered medical practices, known as \n     ``medical homes,'' where doctors are enabled to not only \n     efficiently meet patients' needs but to anticipate them as \n     well.\n       This coordinated approach makes getting care simpler and \n     makes the lives of those getting care easier. It makes \n     quality better; and, by making care simpler, better, and more \n     accessible, it saves money.\n       No law as big or ambitious as the ACA can possibly get it \n     all right on the first try. But let us not forget: When \n     Medicare was signed into law, critics warned seniors would \n     languish in long lines, and that we would all long for the \n     good old days before reform took place.\n       Today, Medicare has helped hundreds of millions of \n     Americans live longer, healthier lives--while reducing the \n     poverty rate among seniors by 75 percent.\n\n  Dr. Laskowski goes on to write:\n\n       I believe if these historic changes are given a chance, we \n     will collectively create a system that is defined not by \n     volume, but by value. Over the next several years, I know we \n     can make health care in America more ``people focused'' and \n     less transactional by realizing the best way to provide \n     better outcomes at lower cost is by partnering with patients.\n       As we in health care listen to our patients, we will learn \n     what our patients truly value. Then we will be able to free \n     up resources to help patients get healthy faster and stay \n     well.\n       The Affordable Care Act is a map toward that future. \n     History is being made.\n\n  I will close by saying: While many of our colleagues argue that the \nAffordable Care Act will lead to rising insurance costs and lost jobs, \nthe truth is that in Delaware and throughout the rest of the country, \nmillions of Americans are already learning they will be able to find \nquality health care, insurance plans for a more affordable price.\n  In Delaware and much of the country, millions of Americans will be \nable to find quality insurance plans for less than $100 a month. I have \ntold my constituents and my colleagues since this debate over health \ncare reform began, this law is not written in stone. We want to make \nthe law better wherever we can, just as we have made the Medicare \nprescription drug program better, which was largely supported by \nRepublicans. But we actually made it better in the Affordable Care Act.\n  I would urge my Republican colleagues to enable us to reopen our \ngovernment, to reassure Americans and our creditors in this country and \naround the world that we will honor our debts. Then let's get to work \nright away to improve the Affordable Care Act and these insurance \nmarketplaces and come to a consensus on a bipartisan budget resolution \nthat lays out a spending plan that will get us from where we are to \nwhere we need to be.\n  Last word. I spent some time in the Navy, and the Presiding Officer \nspent some time in the military. One of the Presiding Officer's sons \nmay be on Active Duty today. Some of the time we used to fly in and out \nof Japan in Navy P-3 airplanes.\n  I learned not long ago that in Japan they spend about 8 percent of \nGDP for health care. In this country, we spend about 17 or 18 percent. \nThink about that. They spend 8 percent of GDP for health care. We spend \n17 or 18 percent. They get better results. For the most part they have \nlower rates of infant mortality and higher rates of life expectancy \nthan we do.\n  The other thing is they cover everybody. Tonight when folks go to bed \nin this country, this evening some 40 million will go to bed without \nhealth care coverage. The Japanese, smart as they are, cannot be that \nsmart. We cannot be that dumb. We cannot be that dumb.\n  There are ways to get better results for less money, including in the \nprovision of health care. We can work together. If we work together, we \ncan make that a reality.\n  The last thing I will say is I think the Presiding Officer has heard \nme tell how I love to ask people who have been married a long time what \nthe secret is for being married 40, 50, 60, 70 years. People give me \nvery funny answers. Some are actually hysterical. But every now and \nthen some of them are serious, almost poignant. And I will close with \none of them tonight.\n\n  A couple of years ago I met a couple who had been married over 50 \nyears.\n  I said to them: What is the secret for being married 55 years?\n  They said: The two Cs.\n  The two Cs.\n  I said: What is that?\n  They said: Communicate and compromise.\n  Think about that. Communicate and compromise. I said: That is pretty \ngood advice.\n  I got to thinking about it later, and I thought that is also some \npretty good advice and maybe the secret for a vibrant democracy--to \ncommunicate and to compromise. We think we were willing to compromise \non the short-term spending resolution that is the continuing resolution \nby agreeing to the numbers set by the Republican House leaders. They do \nnot regard that as a compromise, but I think it was an attempt to \ncompromise.\n  We need to find compromises in a conference on the budget resolution. \nThat is where we should put our money, that is where we should put our \nefforts in the weeks to come.\n  I would add one more C. Communicate and compromise, as important as \nthey are, maybe a third C would be collaborate. That would be a good \none to add. So three Cs: Communicate, compromise and collaborate. It is \nwhat the American people sent us here to do.\n  I know the Presiding Officer feels that way, and so do I, as does Dr. \nCoburn. There are a bunch of us who feel that way. So let's do that.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, pending before the Senate is a unanimous \nconsent request on H. Con. Res. 58, a bill to urge the Department of \nDefense to allow military chaplains to perform duties during the \nshutdown.\n  Earlier today, I objected to this bill because I misunderstood its \npurpose, and I would like to withdraw that objection at this time.\n  The bill will urge the Department of Defense to allow military \nchaplains, including contract personnel, to perform religious services \nduring the shutdown and permit services to take place on property owned \nby the Department of Defense.\n  Today, just as the Department of Defense and the administration \nsolved the\n\n[[Page S7352]]\n\nproblem with military families and their death benefits upon the loss \nof one of their loved ones serving our country, I urge, and I know \nothers will as well, the DOD to ensure that all active-duty members are \nable to exercise their First Amendment rights and participate in \nreligious ceremonies while they are serving. So that is something I \nhope we can resolve.\n  I also want to raise some issues that relate to the shutdown. I \nraised some earlier, but these are additional concerns I have with \nregard to the shutdown.\n  The impact of this shutdown is being felt across the board, across \nthe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and, indeed, across the country. It \nis felt by small businesses, States and municipalities are feeling it \nalready and anticipating much more of an impact as time goes by, and, \nof course, families are feeling it very acutely. Yesterday I sent a \nletter to Speaker Boehner emphasizing the detrimental impact the \nshutdown was having on my constituents in Pennsylvania.\n  Just by way of a couple of examples that apply to Pennsylvania and to \nthe Nation, domestic violence programs across the country have been \nimpacted directly by the shutdown. The offices that oversee grants \nunder the Violence Against Women Act have had to shut down and are not \nable to issue grants or provide reimbursements to local programs.\n  I would say parenthetically that it took many months for the Violence \nAgainst Women Act reauthorization to go forward. There were a lot of \nproblems along the way, a lot of objections. Fortunately, we have the \nprogram reauthorized, but now, because of the shutdown, we are having \nproblems with women who are victims of violence getting the services \nthey are entitled to.\n  We are hearing as well from folks in our domestic violence shelters--\nshelters that rely upon Federal funds and that have already been \nimpacted by the sequester--the across-the-board indiscriminate cuts \nthat have been in effect since March. These shelters may have to \nfurther reduce services to vulnerable victims of domestic violence.\n  In the words of one State advocate: We are hanging on by our \nfingernails.\n  Meaning they are hanging on in terms of just being able to provide \nservices, with funding either limited or funding being jeopardized.\n  Women trying to escape abusive relationships should not be hampered \nby the failures here in Washington to end this shutdown.\n  In terms of Social Security, we know Social Security checks are going \nout, fortunately, but in Pennsylvania, on average, 2,900 new claims are \nprocessed each week. That is the typical weekly total for new claims. \nThis means Pennsylvanians who have reached retirement age and have paid \ninto the system their entire careers are now forced to wait for \nbenefits.\n  You have to ask yourself: Why should a domestic violence center, with \npeople who work to help domestic violence victims, have to wait for a \npolitical dispute where one wing of one party engaged in an ideological \nexercise allows a government shutdown, and, therefore, that domestic \nviolence center doesn't get the help it needs, and the women, mostly \nwomen who are impacted, don't get the help they need.\n  The same could be said of someone who reaches retirement age and \nexpects, and has a right to expect, their Social Security eligibility \nwill be processed. Why should they have to wait for Washington?\n  In Pennsylvania alone, when it comes to small businesses, 30 loans, \non average, are made each week by the SBA, for a total of $13 million \neach and every week. The loss of these loans is hindering entrepreneurs \nfrom growing their businesses and from obtaining much-needed capital. \nAgain, why should a business owner--a small businessperson who gets \nhelp from the SBA and has an expectation of getting that help--and, \nremember, we average 30 of those loans every week in Pennsylvania \namounting to $13 million--why should that all be stopped because \nsomeone in Washington has an ideological point to make? It makes no \nsense, and it is an outrage.\n\n  The shutdown is also impacting infrastructure in public lands across \nthe country. Until the government is open, the maintenance of our \nNation's basic infrastructure is impacted. In Pennsylvania, a lot of \nthat basic infrastructure involves our waterways--the locks and dams. \nThat whole system which is in place for Pennsylvania and many other \nStates, the maintenance of those locks and dams, is deferred. We all \nknow what happens when you defer maintenance on something as \nfundamental as infrastructure.\n  I have been informed that repairs that were scheduled to take place \non locks along the Lower Monongahela River in western Pennsylvania are \nsuspended. If you have a problem with those, with a lock--and locks and \ndams generally, but in particular focusing on the Monongahela River--\nyou stop the flow of commerce or you slow it down substantially. When \nyou slow down or stop the flow of commerce, that affects jobs and the \neconomy of southwestern Pennsylvania. If just one of these locks were \nto fail, it could have a detrimental economic impact on the whole \nregion.\n  How about national parks? We have heard a lot about that topic this \nweek and last week. The closure of national parks is negatively \nimpacting Pennsylvania's economy. According to the National Park \nService, the communities and businesses surrounding Pennsylvania's \nnational parks and memorials are losing up to $5.7 million in spending \nby nonlocal visitors for each week the government remains closed. That \nis just national parks and just in Pennsylvania--almost $6 million--and \nthat is just the beginning of what could be a much more substantial and \ndetrimental impact to the State's economy.\n  I would go back to the point I made several times--and all of us have \nmade these arguments in different ways--and that is that we know for \nsure there is a very simple way out of this predicament for Washington \nbut, more importantly, for the country, and that is for the Speaker to \nput on the floor a bill which both parties now agree will pass. It is a \nclean funding bill. All it does is fund the operations of the \ngovernment, albeit at a much lower level--$70 billion less--than our \nside wanted.\n  We compromised greatly at the beginning of this process, despite what \nsome have said. So we have compromised to make sure we can fund the \ngovernment. It is about time for the Speaker to put this bill on the \nfloor. They can vote on it very quickly, and it would pass very \nquickly. It is only 16 pages long. And that is the key to resolving and \nending this tea party shutdown.\n  I urge the Speaker to do that. I have urged him, as we all have in \nvarious ways, and we respectfully suggest that could happen tomorrow. \nThursday would be a good day to end all of this so we can get people \nback to work, we can have the functions of government operating to such \nan extent the economy can grow, and we can have a lot of debate and \ndiscussion about how to fund the government long term or what to do \nabout our fiscal challenges--what to do about a whole range of issues. \nBut it is time for the government to open, and it is time for the House \nto act to do that.\n  It is also time to make sure we pay our bills.\n  Thirdly, it is important we continue to negotiate, just as we \nnegotiated a long time ago, many weeks ago, to reach the point where we \ncan have a bill that would fund the operations of the government.\n  Some people in the House chose to take a different path which led to \nthe shutdown. It is about time we get them back on the right path, \nwhich is to open the government, pay our bills, and then have \nnegotiations and discussions and compromises to move the country \nforward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/09/senate-section/article/S7352-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7352-S7353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DEATH GRATUITY PAYMENTS\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, today I wish to express my deep \ndisappointment at our failure to adequately provide for our fallen \nheroes and their families.\n  Once again, we learn that we have suffered recent casualties. And \nsince the government shut down last week, the Department of Defense has \nbeen unable to guarantee full benefits and honors to those servicemen \nand women who have been killed in the defense of our Nation.\n  Among those who have given their lives in service of our Nation in \nrecent days are two Army Rangers assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 75th \nRanger Regiment, headquartered at Fort Benning in my home state of \nGeorgia.\n\n[[Page S7353]]\n\n  These elite soldiers were serving on the front lines in Afghanistan, \nfighting for democracy and our American way of life when they made the \nultimate sacrifice.\n  I have since been informed that the Department of Defense believes it \nlacks the authority to make automatic Death Gratuity Payments, to \ntransport the next of kin to Dover Air Force Base so they can receive \ntheir fallen warrior, and to provide funeral allowances for the \nappropriate military honors.\n  This is simply unacceptable, and it is incumbent upon us to fix this.\n  It has been my great privilege to visit Fort Benning and meet with \nthe members of the 75th Ranger Regiment over the years.\n  They live by the motto that ``Rangers Lead The Way,'' and they serve \nour country regardless of Federal funding, domestic politics, or \ngovernment shutdowns.\n  That is exactly what these brave individuals did in Afghanistan, and \nunfortunately it is our lack of leadership in Washington that has \ncreated undue hardship and stress for their loved ones in their \ntoughest time of need.\n  I understand that our colleagues in the House of Representatives are \nexpediting legislation to provide explicit authorization to the \nDepartment of Defense to correct this oversight.\n  The Senate must act immediately on receipt of that legislation.\n  We owe this much to these brave men and women, their families, and \nthe thousands of military members who continue to serve in harm's way.\n  I regret that the President has not taken this issue seriously enough \nto take action on his own to resolve this problem.\n  I remain confident that the Senate will take proper actions, and I \nlook forward to passing this legislation as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/09/senate-section/article/S7353-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/09/senate-section/article/S7353-2", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/09/senate-section/article/S7353-3", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:32 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \npassed the following joint resolutions, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.J.
