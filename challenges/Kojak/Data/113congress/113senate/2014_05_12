Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 332, H.R. \n3474.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 332, H.R. 3474, to amend \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow employers to \n     exempt employees with health coverage under TRICARE or the \n     Veterans Administration from being taken into account for \n     purposes of the employer mandate under the Patient Protection \n     and Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, the Senate will be in morning business until 5:30 \np.m. today. Last week cloture was filed on S. 2262, the Energy Savings \nand Industrial Competitiveness Act. As a result, the filing deadline \nfor all second degree amendments is 4:30 p.m. today. There will be up \nto three rollcall votes at 5:30 p.m. today: confirmation of the \nRosenbaum nomination to be an Eleventh Circuit judge, then confirmation \nof the Croley nomination to be General Counsel of the Department of \nEnergy, and, finally, a cloture vote on S. 2262, the energy efficiency \nbill.\n\n\n                          A Second Opportunity\n\n  Mr. President, Henry Ford once said: ``Failure is simply the \nopportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently.'' Those are \nwise words from a man who knew a thing or two about overcoming logjams.\n  The legislation before us today is an opportunity for Senators to \nintelligently reconsider energy efficiency. The consequences of this \nopportunity loom very large for this body.\n  Shaheen-Portman is a good bill. It was a good bill last year when it \nwas blocked by the Republicans. It is even better now. This legislation \nwill give our country more energy independence and protect our \nenvironment. The Shaheen-Portman bill also gives Americans a fair shot \nat better providing for their families through increased savings on \ntheir energy bills. This is great for working Americans. It also \ncreates 200,000 jobs.\n  Senators Shaheen and Portman worked hard with Democrats and \nRepublicans since this bill was introduced 3 years ago to make this \nlegislation into the effective bipartisan bill it is today.\n  No single bill will solve all of our energy problems, but this is a \ngood first step.\n  The business community agrees. This bill is supported by the Chamber \nof Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the \nBusiness Roundtable.\n  The Shaheen-Portman legislation is an opportunity for this country to \naddress our energy needs on how they are affecting the environment. But \nthe implications of this legislation extend far beyond energy \nefficiency. It goes to the integrity of this Senate we care so much \nabout.\n\n[[Page S2890]]\n\n  The Shaheen-Portman bill is a chance for a fresh start for the \nSenate--really a new beginning. We had been making some limited \nprogress this year in moving legislation, starting with the Murray-Ryan \nbudget arrangement. Then we worked together--Democrats and \nRepublicans--to pass a childcare development block grant, a flood \ninsurance bill, and an extension of unemployment benefits.\n  But as we considered legislation to help American families--like \nequal pay and a minimum wage increase--Republicans got off track, and \nworking families did not get a fair shot.\n  So here we are, once again, confronted with the possibility that a \ngood bipartisan bill may fail. And for what? Democrats have acted in \ngood faith, and we have bent over backwards to make this bill work. But \nit seems our efforts are never enough. Each concession we make brings \nnew demands.\n  The Republicans working with Senators Shaheen and Portman asked for \nchanges to this bill, and 10 bipartisan amendments are now included in \nthe bill before this body.\n  Republicans asked for a sense of the Senate resolution on the \nKeystone legislation, and we agreed.\n  Republicans changed their minds and requested a vote on stand-alone \nKeystone legislation, and we agreed.\n  If Republicans stop their filibuster of this bill and allow it to \nproceed, the Senate will vote on Keystone pipeline legislation, and \nthey know that. That is what they have asked for, and we have given it \nto them.\n  But, Mr. President, they have held this bill hostage--this energy \nefficiency bill--as demand after demand has been met, but even now they \nare still seeking a ransom.\n  So why are we here? Why is this bill at risk? I have spoken from time \nto time recently with my Republican colleagues. They come to me, \nsaying: Harry, how could we get the Senate back on track?\n  I appreciate their sincerity in trying to find a solution, but the \nanswer is right under their nose. I say to them, look at what is \nhappening right now.\n  Mr. President, I have been told that two cosponsors of this \nlegislation will not vote to invoke cloture. These are two gentleman \nwho put their name on this bill.\n  Look at how Republican obstruction is bringing the Senate to its \nknees again and again and again--and now even on this bill, a \nbipartisan bill. This is not a Shaheen bill. It is a Shaheen-Portman \nbill--a New Hampshire Senator and an Ohio Senator, a Democrat and a \nRepublican.\n  I repeat, this bill is being filibustered, obviously, by some of its \nown cosponsors. This useless, mind-boggling obstruction is what \ncontinually grinds the wheels of the Senate to a screeching halt.\n  So to my friends who want to know how we can make things work better \nin the Senate, I say: Put an end to obstruction for obstruction's sake. \nTake yes for an answer. We have a good bipartisan bill. Let's pass it. \nIt is good for the country. Stop filibustering this good bill.\n  We made an agreement on Keystone, and Democrats stand willing to \nhonor our commitment. But we need Republicans to honor their \ncommitments.\n  So let's use this second opportunity at passing this important bill--\nShaheen-Portman--to get the Senate working effectively and give working \nfamilies, American families a fair shot at affordable energy.\n\n\n                       Reservation Of Leader Time\n\n  Would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine).

Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on Indian \nAffairs, I rise in support of the nomination of three distinguished \nNative American leaders: Vince Logan, Keith Harper, and Diane Humetewa. \nThese individuals have been nominated to positions that are crucial to \nIndian Country and to our Nation. It is our responsibility to make sure \nthey can begin this challenging work.\n  I think it is fair to say that no one in this Chamber is happy about \nhow the nominations have been handled in the last 2 years. There are \nreasons and frustrations on both sides of the aisle about the process. \nI understand that. But in the case of these nominees, it is long past \ntime to act. By acting on those nominees, this Congress, which has been \ncriticized for not doing very much, can make a little bit of history.\n  Vince Logan's nomination was first sent to the Senate in September of \n2012. He is a member of the Osage Nation of Oklahoma and was nominated \nto be Special Trustee for American Indians at the Department of \nInterior. This vote is long overdue. The position has been vacant for 5 \nyears.\n  The Special Trustee is charged with overseeing the Department's \nfulfillment of its trust responsibilities to tribes and individual \nIndians. It is a difficult job, and I am confident Mr. Logan is the \nright man to do it. He is a litigator with vast experience in both \npublic and private sectors. He has also shown great passion for working \nwith tribes and individual Indians to manage their trust assets. Mr. \nLogan was unanimously approved by the Indian Affairs Committee in \nJanuary. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to do the same.\n  I would also like to speak in support of Keith Harper, a member of \nthe Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma. Mr. Harper is the President's nominee \nto be the U.S. representative to the United Nations Human Rights \nCouncil. His nomination has been pending since early February. This is \na history-making nomination. If confirmed, Mr. Harper would be the \nfirst member of a federally recognized tribe to hold the rank of U.S. \nAmbassador.\n  Keith has outstanding academic and professional credentials, having \nspent many years representing Indian tribes across the country. Keith's \nnomination was first sent here in June of 2013. What message do we send \nto Indian Country and to the world when we allow endless delay of the \nnomination of a man who will be the first Native American to hold the \ntitle of Ambassador?\n  Mr. Harper's nomination has the strong support of the National \nCongress of American Indians and numerous tribes and tribal leaders \nthroughout Indian Country. He has also been active in human and civil \nrights organizations and has served as a delegate to the 2001 World \nConference Against Racism in Durbin, South Africa.\n  All of these experiences have prepared him to tackle injustice at the \nglobal level. It is also important to confirm this position to ensure \nthat the United States has a representative at the United Nations World \nConference on Indigenous Peoples in September.\n  Finally, Diane Humetewa was nominated to serve as district court \njudge for the District of Arizona, with the strong support of her home \nState Senators, McCain and Flake. Her nomination was reported favorably \n3 months ago by the Judiciary Committee, though her nomination has been \npending since September of 2013. She is a member of the Hopi Tribe of \nArizona. That means, if confirmed, she would be the only Native \nAmerican serving as a Federal judge. She would be the first Native \nAmerican woman to ever serve on the Federal bench.\n  Confirming these nominees during a time of such partisanship will \nsend a strong signal to Indian Country. Whether it is overseeing our \ntrust responsibilities, representing our Nation to the world, or \ndelivering justice, these nominees will help our government function a \nlittle bit better and more efficiently.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in swiftly confirming these three \noutstanding nominees.\n\n[[Page S2891]]\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Energy \nSavings and Industrial Competitiveness Act of 2014. I commend Senator \nShaheen and Senator Portman on their leadership and tireless efforts to \ncraft an energy efficiency bill that is good for consumers, good for \nour economy, and good for our environment.\n  The Shaheen-Portman energy efficiency bill is supported by a \ncoalition of environmental organizations, including the Natural \nResources Defense Council, the Sierra Club, and the BlueGreen Alliance. \nIt is also supported by business trade associations such as the chamber \nof commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers. By working \ntogether on a bipartisan basis, the two Senators have put together a \nbill that is officially sponsored by seven Democrats and seven \nRepublicans and I believe the vast majority of the people in this \nChamber.\n  Although this bill is not a substitute for comprehensive energy or \nclimate legislation, it is the right effort to put us on more secure \nenergy footing and strengthen our economy. I have always argued that at \na time when we have been having a hard time working on comprehensive \nenergy legislation--something which I believe we should do and which \nwould be very good for our economy--we need to get behind efforts such \nas this one. I am so pleased this has finally happened; however, I am \nnot certain we will be able to get it done this week.\n  I believe the beneficial role energy efficiency improvements can have \nfor consumers and also our economic competitiveness often gets \noverlooked in today's debate. The Shaheen-Portman bill creates new \nincentives to install energy-efficient technologies in homes, \nbusinesses, and manufacturing facilities that can quickly pay for \nthemselves. The savings for consumers alone are astounding. According \nto a new study, Shaheen-Portman is estimated to save consumers $16 \nbillion a year by 2030. Making these improvements will not only save \nconsumers and businesses money, it will also create more than 190,000 \njobs.\n  America has always been a country that benefits from the development \nof innovative technologies, but this bill recognizes that we don't need \nto reinvent the wheel or rely on a new space race to move our economy \nforward. This bill will lead to the installation of energy-efficient \ntechnologies that are commercially available today and can quickly pay \nfor themselves through energy savings.\n  The bill doesn't just work with individuals in the private sector on \na voluntary basis to encourage energy efficiency, the bill also helps \nthe government become more efficient. Some people might question why \nthe government should try to make energy efficiency improvements when \nthere are so many demands for Federal resources. I believe we can't \nafford to needlessly waste energy and taxpayer resources on older \nheaters, inefficient lighting, and drafty buildings. Making commonsense \nimprovements to our Federal buildings will pay dividends for years to \ncome.\n  The Shaheen-Portman bill includes a number of commonsense provisions \nthat will help keep energy affordable. I wish to briefly focus on one \nexample which may not sound important at first blush but which has a \nbig impact on the Minnesota Rural Electric Association and the \nconsumers it serves in my State.\n  The rural electric co-ops strongly support a provision in the \nShaheen-Portman bill that my friend and colleague from North Dakota, \nSenator Hoeven, introduced and that I am helping to lead, and that is \nto change the Department of Energy rule to ensure that large-capacity \nhot water heaters that are part of a demand response program can \ncontinue to be manufactured.\n  The rural electric co-ops in my State have installed thousands of \nlarge-capacity hot water heaters in people's basements. Heating water \nis a major source of energy consumption, and our co-ops have found a \nway to provide an important service in a way that incentivizes wind \nenergy development and saves consumers money. These hot water heaters \nare only turned on at night, when the wind blows the strongest and the \ndemand for energy is the lowest. Then in the morning, when people wake \nup and turn on their lights, the heaters are already off. The wind \nenergy is stored in the form of hot water that can be used throughout \nthe day.\n  This provision in the Shaheen-Portman bill will provide regulatory \ncertainty that these heaters will continue to be available.\n  Another provision I worked on with Senator Hoeven was to find new \nopportunities to engage the nonprofit community in making energy \nefficiency improvements. We have an amendment that would help \nnonprofits--including hospitals, schools, faith-based organizations, \nand youth centers--make energy efficiency improvements that will help \nthem save money and ultimately serve our people.\n  Our amendment, which is fully offset, has the support of Senators \nBlunt, Pryor, Stabenow, and Mikulski.\n  The amendment would provide $10 million each year for the next 5 \nyears to create a pilot grant program so that nonprofits can save \nthrough energy efficiency. We work with stakeholders to ensure that \ngrants will achieve significant amounts of energy savings and are done \nin a cost-effective manner. The grants would require a 50-percent match \nso that there is complete buy-in from the nonprofits, and grants would \nbe capped at $200,000.\n  Our amendment has the support of the National Council of Churches, \nthe YMCA of the USA, and the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations, to \nname a few.\n  This provision was one of the many good ideas--many of them \nbipartisan--that promote energy efficiency and that we believe will be \nincluded in the bill once it is finally voted on.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, the Nonprofit Energy \nEfficiency Act, and also support the underlying bill. The bill, as we \nhave discussed, would save consumers and taxpayers money, reduce energy \nconsumption, help create jobs, and make our country more energy \nindependent.\n  Another issue that can drive up the price of energy for consumers is \nmetal, and this is the final issue I wish to talk about because I have \nattempted to get this bill on several other bills. I was able to pass \nit through the Judiciary Committee. It is a bill that is cosponsored by \nSenator Graham, and Senator Graham and I are leading the bill. Senator \nHoeven and Senator Schumer are also cosponsors of this bill, as well as \nSenator Coons.\n  We have been working very hard on the issue of metal theft for years. \nIt has broad support because it has struck so many electric companies \nand so many consumers. Houses have blown up when people take simple \ncopper piping out of the basement and then someone turns on the gas. \nLiterally, people have lost their lives. We had one incident in \nMinnesota, and we have seen others across the country. This is \nunbelievable, but the stars that were placed on the graves of veterans \nduring veterans holidays have been stolen. The beer industry is \nstrongly behind this bill. Why? Because kegs are being stolen all over \nthe country.\n  Those are just things I am recalling by memory. But this is a major \nproblem. Ask any power company or construction crew across the country \nor even operators of ice skating rinks in Minnesota, where one theft of \na couple thousand dollars' worth literally costs the city of St. Paul \nmillions of dollars because once they take a pipe out, they have to \nrebuild the entire system. Talk to any of these people and quickly \nlearn about the growing problem of metal theft.\n  My bipartisan bill--the Metal Theft Prevention Act--has been filed as \nan amendment to the energy efficiency bill to bring attention to this \nimportant issue. The amendment is the much needed Federal response to \nthe increasingly pervasive and damaging problem of metal theft.\n  Metal theft has jumped more than 80 percent in recent years, hurting \nbusinesses and threatening public safety. It\n\n[[Page S2892]]\n\nis a major threat, especially to power companies.\n  In a recent study, the Department of Energy found that the total \nvalue of damages to industries affected by theft of copper wire alone \nis approximately $1 billion every single year. I have visited small \nelectric companies in the rural areas that have been stolen from--not \nonce, not twice, but three times. I have visited companies that have \nhad their trucks stolen and then the thieves go out in the trucks and \nsteal wire because people let them in because they have the electric \ncompany's truck. They have targeted construction sites, power and phone \nlines, retail stores, and vacant houses. They have caused explosions in \nvacant buildings by stealing metal from gas lines, and they have caused \nblackouts by stealing copper wiring from street lights and electrical \nsubstations. Last October four people were injured in an explosion at a \nUniversity of California Berkeley electrical station. Officials blamed \nit on copper theft that occurred 2 hours before the explosion. As the \nelectrical workers tried to fix it, the explosion occurred. As I \nmentioned, they are taking brass stars from our veterans' graves. This \nhappened on Memorial Day of 2012. In another case that shows just how \ndangerous metal theft can be, Georgia Power was having a huge problem \nwith thieves targeting a substation that feeds the entire Atlanta \nHartsfield International Airport, one of the busiest airports in the \nworld. The airport was getting hit two to three times a week and \nsurveillance didn't lead to any arrests.\n\n  This rise in incidents of metal theft across the country, the growing \ncost to businesses, and the danger it poses underscores the critical \nneed for Federal action. What does our bill do? It helps combat this by \nrequiring modest recordkeeping by recyclers of scrap metal, just \nkeeping track of who is selling the metal. It requires limiting the \nvalue of cash transactions. This simply means they can take it in for \n$100 bucks, but after that they have to require a check. We have many \nStates that are doing this but not enough. So what we are finding is \npeople are stealing metals in Minnesota where we have a $100 cash \nrequirement and then they are selling it in another State so they \ncannot be tracked.\n  The amendment also makes it a Federal crime to steal metal from \ncritical infrastructure and directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to \nreview relevant penalties. The Metal Theft Prevention Act has been \nendorsed by the National Rural Electric Cooperate, the American Public \nPower Association, American Supply, Edison Electric Institute, National \nElectrical Contractors Association, National Association of Home \nBuilders, National Retail Federation, U.S. Telecom Association, and \nabout a dozen other businesses and organizations. It has the support of \nthe Major Cities Chiefs of Police Association, the Major County \nSheriffs' Association, the National Sheriffs' Association, the \nFraternal Order of Police, and the National Association of Police \nOrganizations.\n  I ask my friends who represent the scrap metal dealers to look at \nthis coalition and to ask yourself: Is this worth it, over a $100 \nrequirement for writing a check? Is it worth it to oppose this when \nbuildings are blowing up and critical infrastructure is being broken \ninto and one of the busiest airports in the country is having problems? \nIs it worth it to oppose a bill that has strong bipartisan support? I \ndon't think it is. I think the interests of the consumers of this \ncountry, the interests of businesses in this country, and the interests \nof law enforcement should trump, and that is what should matter in this \nChamber. So I hope my colleagues will look at this again and look at \nthe bare minimum this legislation sets. It does not create that much of \na burden, when all these companies that buy this scrap metal, much of \nwhich is stolen--a number of these things are stolen. A lot of these \npeople are good. They know it doesn't matter. They are doing it in some \nof the States. All they are doing is keeping records and requiring a \ncheck when it is over $100. That is all we are talking about.\n  If we balance $1 billion in theft a year against a simple requirement \nof recordkeeping, I think it is pretty clear. I hope my colleagues will \nlook at it this way, and I know their chiefs and sheriffs will tell \nthem this must be a priority. We need to do everything we can to \nprotect our critical industry infrastructure from unscrupulous metal \nthieves. I hope my colleagues support this bill when it comes up for a \nvote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/12/senate-section/article/S2892-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2892-S2893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DOMESTIC VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. MURPHY.

I hope Senator \nKlobuchar had a great Mother's Day and got a phone call from her \ndaughter in Connecticut.\n  I am here to tell the story of three pretty heroic mothers who are \nrepresentative of far too many with similar stories across the country. \nI wish to tell you very quickly this afternoon about Gwen Cox Salley, \nLori Gellatly, and Marianne O'Shields. All three of them are no longer \nwith us. They are amongst the 31,672 victims of gun violence every \nyear, 2,639 deaths a month, and 86 people a day who are killed by guns \nall across this country. I wish to try to lend a voice to a few of \nthese victims tonight, mothers who were killed by their intimate \npartners, by their spouses, in an act of domestic violence that frankly \ncould have been prevented if not for the law of this land.\n  First, the story of Gwen Cox Salley. Gwen was killed 2 days after she \nfinally took out a restraining order against her husband. She had a \nlong history of abuse with her husband Michael Scott Salley. Most \nrecently he had come to her house the day before she took out this \nrestraining order and threatened to kill her and their 7-year-old \ndaughter. He tried to get access to his gun that was on the property, \nbut she was able to hide it and then very quietly texted a couple of \nher friends that she was in trouble. The police came, and before \nviolence erupted they were able to arrest him. She took out a \nrestraining order, but the next day he came back with a gun, went to \nthe local daycare parking lot where Gwen was picking up her 7-year-old \ndaughter, took control of the car, sped off to apparently kill them \nboth, but luckily Gwen was able to push her 7-year-old daughter out of \nthe car so her daughter could be rescued and taken in by the daycare \ncenter's employees, but an hour or so later Gwen Salley was dead.\n  She did everything she was supposed to do. She finally left this man \nwho had been so abusive over the years. After he threatened to kill \nthem both, the cops were called and she took out a restraining order, \nbut because the law of Louisiana at the time didn't allow for police to \ncome and take his gun--in fact, the law allowed him, as the Federal law \nallows now, to go out and even purchase a gun during that time, and 1 \nday later Gwen Cox Salley was dead.\n  The gun industry wants to make us believe that our greatest fear \ncomes from gun-wielding strangers who are going to break into our house \nat night and murder us, but the fact is women across this country are \nthree times more likely to be killed by a gun by their husbands or \ntheir intimate partner than they are to be killed by anybody else with \nany other kind of weapon. That is the reality. For women who live in \nhomes with a firearm, they are 500 percent more likely to be the victim \nof homicide through domestic violence than in houses without firearms. \nThe statistics don't look good for women across this country and in \npart because our laws are so weak, even in a State such as Connecticut.\n  This is the story of Lori Gellatly, who was killed just a few days \nago in Oxford, CT. She had taken out a restraining order against her \nhusband Scott. They had twins, but things had gone wrong. She wrote in \nthe application about one incident that ``Scott had yelled in my face . \n. . and got very angry. I felt threatened. He then told me I wasn't \ngoing anywhere and grabbed my right thumb and twisted my wrist . . .'' \nwhile the two children were in her arms. ``He acts out very violently \nand I am afraid for my kids and myself.''\n  She took out that restraining order and again, almost within moments, \nhe was at the house. She called 911, but when police got there they \nfound Lori Gellatly and her mother Merry Jackson with gunshot wounds. \nLori was pronounced dead at Waterbury Hospital. Again, a restraining \norder taken out\n\n[[Page S2893]]\n\nbut with no ability to take the guns away from her husband or to stop \nhim from buying a gun, she was found dead.\n  The reality is we can do something about it. In fact, some of these \nStates I am talking about are doing something about it themselves. \nLouisiana, which has a reputation as a State with a pretty strong \nhistory of gun ownership, has done something about it. The State \nlegislature has passed a law allowing for a process that someone \nconvicted of a domestic violence crime can have their guns taken away. \nWisconsin has done the same, a State with a similar, pretty robust \nhistory of gun ownership.\n  It just makes sense that if someone has been convicted of a domestic \nviolence crime, if they have a restraining order taken out against them \nbecause they got violent with their spouse, that is the exact time at \nwhich society needs to step in, law enforcement needs to step in and \nseparate those guns from that individual. The statistics back that up. \nIn States, for instance, that have just basic background check \nprotections, women are 38 percent less likely to be killed by guns. \nThese laws matter when it comes to keeping women alive at the hands of \nabusive spouses.\n  Mariann O'Shields died just a couple weeks ago in Spartanburg, SC. \nNot only had she taken out a restraining order against her husband \nRobert O'Shields, but she had gone the extra step to bring her and her \nkids--her daughter to a domestic violence shelter. She was staying in a \nshelter, but her husband tracked her down at the shelter, and just \nafter she had dropped off her child at a bus stop she was killed. The \nstaff at the safe home, if you can imagine, were paralyzed by this \ncrime. The director said:\n\n       My staff and I are totally devastated. It is your worst \n     nightmare when you work with a shelter. I don't think that \n     there is anything we could have done to protect her.\n\n  That is right. There wasn't anything more that domestic violence \nshelter could have done to protect Mariann O'Shields, but there is \nsomething we can do. We have all sorts of disagreements about the \nfuture of gun laws in this country, and I understand in the foreseeable \nfuture we are not likely going to get a bill that expands the sales \nthat are subject to background checks, even though 80 percent of the \nAmerican public thinks we should require people to show they are not a \ncriminal before they can buy a gun.\n  I wish we could get the assault weapons off the street that did the \nkind of damage we saw in Newtown, CT, but in the absence of getting an \nagreement on commonsense alternatives to current law such as bans on \nassault weapons and a greater scope of background checks, at least \nmaybe we can take this specific issue, which is spouses, in particular, \nwomen who have taken out restraining orders against their husbands or \nspouses or boyfriends, maybe we can limit the change we can agree on to \nat least those situations in which women are most vulnerable, after an \nepisode of violence, after a threat, when they have taken out a court-\nordered restraining order, maybe at that moment their spouse shouldn't \nbe able to possess a gun. Maybe at least during those few moments the \nspouse shouldn't be able to go out and buy a gun. Maybe the week after \nMother's Day, in the face of the heroism that women such as Gwen and \nLori and Mariann showed in removing their families and themselves from \nviolent situations, maybe we can at least listen to the voices of these \nhandful of victims of domestic violence crimes and do something in a \ntargeted, limited way that could in the end prevent hundreds of \nunnecessary deaths across this country. I have to believe that in a \nbody of good will we can at least agree on that.\n  That is the reason virtually every week I try to come down to the \nfloor and share with my colleagues some of the voices of the victims, \nthese 31,000 a year, 2,600 a month, 86 a day who are lost to gun \nviolence all across this country. We can do better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/12/senate-section/article/S2893-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2893-S2894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I, along with most Americans, celebrated \nMother's Day yesterday with my wife, my daughter, and my grandchildren, \nto express our appreciation for what mothers all over the world have \ndone in order to help our communities. In America, we have taken action \nto help women in this country. I am referring to the passage of the \nAffordable Care Act, which has helped childbearing women and child \nrearing throughout the child's life, as well as the mother and the \nfamily.\n  Let me give some examples because I think it is good to point out \nwhere we have made progress and to celebrate what we have done to help \nwomen in America. We have taken on the arbitrary practices of private \ninsurance companies that discriminated against women, against pregnant \nwomen, and against mothers. A woman can now choose her own OB/GYN \ndoctor as her primary care doctor, no longer having to wait for \nauthorization or to get a referral in order to have OB/GYN care. Women \nnow have the absolute right to choose their own primary care doctor, \nincluding an OB/GYN.\n  Under the Affordable Care Act, every woman in America is guaranteed \nan annual well-woman visit to be able to assess their health, including \nmammography screening, pap smears, diabetes screening, and other \npreventive screenings services at no cost. That is all provided in the \nAffordable Care Act, so a woman can take care of her own health care \nneeds and, in many cases, avoiding much more costly and debilitating \ncare. Again, this is at no cost. So there is no reason why a woman \ncannot take advantage of these services. HPV DNA testing is now \navailable every 3 years under the Affordable Care Act to deal with the \nsexual health of women. STI counseling and HIV screening for sexually \nactive women are now available under the Affordable Care Act. This is \nnow guaranteed. Women don't have to go look at the fine print of an \ninsurance policy to see whether they have coverage. Before, in most \ncases, they didn't have coverage. Women don't have to wait for \nauthorization, having to show a need. These are given rights that are \nnow available to every woman under the Affordable Care Act.\n  No longer can pregnancy be considered a preexisting condition. Before \nthe passage of the Affordable Care Act, if a woman wanted to get an \ninsurance policy, insurers excluded childbirth during the first perhaps \n9 months or later. It was considered a preexisting condition. Now we \nhave a seamless system, so women can get the type of care they need.\n  Why does that become so important? So they can get the necessary \nprenatal care in order to keep their baby healthy, to get the type of \ntests that are necessary.\n  Pregnant women can now get a gestational diabetes screening to see \nwhether they are at high risk and, if so, they can get the type of \ntreatment they need in order to make sure their baby is born as healthy \nas possible.\n  Prenatal care is available and it is covered, and we now have, \nthrough the Affordable Care Act, a provision we added that provides \nsupport for qualified health centers. I have visited qualified health \ncenters in Maryland that are now providing prenatal care that wasn't \nthere before. It is not only that we are providing coverage; we are \nproviding access to care, so we can reduce low birth weight babies in \nour community. Look at the numbers of infant survival. Look at the \nnumbers of low birth weight babies. We are improving those numbers \ndaily because of the Affordable Care Act. To be able to prevent and \ndiscover complications during pregnancy, including preterm outcomes--\nall of that is now available.\n  Women now have access to folic acid to make sure a woman has a \nhealthier fetus and birth. All of that is now available under the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  We help newborns and their mothers. Breast feeding has been proven to \nbe a very strong part of a healthy infancy and for a baby. There are \ncertain needs a mother has, including having the time to breast feed, \nand the cost of breast feeding, including breast pumps. That is now \ncovered under the Affordable Care Act.\n  We understand the need to keep people healthier, and that is why we \ncall it\n\n[[Page S2894]]\n\na wellness program. No longer is it insurance just to take care of an \nillness or injury; it is to keep people healthy and for women \nparticularly. We didn't do a good job for many years. We are now making \nup for it in the Affordable Care Act, making a huge difference.\n  We are giving peace of mind to women all over this country about \nhaving adequate third-party coverage so they can afford to take care of \ntheir own health and the health of their families.\n  Adult children can remain on parents' insurance policies until age \n26. We have all received so many letters from our constituents saying: \nThank goodness we have that provision. My 24-year-old never thought she \nwould get ill. Now she has this insurance coverage so we can take care \nof her and keep her healthy, and when she needs health care, it is \navailable, thanks to the Affordable Care Act.\n  Today millions of Americans today who didn't have it before, now have \nquality, affordable health insurance as a result of the Affordable Care \nAct. It is peace of mind. They can now carry an insurance card. I got a \nletter from one of my constituents saying how it felt to have an \ninsurance card in her possession, knowing that it worked as a ticket to \ntake care of her health care and the health care of her family.\n  No longer can an insurance company discriminate in ratings against \nwomen--a huge deal. The discriminatory rates were aimed against women, \nand we have eliminated that under the Affordable Care Act.\n  We have eliminated preexisting condition restrictions. I already \ntalked about pregnancy. But it was amazing how women particularly were \ndiscriminated against because of preexisting conditions, where they \ncouldn't get full coverage to take care of all of their needs. That is \nover, including for their children. Many families told us they had a \nchild with asthma and they couldn't get full coverage. Now they can get \nfull coverage, thanks to the Affordable Care Act. They now have peace \nof mind and adequate coverage to take care of their needs.\n  We had the end of the caps on health insurance. No longer do people \nhave to worry: Should I do this or not? Will I hit my annual limit or \nmy lifetime limit?\n  They are gone. If they need insurance, it is there to protect them. \nThat is what insurance should do: Protect families.\n  So we have made a huge difference.\n  I am particularly proud of the prudent layperson provision for \nemergency care. I can't tell my colleagues how many times we had \ncircumstances where people needed to go to the emergency room because \nthey thought they had a true emergency with chest pain and sweating, \nand they would go to the emergency room. The good news was they weren't \nhaving a heart attack. The bad news is they got a bill from their \ninsurance company telling them that because they didn't have a heart \nattack they have to pay this bill. That is over. We have now legislated \nthe prudent layperson standard so it is now right for a person to seek \nurgent care, and the insurance company must cover that visit for urgent \ncare.\n  I could continue to list so many ways we have helped all people in \nthis country but particularly women. It is tough enough to give birth \nto a baby and to raise a child. We have made it easier by taking away \nsome of the burdens regarding our health care system.\n  So this past Sunday, when we celebrated Mother's Day, we could also \npoint to a very tangible accomplishment this Congress has been able to \ndeliver for all of our mothers in this country, and I was proud to be a \npart of making that a reality.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono).

Madam President, shortly we are going to have votes on a \nnumber of judges, and I want to call to the attention of the Senate \nFederal district judge Robin Rosenbaum. She has been nominated by the \nPresident to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Judicial \nCircuit.\n  The two Senators from Florida, Senator Rubio and I, have a proud \ntradition in Florida of bipartisan support for our judicial nominees, \nand Judge Rosenbaum's selection is just another example in that 20-\nsome-year experience in Florida of selecting our judges through a \njudicial nominating commission. In fact, this is the second time \nFlorida's two Senators come together to support Robin Rosenbaum's \nnomination--this time for the circuit court--since we, a couple years \nago, had recommended her to the President, the President chose her, and \nshe has been a Federal district judge in the Southern District of \nFlorida for the last couple of years. The vacancy was created by Judge \nRosemary Barkett, who recently retired from the Eleventh Circuit. Judge \nBarkett was also a very distinguished judge from the State of Florida.\n  We are concerned about the alarming vacancy rate in our judiciary. \nThe Eleventh Circuit is one of the busiest in the country. It has \nmultiple vacancies.\n  Judge Rosenbaum is clearly not controversial. The two Senators are \nsupporting her nomination. She received the ABA's highest rating--\nunanimously ``well qualified''--and she has been approved, obviously, \nby the Senate Judiciary Committee. She is going to make a fine addition \nto the Eleventh Circuit, and at 5:30 p.m. this afternoon she will be \nthe first judge up for confirmation. I urge my colleagues to confirm \nher nomination.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, like many of my colleagues, I have \nattended and spoken at a number of college and law school graduations \nand commencements.\n  I had the great privilege of speaking to the graduates of Post \nUniversity on Saturday and at the Quinnipiac Law School just \nyesterday--both wonderfully exciting and rewarding days full of \ncelebration and pride, well-justified joy and pride in the great \naccomplishments of these graduates, and more than their past \naccomplishments, their contributions of the future. These young people \nare our future. I spoke to them about the challenges and \nresponsibilities that come with the great privilege of having an \neducation from great colleges and universities, undergraduate and law \nschool, the opportunities for public service, to be a champion of right \nand responsibility, to advocate for people who need their voices and \ntheir advocacy, and the responsibilities and opportunities for public \nservice.\n  Each of them has a great opportunity to give back to our country and \nto use that education to better all of us as well as themselves. Yet \nthey are leaving college and law school burdened with debt that would \nhave been unthinkable and even unimaginable a decade or so ago. The \naverage in Connecticut is $27,000 of debt per graduate from \nundergraduate education today.\n  What I have done over the last 2 days, over the last 2 weeks, over \nthe past month, is really listen to our students at every level--high \nschool as recently as Friday at Bassick High School in Bridgeport, \ncolleges throughout the State of Connecticut--crisscrossing our State \nto talk on campuses, at roundtables, with students who are burdened--\nindeed, financially crippled with debt that would have been unthinkable \nand unimaginable when I was going through the same education. In those \ndays, working to pay for college was possible. Today, the tuition costs \nare so high it is impossible.\n  Listening to students across the State of Connecticut, I have heard \ntheir stories. I have listened to the amounts they owe and the levels \nof interest they have to pay. Each of them,\n\n[[Page S2895]]\n\nby first name--whether it is Buckley at $56,000 or Jerry at $260,000--I \ncould go through them one by one, story by story, voice and face, each \nwith great accomplishment and great potential achievement for the \nfuture, for our Nation. Yet they leave college and law school burdened \nby these debts. These are only a few.\n  I have promised to come here to tell their stories. I will tell their \nstories--not all of them but as many as I can, not all today but as \nmany as I can over the next days and weeks--because each of them simply \nwants a fair shot at American opportunity, at the American dream, at \nthe America all of us thought was possible for all of us when we went \nto school, a fair shot at the American dream and opportunity in the \nworkplace, at home, in our society.\n  I venture to guess that every Senator in this body would agree that \nhigher education offers a path to success for hard-working students. \nThere is nothing controversial or partisan about that notion. An \nopportunity to move more Americans into the middle class is what \neducation does for our Nation. It secures our middle class and enlarges \nand enhances it.\n  So investing in higher education really offers a fair shot to \neveryone seeking to make something of himself or herself to earn a \nhigher standard of living, the professional innovators, business \ncreators, and thinkers whom the system will give us from all kinds of \nbackgrounds all across the country and certainly in Connecticut. So \nwhat we need is to maintain educational success so we can sustain our \nsuccess in the global economy and confront the challenges ahead.\n  Attending college or graduate school or technical school is a great \nopportunity but also a great responsibility. Students understand that \nthey are taking on a significant trust obligation with the \nunderstanding that they will pay it back. None of them goes into these \ndebts lightly, thinking that they can just avoid it. They are well \naware that these debts, by and large, are nondischargeable in \nbankruptcy, unlike most other debts. They are told and they rightly \nexpect that these additional qualifications will enable them to find a \ngood job and go on to a successful life and have a fair shot at the \nAmerican dream. They are willing to work for that success. They are \nwilling to pay back these debts. But too often they are not given or \nafforded the opportunity, realistically, to earn at a level that \nenables them to reach these goals, which leaves them with a financially \ncrippling debt that serves no one.\n  Working people who bear a heavy debt burden have to make tough \nchoices about getting married, buying homes, and having children. \nEntrepreneurs are blocked from starting new businesses. The risk takers \nand job creators of America have to go to other lines of work where \ntheir contribution is derivative, dependent on others rather than \ninventing and innovating and starting new businesses.\n  The risk taking that is the foundation and core of the \nentrepreneurial spirit in America is inhibited--indeed, impeded and \nsometimes crippled by these debts. These consequences are so widely \nunderstood that I hesitate even to take the body's time to recount them \nnow. Yet the U.S. student debt totals $1.2 trillion--much higher than \nit has ever been before.\n  I have listened in roundtables to its personal impact on our citizens \nand their children. I am here to tell their stories--Brittany, for \nexample, who is the first in her family to attend college. She took out \nloans to attend school. She is over $100,000 in debt. Her school does \nnot offer much in financial aid.\n  Alese, a mother of three, went back to school when her children were \nyoung because, she said, she ``wanted to make sure they had an example \nto follow when they finished high school'' and she wanted them to \n``push forward and excel in their lives.'' She wrote to me, ``I knew \nthat when I finished I would have to pay back those debts . . . what I \ndidn't anticipate was that I would still be paying those debts when my \nchildren started going to college.'' She is now $46,000 in debt. Her \nloans carry a 7-percent interest rate.\n  Our economy is still recovering from the greatest recession probably \nin most of our lifetimes. We need people such as Brittany and Alese to \nparticipate, young woman to invest in the future. We need to invest in \nthem. They need to feel secure in their ability to support their \nchildren. But the mountains of debt confronting students and graduates \ntoday are overwhelming.\n  I am proud to be here with my colleagues to support their fair shot--\nall of our fair shot in the future because we live through our \nchildren. They are our future. It is a platitude we repeat so often, \nbut it is true.\n  These interest rates are, first of all, unconscionably and unfairly \nhigh. Many of them are variable so they can continue in their \nunprecedented rise when interest rates begin going up again.\n  The money that comes from increased payments is nothing but profit \nfor the Federal Government. The Federal Government is scheduled to make \nmore than $50 billion in profit on the loans it makes this year. We \nshould see higher education as an investment, not as a revenue \nopportunity. Those students are our future, not a profit center. We \nought to set repayments based on what is in students' and graduates' \nbest interests. It is our best interest as well.\n  I am proud to join my colleague Senator Elizabeth Warren in \nintroducing legislation that would allow borrowers to refinance their \nstudent loans. I am proud to join my colleagues in an effort to enable \nrefinancing of student loans at more affordable rates, just as they do \ncar payments and house payments. We cannot forget about current \ngraduates with existing debt.\n  As much as we want to make available more aid through Pell grants, \nlower interest rates on loans being made now, opportunities to pay down \nthose loans based on public service, more disclosure, and more accurate \ndisclosure through the kinds of measures that Senator Franken has \nintroduced and I have joined him, right now we can take this profoundly \nsignificant step by supporting a measure that enables refinancing of \nstudent loans so that everyone has the benefit of the best, lowest, \nmost affordable interest rate.\n  I believe graduates who pursue public service ought to have the \nopportunity to pay down those debts in ways that are expanded, made \nmore flexible and more accessible to more of these graduates. They are \nnecessary to everyone's health and safety, whether they are teaching or \npolicing or fire fighting or advocating for people who need legal \nassistance or caring for people as doctors in areas where they are \nneeded. Those public service opportunities, as I told the graduates at \nPost University and at the Quinnipiac Law School, ought to be expanded \nand enhanced for them and all of our students around the country today, \nas well as those who graduated in recent years.\n  Let's make sure in the meantime for people who have this grinding, \nfinancial, crippling debt that overhangs them and inhibits economic \ngrowth, it is made more affordable. Let's give them a fair shot at \neconomic opportunity. Let's give all the students who are aspiring now \nin high school, at Bassick or elsewhere, the opportunity to have a fair \nshot.\n  I am going to briefly quote some of what some said to me.\n  ``There is no end in sight.''\n  ``I feel like I will never escape this.''\n  ``I don't own a home. I can't. I just work to pay my loan.''\n  These messages--and I am going to bring them again to the floor--are \nfrom the heart of Connecticut. The Presiding Officer could do the same \nfrom Hawaii. Every Member of this body could come to the floor with \nthese same messages from the students and graduates of America, the \ninnovators and creators, the home builders and family men and women who \nsimply want a fair shot for themselves and their children.\n  One person said: ``If there is anything that can be done for \nstruggling families with student loan debt please help.''\n  Let's help. Let's give them a fair shot.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRUZ.

RES. 225 and S. 1386\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, 8 months ago yesterday I requested \nunanimous consent for S. Res. 225 calling for a joint select committee \nof Congress to investigate the terrorist attack on our facilities in \nBenghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012, which resulted in the murder of \nfour brave Americans: Foreign Service Officer Sean Smith, former Navy \nSEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods, and Ambassador Christopher \nStevens, who was our first Ambassador murdered while serving since \nAdolph Dubs in 1979.\n  At the time my colleague, the junior the Senator from California, \nobjected on the grounds that the administration was trying ``to address \nBenghazi,'' and that President Obama would ``not rest until the \nperpetrators were caught.''\n  Here we are, 8 months later, and the perpetrators still have not been \ncaught, and the confusion about what occurred on September 11, 2012, in \nBenghazi has only gotten worse. In recent weeks, what happened on that \nterrible night has gotten more and more obscure.\n  On April 2 of this year, Mike Morell, the Deputy Director of the CIA \nduring the Benghazi attacks, testified regarding the CIA talking points \nthat he ``took out the word `Islamic' in front of `extremists' '' \nbecause he thought there were other kinds of extremists in Libya and \nthat he did not use the word ``terrorist'' because ``we see extremists \nand terrorists as the same thing.''\n  On April 29 of this year, in response to a FOIA request by Judicial \nWatch, the White House released emails related to Benghazi, including a \nSeptember 14, 2012, email from Deputy National Security Adviser Ben \nRhodes that had as its stated goal ``to underscore that these protests \nare rooted in an Internet video and not in a broader failure of \npolicy.''\n  I would note that is a stated political goal from the White House, in \nwriting, days after the attack--not to get to the truth but to further \nthat political goal.\n  Then, on May 1, 2014, Gen. Robert Lovell, Deputy Director of \nIntelligence of U.S. AFRICOM during the Benghazi attacks, became the \nfirst former military officer to question the administration's \ninsistence that a rescue attempt was not possible, arguing ``the \ndiscussion is not in the `could or could not' in relation to time, \nspace, and capability, the point is we should have tried.''\n  It is hard to disagree with the good general that we should have \ntried to save those four Americans who were murdered that tragic night.\n  We are left once again with persistent questions on Benghazi to which \nwe still don't know the answers. Here are 10:\n  No. 1. Why was the State Department unwilling to provide the \nrequested level of security to Benghazi in the summer of 2012?\n  No. 2. Do President Obama's daily intelligence briefings in the runup \nto September 11, 2012, support the assertion that there was no credible \nthreat of a coordinated terrorist attack on Benghazi during the time, \nand do the daily intelligence briefings following that date support the \nclaim the administration made that the cause was an Internet video? Why \nhasn't the White House declassified and released those briefings, as \nPresident George W. Bush did with his pre-September 11, 2001, \nbriefings?\n  No. 3. Why did we not anticipate the need to have military assets at \nthe ready in the region on the anniversary of September 11--of all \ndates?\n  No. 4. Did President Obama sleep the night of September 11, 2012? Did \nSecretary Clinton? Neither has answered that very simple question: Were \nthey awake or asleep while Americans were under fire? When was \nPresident Obama told about the murder of our Ambassador?\n  No. 5. If the Secretary of Defense thought there was ``no question \nthat this was a coordinated terrorist attack,'' why did Ambassador \nSusan Rice, Secretary Clinton, and President Obama all tell the \nAmerican people that the cause was a spontaneous demonstration about an \nInternet video? None has squarely answered that question.\n  No. 6. Why did former Deputy CIA Director Mike Morell edit the \nintelligence community talking points to delete the references to \nIslamic extremists and Al Qaeda?\n  No. 7. Why did the FBI not release pictures of the militants taken \nthe day of the attack until 8 months after the fact--why not \nimmediately, as proved so effective in the Boston bombing?\n  No. 8. Why was Secretary Clinton not interviewed for the ARB report? \nIf all the relevant questions were answered in the ARB report, as our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle often like to say, why did the \nState Department's own inspector general's office open a probe into the \nmethods of that very report?\n  No. 9. Why have none of the terrorists who attacked in Benghazi been \ncaptured or killed?\n  No. 10. What additional evidence that the White House engaged in a \npartisan political campaign to blame the Benghazi attack on the \nInternet video is contained in the additional emails requested by \nJudicial Watch but withheld by the White House on the grounds that it \nwould put a ``chill'' on internal deliberations?\n  I would suggest to my colleagues that what is truly chilling is that \n20 months after the Benghazi attack, we have four dead Americans and no \ndead terrorists. It is chilling to think our President may have had \nbetter things to do than personally attend to an ongoing terrorist \nattack on our people. It is chilling to imagine that we could have \nmounted a rescue attempt of our own people but that we didn't even \nbother to try. It is chilling to think our Secretary of State would not \ninsist on giving an interview for the ARB report. It is chilling to \nthink we have an administration that is reluctant to utter the words \n``radical Islamic terrorism,'' let alone fight effectively against it. \nIt is chilling to have former administration officials respond to \nquestions in response to Benghazi with, ``Dude, this was like two years \nago.''\n  The clock is ticking. Memories are fading. It is beyond time to get \nthe full resources of both Houses of Congress behind this \ninvestigation. The President should release his daily intelligence \nbriefings in the times surrounding the Benghazi attack, as President \nGeorge W. Bush did concerning 9/11. This body should join with the \nHouse of Representatives, with a joint select committee to get to the \nbottom of what happened. Why didn't we protect Americans? Why didn't we \nstop this attack? Why haven't we captured the terrorists who killed \nfour Americans including our Ambassador?\n  Accordingly, I ask unanimous consent that the rules and \nadministration committee be discharged from further consideration and \nthe Senate now proceed to S. Res. 225. I further ask unanimous consent \nthat the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Reserving the right to object, this request is, in my \nview, without merit. It is an effort to follow in the footsteps of the \nunfortunate, politically motivated creation of a just-founded special \ncommittee by the House of Representatives just in time for midterm \nelections. The supposed reason once again we hear colleagues saying we \nneed to have another review, another hearing, another investigation, is \nthe White House email. This is the smoking gun.\n  When you read the email, in fact, it is nothing more than a day-to-\nday work product and part of the job of the President's staff when they \nare talking about, not Benghazi--not Benghazi--but what is happening \nacross the entire region, and clearly across many parts of the Arab \nworld. What happened as a result of that video was a visceral response, \nand it is in that context that this email is being discussed, but our \nfriends--who will never be satisfied because it doesn't solve their \npolitical concerns--at the end of the day seek to use this as their \nlatest claim for their ``investigation.''\n  Their previous one-trick pony, repealing the Affordable Care Act, has \nfinally been put out to pasture. The Republicans desperately need \nanother political trick, and apparently when there is nothing else of \nsubstance to fire up their base, their plan is to yell ``Benghazi'' as \noften and as loudly as possible.\n\n[[Page S2897]]\n\n  This request is, from my perspective, purely a political witch hunt \nwithout merit. There have been 11 congressional hearings on the attack. \nThe executive branch has released 25,000 pages of documents and email \nrelated to the incident. There has been an independent Accountability \nReview Board report. There have been multiple Congressional reports on \nthe attack. The Senate Intelligence Committee issued a bipartisan \nreport last January on the attack. The House Armed Services Committee \nissued a report on military response to the attack. The Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, which I chair, has held multiple hearings and \nbriefings to review the events that occurred in Benghazi. We heard from \nSecretary Clinton. We heard from Secretary Kerry. We have heard from \nDeputy Secretary Burns. We have met with survivors of the Benghazi \nattack. We have multiple briefings from Assistant Secretary Starr and \nwith diplomatic security. We have had briefings from the intelligence \ncommunity and the Department of Defense.\n  Whatever questions remain are meant, from my perspective, only to \nscore political points. I feel confident the Congress and the American \npeople have received the necessary information about the attack, but \nCongress is not without responsibility. We also have an obligation to \ndo our part to comply with the Administrative Review Board's \nrecommendations.\n  Benghazi again highlighted the need to maintain focus and to revise \npolicies to better protect the nearly 70,000 men and women serving \nacross the world in more than 275 posts. The Congress took a serious \nlook at the issue following another set of tragedies in Nairobi and Dar \nes Salaam that resulted in 224 deaths, including 11 American citizens.\n  We may not be able to prevent every single terror attack in the \nfuture, but we can and we must make sure our embassies and employees, \nstarting with high-risk, high-threat posts, are capable of withstanding \nsuch an attack. That is why the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \npassed S. 1836, the Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods, and Glen \nDoherty Embassy Security Threat Mitigation and Personal Protection Act \nof 2013.\n  If the Senate wants to take effective action to safeguard our brave \nmen and women serving in U.S. embassies and consulates abroad, if we \nwant to actually be serious about discharging our duties and to make \nsure these attacks are less likely to occur in the future, rather than \ngrandstanding for cheap political advantage, then it is time to take up \nS. 1386 and immediately pass a bipartisan bill--that Senator Corker and \nI authored together with support from both sides of the aisle on our \ncommittee--that would authorize the funding for the key items \nidentified by the Accountability Review Board on Benghazi, including \nembassy security and construction, language training, and an improved \nand integrated foreign affairs security training for State Department \npersonnel.\n  It provides contract authority to the State Department to allow it to \naward contracts on a best value basis, rather than to the lowest \nbidder, where conditions require enhanced levels of security, and it \ngoes on and on about our high-risk, high-threat posts meeting all the \nelements of what the review board said was critical to make sure we \ndon't lose lives again.\n  I would rather we legislate, which our constituents sent us to do, \nand pass bills extending our Nation's security policy and addressing \nthe real challenges and real lessons to be learned from the tragic \nevents at Benghazi. The bipartisan embassy security bill does just \nthat.\n  For that purpose, I would ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 257, S. 1386, a \nbill to provide for enhanced embassy security; and further, that the \ncommittee-reported amendments be agreed to; that the bill as amended be \nread a third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to the request made by \nthe Senator from New Jersey?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, reserving the right to object, my friend, \nthe senior Senator from New Jersey, suggests that this is a request on \nthe eve of a midterm election. The only reason for that of course is 8 \nmonths ago, when I made the exact same request, the Democrats objected \nand blocked a joint select committee looking into Benghazi at that \ntime. The Senator from New Jersey also suggested this was some kind of \ndistraction from ObamaCare. I promise the Senator, there is no one in \nthis Chamber less interested in distracting from ObamaCare than I.\n  I would encourage the senior Senator from New Jersey, if he believes \nwhat he says, to go and campaign for his Democratic colleagues who are \nup for election this year with the simple message that he said on the \nfloor of this Senate, which is Senator so-and-so is the critical 60th \nvote to passing ObamaCare, and if you like it you can keep your \nSenator. I feel quite confident that the Democratic Senators up for \nelection this year are running as rapidly away from the point suggested \nby the senior Senator from New Jersey as possible.\n\n  But secondly, I would note, in his entire speech, the senior Senator \nfrom New Jersey said there is no need for any further inquiry because \nwe had lots of hearings and there is no need to know anything, but let \nme point out, the senior Senator from New Jersey did not answer even a \nsingle question that I asked. I outlined 10 questions that have not \nbeen answered. He is the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. \nYet he either could not or did not answer even a single question--two \nsimple ones--which are ``yes'' or ``no'' questions.\n  No. 1. Did President Obama sleep on the night of September 11, 2012? \nThe senior Senator from New Jersey chose not to answer, I suspect, \nbecause none of us knows because the White House has never answered \nthat question.\n  No. 2. Do the President's daily intelligence briefings reflect the \npolitical spin from the White House on Benghazi? Likewise, the chairman \nof the Foreign Relations Committee did not answer that question. Again, \nI suspect it is because he does not know because the White House has \nnot released that information.\n  There are far too many questions remaining, but the senior Senator \nfrom New Jersey, my learned colleague, proposed a counter unanimous \nconsent request to improve embassy security.\n  I would ask unanimous consent to engage in a very brief colloquy with \nmy colleague and ask him specifically one question about the unanimous \nconsent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection.\n  Mr. CRUZ. The question I would ask my colleague from New Jersey is, \nIf I were to consent to the unanimous consent that the Senator has \nproffered, and if this side of the aisle would request, would he \nlikewise consent to the unanimous consent request that I put forward \nfor a joint select committee composed of Republicans and Democrats in \nthe Senate to get to the bottom of what happened in Benghazi?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I would say to my colleague from Texas that the consent \nrequest for embassy security we passed in committee in a bipartisan \neffort is much different than a partisan effort to have an \ninvestigation that ultimately also is led by a partisan effort in the \nHouse of Representatives. So one is guaranteed to have the support of \nboth sides of the aisle in order to ensure that we protect our men and \nwomen in the Foreign Service in the days ahead. The other one is \nguaranteed to pursue a political line and a political attack instead of \nmaking sure we ultimately save lives in the future, not because I said \nit but because an independent review board made these recommendations \nthat we incorporate them. So, of course, the two are not the same.\n  Mr. CRUZ. So why is it--I am curious--the senior Senator from New \nJersey believes an inquiry to ascertain the truth about what happened \nis necessarily a partisan endeavor? Is there no partisan interest on \nthat side of the aisle in finding out what happened, how it could have \nbeen prevented, and why we didn't save those four Americans?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I am happy to answer my colleague on that, because he \nsuggested that his 10 questions--that because he asked the 10 \nquestions, they are suddenly worthy of being answered, worthy of in \nfact not being viewed\n\n[[Page S2898]]\n\nthrough the prism of any politics. I would simply say if there is \npolitical spin--several of the Senator's questions are pretty shocking \nto me in terms of the political nature of them.\n  As I said to the body, we have had a whole host of efforts to review \nthe facts and come to a determination of the truth of what happened on \nthat day. They have been in public hearings and they have been in \nsecure intelligence briefings. Members on both sides--on both sides--\nhave been exposed to it. Members on both sides got to ask questions \nacross the spectrum, and so from my perspective we have gone through \nthe search of what happened on that fateful day. We all abhor what \nhappened to the men who lost their lives on that day. That is why what \nI want to do is ensure that we lose no more lives as a result of this \nCongress's irresponsibility to act on embassy security, knowing what in \nfact a panel of experts, undisputed in their capacity, has said is \nnecessary to protect our men and women around the world. Yet we cannot \nseem to get that legislation passed through the Senate. Now, that is \nabout congressional responsibility from my perspective.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I would note that my friend from New Jersey did not \nendeavor to answer any of the questions I proffered, including the most \nsimple question, such as did the President sleep on the night of \nSeptember 11, 2012.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I think whether the President slept on that day, the \nquestion is, Did he even get told by those who had information that \nsuch an attack was going on? I don't know. The bottom line is would \nthat have saved anybody? I don't know that either.\n  The bottom line is does the Senator want to do something about saving \nfuture lives or does he just want to do politics with this issue? If he \nwants to save lives tomorrow, where he does have the control--where he \ndoes have the control at this moment--then he will let the embassy \nsecurity bill go forward. If, God forbid, we have an attack somewhere \nin the world, and the legislation we are seeking in a bipartisan way in \nresponse to that independent board is stopped because the other side \nwishes to stop it, then God forbid we have an attack and lives are cut \noff. Then there will be an accounting at that time.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I would thank my friend from New Jersey for a colloquy in \nsupport of this joint select committee on Benghazi because the \nDemocratic Senator from New Jersey, the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, just told this body he has no idea if President \nObama was even told that four Americans were under terrorist attack. He \nhas no idea. He doesn't know what, if anything, the President could \nhave done to save them.\n  I would suggest that is exactly the reason we need this committee. If \nthe chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee 2 years later cannot \nanswer that question, it makes abundantly clear that the response of \nthe administration, sadly, and the response of the Senate Democrats has \nbeen partisan stonewalling rather than getting to the truth. In the \nimmortal lines of Jack Nicholson, it makes one think perhaps they \ncannot handle it or at least they don't want to know.\n  I would finally say I am more than prepared to consent to the request \nfrom the senior Senator of New Jersey if he would only show the same \nreciprocal courtesy of agreeing to the same request; a bipartisan \ncommittee, in which he would no doubt participate, to answer the \nquestion--the senior Senator from New Jersey just told this body he \ndoesn't know if the President knew. He doesn't know what the President \ncould have done. Apparently, the premise of the statement is he doesn't \nthink the American people care.\n  I suggest that the American people care a great deal as to what the \nPresident knew about national security. They would want to know if he \nwas not engaged or if he didn't act to stop it. That is a matter worthy \nof inquiry by this body.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I say to my colleague from Texas that we have come to a \nconclusion based on all of the hearings, all of the testimony, and all \nof the reports as to what transpired and what we can do to save a life \nprospectively; therefore, I say to the Senator, he has it in his \ncontrol to ultimately ensure that we set the foundation so no one else \nwill lose their life. If he wants to hold that hostage to his political \nefforts to continue an issue that has had thousands of hours of \nreviews, hearings, reports--all with bipartisan participation--then he \ncan choose to do so.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Since my friend from New Jersey has made it plain that he \nwill not consent to this request, I will note that this is an open \noffer that anytime my friend from New Jersey will simply stop blocking \na fair, bipartisan, joint inquiry as to what occurred in Benghazi--the \nterrorist attack that tragically took the lives of four Americans--I am \nhappy to consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for morning business has expired.\n  Is there objection to the request made by the Senator from New \nJersey?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the request made by the Senator from Texas?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the nomination of \nSteven Croley to be the next General Counsel at the Department of \nEnergy. Nominated in August 2013, Dr. Croley has served the Obama \nadministration since 2010, including as Deputy Assistant to the \nPresident, Deputy White House Counsel, and Special Assistant to the \nPresident for Justice and Regulatory Policy at the Domestic Policy \nCouncil. A native of DeWitt, MI, Dr. Croley earned his undergraduate \ndegree from the University of Michigan, where he later went on to teach \nat the law school after obtaining his juris doctor from Yale Law School \nand a Ph.D. from Princeton. At the University of Michigan, Dr. Croley \nwas named the Harry Burns Hutchins Collegiate Professor of Law and \nserved as the law school's associate dean for academic affairs, \nteaching and publishing in the areas of administrative law, civil \nprocedure, regulations, and other areas.

The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all filed \namendments to Calendar No. 368, S. 2262, be in order for floor \nconsideration of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we had an \nagreement to do the bill. Then we changed it to do it with Keystone. \nThat is still our agreement. We are willing to do this bill, energy \nefficiency, which is such a good bill. We are in agreement that we \ncould have an up-or-down vote very shortly thereafter on Keystone.\n  So without going through all of the details, that is what I want to \ndo. He does not want to do that. I object to his unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, therefore, I propose a different \nunanimous consent agreement. I ask unanimous consent that the only \namendments in order be five amendments from the Republican side related \nto energy policy with a 60-vote threshold on adoption of each \namendment. I further ask that following the disposition of these \namendments, the bill be read a third time, and the Senate proceed to \nvote on passage of the bill, as amended, if amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote the yeas are 55, the nays are 36. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the vote by \nwhich cloture was not invoked on S. 2262.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I understand there are several Senators \non the floor who wish to speak on several important subjects. I would \nlike to talk for about 5 to 7 minutes on the vote that just occurred \nand to give some concluding remarks on the Keystone Pipeline and the \nfailure of the Senate to take the opportunity presented today to move \nforward in a bipartisan, cooperative fashion and adopt two important \nand significant steps toward building a more aggressive, a more \ndynamic, and a more comprehensive domestic energy policy for the United \nStates of America.\n  It is a shame that after all of the hard work that has gone into \nthis, it has basically ended in a draw tonight. Senators Shaheen and \nPortman could not have worked harder together to produce a bill that \ncreates thousands of jobs for our country. They brought their bill, as \nis the order, to the Senate energy committee. Senator Wyden served as \nchair of that committee for the last several years. I just stepped into \nthe chairmanship in the last 8 weeks, but I have committed to both \nthese terrific leaders and the former chair that I would try to advance \none of the important bills that came out of our committee.\n  There have been 300 bills filed this Congress in the energy \ncommittee. There have been 13 that have passed. This would have been \nthe 14th. I thought it was important to pair it with the Keystone \nPipeline because while there is strong support for the efficiency bill \non the Democratic side and significant support on the Republican side, \nthe Republican leaders wanted to build--and many of us, including \nmyself--the Keystone Pipeline. In fact, Senator McConnell said on April \n29--not too long ago--that Keystone ``would produce significant \neconomic benefits.'' On May 6 Senator Thune said that we ``will have \nshovel-ready jobs associated with it.'' On May 7 Senator Cornyn said, \n`` build this pipeline so we can safely transport oil.'' Senator \nAlexander said that ``after 5 years of delays, there is simply no \nreason not to let the Keystone XL Pipeline move forward.'' On April 29 \nSenator Enzi said, ``How many times have we been through this?'' \nSenator Inhofe: `` . . . no longer have a valid reason to stall.'' \nSenator Toomey said, ``It is time for Congress to step up and do what \nthe President hasn't--authorize this pipeline.'' We had an opportunity \njust a few minutes ago for these Senators to do exactly that, but they \nchose to have an issue as opposed to having a pipeline, and that is \nvery disappointing.\n  The efficiency bill that came out of the committee, contrary to what \nhas been said on this floor over and over again--that the problem was \nthat Harry Reid would not allow amendments--was amended in committee \nseveral times before the bill came out. There are Republican and \nDemocratic members of the committee, and it came out of the committee \non a vote of I think 19 to 3.\n  When the bill was brought to the floor approximately 6 or 7 months \nago, Senators Shaheen and Portman allowed 10 additional amendments--10 \nadditional amendments--by Members on the Democratic and Republican \nside. I am going to read those amendments into the record so that \nnobody can report or continue to say that the reason we are here is \nbecause there weren't amendments that were offered.\n  This bill was well negotiated. For the record, the first amendment \nwas added by Senator Collins and Senator Udall on energy-efficient \nschools--Senator Collins, a Republican from Maine. No. 2 was a better-\nbuildings amendment by Senators Ayotte and Bennet--a Republican from \nNew Hampshire. There was a data center amendment--the fourth amendment \nadded to the base of this bill--by Senator Risch, a Republican Member. \nThe fifth amendment was again a Collins amendment--low-income housing \nretrofits. That was a Collins-Whitehouse amendment. The ENERGY STAR \nthird-party testing was an amendment I offered along with Senator \nWicker, a Republican from Mississippi. Another was the Wicker-Landrieu-\nPryor amendment--Federal green buildings adjustment so that some of our \nproducts that are used to promote energy efficiency would not be \ndisqualified. It was a very important amendment, and Senator Shaheen \nand Senator Portman agreed to that. Senator Hoeven, a Republican, \noffered an amendment creating an exemption for thermal storage water \nheaters. That amendment was put in. And then there was a Hoeven-\nManchin-Isakson-Bennet amendment--energy efficiency in Federal \nresidential buildings. That amendment was put in the base bill. \nFinally, the 10th amendment was by Senator Sessions and Senator Pryor \nrequiring DOE to recognize voluntary independent certification \nprograms.\n  So this argument that the reason we can't have a vote on the Keystone \nPipeline is because Democrats will not allow amendments is completely \nbogus--completely bogus--and anyone following this debate knows that.\n  Senators Shaheen and Portman compromised. And as the new chair of the \ncommittee, I thought that if the Republicans wanted a vote on Keystone, \nwe could at least offer that, and I thought that was a big step--I \nmean, a big step. I guess it was so big they decided they didn't want \nto take it, because they could have had a vote on Keystone. They can't \ntake yes for an answer. I thought that was a big step forward, a big \nimprovement over where we were about 6 months ago where we had 3 \nDemocrats--we now have almost 11, and the number is growing--who \nsupported Keystone.\n  And it is not because people are not respectful of the President's \nposition. He is entitled to have his own position. Some of us just \nstrongly disagree with it. The studies are in. The environmental \nstudies are in. This is a rounding error when it comes to increased \ncarbon emissions. And it is a hugely important impact for safety to get \noil transported by the safest route possible--pipeline--as opposed to \nthese tankers rolling alongside our children and schoolbuses on our \nhighways or rolling through our communities on rail. We have already \nseen a number of horrific accidents.\n  So here I am, the new chair of the committee, and I thought, well, \nthis could be possible. We have an efficiency bill Democrats like, and \nwe have Keystone, which the Republicans really want to get done. Why \ndon't we just offer them together? It makes perfect common sense to \neveryone in America--cooperation and common sense--but that is in short \nsupply here in the Senate, and it is very disappointing.\n  I know it is an election year. I am reminded about that every day by \nmy colleagues. But I thought this was bigger than the campaign. It is \nabout jobs, it is about middle class, it is about strengthening \ndomestic energy, and it is about being balanced in our approach. I know \nif Democrats were completely in charge they would write an energy bill \none way, and if Republicans were completely in charge they would write \nit a different way. But this isn't fairyland. This is Washington, DC, \nand we have a split Congress. So I thought bringing an efficiency bill \nthat has over 200 organizations, from the Environmental Defense Fund to \nthe chamber of commerce--and Senator Shaheen and Senator Portman have \nput together an absolutely magnificent coalition--not seen very often \naround here, to tell the truth. And the Keystone Pipeline has won over \nits critics. There were a lot of critics in the beginning. There still \nare very loud critics, but I think the evidence is showing the \nimportance of building this Keystone Pipeline.\n  As chair, I intend to be as fair as I can be with both parties, and \nputting things on this floor we can be proud of together, where \neverybody takes a little and gives a little and we move forward. But, \nno, that is not enough for\n\n[[Page S2901]]\n\nthe Republican leader. The Republican leader wants an issue; he does \nnot want the pipeline. I hope the people of Kentucky will remind him \nhow important the pipeline is.\n  So I am going to ask unanimous consent--I am going to read this into \nthe Record, all this formal language, but I want people to know what my \nconsent request really is. I am going to ask unanimous consent that at \nsometime before May 22, which would be about 2 weeks from today, or a \nweek and a half, this Senate have a straight-up vote after 3 hours of \ndebate on the Shaheen-Portman bill that already has 10 Republican \namendments included in it and that 3 hours later or at some certain \ntime later, we have a straight-up vote on the Keystone Pipeline.\n  That is what this unanimous consent request I am going to read into \nthe Record says, but it is a little bit confusing when you hear it, so \nI want people to know really clearly what it is I am asking.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that sometime before May 22 \nthere would be a vote straight up on Keystone and on the efficiency \nlegislation, which already has 10 Republican amendments--bipartisan \namendments led by Republican Members--included in the bill, and I ask \nfor that now with a 60-vote threshold.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that with respect to S. 2262, the pending \nmotion to commit and amendments be withdrawn, with the exception of the \nsubstitute amendment; that at a time to be determined by the majority \nleader, after consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate \nresume consideration of S. 2262, that the substitute amendment be \nagreed to; that there be no other amendments, points of order or \nmotions in order to the bill other than budget points of order and the \napplicable motions to waive; that there be up to 3 hours of debate on \nthe bill, equally divided between the two leaders or their designees; \nthat upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote \non passage of the bill, as amended; that the bill be subject to a 60-\naffirmative vote threshold; that if the bill is passed, the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 371, S. 2280--which would \nbe Keystone--at a time to be determined by the majority leader, after \nconsultation with the Republican leader, but no later than Thursday, \nMay 22, 2014; that there be no amendments, points of order or motions \nin order to the bill other than budget points of order and the \napplicable motions to waive; that there be up to 3 hours of debate on \nthe bill, equally divided between the two leaders or their designees; \nthat upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote \non passage of the bill; that the bill be subject to a 60-affirmative \nvote threshold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FLAKE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I understand there are 75 amendments filed \nat the desk to this bill. Some of them are mine. Twenty-four of them \nhave been filed by Democratic Senators who hope to offer them to this \nbill.\n  We keep hearing about amendments that are being allowed. These are \namendments or amendment language which has been drafted into a \nmanager's amendment to the bill, not to be offered on the floor. I \nshould note that the vote on the Keystone Pipeline is one of those \namendments that could be offered to the bill if there was agreement to \nmove ahead.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the unanimous consent be modified so \nthat all filed amendments to Calendar No. 368, S. 2262, be in order for \nfloor consideration of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify the request?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I reserve my right to oppose this modification, and I \nwish to briefly explain why, as my colleague explained his reason why \nhe wanted to modify.\n  I think what Senator Landrieu has offered is what everybody in this \ncountry thought we were going to do. Senator Landrieu and I disagree on \nKeystone. No one could be a stronger advocate for Keystone than she is, \nperiod.\n  I believe tar sands should not be brought into this country the way \nthey would be brought in at a 45-percent increase with this pipeline--\neventually 300 percent. We could have had a robust debate. The Senator \nand I would have been respectful and caring about each other, but we \nwould have disagreed. We could have had the vote.\n  Maybe I am old-fashioned, but I believe when you give your word, you \nkeep your word. Leadership was very clear that if we were able to give \nthe Republicans and Senator Landrieu a vote on Keystone, we could move \nforward with Shaheen-Portman, a bipartisan, incredibly important energy \nefficiency bill.\n  Instead, what we know is Republicans want to offer--and it is in my \njurisdiction so I can speak about it--environmental riders, the likes \nof which I have never seen in one grouping, essentially repealing the \nessence of the Clean Air Act that was signed into law in 1970 by \nRichard Nixon, and the 1990 amendments which were signed into law by \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush. They want to put those on this bill. You \nhave got to be kidding. Something as serious as that?\n  So I object to the modification.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Given Senator Boxer's comments, I am unable to modify \nmy request. I hope we can move forward at some time with a vote on the \nenergy efficiency bill and on the Keystone Pipeline.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection to the modification. Is \nthere objection to the original request?\n  Mr. FLAKE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before Senator Shaheen and other Senators \nleave, I wish to say how disappointed I am, because energy efficiency \nis so good for this country, and they have stopped it because they want \nto repeal the Clean Air Act. Let's call it what it is. It is really a \nsad state of affairs.\n  I was so looking forward not only to the debate on energy efficiency, \nbut, frankly, the debate on the Keystone Pipeline, which my Republican \nfriends say is a major priority. If they felt it was a major priority, \nwhy have they filibustered this bill when we could have made that deal \nwhich they came up with in the first place?\n  So I am very disappointed. I hope we will have another chance to pass \nthis bipartisan energy efficiency bill that Senator Shaheen and Senator \nPortman worked so hard on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, the notion that Republicans are trying to \nrepeal the Clean Air Act--if somebody were offering an amendment to \nthat, then it would simply be defeated on this floor.\n  Let the amendments be offered. That is what the Senate is all about. \nThis is a place of unlimited debate and usually unlimited amendments. \nBut we are told now they can only agree to amendments the majority \nleader agrees should be offered. That is not right. That is not the \nSenate.\n  Let's go ahead and allow the amendments to be offered. If the \namendments are wild-eyed and out there, they will surely be defeated. \nBut let's debate the bill. Let's actually have an opportunity to amend \nthe bill with amendments of our own choosing, not somebody else's \nchoosing. That is what this debate is about.\n\n\n                         Production Tax Credit\n\n  Mr. President, last month the Senate Finance Committee considered \nlegislation to extend a number of expired tax provisions.\n  We have become so accustomed to extending various tax credits and \ndeductions on a year-by-year basis, we have given this bill the name \n``tax extenders'' when it comes up every year.\n  Unfortunately, these short-term fixes passed by Congress fail to give \nany certainty to taxpayers in the future, other than the fact that the \ngovernment continues to give preferential treatment to certain chosen \nindustries.\n  Now, rather than blindly extend these provisions, what we ought to do \nis eliminate these wasteful extenders which are really just subsidies. \nThese benefit just a few. Those that are necessary for the economy \nlet's extend permanently so we don't go through this exercise year \nafter year.\n  But today I will discuss for a minute one extender that is ripe for \nelimination--the Production Tax Credit, otherwise known as the PTC.\n\n[[Page S2902]]\n\n  In 1992, the PTC was temporarily established to promote development \nof renewable energy--electricity, particularly. This was for the then-\nfledgling wind power industry.\n  Congress gave energy producers a lengthy 7-year window to take \nadvantage of and prepare for the eventual expiration of this tax credit \nin 1999. But as we know, here in Washington, very few of these programs \nare temporary. So here we are 15 years later, and the PTC is still \nhanging around.\n  Since its inception, this credit has been extended eight times. \nHaving expired on January 1 of this year, there is now another effort \nafoot to resurrect what can only be described as a zombie credit. Do we \nreally need a ninth extension? Wouldn't it be more intellectually \nhonest to decide, if this government's policy is worth it, to simply \npermanently renew? Yet we go through this exercise year after year.\n  Last month there was a glimmer of hope that common sense would \nprevail. The tax extender package put forward by Senator Wyden and \nRanking Member Hatch excluded the PTC--allowing the credit to finally \nexpire so it wouldn't have been part of this package. However, it \ndidn't take long for those who benefit from this government subsidy to \nactivate the rallying cry.\n  A few short days later, the PTC was back in the package to provide \nthe wind industry 2 additional years, until the end of 2015, to start \nconstruction on projects that would be eligible for the subsidy.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, this short extension \nwould cost more than $13 billion over the next 10 years. But this isn't \na true cost. Wind producers get to claim the credit for 10 years, \nbeginning on the date of first production, as opposed to the start of \nconstruction.\n  In reality, the Federal Government's financial commitment extends \nwell beyond the 10-year period considered in the JTC's initial \nestimate. The government will still likely be passing out these credits \nin 2027 and beyond.\n  That is a long commitment for a technology that former Energy \nSecretary Steven Chu said was mature in 2009. In fact, he projected \nthat wind would be cost competitive with other forms of energy without \nsubsidies by the end of this decade.\n  Wind power generation is no longer an infant industry. It is no \nlonger in need of Federal support. By the end of last year, more than \n61,000 megawatts of wind power capacity had been installed around the \nU.S., which is 15 times the amount that existed in 2001. In 2012, wind \npower was the top source of new generating capacity, beating out \nadditional capacity from natural gas. The PTC is, in fact, so generous \nthat at times it is more valuable than the wholesale price of \nelectricity. That is a whopper of a subsidy. According to the \nCongressional Research Service, as a result of government subsidies, \nthere are times when wind producers actually pay the market to take \ntheir power.\n  Recently, some of my colleagues who support this tax credit have \npointed to the growing share of wind power generation in the U.S. and \nmore than 550 wind-related manufacturing facilities around the country \nwhich will supply tens of thousands of jobs.\n  Rather than depicting an infant industry, these advances describe an \nindustry that should be ready to stand on its own two feet.\n  We all know the U.S. has a $17.5 trillion debt. All subsidies like \nthis need to be eliminated.\n  The production tax credit distorts the market by having the \ngovernment favor one source of energy over another. An ideal energy \nmarket is one largely absent of the government's convoluted tax \npolicies. Simply put, no industry's success should be predicated on \ncongressional action.\n  Instead of extending an energy subsidy that picks winners and losers \nand creates market inefficiencies, Congress should eliminate the PTC \nand support an energy policy that encourages entrepreneurs to satisfy \ndemand by providing consumers with alternative sources of energy.\n  This law has run its course. The PTC should meet its long overdue \nend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am very disappointed at the actions of \nthe Senate this evening: that we were not able to come together after \nall of the work and all of the support from groups across this country \nfor energy efficiency legislation; that we cannot bridge our \ndifferences and get this bill done, despite the broad bipartisan \nsupport, despite the support of organizations from the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce to the National Association of Manufacturers to the NRDC \nenvironmental groups to the painters union. We had groups across the \npolitical spectrum supporting this legislation--the Alliance to Save \nEnergy, which was really the brain child behind this legislation. Yet \nwe were not able to come together to support a bill that would have \nmade progress on the jobs front, progress on savings for consumers, and \nprogress on preventing pollution.\n  I thank Senator Landrieu, who has chaired the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, and Senator Boxer, chair of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, for their kind words about this legislation \nthis evening. I also thank my partner, who worked as hard on this bill \nas I did, Senator Rob Portman from Ohio, and the good work of both his \nstaff and my staff in trying to move this efficiency agenda forward.\n  Unfortunately, we saw tonight that differences in this body have \nprevented positive progress. The reason that is so unfortunate is \nbecause energy efficiency is the cheapest, fastest, cleanest way to \naddress this country's energy demand, because energy that we don't use \nis energy that we don't have to produce. And efficiency saves money, \nlessens our dependence on imported energy, decreases pollution, and \nimproves our Nation's global competitiveness.\n  In addition, energy efficiency investments enable domestic businesses \nto leverage private capital, to reduce business risks associated with \nprice volatility, to spur economic growth, and to create jobs. All of \nthose are part of this Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness \nAct that Senator Portman and I cosponsored along with a great group of \nbipartisan sponsors from this body. One of the aspects I like about \nenergy efficiency is that it doesn't matter whether one supports fossil \nfuels or whether one supports alternative sources of energy; everyone \nbenefits from energy efficiency. In the last 40 years we have saved \nmore through energy efficiency in this country than we have produced \nthrough fossil fuels and nuclear power combined. So there is huge \npotential benefit in energy efficiency, and it is important for us to \nfigure out a way to move this legislation forward.\n\n  In the last 3\\1/2\\ years I have visited businesses across New \nHampshire--small retail businesses, manufacturing companies, ski areas, \napartment complexes, municipal buildings. Today I was at the opening of \na new expansion of Airmar Technologies in New Hampshire, a beautiful \nnew facility. They make sensors that go in everything from ships to \nweather instruments to detect weather. They were very proud that in \nconstructing the new building they made it energy efficient. This is a \nwin-win-win. According to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient \nEconomy, if we pass this bill this year by 2030 we will help create \n192,000 jobs, we will save consumers $16.2 billion a year, and it will \nbe the equivalent of taking 22 million cars off the road, all because \nwe are saving energy.\n  We ought to all be able to come together behind this. I am not going \nto quit. I don't think the sponsors of this legislation are going to \nquit. All of those 260-plus businesses, organizations out there that \nhave been advocating for this bill, are not going to quit because this \nis legislation that makes sense. It makes sense for job creation, it \nmakes sense for saving on pollution, it makes sense for saving money, \nit makes sense to our national competitiveness, and we are going to \nkeep at it until we pass this legislation.\n  I hope politics will stay out of the way; that we will come together, \nwe will agree on amendments we can all vote on, and that we will be \nable to move forward in a positive way.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/12/senate-section/article/S2902-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2902-S2904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY SAVINGS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am disappointed today that we were unable \nto\n\n[[Page S2903]]\n\nmove forward on the Energy Savings and Industrial Competiveness Act of \n2014, S. 2262. This legislation, also referred to as the energy \nefficiency bill, had substantial public support and included several \nstrong bipartisan compromises. It is a pretty sad state of affairs that \nwe were unable to garner the 60 votes necessary to overcome a \nfilibuster of S. 2262. Not moving forward on this bill is irresponsible \nand inhibits our economy's growth.\n  Through a deficit neutral framework, the energy efficiency bill would \nhave provided several low-cost tools to promote the adoption of energy \nefficient technologies. It supported the use of such technologies in \nresidential and commercial buildings, encouraged stronger coordination \nbetween the private sector and the Federal Government through the \nresearch, development and commercialization of energy efficient \ntechnologies, and required that the nation's largest consumer of \nenergy, the Federal Government, implement energy-saving techniques.\n  This legislation would have been good for Michigan and the Nation. \nMichigan is the epicenter of America's manufacturing sector and has the \npotential to help spearhead the development of energy efficient \ntechnologies. With a highly skilled workforce and a robust base of \nmanufacturers specializing in energy efficient products, Michigan is \nwell-positioned to meet the demands of an evolving energy efficient \neconomy. This bill could have provided job creation opportunities for \nenergy efficiency contractors, manufacturers, and service companies.\n  A comprehensive energy policy must balance the demands of providing \naffordable and reliable energy with environmental protection. Energy \nefficiency is one of the most successful tools that will allow us to \nachieve that balance. Using less energy not only reduces harmful \nemissions, but also helps us to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, \nand enhance our energy security. This bill had the potential to create \njobs, increase our country's productivity, and incentivize industry to \ninnovate and develop competitive technologies that strengthen our \neconomy.\n  The Senate has not voted on energy legislation since 2007 and it is \nunfortunate that we have squandered another opportunity to help advance \nour nation's economy and increase our energy security. This was \ncommonsense legislation that not only made economic sense for the \nAmerican public, but strong environmental sense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Billy Frank, Jr.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening, along \nwith my colleague Senator Cantwell, to talk about a truly remarkable \nman from our own State of Washington whom we just lost last week.\n  Billy Frank, Jr., was many things to many different people. To his \nfamily he was a loving husband and father, to the dozens of Native \nAmerican tribes in Washington State he was a hero and a champion for \nhard-fought treaty rights, and to millions across our State, Billy \nFrank, Jr., was a marine who represented what the best of America is \nall about, fighting for what you believe in and never, ever giving up.\n  I was back in Washington State yesterday for Billy's memorial \nservice, and looking around at all the people there whose lives he had \ntouched, I was reminded of what made Billy so special. Billy was the \ntype of person who defined the term ``larger than life.'' He was the \ntype of person who had so much personality and so much ability and so \nmuch passion and love in his heart that it was very hard to believe it \ncould all be contained in just one person.\n  When Billy believed in something, he didn't just make his argument, \nhe held a fish-in. He built a movement. He did raise his voice just to \nbe heard, he banged down the doors in Olympia and here in Washington, \nDC, until he got what he needed. Most of all, he never flinched in the \nface of opposition, and he faced plenty of it, from hate and \ndiscrimination to being arrested and abused. Over a lifetime that took \nhim from the banks of the Nisqually River to the steps of the U.S. \nSupreme Court, Billy made sure the rights of Native Americans were \nprotected and honored by the United States of America. He led the fight \nto ensure tribal rights to Native lands and salmon harvest could never \nbe stolen away and over time he became much more than an advocate. He \nbecame in many ways a face of so many Native American communities \nacross this country.\n  Now as we grieve and try to think about how to move forward without \nthis larger-than-life man, I am reminded that while we have lost Billy, \nso much of his life's work truly remains with us because all he \naccomplished and all he achieved, whether it was power and influence or \ncourt decisions and new laws, it was never about him. It was always \nabout his community, his tribe, and protecting treaty rights for all \nNative Americans. Billy was someone who did so much and worked so hard \nnot so he could gain power or wealth but so the people, the land, and \nthe fish he cared so much for would never be brushed aside or \nforgotten. That is a rare thing.\n  Billy's life wasn't a job for one man or one woman, but somehow he \npulled it off by himself. So now it is going to take everyone who knew \nhim to fill his shoes together and fight with the tribes that call \nWashington State home.\n  I wish to conclude by quoting something Billy once said:\n\n       I don't believe in magic. I believe in the sun and the \n     stars, the water, the tides, the floods, the owls, the hawks \n     flying, the river running, the wind talking. They are \n     measurements. They tell us how healthy things are. They tell \n     us because we and they are the same, and that is what I \n     believe in. Those who listen to the world that sustains them \n     can hear the message brought forth by the salmon.\n\n  That is Billy and we will miss him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am glad to join my colleague, the \nsenior Senator, to commemorate a great Washingtonian whom we lost last \nweek, Billy Frank, Jr.\n  Senator Murray and I were able to attend his memorial service \nyesterday in the South Puget Sound area with 6,000 other \nWashingtonians. That is what happens when a great leader is lost; a \ncommunity shows up to commemorate him and his spirit. Everybody who \nknew Billy Frank across the United States of America--and there are \nmany people from all over Indian Country who do know or knew of Billy \nFrank--will want us to remember he was a legend who walked among us \nbecause what he did was champion environmental rights and the rights of \nNative American people to fish and in some ways championed the salmon \nto make sure we had good habitat.\n  Sometimes I wonder how a boy from the Nisqually River turned into \nbeing such a big Northwest Pacific hero, but for him, he started when \nhe was a very young man listening to fishing stories of his father and \nmany members of the Nisqually tribe. In a book about his life, his \nfather Willie Frank, Sr., recalled a warden telling him, ``Your treaty \nisn't worth the paper it's printed on.''\n  So while Billy's family faced beatings and incarcerations and \nexplicit and inexplicit racism, he decided he was going to defend those \nrights all the way to the Supreme Court. As he grew into an adolescent, \nhis father said to him: Keep fishing even if they arrest you. Keep \nfishing even if they beat you. Keep fishing even if they say the \nfishing claims aren't yours and they challenge them. Keep fishing. \nBecause he knew those fishing claims were promised in the Medicine \nCreek Treaty.\n  So Billy was arrested more than 50 times in this struggle to secure \nthe rights that were guaranteed to him by this government in a treaty. \nIn fact, also in that book, he once was jailed and was asked by some of \nthe people in jail--he called them bank robbers--what was he in for, \nand Billy just said, ``Fishing.''\n  So he took the beatings, and instead of turning all that into anger, \nhe urged people to work in a nonviolent way, to stand for what they \nthought were important issues.\n  He had a great sense of humor. He once said:\n\n       If a salmon gets away from you, don't cuss. Don't say \n     anything. That salmon, he's going upriver. He's producing \n     more salmon for you and for all of us. The salmon--he's \n     coming home. And we have to take care of his home.\n\n\n[[Page S2904]]\n\n\n  That is the vision that helped Billy win one of the greatest \nvictories the tribes in the United States of America has ever seen. In \na landmark decision, they abolished the regulations of discrimination \nagainst the Indian fishermen and allowed the tribe to self-regulate, \ncomanage, and have the opportunity to catch up to half the harvestable \ncatch.\n  We just celebrated the 40th anniversary of that historic Boldt \ndecision, and yesterday we had a chance to pay tribute to a man who \nplayed a critical role in that decision. But as my colleague Senator \nMurray said, Billy Frank did more than just fight for that decision. He \ncontinued to focus on restoration of Puget Sound, including the \nNisqually Delta Restoration, one of the largest tidal marsh \nrestorations in the Pacific Northwest. This project has increased the \npotential for salt marsh habitat in the southern reach of Puget Sound \nby over 50 percent.\n  Because of his advocacy we have a program now called the Puget Sound \nPartnership, which is a public-private tribal partnership trying to \nimprove the health of Puget Sound, and he is the reason we have an \nagreement called the Timber, Fish, and Wildlife Agreement, which is a \nmodel for how people around the United States of America should try to \nresolve some of their differences on environmental issues instead of \nsuing and going to court forever and ever and never having any kind of \nresolution. This kind of collaboration helped people address the \nenvironmental issues at hand.\n  So all of these things are things Billy Frank accomplished. As my \ncolleague Senator Murray said, it was almost as though he was larger \nthan life and did a job that could have, should have been for many \npeople, but instead he just did it in his own way.\n  We will miss him, but we are thankful for all he did and for the \npeople in the Northwest Fishing Commission for all they have done to \nhelp us in the Northwest set the right course. While he will not be \nthere in person, we know Billy Frank will always be with us and with \nthe salmon of the Pacific Northwest. We will miss him.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/12/senate-section/article/S2904-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF STEVEN PAUL LOGAN TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR \n                        THE DISTRICT OF ARIZONA\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Col. Tom Murgatroyd \nof Sherman, IL, and his extraordinary family.\n  You may have heard the story of President Abraham Lincoln informing \nLydia Bixby of the death of her five sons in defense of the Republic \nduring the Civil War. This is not that story. You may have heard about \nthe five Sullivan brothers who died on board the USS Juneau in World \nWar II as they fought for freedom in the Pacific. This is not that \nstory either.\n  No, Tom Murgatroyd's family does share that uncommon courage that \nruns in the blood of so many families with veterans, but this story \ndoesn't end in the same way. Like so many great stories, this has the \nwonderful trait of being true. Tom had seven uncles serving in World \nWar II, and all seven made it back home.\n  George and Addie Powell had 11 sons and 2 daughters. The family lived \non a farm near Hillview, in Greene County, IL. In the summer of 1941, \nAddie wanted a picture of the whole family together. It is always \ndifficult to gather a large family, but that picture was a rare feat \nand it would become a truly special one. That photo taken on Veterans \nDay would be the last time they were all together. Though seven of the \nsons would make it back home from the war, their brother John would \nsuccumb to lung cancer while those boys were overseas in 1945.\n  The sons who enlisted to join the war after Pearl Harbor were Arthur, \nEarl, Fred, George, Everett, Max, and Adrian Powell. You may be \nfamiliar with the service star pins that mothers of active duty \nservicemembers wore. Addie didn't have a service star pin large enough \nto include all of her fighting family on a lapel. Her solution was to \nput two pins with three stars each on the lapel. I assume she adjusted \nagain when her seventh son joined the war. Three of the men were Army \nAir Corps and the other four enlisted in the Navy. The eldest, Arthur, \nalready had a 20-year Navy career when the war started, and he returned \nto service as a recruiter. This sense of duty and patriotism extended \nto the entire Powell family, who all pitched in to help with the war \neffort. There would have been an eighth Powell enlisting had the war \ngone on another few years.\n  The whole family did their part for the war, but I want to focus on \nEverett for a moment. On March 4, 1944, he was flying his Thunderbolt \nP-47 on an escorting mission with a formation of Flying Fortresses. It \nwas his 90th mission and also his mother's birthday. His plane was shot \ndown over Belgium. He told his fighter group that he would bail out, \nbut he never did. Two weeks later, the family was informed that Everett \nwas missing. His mother Addie had a heart attack upon hearing the news.\n  Weeks turned to months, and Everett was still missing. Then, on the \nFourth of July, the family received a message that Everett was alive \nand a prisoner of the Germans. The family's prayers were answered. \nRuth, sister to the Powell brothers and Col. Tom Murgatroyd's mother, \nrecalled that it was rightfully, ``the happiest Fourth of July'' in \nseveral years. Everett went on to endure 18 months in the German POW \ncamp called Stalag 3. When Everett was released, he wandered until \nencountering the American lines and then boarded a ship to come home. \nHe said he bought 24 chocolate bars in the ship's store and got so sick \nhe never cared for chocolate afterward.\n  The family never ceased waiting to hear from their boys. While they \nwere away, their sister Ruth made a banner for the family to represent \nthe seven family members serving, because the military at the time \ndidn't have any banners with more than six stars to represent the \nnumber of sons serving from one family.\n  The sons all wrote letters to their family. Their first questions \nconsistently were about the crops back home before asking about family \nand friends. When they did return, their mom, Addie, was always waiting \ndown the road to greet her sons.\n  The Powell family is an extraordinary example of what so many \nfamilies experience during war. It should not surprise us that several \nof the Powells would continue their military service after the war. \nEverett, though being held in a POW camp, went on to have a nearly 30-\nyear Air Force career. Many of the children of the Powell brothers and \nsisters went on to serve in the military, including Col. Tom Murgatroyd \nof Sherman, IL. George is the last surviving sibling who had served in \nWorld War II, and he is now living in Traverse City, MI.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in celebrating the courage of the \nPowell family. Thank you, and all the families like you, who are doing \ntheir part to support our veterans and serving the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/12/senate-section/article/S2905-3", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WORLD WAR II VETERANS VISIT\n\n  Mr. WALSH. Mr. President, over the past 2 years, the Big Sky Honor \nFlight has transported 755 World War II veterans to their memorial in \nWashington, DC. Before these trips, most of the veterans had never seen \nthe memorial that was built in their honor.\n  Our World War II veterans sacrificed so much for our country, often \ndeploying for as long as 4 years, and then returned home to build the \ngreat country we have today. They truly are the greatest generation.\n  The Big Sky Honor Flight started out as a powerful idea to honor \nMontana's veterans, but getting 755 veterans, their caregivers, and \nmedical staff across the country and back is no easy task. Today I want \nto recognize the selfless servants who made the Big Sky Honor Flight a \nreality.\n  The Big Sky Honor Flight Committee works tirelessly on behalf of our \nveterans. Their mission was to make sure every World War II veteran \nfrom Montana had the opportunity to visit our Nation's capital and see \nhow grateful we are for their service. Today, as the ninth and final \nflight leaves Washington, DC, for Billings, MT, we are proud to say: \nmission accomplished.\n  The Big Sky Honor Flight Committee successfully raised $1.45 million \nfrom Montanans to charter nine flights transporting the veterans to \nWashington, DC. The committee's dedication to bringing the veterans to \nsee their monument was no easy task.\n  As honorary chair of the Big Sky Honor Flight, I saw firsthand the \nwork that went into identifying our veterans, providing transportation, \nand coordinating all of the logistics.\n  As we celebrate the final Big Sky Honor Flight for our World War II \nveterans I want to pay tribute to the men and women who made the nine \nflights a reality: the Big Sky Honor Flight Committee.\n  From the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you to the Big Sky \nHonor Flight Committee: Chris Reinhard, George Blackard, Burt Gigoux, \nBecky Hillier, Bill Kennedy, Denise Licata, Cory Miller, Charlie Reed, \nRay Robinson, Tiffany Samel, Annette Satterly, Kathy Shannon, Vicky \nStephens, and Tina Vauthier.\n  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to ensure that Montana's \nWorld War II veterans saw their memorial.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/12/senate-section/article/S2905-4", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2905-S2906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                RECOGNIZING CONCERNS OF POLICE SURVIVORS\n\n Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the work of \nConcerns of Police Survivors, C.O.P.S., for 30 years of service to the \nsurviving families of America's fallen law enforcement officers. In \n1984, Suzie Sawyer started C.O.P.S. as a small grief support \norganization of 110 law enforcement survivors in the basement of her \nPrince George's County, MD, home. Following the retirement of her \nhusband from the Prince George's County Police Department, C.O.P.S. \nrelocated its national headquarters to Camdenton, MO, in 1993, where it \nhas since grown, unfortunately every year, to serve over 30,000 \nsurviving law enforcement families across the country at annual \nseminars and retreats. With 50 national chapters\n\n[[Page S2906]]\n\nand a yearly budget of $3.4 million collected from private donations \nand awarded grants, C.O.P.S. assists with rebuilding the lives of \nsurviving families and coworkers of law enforcement officers who have \ndied in the line of duty.\n  I thank Suzie Sawyer for her dedication to this great cause and thank \nC.O.P.S. for 30 years of incredible service to grieving surviving law \nenforcement families and coworkers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/12/senate-section/article/S2906-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CHEROKEE COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State, and it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills--but I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Cherokee County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community. Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your \ncommunity has worked with me to successfully acquire financial \nassistance from programs I have fought hard to support, which have \nprovided more than $5.2 million to the local economy.\n  Of course, my favorite memory of working together has to be ensuring \nthat the Cherokee County Regional Airport has the resources it needs to \nstay modern. Dependable air service is a significant factor for growing \nbusinesses as well as increasing tourism in the area. I look forward to \nlearning about the impact of these improvements, which are important \nfor the airport and the local economy.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Investing in Iowa's economic development through targeted community \nprojects: In Northwest Iowa, we have worked together to grow the \neconomy by making targeted investments in important economic \ndevelopment projects, including improved roads and bridges, modernized \nsewer and water systems, and better housing options for residents of \nCherokee County. In many cases, I have secured Federal funding that has \nleveraged local investments and served as a catalyst for a whole ripple \neffect of positive, creative changes. For example, working with mayors, \ncity council members, and local economic development officials in \nCherokee County, I have fought for funding for small community \nairports, which brought more than $1.4 million to the county in the \npast decade, helping to create jobs and expand economic opportunities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Cherokee County has received $163,458 in Harkin grants.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Cherokee County has received more than $1.1 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained, equipped, and able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Cherokee \nCounty's fire departments have received over $875,290 for firefighter \nsafety and operations equipment.\n  Disability Rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the \nADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow \ncitizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter \ncentury since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in \ncommunities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed \ncaptioned television, but in the full participation of people with \ndisabilities in our society and economy, folks who at long last have \nthe opportunity to contribute their talents and to be fully included. \nThese changes have increased economic opportunities for all citizens of \nCherokee County, both those with and without disabilities, and they \nmake us proud to be a part of a community and country that respects the \nworth and civil rights of all of our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Cherokee County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Cherokee \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. Of course, this \nwork is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I have no \nintention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, richer Iowa. \nI will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity to serve the \npeople of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/12/senate-section/article/S2906-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2906-S2907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          OSCEOLA COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

Ensuring Iowans have access to quality, \naffordable health care is critical, particularly for those in rural \nareas, who may find this care out of reach. Thanks to the insightful \nleadership of Janet Dykstra, the Osceola Community Hospital is equipped \nwith the equipment and facilities to care for residents and promote \nwellness in the area.\n  Among the highlights:\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern.

Over the \nyears, Osceola County has received $66,873 in Harkin grants.

Since 2001, Osceola \nCounty's fire departments have received over $543,297 for firefighter \nsafety and operations equipment.\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces. I am so proud that Americans have better access to clinical \npreventive services, nutritious food, smoke-free environments, safe \nplaces to engage in physical activity, and information to make healthy \ndecisions for themselves and their families. These efforts not only \nsave lives, they will also save money for generations to come thanks to \nthe prevention of costly chronic diseases, which account for a whopping \n75 percent of annual health care costs. I am pleased that Osceola \nCounty has recognized this important issue by securing $116,399 to curb \nobesity and $35,833 to implement a wellness center through the Harkin \nwellness grant program.

BENNETT\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today we honor the life and service \nof Hale Bennett, whose passing signifies a great loss to Nevada. I send \nmy condolences and prayers to his wife Kay and all of Hale's family in \nthis time of mourning. Hale was a man committed to his country, his \nState, and community. He will be sorely missed.\n  Hale was a true patriot and served his country in the U.S. Army Air \nCorps during World War II. He flew combat missions over France, \nGermany, and the Low Countries. Through the course of the war in \nEurope, he flew 68 bombing missions and went out on an additional 100 \nthat returned without dropping bombs due to bad weather. Hale's unit, \nthe 553rd Squadron of the 386th Bomb Group, 9th Air Force, was so \nhighly respected that on D-day they were chosen to fly the final \nbombing runs over the Germans on Utah Beach as our troops were landing \non the beach below. After the war, Hale was called once again to serve \nour Nation by training bomber pilots for the Air Force during the \nKorean conflict. As one of our Nation's servicemembers, he made \nexceptional sacrifices for our country and deserves our deepest \ngratitude. I am both humbled and honored by not only his, but his \nfamily's service to our great Nation.\n  Hale and his wife were upstanding Nevadans and a huge asset to their \ncommunity. His dedication to serving others extends far beyond our \nNation's military. Hale worked as the Department of Motor Vehicles \nchief of Registration and Titling and often represented his department \nin the Nevada State Legislature. His work as chairman of the board of \nthe Carson-Tahoe Hospital showcased his commitment to the betterment of \nthe community and led him to meeting his wife, Kay. The couple, both on \nthe hospital board of trustees and pilots, spent their time having many \nadventures together and contributing their community. The Bennett's \nlove for aviation and community service led them to Silver Springs, \nwhere they took on the daunting task of turning an abandoned airstrip \ninto a thriving airport. His hard work and contributions to his \ncommunity will remain a lasting legacy in the Silver State.\n  As a World War II veteran, Hale's commitment to his country, as well \nas his dedication to his family and community, exemplified why the \nlegacy of all World War II veterans must be preserved for generations \nto come. These veterans truly are the greatest generation--selflessly \nserving not for recognition, but because it was the right thing to do. \nAs a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I recognize that \nCongress has a responsibility not only to honor these brave \nindividuals, but to ensure they are cared for when\n\n[[Page S2908]]\n\nthey return home. I remain committed to upholding this promise for our \nveterans and servicemembers in Nevada and throughout the Nation.\n  I extend my deepest sympathies to Kay and all of Hale's family. We \nwill always remember Hale for his courageous contributions to the \nUnited States of America and to freedom-loving nations around the \nworld. His service to his country and his bravery and dedication to his \nfamily and community earn him a place among the outstanding men and \nwomen who have valiantly defended our Nation.\n  Throughout his life, Hale maintained a dedication to the preservation \nof justice and integrity, which I am honored to commend. Today, I join \nthe Silver Springs community and citizens of the Silver State to \ncelebrate the life of an upstanding Nevadan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/12/senate-section/article/S2908-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING DUKE BRUNELLI\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I congratulate Duke Brunelli of \nSparks, NV, on his recent retirement from Southwest Airlines. I am \nproud to honor a Nevadan who has dedicated his life to serving our \ncountry.\n  As an attendee of the U.S. Naval Academy, Mr. Brunelli was deployed \nall over the world, including Vietnam, where the love of his country \nand the want to serve began. After graduation, he attended flight \nschool in Pensacola, earning his Navy pilot wings. Duke then went on to \ncomplete jet transition training in San Diego and completed eight \nassignments aboard aircraft carriers. Through his accomplishments, Duke \nwas promoted to commanding officer of the Golden Eagles, which were \ndesignated the safest jet-setting squadron in the Navy, while also \ngraduating more pilots than any other squadron.\n  After completing his tour as commanding officer, Duke was ordered \naboard the USS Midway, where he was involved in combat operations \nduring Operation Desert Storm. He also successfully brought the Navy's \noldest fleet carrier back to San Diego for decommissioning, where today \nit stands as a museum. Returning to Japan, Duke finished out his naval \ncareer as Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations for Commander Fleet \nAir Western Pacific, where he retired from the Navy in 1994. Upon his \nretirement from the Navy, Mr. Brunelli started work as a commericial \npilot, flying for Polar Air Cargo and Southwest Airlines for the past \n20 years.\n  I extend my deepest gratitude to Duke Brunelli for his courageous \ncontributions to the United States of America and to freedom-loving \nnations around the world. His service to his country, and his bravery \nand dedication earn him a place among the outstanding men and women who \nhave valiantly defended our nation. As a member of the Senate Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, I recognize that Congress has a responsibility not \nonly to honor these brave individuals who serve our Nation, but also to \nensure they are cared for when they return home. I remain committed to \nupholding this promise for our veterans and servicemembers in Nevada \nand throughout the nation.\n  Throughout his tenure, Duke has demonstrated professionalism, \ncommitment to excellence, and dedication to the highest standards of \nthe U.S. Navy.

I ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing Mr. Brunelli for all of his accomplishments and wish him \nwell in all of his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/12/senate-section/article/S2908-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NEVADA SCHOLARSHIP RECIPIENTS\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize four of \nNevada's brightest students--Erika Carrera, Miguel Gonzalez, Jose \nSolorio, and Mary Tatlock--for being awarded the coveted Gates \nMillennium Scholarship.\n  There are only 1,000 recipients of the Gates Millennium Scholarship \nthroughout the United States each year, and the Silver State has been \nfortunate to be the home to four of them. Erika Carrera, who attends \nthe Veterans Tribute Career and Technical Academy; Miguel Gonzalez of \nChaparral High School; Jose Solorio of Hug High School; and Mary \nTatlock of Las Vegas Academy will represent Nevada in this esteemed \nprogram. Each of these students have been awarded the opportunity to \ncontinue learning through higher education institutions, and I expect \ngreat things to come from each of them.\n  These students' academic accomplishments serve to reinforce the \nimportant role of education in our State. As the father of four and \nhusband to a lifelong teacher, ensuring that all of Nevada's students \nhave access to a high-quality education is important to me.

I wish to recognize a small business \nin my home State of Idaho that provides an invaluable service. There is \nsomething special about businesses that dedicate themselves to \nproviding and improving life-saving equipment. Search and rescue teams, \nfirst responders, and emergency medical technicians hold a high \nstandard for what they will purchase, because there is no margin for \nerror. It gives me great pleasure to honor Cascade Rescue Company of \nSandpoint, ID.\n  In 1962, Victor Bradley was volunteering his time to help injured \nskiers in Washington State. Pulling someone on the toboggans in use in \nthe 1960s was incredibly strenuous, especially if several people needed \nhelp. Mr. Bradley knew that there must be a better design. Mr. Bradley \nspent several years designing and improving sleds, until in 1966 he \ndecided to start the Cascade Toboggan & Rescue Equipment Company.\n  Mr. Bradley and his son Robert obtained a patent for their design and \nbegan selling toboggans to rescue professionals throughout the region. \nOrders grew exponentially, especially after a demonstration at Lake \nPlacid drew national attention. Robert Bradley took the reins from his \nfather in the early 1970s, and helped develop Cascade Toboggan into an \ninternationally respected brand.\n  Ownership later transitioned to Dana and Susan Jordan, relatives of \nthe Bradleys, who are the current owners and operators. To better fit \nthe over 150 products being provided, they renamed the business Cascade \nRescue Company, which is based in Sandpoint, ID. Today, the company \nprovides rescue equipment across America and to 23 other countries.\n  So often, we measure success in terms of dollars and cents. While \nCascade Rescue Company has a strong bottom line, they can also be proud \nof having been a vital component of countless life-saving responses. \nSki patrols, firefighters, and medical technicians rely on Cascade \nproducts every day to safely and effectively do their jobs. I \ncongratulate Cascade Rescue Company for nearly 50 years of growth, \ndedication, and service and wish them well in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/12/senate-section/article/S2908-4", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2908-S2909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATING MARELLI'S MARKET\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Marelli's \nMarket in Hampton, NH, on celebrating their 100th anniversary.\n  Opened in 1914 by Italian immigrants Luigi and Celestina Marelli, \nMarelli's has been serving traditional Italian fare, including cigars, \nolive oil, and homemade ice creams, to generations of families in the \nHampton community. They are most well-known for their world-famous \nroasted cashews and peanuts, which the family continues to roast \nthemselves.\n  Today Marelli's is run by Luigi and Celestina's sons, Richard and \nBobby, and grandchildren, Karen Raynes and Marcia Hannon-Buber, and the \nmarket has remained a cornerstone of the Hampton community. The market \nwas recently entered into the New Hampshire State Register of Historic \nPlaces, a testament to its place in our State's history.\n\n[[Page S2909]]\n\n  Karen and Marcia have marked this celebration with a book entitled \n``Marelli's Market: The First 100 Years in Hampton, NH.''

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \n60th anniversary of the New England Chapter of the American Public \nWorks Association.\n  Sixty years ago marked the first meeting of the New England Chapter \nof the American Public Works Association, which includes Massachusetts, \nVermont, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and my home State of New Hampshire. \nThis organization has been an integral part of our State, bridging our \npast to our future through education and public service.\n  The members of this dedicated organization have built the \ninfrastructure, from highways to water supply treatment systems, that \nis critical to New Hampshire's well-being and economic strength.\n  As a former Governor of New Hampshire, I understand the importance of \nthis organization and the positive impacts of their work on all New \nHampshire residents. During my time as Governor, I appointed an \nAmerican Public Works member, Carl Quiram, to the New Hampshire Solid \nWaste Task Force, which was designed to study the effects of limited \ndisposal capacity for solid waste in our State. His work and the work \nof all the members of the New England Chapter of the American Public \nWorks Association have had truly meaningful impacts on the lives of \nresidents in New Hampshire and around the country.\n  It is my honor to recognize the New England Chapter of the American \nPublic Works Association's 60th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/12/senate-section/article/S2909-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BILL MARCELLO\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I wish to honor Bill Marcello for \nhis 45 years of service to New Hampshire and thank him for his endless \ndedication to Southwestern Community Services and the people of our \nState.\n  A Portsmouth native, Bill went to Keene State College, where he \nearned a teaching certificate. From then on, he dedicated his entire \ncareer to serving southwestern New Hampshire, first working as a \nteacher at Head Start in Keene.\n  In 1978, Bill was named deputy director of Southwestern Community \nServices and soon rose to the position of CEO. Under his leadership, \nSouthwestern Community Services has provided housing, jobs, and fuel \nassistance to those in need, while also serving as the lead agency in \nthe area for Head Start, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for \nWomen, Infants, and Children, New Hope New Horizons, and a host of \nother community programs.\n  With Bill's leadership, Southwestern Community Services now serves \nmore than 30,000 residents in 38 communities, accounting for $30 \nmillion in annual economic impact.\n  New Hampshire has always been able to turn to Bill in times of need. \nWhen flooding hit the State's southwest region in 2005, residents \nlooked to Bill to help recover and rebuild. When someone in Sullivan or \nCheshire counties has needed skills training to find a job or help with \nheating their home, they have found support in Bill and Southwestern \nCommunity Services. He has worked tirelessly his entire career for New \nHampshire families.\n  On behalf of New Hampshire and the countless lives Bill has touched, \nI thank him for his leadership and determination to serve Granite \nStaters in need. I ask my colleagues and all Americans to join me in \ncelebrating the selfless service that Bill has given to his community \nand congratulating him on his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/12/senate-section/article/S2909-3", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/12/senate-section/article/S2909-4", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/12/senate-section/article/S2909-5", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2014, \nthe following enrolled bill, previously signed by the Speaker of the \nHouse, was signed on May 9, 2014, during the adjournment of the Senate, \nby the President pro tempore (Mr. Leahy):\n\n       H.R. 3627.

A bill to restrict confidentiality agreements that prohibit \nthe disclosure of information relating to hazards to public safety or \nhealth, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nSafety over Secrecy Act, which prohibits courts from enforcing \nconfidentiality agreements in the settlement of civil suits involving \nhazards to public health and safety. This bill will ensure that \nplaintiffs in such suits do not have to remain silent about their \nexperiences as a condition of settling their disputes.\n  While confidentiality agreements can be useful tools to protect \nsensitive information and trade secrets, too often they are used to \nhide important safety concerns from regulators, policymakers, the news \nmedia, public health experts, and the general public. Over the past 20 \nyears, we have learned of numerous cases where court-approved secrecy \nhas shielded serious public health and safety dangers from the public--\nputting hundreds, if not thousands, of lives at risk. These cases have \ninvolved hydraulic fracturing, or ``fracking,'' asbestos, defective \nauto components, and ``adverse incidents'' from drugs.\n  Typically in these cases, victims face large corporations that can \nspend unlimited amounts of money defending lawsuits and prolonging \ntheir resolution. Faced with mounting litigation expenses and medical \nbills, plaintiffs often seek to settle their suits. In exchange for \ndamages, they are forced to agree to provisions that prohibit them from \ndiscussing their cases or revealing information disclosed during \nlitigation. Defendants are thus able to keep damaging information from \ngetting out. As a result the public, as well as regulatory agencies, \nremain unaware of the risks.\n  Let us take fracking, where drillers from Pennsylvania to Arkansas \nand Wyoming to Texas have entered into cash settlements or property \nbuyouts with individuals who claim fracking has contaminated their \nwater and polluted their air. In the vast majority of these cases, the \ncost of the awards has been the plaintiffs' silence. As Aaron \nBernstein, associate director of the Center for Health and the Global \nEnvironment at the Harvard School of Public Health, put it in an \ninterview, non-disclosure agreements ``have interfered with the ability \nof scientists and public health experts to understand what is at \nstake'' in the country's quickly evolving energy infrastructure.\n  Perhaps the most notorious case of fracking hush money is the \nHallowich case. In that case, Chris and Stephanie Hallowich's dream \nhouse--built on acres of land in southwestern Pennsylvania--turned out \nto be sitting atop the Marcellus Shale, one of the biggest fracking \noperations in the country. The previous land owner had leased the \nmineral rights to various gas companies. Soon after moving in, Chris,\n\n[[Page S2913]]\n\nStephanie, and their young children began experiencing headaches, nose \nbleeds, burning eyes, and sore throats. After complaining for three \nyears of what they concluded were the side effects of contaminated air \nand water, the Hallowiches brought suit. Without accepting \nresponsibility for any health effects, the companies agreed to pay the \nHallowiches $750,000 so that they could move off the property, in \nexchange for the Hallowiches' promise to remain silent about the case. \nThe case gained international attention when the Pittsburg Gazette \nobtained an unsealed settlement transcript 2 years later and discovered \nthat the Hallowiches' 7 and ten year-old children had been gagged for \nlife along with their parents under the confidentiality agreement. \nNeedless to say, these gag orders make it difficult to challenge \nindustry claims about the safety of the fracking process. Fracking is \njust one of many areas where defendants impose secrecy as a condition \nof settlement.\n  Under current law, judges are not specifically required to consider \nthe public interest when determining the enforceability of \nconfidentiality ageements. In cases involving hazards to public health \nand safety, and only in those cases, this bill would change that, and \nwould require judges to balance a party's specific interest in \nconfidentiality against the public interest in disclosure of \ninformation when approving or enforcing confidentiality agreements. My \nbill would not prohibit secrecy agreements across the board because \nthere are appropriate uses for such agreements, including protecting \ntrade secrets and other confidential company and personal information. \nGiven its narrow scope, this bill would not place undue burdens on our \njudges or judiciary system.\n  In introducing the Safety over Secrecy Act, I want to recognize \nformer Senator Kohl and his Sunshine in Litigation Act, which he \nintroduced in various forms between 1995 and 2011. That bill, which I \nwas proud to support in the Judiciary Committee, was a broader version \nof the legislation I have just introduced. I supported that bill when \nSenator Kohl introduced it, and I plan to offer my full support when it \nis introduced again in this chamber.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/12/senate-section/article/S2913-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3055.
