Mr. President, for 38 straight months private sector \ncompanies have added new jobs and put Americans back to work, 7 million \nAmericans in all. They have done it in spite of economic policies that \nhampered growth--harsh austerity policies Republicans have forced on \nthe economy for the last 2 years. Yet the Dow Jones Industrial Average \nand the other indicators hit an all-time high last week and the \nmanufacturing sector remains strong.\n  While the economy isn't back to full strength, and that certainly is \nthe truth, last week's job report shows we have made remarkable \nprogress in 3 years. But just imagine how strong job growth could have \nbeen if Republicans had not insisted on round after round of meat axe \nbudget cuts that undercut economic expansion.\n  Every expert, every respected economist says the best way to \nencourage a recovery, the best way to create jobs is with targeted \ninvestments and balanced deficit reduction. The most responsible way to \nreduce our deficit is to get away from short-term fixes, last-minute \nnegotiations and, instead, pursue a responsible budget process. We \ncan't begin to find common ground if we never get to the negotiating \ntable. That is why again today I will ask unanimous consent to go to \nconference with the House on the budget, the budget that we passed.\n  For 2 years my Republican colleagues have complained the Senate had \nnot passed a budget resolution, even though we had enacted a budget \nwith the force of law and signed by President Obama. Remember, a budget \nresolution is just an inter-Congress matter. It doesn't have anything \nto do with the President. He doesn't have to sign that, but we enacted \na budget with the force of law and signed by President Obama.\n  The Republicans complained and complained: Why didn't we do a budget \nresolution? We had something much better than a budget resolution, but \nfor 2 years Republicans longed for the days of regular order. We know \nbecause they told us so. They wanted amendments; we gave them \namendments. They wanted bills to go through committee; they got bills \nreported out of committees. Republicans were desperate for the Senate \nto vote on a budget resolution that would set spending priorities for \nthe fiscal year. They got them. We passed a budget resolution under \nregular order, complete with a late-night budget vote-arama that lasted \nuntil 5 a.m. that included more than 100 individual votes. Still, the \nHouse has refused to go to conference with us. Since they got what they \nclaimed they wanted, their interest in regular order has not just \nwaned, it disappeared.\n  They don't want to go to conference as we would under the regular \norder--that they said they wanted. They don't even want to name \nconferees. We tried to get that out of this body.\n  The ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee admitted these \nstall tactics were an effort to provide political cover for his \ncolleagues in the House. This is what he said:\n\n       There are difficulties in the fact that we haven't been \n     able to have any understanding on how this conference might \n     work and what prospects we have for success might be. I think \n     it's possible that we could succeed, but at this point we're \n     not close enough to anticipate a successful conference and \n     that presents complications for the House.\n\n  Can you imagine? They don't have any understanding how this \nconference might work. Well, probably one of the\n\n[[Page S3070]]\n\nreasons he doesn't have an understanding of how a conference works is \nbecause they have stopped us from going to conference on virtually \neverything.\n  He also says: We don't know what the prospects are for success. That \nis what conference is all about. The Senate passes a bill, the House \npasses a bill, and we sit down and try to work it out.\n  He said:\n\n       I think it's possible that we could succeed, but at this \n     point we're not close enough to anticipate a successful \n     conference, and that presents complications for the House.\n\n  We are the United States Senate, not the United States House of \nRepresentatives. We should do our business and not be worried about the \ntea party-driven House of Representatives. The budget process is the \nonly way to work through our differences without bringing the country \nto the brink of another artificial crisis. To accelerate job growth and \nreduce the deficit without harming the economy, we have to make \nimportant and smart spending cuts, while asking the most fortunate \namong us to do a little better, contribute a little more.\n  The arbitrary across-the-board cuts of the so-called sequester do \njust the exact opposite. The sequester uses a meat cleaver where a \nscalpel is needed. The sequester cuts were designed to be too painful--\nso painful they would force the supercommittee to reach a bipartisan \ncompromise. We all remember what happened there. Republicans refused to \nallow one penny of revenue. When they did that, they insisted on a \ncuts-only approach. They ensured the sequester would kick in.\n  Eliminating sequester is part of a larger challenge: to set sound \nlong-term fiscal policy through the regular order of the budget \nprocess, which they said they wanted--they, the Republicans. Now they \nhave walked away from it. That will take cooperation. Remember, \nDemocrats and Republicans voted for these arbitrary cuts, and Democrats \nand Republicans will have to work together to reverse them.\n  Why are my Republican colleagues so afraid? We know the two sides \nwill not agree on every aspect of the budget. We know finding common \nground will not be easy.\n  We can get it done. We used to do it until we have been stopped from \ndoing everything by a tea party-driven House of Representatives and the \nstrongly influenced Republicans in the Senate by the tea party. \nRepublicans believe in one set of principles for how the government \nshould spend money and how it should save money.\n  Democrats have very different principles. Republicans would lower \ntaxes for the rich while the middle class foots the bill. Democrats \nwould ask the wealthiest individuals and corporations to contribute a \nlittle more to reduce the deficit. Republicans would turn Medicaid into \na voucher program, in effect doing away with Medicaid as we know it.\n  Democrats would preserve and protect Medicare for future generations. \nRepublicans would use more harsh austerity to reduce the deficit. \nDemocrats would adopt a balanced approach that couples smart spending \ncuts with new revenue from closing loopholes.\n  Remember, we have already cut more than $2.5 trillion from the debt. \nWe have our differences, but Democrats aren't afraid to work out those \ndifferences. We are ready to go to conference to begin the difficult \nwork of compromise.\n  If this Congress is serious about reducing the deficit and protecting \nthe economy, we need to go to work now, not wait until this minor \nimpasse--and that is what it is--turns into another major manufactured \ncrisis, which the House loves to send to us at the last minute.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/06/senate-section/article/S3070-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.

Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote \nfor the Marketplace Fairness Act in just over an hour or so from now. I \nhave said many times over the past few weeks--and, in fact, I have been \nsaying it for the past 12 years as I have worked on this issue, but it \nis worth repeating--this bill is about fairness. It is about leveling \nthe playing field between the brick and mortar and online companies and \nit is about collecting a tax that is already due. It is not about \nraising taxes, taxing the Internet, or taxing Internet access.\n  This bill in general, and this bill in particular, has grabbed the \nattention of Members of the Senate and their constituents back home. \nUnfortunately, the misinformation that is being disseminated by many \nhas added confusion and anxiety about what the bill does and does not \ndo. For example, the Americans For Tax Reform sent me a detailed letter \nlast week asking many questions. It appears the letter was not meant to \nfind resolution or a path forward with this issue but ultimately to \nconfuse my colleagues prior to tonight's vote. Senator Alexander and I \nresponded to the 16 questions in order to provide clarity for the \norganization and its members.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe two letters to which I just referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                     Americans for Tax Reform,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 2, 2013.\n     Hon. Mike Enzi,\n     Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: We believe that there are a number of \n     unanswered questions concerning the Marketplace Fairness Act \n     that remain troubling to taxpayers. We would appreciate your \n     leadership in answering the following questions regarding the \n     legislation as it stands and the recent manager's amendment \n     that you filed to S. 743, the Marketplace Fairness Act.\n       1) What measures protect businesses from tax audits, court \n     proceedings and penalties like tax liens imposed on a \n     business by state departments of revenue where the business \n     has no physical presence? How will businessmen and women be \n     protected over time from politicians in a different state \n     that they cannot vote for or against? Is there a danger of \n     establishing taxation without representation?\n       2) Does the bill prevent double taxation by removing the \n     Use Tax? If states still have a Use Tax law on the books what \n     provisions of MFA prevent states from charging Use Tax in \n     addition to sales tax?\n       3) Can states audit remote sellers for customer data and \n     then retroactively (i.e., prior\n\n[[Page S3071]]\n\n     to the enactment) audit citizens for ``unpaid'' Use Taxes? \n     Some states, such as California, can perform audits reaching \n     back six years. Can states ask remote sellers for historical \n     customer purchasing data and then audit citizens based on \n     this data?\n       4) While the legislation says that it does not break \n     physical nexus requirements for other types of taxation, some \n     states have ``privilege'' taxes already in law. Some of these \n     privilege taxes require enaction of MFA as written to enforce \n     ``privilege'' tax collections. For example Michigan law \n     states:\n       ``there shall be collected from all persons engaged in the \n     business of making sales at retail, by which ownership of \n     tangible personal property is transferred for consideration, \n     an annual tax for the privilege of engaging in that business \n     equal to 6% of the gross proceeds of the business, plus the \n     penalty and interest if applicable . . .''\n       Is there anything in MFA that prevents this type of \n     application of MFA collection standards?\n       5) If states do not conform with MFA requirements or basic \n     simplification requirements, does Section 6 of the MFA permit \n     them to continue to expand ``nexus definition'' laws? Can \n     California collect tax based on economic nexus laws? Can New \n     York collect based on affiliate nexus laws? Could Oklahoma \n     expand its reporting requirement laws across its borders?\n       6) Why are tribal lands now included as ``states'' in the \n     manager's amendment? Why were tribal lands not included in \n     the original bill? Have any of the tribes agreed to the same \n     rules the states have, or asked to be included?\n       7) During the floor debate, there were many questions on \n     how the MFA would apply to sellers based in other countries. \n     What is the enforcement process for overseas sellers with no \n     presence in the United States? Are they required to comply \n     with state tax collection duties? Under MFA, do states have \n     the ability to bring enforcement actions against overseas \n     businesses that are selling remotely into the state?\n       8) Does the MFA protect the small sellers, who would be \n     eligible for the small seller exemption, from states that \n     exercise their Section 6 discretion to expand their tax \n     collection authority through nexus definitions?\n       9) While the minimum simplification requirements preclude \n     the Streamlined Sales Tax Agreement (SSUTA), if states make \n     changes to the SSUTA after the enaction of MFA do those \n     changes become law?\n       10) Included in the manager's amendment is language that \n     clarifies that a state may not impose requirements on remote \n     sellers that they do not impose on non-remote sellers. \n     Currently, many states give special state sales tax deals for \n     businesses with in-state presence, while offering remote \n     sellers no such deal. Since this practice is giving \n     preferential treatment to in-state sellers in relation to the \n     collection and remittance of sales taxes, will this be \n     prohibited under MFA. Will there be any limitation on states \n     giving special sales tax breaks to large in-state businesses \n     while forcing strictly out-of-state businesses with no \n     presence to comply?\n       11) Under SSUTA states agreed that sales price was the cost \n     that a consumer actually paid for an item. However, Nebraska \n     wants to claim that ``sales price'' is the gross price before \n     discounts and coupons, thereby charging the business tax on \n     retail value rather than amount paid (Think discounts from \n     Groupon or Living Social. If the retail cost is $75, but the \n     discount makes it $25, Nebraska would want to collect sales \n     tax on the $75 rather than the amount actually paid, which \n     was $25). Is there anything in the MFA that prevents this \n     type of excessive taxation from occurring in Nebraska or \n     other states? From what we understand the minimum \n     requirements of MFA do not prevent this type of theoretical \n     taxing from occurring.\n       12) How could MFA requirements affect the financial \n     services sector? Will financial products that are sold over \n     the Internet, like portfolio management services, credit \n     reporting service apps, or insurance service fall under MFA \n     taxation authority?\n       13) Home-schooling parents meet at state, regional, and \n     national gatherings in part to sell used textbooks and \n     related products that their children have completed. If these \n     transactions are conducted online through an aggregation \n     site, would the transactions be subject to the MFA small-\n     seller exemption in states that exercise their Section 6 \n     discretion to expand their tax collection authority through \n     nexus definitions?\n       14) How will the MFA affect digital goods and services? \n     Without a clear structure for digital goods taxation, these \n     types of goods could fall under multiple taxation schemes. \n     Does the MFA protect digital goods from multiple taxation?\n       15) In terms of digital goods, like apps and music, who is \n     responsible for remitting the sales tax: the vendor, an app \n     store or sales platform, or the creator of the digital good?\n       16) Some states, like Maryland have different sales tax \n     rules for goods that are priced under one dollar. For \n     example:\n       Effective January 3, 2008, the Maryland sales and use tax \n     rate is 6 percent, as follows:\n        1 cent on each sale where the taxable price is 20 cents.\n        2 cents if the taxable price is at least 21 cents but less \n     than 34 cents.\n        3 cents if the taxable price is at least 34 cents but less \n     than 51 cents.\n        4 cents if the taxable price is at least 51 cents but less \n     that 67 cents.\n        5 cents if the taxable price is at least 67 cents but less \n     than 84 cents.\n        6 cents if the taxable price is at least 84 cents.\n       On each sale where the taxable price exceeds $1.00, the tax \n     is 6 cents on each exact dollar plus:\n        1 cent if the excess over an exact dollar is at least 1 \n     cent but less than 17 cents.\n        2 cents if the excess over an exact dollar is at least 17 \n     cents but less than 34 cents.\n        3 cents if the excess over an exact dollar is at least 34 \n     cents but less than 51 cents.\n        4 cents if the excess over an exact dollar is at least 51 \n     cents but less than 67 cents.\n        5 cents if the excess over an exact dollar is at least 67 \n     cents but less than 84 cents.\n        6 cents if the excess over an exact dollar is at least 84 \n     cents.\n       If Maryland, or states wishing to follow suit, do not \n     comply with SSTP or the minimum simplification requirements \n     included in MFA, can they tax low-cost goods in this way? \n     This applies in particular to digital goods like apps and \n     songs. Does the MFA require simple, flat taxes for low cost \n     and digital goods?\n       Thank you in advance for your consideration and response to \n     our concerns. I look forward to working with you to address \n     these issues and ensure no legislation is passed that harms \n     taxpayers nationwide.

Is there a danger of \n     establishing taxation without representation?\n       The Marketplace Fairness Act (MFA) includes many \n     significant benefits for remote sellers, including limits on \n     audits, critical liability protection, and tax and \n     administrative simplification. It is also important to \n     remember that the sales tax is imposed on the consumer by the \n     state where they reside, so that is the ultimate check \n     against excessive taxation. Because the tax is imposed on the \n     consumer, there is no danger of taxation without \n     representation.\n       2) Does the bill prevent double taxation by removing the \n     Use Tax? If states still have a Use Tax law on the books what \n     provisions of MFA prevent states from charging Use Tax in \n     addition to sales tax?\n       There is not double taxation between a sales tax and a use \n     tax. A Sales tax is imposed by states on applicable \n     transactions. A use tax only applies if the sales tax is not \n     collected or imposed.\n       3) Can states audit remote sellers for customer data and \n     then retroactively (i.e., prior to the enactment) audit \n     citizens for ``unpaid'' Use Taxes? Some states, such as \n     California, can perform audits reaching back six years. Can \n     states ask remote sellers for historical customer purchasing \n     data and then audit citizens based on this data?\n       No. The authority provided by the MFA is prospective and \n     builds in considerable ``waiting periods'' before states can \n     exercise collection authority after they have adopted the \n     minimum simplification requirements.\n       4) While the legislation says that it does not break \n     physical nexus requirements for other types of taxation, some \n     states have ``privilege'' taxes already in law. Some of these \n     privilege taxes require enaction of MFA as written to enforce \n     ``privilege'' tax collections. For example Michigan law \n     states:\n       ``there shall be collected from all persons engaged in the \n     business of making sales at retail, by which ownership of \n     tangible personal property is transferred for consideration, \n     an annual tax for the privilege of engaging in that business \n     equal to 6% of the gross proceeds of the business, plus the \n     penalty and interest if applicable . . .''\n       Is there anything in MFA that prevents this type of \n     application of MFA collection standards?\n       Sales and use taxes are often called by different names, \n     such as the general excise tax in Hawaii, the gross receipts \n     tax in New Mexico or the transaction privilege tax in \n     Arizona. All of these taxes are sales and use taxes, where \n     the retailer is authorized (and in most cases required) to \n     collect the tax directly from the consumer and to identify \n     the tax on the consumer's invoice or receipt.\n       5) If states do not conform with the MFA requirements or \n     basic simplification requirements, does Section 6 of the MFA \n     permit them to continue to expand ``nexus definition'' laws? \n     Can California collect tax based on economic nexus laws? Can \n     New York collect based on affiliate nexus laws? Could \n     Oklahoma expand its reporting requirement laws across its \n     borders?\n       Section 6 does not alter nexus standards, as interpreted by \n     the Supreme Court. The\n\n[[Page S3072]]\n\n     Supreme Court has declined to extend the ``physical \n     presence'' standard beyond sales taxes, and it has not taken \n     any cases to clarify the constitutionality of ``economic \n     nexus'' laws. Other Supreme Court decisions, such as Scripto \n     and Tyler Pipe, have made clear that in regard to sales tax, \n     affiliates and independent contractors can create physical \n     presence for sales tax collection purposes. The MFA addresses \n     these problems by setting specific standards for states who \n     wish to require remote sellers to collect state sales taxes.\n       6) Why are tribal lands now included as ``states'' in the \n     manager's amendment? Why were tribal lands not included in \n     the original bill? Have any of the tribes agreed to the same \n     rules the states have, or asked to be included?\n       Tribal governments are required to meet the same conditions \n     as states choosing to participate. Tribal governments were \n     included in earlier versions of this legislation, and they \n     requested that they also be given the ability to collect \n     sales taxes if they choose to exercise the authority granted \n     by this legislation.\n       7) During the floor debate, there were many questions on \n     how the MFA would apply to sellers based in other countries. \n     What is the enforcement process for overseas sellers with no \n     presence in the United States? Are they required to comply \n     with state tax collection duties? Under MFA, do states have \n     the ability to bring enforcement actions against overseas \n     businesses that are selling remotely into the state?\n       States currently enforce collection of state taxes against \n     foreign businesses with no physical presence in the United \n     States, and have a number of methods to compel collection by \n     foreign sellers including liens, levies and seizure of \n     assets. The MA treats foreign corporations the same as it \n     does domestic corporations. All online retailers that make \n     over $1 million in remote sales, regardless of where the \n     retailer is located, must collect and remit sales tax to \n     states that require it.\n       8) Does the MFA protect the small sellers, who would be \n     eligible for the small seller exemption, from states that \n     exercise their Section 6 discretion to expand their tax \n     collection authority through nexus definitions?\n       The MFA does not alter nexus standards, as interpreted by \n     the Supreme Court.\n       9) While the minimum simplification requirements preclude \n     the Streamlined Sales Tax Agreement (SSUTA), if states make \n     changes to the SSUTA after the enaction of MFA, do those \n     changes become law?\n       The MFA does not ``preclude'' the SSUTA, and changes to the \n     SSUTA have no force of law because any changes to the \n     agreement must be enacted by individual states and their \n     legislatures. The MFA recognizes that the SSUTA already \n     incorporates the simplifications and protections embodied \n     within the MFA. Thus, states that have already enacted laws \n     to comply with SSUTA are granted authority by the MFA to \n     require remote sellers to collect tax. The MFA also ensures \n     that future changes to the SSUTA meet the simplifications and \n     protections provided in the MFA.\n       10) Included in the manager's amendment is language that \n     clarifies that a state may not impose requirements on remote \n     sellers that they do not impose on non-remote sellers. \n     Currently, many states give special state sales tax deals for \n     businesses with in-state presence, while offering remote \n     sellers no such deal. Since this practice is giving \n     preferential treatment to in-state sellers in relation to the \n     collection and remittance of sales taxes, will this be \n     prohibited under MFA? Will there be any limitation on states \n     giving special sales tax breaks to large in-state businesses \n     while forcing strictly out-of-state businesses with no \n     presence to comply?\n       The MFA does not dictate to the states how they structure \n     their state tax systems; to do so would be a fundamental \n     violation of state sovereignty and the constitutional \n     framework of our government embodied by the 10th Amendment. \n     The MFA simply grants states the authority to enforce state \n     sales tax laws on remote sales.\n       11) Under SSUTA, states agreed that sales price was the \n     cost that a consumer actually paid for an item. However, \n     Nebraska wants to claim that ``sales price'' is the gross \n     price before discounts and coupons, thereby charging the \n     business tax on retail value rather than amount paid (Think \n     discounts from Groupon or Living Social. If the retail cost \n     is $75, but the discount makes it $25, Nebraska would want to \n     collect sales tax on the $75 rather than the amount actually \n     paid, which was $25). Is there anything in the MFA that \n     prevents this type of excessive taxation from occurring in \n     Nebraska or other states? From what we understand the minimum \n     requirements of MFA do not prevent this type of theoretical \n     taxing from occurring.\n       The MFA does not dictate to the states how they structure \n     their state tax systems. Residents of Nebraska, not \n     Washington, should determine the appropriate level of state \n     taxation in Nebraska.\n       12) How could MFA requirements affect the financial \n     services sector? Will financial products that are sold over \n     the Internet, like portfolio management services, credit \n     reporting service apps, or insurance service fall under MFA \n     taxation authority?\n       The MFA does not affect the financial service sector, and \n     no state imposes a sales tax on financial transactions.\n       13) Home-schooling parents meet at state, regional, and \n     national gatherings in part to sell used textbooks and \n     related products that their children have completed. If these \n     transactions are conducted online through an aggregation \n     site, would the transactions be subject to the MFA small-\n     seller exemption in states that exercise their Section 6 \n     discretion to expand their tax collection authority through \n     nexus definitions?\n       The small seller exemption applies to all remote sellers, \n     and no discretion is given to states with respect to the \n     amount of the small seller exemption. The term ``remote \n     seller'' is defined in the bill and means a person that makes \n     remote sales. Only individual remote sellers who make more \n     than $1 million in remote sales each year can be required to \n     collect state sales taxes.\n       14) How will the MFA affect digital goods and services? \n     Without a clear structure for digital goods taxation, these \n     types of goods could fall under multiple taxation schemes. \n     Does the MFA protect digital goods from multiple taxation?\n       The MFA does not affect the taxability of goods, digital or \n     otherwise.\n       15) In terms of digital goods, like apps and music, who is \n     responsible for remitting the sales tax: the vendor, an app \n     store or sales platform, or the creator of the digital good?\n       The person responsible for remitting sales tax is exactly \n     the same under the MFA as it is under current state law. The \n     question under state law remains as it always has: who is \n     making the ``sale'' as defined in state law? The party making \n     the ``sale'' first collects and then remits the tax.\n       16) Some states, like Maryland have different sales tax \n     rules for goods that are priced under one dollar. For \n     example:\n       Effective January 3, 2008, the Maryland sales and use tax \n     rate is 6 percent, as follows:\n       1 cent on each sale where the taxable price is 20 cents.\n       2 cents if the taxable price is at least 21 cents but less \n     than 34 cents.\n       3 cents if the taxable price is at least 34 cents but less \n     than 51 cents.\n       4 cents if the taxable price is at least 51 cents but less \n     that 67 cents.\n       5 cents if the taxable price is at least 67 cents but less \n     than 84 cents.\n       6 cents if the taxable price is at least 84 cents.\n       On each sale where the taxable price exceeds $1.00, the tax \n     is 6 cents on each exact dollar plus:\n       1 cent if the excess over an exact dollar is at least 1 \n     cent but less than 17 cents.\n       2 cents if the excess over an exact dollar is at least 17 \n     cents but less than 34 cents.\n       3 cents if the excess over an exact dollar is at least 34 \n     cents but less than 51 cents.\n       4 cents if the excess over an exact dollar is at least 51 \n     cents but less than 67 cents.\n       5 cents if the excess over an exact dollar is at least 67 \n     cents but less than 84 cents.\n       6 cents if the excess over an exact dollar is at least 84 \n     cents.\n       If Maryland, or states wishing to follow suit, do not \n     comply with SSTP or the minimum simplification requirements \n     included in MFA, can they tax low-cost goods in this way? \n     This applies in particular to digital goods like apps and \n     songs. Does the MFA require simple, flat taxes for low cost \n     and digital goods?\n       The MFA does not require states to adopt the SSUTA. In \n     fact, the legislation does not require states to do anything. \n     However, states must adhere to the simplifications and \n     protections provided in the MFA if they choose to simplify \n     their tax systems and require remote sellers to collect state \n     taxes.\n       The table reproduced above is an if/then statement of the \n     kind that computers have been able to process for decades. In \n     other words, this apparently complicated rounding method \n     isn't complicated at all for computers to process.\n       Thank you for giving us the opportunity to respond to your \n     questions. We look forward to working with you to address \n     these issues as we move forward with the enactment of the \n     Marketplace Fairness Act.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael B. Enzi,\n       U.S. Senate.\n     Lamar Alexander,\n       U.S. Senate.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I would encourage everyone to read the bill. It is short--\n11 pages. You don't see many like this. You can see through that; \nright? It is a bill you can read from beginning to end and you can \nunderstand what it does, which is very unusual for Washington. It is \nnot like a lot of bills that simply make changes to other bills and \nrequire you get hold of those other bills and read them to figure out \nwhat is going on. This bill is straightforward.\n  If a State meets the simplification requirements outlined in the \nbill, it may choose to require collection of sales taxes that are \nalready due. Congress is not forcing States to do anything. And if \nStates do act, they are collecting taxes already due by consumers--\nfolks such as you and me.\n  One of the issues that received much attention while debating this \nbill the past few weeks is the issue on audits. There is some concern \nsmall businesses will be subjected to onerous and time-consuming audits \nby State and local governments if those governments start requiring \nthey collect sales taxes on these remote sales. It is critical to keep \nin mind that sellers that have under $1 million in remote sales in 1 \nyear are not required to collect and\n\n[[Page S3073]]\n\nwould not be subject to an audit from any out-of-State government.\n  In order to obtain authority to require remote sellers to collect, \nand therefore even have the potential of being audited by remote \ngovernments, States either must join the Streamlined Sales Tax and Use \nAgreement--and I will refer to that as the Streamlined States--or they \ncan simplify their tax structure by creating a single entity within the \nState responsible for all State and local taxes and use tax \nadministration and audits; establishing a single audit statewide; \nlimiting collection to a uniform State and local tax base; allowing a \nsingle sales and use tax return; and providing the program to figure \nthe tax with no liability to the retailer and, therefore, no need for \nan audit.\n  For States that join the Streamlined Sales Tax and Use Agreement, a \nremote business would only be subject to a single audit for \nparticipating streamlined States, eliminating the possibility of audits \nby local governments and the probability of an audit.\n  For States that do not join the streamlined States but choose to \nparticipate in the alternative simplification system outlined in the \nbill, a business would also be limited to a single audit, per State, \nper year.\n  Practically speaking, there is no possibility that streamlined States \nor non-streamlined States would ever be able to perform significant \naudits of remote sellers.\n  Today, the States audit less than 1 percent of retailers inside their \nborders. Auditing remote sellers would require additional resources and \ntravel and is simply not a realistic possibility.\n  For audits that are performed under the new system, the Marketplace \nFairness Act demands that States adopt uniform audit procedures which \nwould simplify and reduce business administrative expenses.\n  Sellers who use the certified sales tax administration software would \neither not be audited or would have limited scope audits to determine \nthat the software was properly installed.\n  In addition to the audit protection the Marketplace Fairness Act \nprovides, participating States are required to establish and maintain \nan accessible database of geographically based tax rates and tax base \ninformation to make it easier for remote sellers to collect taxes. \nThese states are also required to hold those sellers harmless for \nerrors in the database.\n  Compared to today's sales tax administration, where sellers are \nexpected to research and comply with tax rate and tax base information \nand to understand jurisdictional boundaries without help from the state \nand local governments, the Marketplace Fairness Act dramatically \nreduces administrative burden and audit risk.\n  Some opposed to this bill go so far as to say that this potential \noverreach of State and local governments will lead to taxation without \nrepresentation. The Marketplace Fairness Act includes significant \nbenefits for remote sellers, including limits on audits, liability \nprotections, and tax and administrative simplification. The tax is \nimposed on the consumer by the State where they reside pursuant to tax \nrates and a tax base established by the State and local governments. \nThis serves as the ultimate check on excessive taxation. Because this \ntax is imposed on the consumer, there is no danger of taxation without \nrepresentation.\n  Another concern raised by a few of my colleagues is that businesses \nwill leave the United States, set up shop outside our borders, and sell \ninto the United States, presumably only because of a sales tax \ncollection requirement. It is important to note that States currently \nenforce collection of State taxes against foreign businesses with no \nphysical presence in the United States, and have a number of methods to \ncompel collection by foreign sellers, including liens, levies, and \nseizure of assets. The Marketplace Fairness Act treats foreign \ncorporations the same as it does domestic corporations. All online \nretailers that make over $1 million in remote sales, regardless of \nwhere the retailer is located, must collect and remit sales tax to \nStates that require it.\n  I would say this. No one works on a bill such as this, works on it 12 \nyears, as a popularity contest. You have to be doing what is right. I \nhave listened to the people, talked to the people, and know this is \nsomething that is going to be necessary to keep Main Street in business \nso people will have the ability to go to the store and make a selection \nand try the goods, feel the goods, and know it is right and that \nretailer is not going to have to worry about the person using their \niPhone to get the barcode and order it from somebody else because of a \nsales tax difference. That is what will keep Main Street viable and the \ndowntowns making it look like there is a growing community.\n  In conclusion, I thank everyone associated with this bill for their \nhard work and efforts in getting us to this point. I thank Senators \nAlexander, Durbin, and Heitkamp for their unwavering support of this \nbill and moving it forward in the Senate. I thank all of the cosponsors \nof the bill. I very much appreciate their support. I thank all the \nbusinesses, the trade groups, the constituents who provided \nconstructive feedback as we have attempted to address, as best we can, \nall the concerns that have been raised.\n  I thank all of the staff who have worked on this issue--on my staff, \nmy legislative director Randi Reid. She has worked on this as long as I \nhave. She is probably, on the Hill if not the country, the expert on \nmarketplace fairness or any of the other titles this kind of bill may \nhave had.\n  I also thank my tax counsel, Eric Oman; Corey Tellez, Beth Cook, Dena \nMorris, Reema Dodin, MJ Kenny; Ben Garmisa on Senator Durbin's Staff; \nAllison Martin, Michael Merrell, and David Cleary on Senator \nAlexander's staff; Jillian Fitzpatrick on Senator Heitkamp's staff; and \nall of the staffs of the bill's cosponsors and all of the people in \noffices that have been taken into the process so we could get the \nprocess to work. It is always a team effort, and it takes more than \nones who are just leading the effort. I know there are an immeasurable \nnumber of hours they have put in on this issue and I thank all of them \nfor their hard work.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my House colleagues, \nCongressman Womack, Congresswoman Speier, Congressman Conyers, and \nCongressman Welch, as they push forward to the House passage of the \nMarketplace Fairness Act.\n  I also thank Senator Durbin for all of his energy on this bill, the \nperspective he was able to bring to the bill and his tremendous ability \nto communicate the issues. I thank Senator Alexander. We were working \non a much bigger bill until Senator Alexander lent some expertise to \nmake this a much simpler one, one that is completely readable and only \n11 pages.\n  I think that covers most of the objections. There will be some from \nthe States that do not charge a sales tax at all because if their \nbusinesses exceed $1 million in on-line sales, then they will have to. \nIf they sell into States that collect the sales tax, they would have to \nparticipate in the collection of that.\n  As we push forward with House passage of the Marketplace Fairness Act \nand as we finish in the Senate tonight, as I am confident we will, I \nthank all who are participating in it, particularly the people of \ncourage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today the Senate is voting on whether to \ntake a few more inches off the little guy. I say that because we can \ntell what this debate is all about by looking at the morning newspaper. \nAll over those newspapers we saw ads taken out by some of the biggest \nbusinesses in the country. It is pretty easy to see why. It is because \nwith this vote for the so-called Marketplace Fairness Act, what we have \nis big businesses being given the ability to force--force, mind you--\nnew regulations onto the startups, onto the small businesses. That is \nwhat this bill has always been about.\n  The big businesses have physical presence. They already pay taxes. \nThe people whom we have said we care about, for the last 15 years, are \nthe startups, the people who are just trying to get off the ground, who \nhave the dream of one day being big. With this proposal that we will \nvote on in an hour, I fear what we are going to do is crush a lot of \nthose startups, a lot of those small businesses, because not only will \nthey have new regulations,\n\n[[Page S3074]]\n\nthose small businesses will have new legal regimes, new audits by out-\nof-State regulators, new legislators, new Governors, new court systems, \nnew accountants, new software, new consultants, and new lawyers. What I \nhope we will do is ensure, as this process goes forward, that we truly \nthink through the implications of what is being done because on every \ncount it is coercive and discriminatory in nature. It, in fact, gives a \nleg up to foreign retailers. It, in effect, repudiates a lot of what we \nhave done over the last 15 years to build a sensible policy that will \nensure what I call prosperity for both bricks and clicks.\n  I am sure that is what the Presiding Officer of the Senate wants. It \nis what we want in Oregon. We want our brick-and-mortar stores to \nprosper. We want our online stores to prosper. What this bill does is \nit precipitously overturns the law of the land, the law of the land \nupheld by the Supreme Court. It would, in unprecedented fashion, \nstipulate that State and local governments have taxing authorities over \nbusinesses that are located thousands and thousands of miles away.\n  The sponsors are quick to point out that the Court allowed that \nCongress could enact this sort of extraterritorial taxation. But as the \nSenate has seen again and again, just because government can doesn't \nmean government should.\n  We are going to continue this debate. It will not be done today. One \nof the central discussion points in this debate going forward will be \nthe damage this bill, in its present form, does to the idea of State \nsovereignty. Proponents of the bill say the measure is about promoting \nStates rights, but the reality is it is a coercive affront to State \nsovereignty. If any State does not wish to subject their business to \nout-of-State government tax collectors, the MFA tells them in effect: \nGet lost. The MFA enables the State of Indiana or the State of South \nDakota to require online businesses located in New Hampshire to collect \nsales taxes on their behalf. I will repeat that. This so-called \nMarketplace Fairness Act could require New Hampshire, a State that does \nnot have a sales tax--require New Hampshire businesses to collect sales \ntaxes for goods and services provided to consumers in Indiana and South \nDakota and send that money to those States. It enables California and \nNew York to collect taxes from businesses located in Florida or Texas.\n  Finally, since I know we are in morning business, I think this steers \nthe Internet toward a dangerous path. It would, in effect, endorse the \nnotion that Internet entities should be required to enforce laws \noutside their home jurisdiction. Foreign countries have long pressed \nthat notion. Foreign countries have specifically pushed that notion, \nthat the Internet ought to cede to their control. As it is already, \nmany countries are seeking to put the United Nations in charge of the \nInternet's regulator-in-chief, and essentially, if we look at the \nphilosophical foundation of this proposal, it endorses that world view.\n  The Senate is being asked to consider schemes to allow States and \nlocalities to essentially nationalize their taxes, but tomorrow the \nSenate may be asked to consider similar schemes to enforce law and \nregulations. I will tell you what truly concerns me about this is it \ncould be laws and regulations about content and other issues that are \nimportant to the powerful and well-connected. Make no mistake about it, \nthat is who is pushing this bill today.\n  Open those morning newspapers and it was not the little guy, the \nperson who does not have PACs and big political committees who was \nbuying ads in the morning newspapers, it was the powerful and the well-\nconnected. It seems to me the last thing this body should do is \njeopardize the democratizing power of the Internet and technology \nthrough legislation such as this.\n  I believe the substance of this bill is deeply flawed. I know there \nhave been efforts to improve it.\n\n  I see my colleague from Illinois. He wanted to take the bill I wrote \nyears ago, the Internet tax freedom legislation, along with colleagues \nfrom both sides of the aisle, and he wanted to put it into this bill. \nThe Internet Tax Freedom Act runs contrary to this bill because this \nbill allows discrimination.\n  It specifically allows online retailers to do things that would not \nbe required for offline retailers. The offline retailer doesn't have to \nchase somebody across the country and try to figure out where they are \ngoing to consume a particular product. We ask for things from online \nretailers that we do not ask from offline retailers.\n  I understand why the Senator from Illinois wanted to take a bill that \nhas been a big success for both bricks-and-clicks retailers and put it \ninto this bill. In effect, I compared it to trying to dump sugar into a \nvery bitter cup of coffee.\n  We cannot get healthy with this bill in its present form. It is a \ndeeply flawed piece of legislation. This debate is going to continue.\n  I urge colleagues to vote no on the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my friend and colleague from Oregon for coming to \nthe floor and stating his position on the bill. For those who follow \nthe Senate, we are about to see something that is historic, precedent \nsetting, and nothing short of remarkable in an hour and a half. The \nSenate is actually going to vote on a bill.\n  Those who are watching this program on C-SPAN or from galleries may \nactually see 100 Senators--or close to that number--come to the floor, \nvote, and perhaps there will be a bipartisan majority supporting the \nbill. At least that is my hope.\n  I have joined with Senator Enzi, a Republican from Wyoming; Senator \nAlexander, a Republican from Tennessee; and Senator Heitkamp, a \nDemocrat from North Dakota, in a bipartisan effort to solve a problem. \nIt was a problem not out of our creation, it was a problem that came \nabout because commerce has changed in the United States.\n  Twenty years ago the State of North Dakota went to the Supreme Court \nand said: We want to collect sales tax from remote sellers. Twenty \nyears ago these were mainly catalog sales. It would give a company that \nmade a catalog sale in the State of North Dakota the ability to collect \nsales tax.\n  Nearly 21 years ago the Supreme Court--across the street--said in the \nQuill decision: We are not going to rule this from the Court. It is up \nto Congress to write the law.\n  Well, in lightning-fast speed--the kind of reaction we have come to \nexpect--21 years later, here we are actually debating the bill. We may \nactually vote on it in an hour and a half.\n  What is it all about? It is about the way commerce has changed in \nAmerica. Let's think about it. When did anyone here first make an \nInternet purchase? Virtually all of us have. I remember doing it and \nsaying: I wonder how this is going to work. They are going to take it \noff my credit card, I am going to receive this in the mail or UPS will \ndeliver this book from Amazon. Well, it worked out pretty nicely, so I \ndid it again. I bought clothes from Lands End, along with some other \nthings, and pretty soon I am an Internet purchaser.\n  Well, it turns out there was something going on I didn't know about. \nIn my State of Illinois--and 45 other States--I have a legal obligation \nto pay sales tax on what I purchase on the Internet. Most people don't \nknow it. It is on the State income tax form, and at the end of the year \nin Illinois--and many other States--each taxpayer is asked to itemize \nhow much they owe for sales tax to, for instance, the State of Illinois \nfor purchases that were made on the Internet.\n  A year ago my bookkeeper brought it to my attention and said: \nSenator, do you want to pay this? I said: I think I should. I started \nmaking calculations of what it was. It was my best estimate, and I paid \nit. It turns out only 5 percent--1 in 20 taxpayers in Illinois--make \nthat payment.\n  Now repeat that story for 45 States and we will find that so many \nresidents of States--whether it is Maine, Illinois, or California--may \nhave a legal obligation to pay sales tax on their Internet purchases, \nbut they don't do it.\n  As a result, less money is going into the States, the counties, and \nthe localities that have the sales tax revenue coming their way, but \nsomething else has happened that is very significant. The competition \nof the Internet retailers is a disadvantage.\n  Unabridged Bookstore is on Broadway in the city of Chicago. It is \naround\n\n[[Page S3075]]\n\nthe corner from where my wife and I reside in Chicago. Unabridged is a \ngreat bookstore, and I love bookstores. I make a point of going in \nthere. I went in there last Friday, bought a couple of books, and paid \nmy sales tax to the State of Illinois.\n  As I mentioned earlier, I also buy books on Amazon. Sometimes they \ncollect sales tax and sometimes they don't. It depends on whether the \nactual seller of the book is a store in Illinois, for example.\n  So what is the difference? Well, the difference is about 8 or 9 \npercent on what a purchaser pays for a book. When I bought the book at \nthe store on Broadway--where they are collecting the sales tax as they \nare required by law, where they pay property tax as they are required \nby law sustaining the great city of Chicago and all of its services--I \npaid more than I might have on the Internet.\n  Here is what this bill says: States can now require the Internet \nretailers to collect the sales tax at the point of purchase and to \nremit those proceeds back to the States. So, for example, if Amazon, \nwhich supports this bill, sells a book to me in Illinois, they can \ncollect the sales tax and send it to Springfield, the Illinois \nDepartment of Revenue. It is just that simple.\n  As far as the way they collect it, this bill requires that the \nInternet retailers be given the software they need so when I put in my \naddress either in Chicago or Springfield--I have two places in \nIllinois--the address is going to identify how much tax is owed. It is \nnot as dramatic and complicated as some on the Senate floor have \nsuggested. In fact, it is done every single day.\n\n  What if we don't do it? What we are going to find is that stores that \nsell books, running shoes, bicycles, and appliances are at a distinct \ndisadvantage. They become showrooms, and they tell a story.\n  This is a Lacrosse store, and they are going out of business. They \nsold sporting goods and soccer gear in the suburbs of Chicago. They \ncould not keep up with it anymore because people were coming in and \nthey were showrooming. Potential customers would come into the store \nand say: I am looking for running shoes, and I cannot decide if it is \nNike or Adidas. Can you bring out a few boxes? How about different \ncolors? Let me try a different size. OK. This is perfect. Let me write \nthis down.\n  Everyone knows what happened next. They walked out of the store, \nordered it on the Internet, and paid no sales tax. That is what this \nstore, and many like them, are competing against. We are trying to \nsolve this once and for all, and we have done it in a way I think is \nfair.\n  We took a bill that was 80 pages long and turned it into 11 pages so \nit is simple to follow. We made it easy for the retailers in terms of \nthe software they need to make this collection, and now across the \nUnited States there will be a standard which will help a lot of \nretailers. Sure, it is going to help the biggest ones. I will not make \nany bones about that. Of course it will. It will help the small ones \ntoo such as the Unabridged Bookstore and businesses such as the \nLacrosse sporting goods store. They will be helped in the process too. \nThey create jobs. These are entrepreneurs which sustain our \ncommunities.\n  When it comes to things we need in our neighborhood or town, we go to \nthe small stores and ask if they will buy an ad in the church program \nor support the local baseball team. They are citizens and residents of \nthe community. They are part of the community. This bill is trying to \nmake sure they have a fair and level playing field when it comes to \ncompeting. That is what this is all about.\n  Some may wonder why we have such opposition. The Senator who spoke \nbefore me is from the State of Oregon. Oregon is one of five States in \nthe Nation with no State sales tax. For the record, they are Alaska, \nOregon, Montana, New Hampshire, and Delaware. Of those five States, \nfour of those States--all eight of those Senators--are actively \nopposing this bill.\n  What does it come down to? If this bill passes, will the people of \nOregon, who currently have no sales tax, have to collect sales tax from \nthe residents of Oregon? No. Not one penny of sales tax will be imposed \non any State where they currently don't have a sales tax. The residents \nof Oregon will not have to pay sales tax at the counter or over the \nInternet. It will not apply.\n  However, the three or four--and there are only three or four \ncompanies--Internet retailers in California that want to sell in \nCalifornia, Washington, Maine, and Illinois will be collecting sales \ntax based on their sales in our States only. That is fair. It doesn't \nchange an Oregonian's sales tax responsibility at all. So for three or \nfour retailers, the argument is being made: Don't change the law.\n  Just how many Internet retailers are we talking about? We put an \nexemption in this bill and said: If you had less than $1 million in \nInternet sales last year, you don't have to collect sales tax this \nyear. What does that $1 million mean? Well, if we set that number at \n$150,000 instead of $1 million, we would have exempted 99 percent of \nall the Internet retailers.\n  What it comes down to is this bill will affect the big boys, such as \nAmazon and eBay--the big ones. They can certainly--and already do in \nmany instances--collect the sales tax. It does not affect the small \nInternet retailers, particularly in States that are complaining the \nmost about the passage of this legislation.\n  I think this is an important measure in terms of leveling the playing \nfield for retailers across America, and it is long overdue. It is \nbipartisan, and it has the support of the White House. It has the \nsupport of the retail community. Stores large and small all across \nAmerica support this legislation. It has the support of virtually every \nlevel of government beyond the Federal level.\n  All the Governors and mayors in all the different localities--\nvirtually all of them--support it. The labor union supports it as well \nbecause money coming back into these States and communities will be \nused for the good of the people who live there. I don't know about many \nStates, but in my State they are struggling in terms of coming up with \nenough revenue. This bill will help provide some of the revenue my \nState needs to deal with some of these problems.\n  I would like to mention one other issue that was brought up Friday \nmorning by the Wall Street Journal. The Wall Street Journal talked \nabout the number of audits an Internet retailer might face if this bill \npasses. They suggested--I think improperly in their editorial--that it \ncould be an onslaught of audits. We made it clear--and Senator Enzi \nsaid on the floor, as I have--that we are talking about one centralized \naudit for each State.\n\n  It would not be a matter of harassment. At most there would be some \n45 audits which these Internet retailers would face. I hope that can be \nmade extremely clear.\n  I have listened to a lot of speeches on the floor against this \nmeasure, and virtually every single one of them has been from a State \nwith no sales tax. My final plea is to the people of Oregon, Montana, \nNew Hampshire, Delaware, and Alaska. If this bill passes, they will not \nhave to pay any new sales tax. This bill creates no new Federal tax and \ndoes not create new sales tax anywhere in the United States. It only \nhas a method of collection for those sales taxes that already exist in \nthe States across the Nation.\n  I hope we can get a good, strong bipartisan vote so we can send it to \nthe House, and I hope they will take it up. It is a timely and \nimportant measure. After 21 years I think we have thought it over \nenough. It is time to act and do something to resolve the issue. This \nwill help small businesses and local governments across America where \nthis revenue will play an important part in their future.\n  I believe all the speeches I have heard about the value of small \nbusiness, the value of entrepreneurship, and how important it is to \ncreate jobs at the local level. This will be a test vote this \nafternoon. In fact, we will have a couple of votes. First, there will \nbe the managers' amendment. It is generally an amendment where we look \nclosely and carefully at every single sentence in the bill. We made \nsome slight variations. There were no major changes in the substance of \nthe bill that was originally introduced. However, it is a cleanup \namendment, which shows that even with our best efforts, we can improve, \nand I think that is important. Second, there will be the vote on final \npassage on the bill.\n\n[[Page S3076]]\n\n  The last point I want to make is one I expect to hear from my friend \nfrom Oregon, Senator Wyden--and he is my friend. He feels passionately \nabout the Internet, and he should. The Internet has changed America. It \nhas changed the world. It has changed the way we live, the way we \nresearch, the way we read books, the way we shop, and so many other \nthings.\n  Senator Wyden talks about the virtual issue of the sanctity of the \nInternet. I could not agree with him more. We have to make sure we \npreserve some very basic things about the Internet. One of the things \nwe need to preserve is access to the Internet. What if we had to pay a \ntax every time we went online? That would be awful. So we had an \namendment from Senator Pryor of Arkansas and Senator Blunt from \nMissouri which said access to the Internet cannot be taxed. It is \ncalled the Internet Freedom Act.\n  I said put it on here. I agree with that. Let's make it clear that \nnothing we do here will in any way inhibit a person's access to the \nInternet.\n  It is a bill which, frankly, Senator Wyden had introduced, but \nbecause of the nature of this political debate, he objected to our \nputting an amendment on the bill. I am sure he still supports that bill \nin principle. This was an effort by us to make it clear that we want to \nprotect access to the Internet and in so doing make sure we also \nprotect something that is fundamental in this country: an opportunity \nfor real competition and a level playing field for all manner of \nbusiness, large and small, across America.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, we have an opportunity to vote today on \nan important piece of States rights legislation--at least that is the \nway I look at it as a former Governor of Tennessee.\n  Here is what the legislation does. It is called the Marketplace \nFairness Act. There are many reasons to support it, but the reason I \nlike it is because it gives Governors and legislators the opportunity \nto decide for themselves whether they can require out-of-State sellers \nto do the same thing in-state sellers are required to do; that is, to \ncollect the sales tax already owed.\n  Let me say that again. This legislation is States rights legislation. \nIt allows Governors and legislators in Maine or Tennessee or wherever--\nIllinois--to decide for themselves whether they want to require out-of-\nState sellers to do the same thing in-state sellers already do, which \nis to collect the sales tax that is already owed when something is \nsold. That is it.\n  Before I went back to Tennessee, some people here were saying: We \ndon't trust the States to make this decision. I think I know the answer \nto that from Tennesseans. I have spent the last week going from one end \nof our State to the other. Everywhere I have gone, I have asked a \nquestion. I said: There are some people in Washington who said they \ntrust Washington to make a decision more than they trust Governor \nHaslam and Speaker Harwell, Lieutenant Governor Ramsey, and the \nTennessee Legislature to decide what to do about taxes.\n  The last time I checked, Tennessee had an AAA bond rating, no State \nroad debt, one of the lowest tax rates in the country, and was named \nthe second freest State in the country. And the last time I checked, \nWashington, DC, was running up $1 trillion of debt and more every year. \nNobody in Tennessee trusts Washington more than the Governor and State \nlegislature to decide what to do about taxes, particularly when it \ncomes to whether we are collecting a tax that is already owed.\n  This is such an obvious piece of legislation that many of the \nopponents have resorted to interesting arguments, let's say, in \nopposition to it.\n  It has been said that the bill should have gone through committee. \nWell, it went to committee, but the chairman--a very respected Member \nof this body--doesn't like the bill, so he didn't report it to the \nfloor. So that is why it didn't get out of committee.\n  They have said it should have more amendments. All of us, \nparticularly on our side of the aisle--we are in the minority--would \nlike to have as many amendments as we can. But there is one reason this \nbill didn't have amendments, and that is because opponents to the bill \nobjected to every single amendment, every single one, even amendments \nthey support. Senator Pryor and Senator Blunt offered a 10-year \nextension of the moratorium on Internet access taxes, and the Senator \nfrom Oregon objected to that even though he wrote the original act.\n  Some have suggested that what we are talking about is a tax on the \nInternet, but every Senator knows there is a law against a tax on the \nInternet.\n  Some have said: Well, it is a new tax. But of course it is not. It is \nan existing tax. One of my colleagues over here said that the only \nthing he hates worse than a tax is somebody who doesn't pay a tax that \nis owed. This is a tax that everybody owes that only some people pay. \nWhat we are trying to say to the Governor of Maine or to the Governor \nof Tennessee or to the Governor of Illinois is this: You can decide for \nyourselves, without playing ``Mother May I'' to Washington, DC, whether \na State wants to treat some taxpayers one way and some another way, \nsome businesses one way and some businesses another way.\n  Then there are some who say it is too complicated. Well, this is how \ncomplicated it is. If I order ingredients to make ice cream over the \nInternet from Williams-Sonoma, I put in my name, my address, and my ZIP \nCode, and the software figures out the sales tax, collects it, and \nsends it to the State of Tennessee, how hard is that?\n  I guess the complete answer to that is that a majority of Internet \nsales today collect the sales tax that is owed. If it is so hard, how \nare they doing that? Let me say that again. A majority of the retailers \nthat sell over the Internet today collect the sales tax when it is owed \nusing the software that is as simple as looking up the weather on a \nperson's computer. I look up the weather in Maryville, TN. I type in my \nZIP Code, and I type in ``weather,'' and it tells me the weather. That \nis about how easy this is. A majority of the retailers that sell over \nthe Internet today collect the sales tax when they make the sale, so it \ncan't be not only impossible to do, but it is not hard to do.\n  Then there are some who say conservatives aren't for this. One of the \nleading proponents of this legislation is the chairman of the American \nConservative Union, Al Cardenas. He sent out an e-mail last week, and \nhe sent out another one today.\n\n       Dear Senator: As you continue work next week on the \n     Marketplace Fairness Act, I would like to call your attention \n     to what conservatives are saying about this issue. They \n     recognize as I do that it is not the role of government to \n     pick winners and losers in the marketplace by requiring brick \n     and mortar stores to charge a sales tax while exempting \n     Internet sales.\n       Sincerely, Al Cardenas, Chairman, American Conservative \n     Union.\n\n  He included in his e-mail--I received this e-mail--the comments of \nCharles Krauthammer, a conservative if there ever was one.\n\n       The real issue here is the fairness argument--that if \n     you're an old-fashioned store, you have to have your \n     customers and you pay the sales tax and online you don't . . \n     . So I think you want to have something that will level the \n     playing field. You can do it one of two ways. You abolish all \n     sales tax for real stores and nobody pays. Or you get the \n     Internet people to pay the sales tax as well. I think the \n     second one is the only way to do it, obviously.\n\n  Representative Paul Ryan--he was home this past week too. He was in \nJanesville, WI. He is a pretty good conservative, last time I checked. \nI don't go around making a list of who is a good conservative and who \nis a bad one. I just think most people in America think of Paul Ryan as \na conservative, just as the chairman of the American Conservation Union \ndoes.\n  Representative Paul Ryan:\n\n       To me, I think the concept is right . . . It's only fair \n     that the local brick-and-mortar retailer be treated the same \n     as the big-box online sales company out-of-State.\n\n  Lest one think the chairman of the American Conservative Union and \nCharles Krauthammer and Paul Ryan are all on another planet somewhere,\n\n[[Page S3077]]\n\nhere are a few other conservatives who agree with him: William F. \nBuckley before he died wrote extensively about this; Republican \nGovernors Bob McDonnell, Chris Christie, Robert Bentley, Paul LePage, \nBill Haslam, Butch Otter, Terry Branstad, Rick Snyder, Mike Pence, Tom \nCorbett, and Dennis Daugaard of South Dakota.\n  This is common sense. This is fairness. This is States rights.\n  For the life of me, as a former Governor, I do not understand how \nCongress can say to the conservative Republican Governor of Tennessee, \nthe conservative Lieutenant Governor of Tennessee, to the conservative \nsupermajority Republican legislature: You have to play ``Mother May I'' \nwith Washington, DC. We don't trust you to make decisions about your \nown tax policy. We think Washington does a better job.\n  That is laughable. That is just laughable.\n  What we are doing with this bill--and I will conclude with this--is \nvery simple. It is two words: States rights. It allows our State of \nTennessee, our Governor and legislature, to make a decision: Will they \ndecide to require out-of-State sellers to do the very same thing they \nrequire in-state sellers to do; that is, collect the sales tax when \nthey sell an item and remit it to the State government? It is a tax \nthat is already owed. It is not a tax on the Internet. It is a tax some \npeople are paying and other people aren't even though they owe it. It \ndiscriminates against mom and pop small businesses.\n  This bill only applies to large retailers--those that sell more than \n$1 million in remote sales each year.\n  To the charge that it is too complicated, how could it be too \ncomplicated if a majority of Internet sales being made today already \ncollect the sales tax?\n  All we are saying is that the Governor and the legislature may wish \nto say to all taxpayers: If you owe the tax, you are going to need to \npay it, and if you pay it, we can lower the tax rate for everybody in \nthis State.\n  I thank Senator Durbin and Senator Enzi for their leadership and \nbipartisan support. I regret that we didn't have more amendments, but \nthe opponents used as their tactic to try to kill the bill--which I \nhope won't be successful--their right to object to every amendment. We \ncan't do much about that.\n  So after the bill passes, which I hope it does tonight, the House \nwill consider it, and I am sure they will come up with their version of \nthe bill, and we can go to conference and we can pass the Marketplace \nFairness Act, a States rights bill that, in my view, is exactly what \nconservatives hope would happen.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/06/senate-section/article/S3077-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3077-S3079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 20 \nminutes prior to the vote, which is scheduled at 5:30, in relation to \namendment No. 741 be equally divided between the proponents and \nopponents, with proponents controlling the final 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise today to speak out against the so-\ncalled Marketplace Fairness Act. In my view, during a time of economic \nchallenge, as we are in today, the very top priority of every elected \nofficial, whether Republican or Democrat, should be to restore economic \ngrowth, to get our economy moving, to get back to the economic \ndynamism, the economic strength that has lifted so many millions out of \npoverty and toward the American dream. This bill, if enacted into law, \nwould hurt economic growth and would be a mistake.\n  First of all, more taxes will hurt economic growth, and this bill, if \nenacted, would in effect create a national Internet sales tax. It would \nsubject small online retailers to paying taxes in 9,600 different \njurisdictions all across this country. At a time when so many are \nhurting, we should be discussing how to reduce regulatory burdens on \nsmall businesses and how to reduce tax burdens on small businesses, how \nto reduce the complexity of taxes on small businesses, and this bill \ngoes in exactly the opposite direction.\n  In particular, those who will be hurt the most by this bill if it is \npassed are small mom-and-pop retailers online. The threshold for this \nbill is $1 million in gross online sales. That is not profit; that is \n$1 million in total sales, gross sales, and $1 million for a starting \nbusiness is not a terribly high threshold for their gross, not their \nprofits. That has to cover the costs and all expenses of the business. \nIt has to cover any salary, any rent, any Web costs, communications, \ntravel, accounting, legal services, plus the costs of goods sold. These \nsmall- and medium-sized businesses would suddenly find themselves \nsubject to 46 different States and 9,600 local jurisdictions. They \nwould find themselves having to pay tax filings, potentially, in all 46 \nStates monthly or quarterly and to be subjected, potentially, to audits \nfrom each of these local counties, each of these local municipalities.\n\n  I have with me here today a listing of all of the tax rates of these \n9,600 different jurisdictions. It is truly indecipherable, that you can \nlook and pick any State and get the county and see the different tax \nrates. Indeed, in a lot of counties--for example, I just opened this at \nrandom. In Colorado--which I happened to open it to--if you look in \nTaylor Park, if it happens to come from the 81210 ZIP Code, the tax \nrate is 4.5 percent, but if it is in the same county that comes from \nthe 81230 ZIP Code, the tax rate is 8.25 percent.\n  Small businesses--a small mom-and-pop just getting started on the \nInternet would be required to comply with all of these taxing \njurisdictions, to send the taxes to all of these taxing jurisdictions, \nand to be subject, potentially, to audits from 9,600 taxing \njurisdictions. That makes no sense.\n  I wish to point out also that this is not fundamentally about \nfairness. The proponents of this act point to small mom-and-pop stores \nthat are their bricks-and-mortar retailers. But those are not the main \nproponents of these bills. A small bricks-and-mortar retailer right now \nis losing sales primarily to two different sources: No. 1, big-box \nbricks-and-mortar retailers. They are losing a lot of sales to big-box \nlarge retailers. This bill does nothing about that. No. 2, they are \nlosing substantial sales to large online retailers, the giant \ncorporations.\n  But here is an interesting statistic. Nine of the ten largest \nInternet retailers are already paying sales taxes in all 46 States that \nhave sales taxes. Why? Because they have a physical presence in the \nState.\n  What the Supreme Court has said is, if you are physically in a State, \nthe State can force you to collect its tax. But if you are not \nphysically there, the Constitution does not let you haul someone in \nfrom a distant State and force them to collect your taxes because you \ndo not have any accountability to those individuals in a distant State.\n  In terms of the small mom-and-pop retailers, they are losing their \nsales to the big-box and big Internet retailers, all of whom are \nalready paying these taxes.\n  So what do we have here? We have a bipartisan coalition, \nunfortunately, that it appears is going to pass this bill in this \nSenate. But the coalition is driven by the fact that you have big \nbusiness united. You have the big business bricks-and-mortar companies \nand the big business online retailers all together because the impact \nof this bill is to hammer the small business online retailers, to make \nit harder for the little guys to compete. So you see a strange alliance \nhere in Washington, but one that I think is exactly backwards of what \nwe ought to be doing.\n  I think it is fundamentally unfair to ask a Texas business to collect \ntaxes for California Governor Jerry Brown or for New York City Mayor \nBloomberg and a nanny State, in particular, because they cannot hold \nthose politicians accountable. They do not have a presence there. They \ndo not vote there. They do not have influence there. But yet they are \nbeing dragooned into collecting those taxes. I think that is \nfundamentally not right.\n  Let me give you an example of how this will hurt small businesses. \nThere is a woman in Texas named Ann Whitley Wood who wrote a letter to \nour office. She lives in Dallas and had created an online consignment \nstore. Even though it is largely a one-person operation, she may come \nclose to doing $1\n\n[[Page S3078]]\n\nmillion in sales--which, keep in mind, are not profits; those are gross \nsales. Her letter said:\n\n       Legislators must understand that it is both possible and \n     common for a small seller like me to reach about $1 million \n     in sales with a near-one person operation.\n\n  She estimates it could take her 6 weeks a year to comply with the \nsales tax procedures for all of the collecting States. That impact on a \nsmall business is crushing. A giant corporation has accountants, has \nlawyers, has people designed to deal with that. For a small business, \nit hits them in particular.\n  I point out even more fundamentally, the Internet has been this \nincredible haven of entrepreneurial freedom. It has enabled people to \nstart businesses with nothing, out of their garage, and sell all over \nthe world. It has transformed the ability for single moms and Hispanics \nand African Americans and people with nothing to go and start a \nbusiness. Because it used to be that you needed this big distribution \nnetwork, you needed warehouses, you needed trucks, you needed all of \nthis, so it was difficult for someone to start a small business.\n  The Internet has transformed all of that. There are 2.3 million \nHispanic small business owners. The Internet has been critical to their \nbeing able to open those small businesses because it lets them \ncommunicate with the world and get their products out.\n  I believe the Senate should treat the Internet as a safe haven, that \nit should be treated as free from taxes and regulations that would \nhamper the entrepreneurial spirit and make it harder for the little \nguy, for small business to be created, to grow, and thrive. When they \nbecome gigantic corporations, they will have a physical presence in the \nState, and then they will be subject to the taxes. But do not hit them \nwhen they are getting started on the Internet. I think it would be \nabsolutely foolish to do anything to impinge on the entrepreneurial \nfreedom of the Internet.\n  In conclusion, I want to say three very simple things.\n  No. 1, in my judgment, we should not be taxing the Internet, period. \nNo. 2, we should not be increasing the burdens on small businesses, \nparticularly at a time of economic challenge, period. And, No. 3, we \nshould not be favoring politicians and big business at the expense of \nthe little guy, at the expense of the single mom trying to start a \nsmall business to feed her kid, at the expense of the Hispanic \nimmigrant trying to start a small business and work toward the American \ndream.\n  We should not be standing with politicians looking for more tax \nrevenue and big businesses looking to make it harder for their \ncompetitors to survive. Instead, we should stand up with the little \nguy, the small business, with the American people.\n  I urge the Senate to reject this bill. If the Senate does pass it, I \nwould urge the House to listen to the American people and reject the \nbill as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I think we only have 2 or 3 minutes before \nthe 20-minute period that has been reserved equally for both sides. I \nwish to use those 3 minutes to respond directly to my colleague from \nthe State of Texas.\n  The first thing he says is, do not tax the Internet. Good news. I \njust went through the entire bill. There is no tax on the Internet in \nthe bill, none. So we have taken care of point No. 1. In fact, we \nwanted to add the Internet Freedom Act here, which would have said \nexpressly: We will continue the prohibition against tax on the \nInternet, and it was objected to by one of the opponents of this bill.\n  The second thing he says is, do not put a burden on small businesses. \nI would say to my friend from Texas, what about the small business that \ndoes not have Internet sales?\n  You have just put a burden on them because they cannot compete with \nInternet retailers that do not collect sales taxes.\n  I might say also, when it comes to small business exemptions, we \nexempt those with sales of $1 million or less in the previous year. \nThat exempts 99 percent of all Internet retailers. The small \nbusinesses--the Hispanic and non-Hispanic businesses--collect sales \ntaxes in Texas on the first dollar of sales. We exempt $1 million in \nsales for their competitors in Internet retail.\n  The final thing the Senator says is, do not favor large businesses. \nThe coalition supporting this bill includes the smallest businesses, \nthe mom-and-pop businesses. Of course, it includes the big-box stores \nand the big chains. But it goes all the way down the line. They are all \nin competition.\n  What we have put in here, with this exemption, exempts 99 percent of \nall online retailers. When the Senator says he looks at 9,600 different \ntaxing jurisdictions and cannot figure out how in the world we are ever \ngoing to figure this out, I refer him to page 3 of the bill. Please \nstart reading at line 14 through 24, where you will see that we \nexpressly provide there must be a single entity within the State \nresponsible for all State and local sales. So you are not going to have \n9,600. You are going to have, at most, 45 separate entities--the 45 \nStates with sales taxes--as well as audits; one audit from the State, a \nsingle audit.\n  We do not want to put a burden on any businesses--large, small, \nInternet or not--but we do want to level the playing field.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 20 \nminutes of debate equally divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, the time will be charged equally.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Parliamentary inquiry: I believe the order suggests that \nthe time is equally divided between the opponents and proponents, and \nthe opponents have the first 10 minutes and the proponents the final 10 \nminutes. So I would ask the Chair to clarify his ruling.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I come to the floor again this afternoon \nto continue my opposition and concerns about the Internet sales tax \nlegislation that has been submitted.\n  I appreciate that we are going to vote on this bill in a few minutes, \nand I appreciate that I am probably going to lose. But I do think it is \nimportant to raise these concerns again because I think we have to take \na look at the issues that have been raised and see if there are any \nways to address them.\n  There are a number of problems with the bill that in my State of New \nHampshire--which has no sales tax--makes it anything but fair. In fact, \nit creates an unfair situation for small businesses in a number of \nways.\n  First, it is unfair for businesses in my State of New Hampshire and \nthe four other States in this country that do not collect a sales tax. \nWe did not have an opportunity to address this issue through \namendments. I think it is not fair for us to pass a bill out of the \nSenate that fundamentally makes an impact on businesses in States where \nwe have no ability to address the imposition of these taxes.\n  I also think we should not pass a bill that is going to create \nunnecessary new redtape for small companies across the country. One of \nthe real benefits of the Internet has been the innovation and the job \ncreation it has spawned. What this legislation does is put in place \nredtape that is going to put small companies that sell online at a \nsevere disadvantage, making it harder for them to compete with large \nonline retailers.\n  As a former small business owner myself, I know how time consuming \nregulations and compliance can be. Make no mistake about it, we are \ncreating a bureaucratic morass for small businesses under this \nlegislation. Small companies will be looking at complying with 46 \ndifferent State laws. They are going to face audits or lawsuits, \npotentially, in some of these States.\n  Small business owners, who are working hard to grow their companies, \ndo not need additional paperwork to distract them from running their \ncompanies. I fear that is what this bill will create. I urge my \ncolleagues to take another look and see how we can address those \nconcerns.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Marketplace Fairness Act is designed to \naddress a simple problem--a significant loss in States' sales tax \nrevenues arising from e-commerce.\n\n[[Page S3079]]\n\n  Generally, retail businesses are required to collect and remit sales \nand use taxes on qualifying merchandise or services. While most States \nrequire consumers to remit use taxes for purchases from out-of-State \nvendors, compliance is extraordinarily low as States cannot legally \nmandate the collection and remittance of taxes by a business unless the \nbusiness has a physical presence in the State.\n  This restriction, which was articulated in the 1992 Supreme Court \ncase, Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, went so far as to invite Congress to \naddress the issue. It is time we do that.\n  In an era of unprecedented e-commerce, Congress's failure so far to \naddress this problem unfairly deprives State treasuries of much-needed \ntax revenue because Internet-based retailers are not required to charge \nsales tax to their out-of-State customers. As you might imagine, a \nlarge number of State governments have asked for this legislation to \nfix that problem, including the current Republican Governor of \nMichigan. In fact, Michigan governors of both political parties have \nasked Congress to pass this important piece of legislation, and I agree \nwith them.\n  The Governor of Michigan says that passing this law will help the \nState of Michigan collect more than $800 million over the next 2 years. \nThose are revenues that the State desperately needs.\n  I also think it's important to keep in mind some of the things this \nbill doesn't do. This bill does not authorize the States to create \nState-level financial transaction taxes, as some have erroneously \nargued. In fact, the Marketplace Fairness Act does not create, endorse, \nor recommend new Federal, State or local taxes of any kind.\n  This bill gives States the option of pursuing collection authority by \nsimplifying their tax structure, but States can also choose to do \nnothing differently than they do today. The Marketplace Fairness Act is \nabout more equitably collecting taxes that are already owed.\n  Over the past decade, many States have worked together to develop a \nframework to harmonize sales and use tax collection and remittance, \nknown as the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement. Michigan is 1 of \nthe 24 States that currently participate in that agreement. But, in \norder for the agreement to be legally enforceable, Congress would need \nto enact legislation granting States the authority to require out-of-\nState merchants to remit sales and use taxes. This bill would do that.\n  I support this effort to simplify and improve sales tax collection, \nand I am a cosponsor of this bill. This bill will level the playing \nfield between on-line retailers and those with ``brick and mortar'' \nstores, ensuring that we do not give an unfair tax advantage to one \ntype of retailer over another. This is about ensuring that our States \nhave the ability to collect the taxes they need to fund schools, and \nlaw enforcement, and other key priorities.\n  I will vote for this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the closing 10 minutes, the four \nproponents who will speak will be first Senator Heitkamp of North \nDakota, followed by Senator Alexander of Tennessee, myself, and then \nSenator Enzi of Wyoming, who has for 11 years been fighting for this \nvote. I want him to have the last word.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, this is a day that has been 20 years in \nthe making. You have heard argument after argument here about how this \nbill has been rushed, how it is not ready, how we have not yet had \nenough debate or deliberation. I tell you on behalf of the small \nbusiness owners in my State who have told me it is about darn time we \ndo something, I stand today and congratulate this body for taking on \nthis issue and taking a system that has been grossly unjust and \nincredibly unfair to Main Street businesses in our country and in our \nState and said, yes, the Senate will not stand back and wait any longer \nbefore we give you marketplace fairness.\n  This bill could not be and could not have a better name than \nMarketplace Fairness. I got involved in this issue as a very young \nperson--I like to say that because it was 20 years ago--litigating a \ncase before the U.S. Supreme Court. I was moved to take that case to \nthe Court by a woman who approached me and said: Look, I am trying to \nsurvive. I am trying to participate as a good businessperson in North \nDakota, trying to support my community, trying to do everything right, \ncollect my sales tax, but I am getting killed in the marketplace, \nbecause people are sending catalogs; people come into my store; they \nwill look at my products. Then they order this stuff through a mail \norder business. Please help me.\n  Those pleas have for the last 20 years gone unheard by this body and \nby the House of Representatives. But today we have a chance. We have a \nchance to say to all of those businesspeople throughout our country who \nhave been unfairly treated by a tax system that does not recognize \ntoday's modern-day method of marketing, this modern-day way we do \nbusiness and commerce in our country has not been recognized. They \ncontinue to struggle, continue to try. I congratulate the Senate. I \ncongratulate all of the other Senators who have pursued this with such \nvigor and with such hope. I say today is the day that we say yes to \nAmerica's small businesses.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask I be notified when I have \nconsumed 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from North \nDakota on 20 years of work on this issue, Senator Enzi for 11 years of \ntireless work here, and Senator Durbin for his effective advocacy. I \nwill make four quick points.\n  The Senator from Texas said reinvigorating the economy should be the \nNo. 1 priority for Federal and State leaders. That is precisely the \nfirst sentence of the column of economist Art Laffer in the Wall Street \nJournal where he says:\n\n       States can cut their income tax rates if web vendors \n     collect the sales taxes that are legally due.\n\n  In other words, if you want economic growth, vote for the Marketplace \nFairness Act.\n  No. 2, the idea that this is too complex to do--more than half of the \nsales now made on the Internet are by retailers that collect the tax \nwhen it is sold. It is a tax that is already owed, so how can it be too \ncomplex for anybody else to do? It is already being done. So that is \nspecious.\n  No. 3, it has been said this should have gone to committee. It did. \nIt just never came out of committee because the chairman, and I say \nthat with great respect, did not want it to. It should have had \namendments. Yes, it should have had amendments. Why didn't it have \namendments? Because the opponents to the bill resorted to objecting to \nevery single amendment.\n  Finally, I say this to my Republican colleagues: This is a \nconservative bill. I just mentioned Mr. Laffer. I read this earlier, \nbut I want to read it again. The comments of the chairman of the \nAmerican Conservative Union, Al Cardenas:\n\n       Dear Senators, you continue work next week on the \n     Marketplace Fairness Act. I would like to call to your \n     attention what conservatives are saying about the issue. They \n     recognize, as I do, it is not the role of government to pick \n     winners and losers in the marketplace by requiring brick and \n     mortar stores to charge a sales tax while exempting Internet \n     sales.\n\n  He then lists the comments of Charles Krauthammer favoring the idea, \nRepresentative Paul Ryan favoring the idea, and, of course, as we know, \nWilliam F. Buckley did before he\n\n[[Page S3080]]\n\ndied. Many Governors do. This is an idea for conservatives and for our \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, thanks to my colleagues who are on the \nfloor, especially Senator Alexander. Senator Enzi and I owe the Senator \na great debt of gratitude for his work on this bill, in helping us \ncraft the bill and bring the support together.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following four editorials be printed \nin the Record, from the New York Times, the Idaho State Journal, the \nGreen Bay Press Gazette, and the Northwest Herald of Illinois.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 1, 2013]\n\n                        Fairness on Sales Taxes\n\n                           (Editorial Board)\n\n       Twenty-one years is a long time to wait. But that is how \n     long local retailers have waited for Congress to undo a 1992 \n     Supreme Court decision that exempted many online retailers, \n     like Amazon.com, from collecting most state sales taxes. The \n     exemption has given online sellers a 5 percent to 10 percent \n     price advantage over Main Street stores.\n       The wait, however, may soon be over. Next week, the Senate \n     is expected to pass the Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013, a \n     bipartisan bill that would authorize states to require out-\n     of-state sellers with more than $1 million in sales to \n     collect sales taxes. The states, in turn, must simplify their \n     sales-tax codes and give retailers free software to calculate \n     the taxes--steps already taken by most states. An identical \n     bill in the House also has bipartisan support.\n       Lawmakers have raised the issue for years, to no avail, \n     and, in the meantime, many brick-and-mortar stores have gone \n     out of business. The willingness to act now is driven in part \n     by the fact that Amazon, which fought hard to preserve the \n     exemption, recently gave up the fight. That's not because the \n     company suddenly developed a belief in sales taxes. Its \n     business model--especially its emphasis on same-day \n     delivery--is changing in ways that would soon cause it to \n     lose the exemption anyway.\n       Main Street needs a level playing field to compete with the \n     exploding online industry. So do large retailers, like Best \n     Buy, that have cut jobs as shoppers have increasingly tested \n     electronics at local stores and then gone home to buy them \n     online without paying sales tax. Equally important, states \n     need the revenue to help recover from the recession. \n     Noncollection of sales tax on online purchases costs states \n     an estimated $11 billion a year. Another $11 billion goes \n     uncollected on mail-order catalog sales, which would also be \n     covered under pending bills.\n       In the past, most bills that deal with revenue, no matter \n     how justified, have fallen victim to the knee-jerk refusal \n     among many Republicans to even talk about taxes, urged on by \n     anti-tax groups like Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax \n     Reform. But, as reported in the Times on Monday, lawmakers \n     from both parties have come to see that the argument for \n     sales-tax collection is airtight.\n       Sales taxes for any state are already legally due on online \n     purchases that would be taxable if the items were bought in a \n     local store. If the retailer does not collect the taxes, the \n     buyer is supposed to send them to the state voluntarily. As a \n     practical matter, however, if the taxes are not collected by \n     retailers, they are virtually never paid.\n       The proposed law would close that loophole, not impose new \n     taxes. It's a matter of efficiency and fairness, of necessity \n     and competitiveness. If those really are bipartisan values, \n     the Senate will act without further delay to pass the \n     Marketplace Fairness Act, and the House will follow suit.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Idaho State Journal, May 6, 2013]\n\n      There's a reason This Is Called the Marketplace Fairness Act\n\n                           (Editorial Board)\n\n       The Marketplace Fairness Act making its way through \n     Congress is well-named. It would allow state governments to \n     force Internet retailers to collect sales taxes from their \n     customers and remit the proceeds to state and local \n     governments--like, you know--brick-and-mortar retailers are \n     required to do.\n       The shoppers who buy merchandise off the Internet are \n     supposed to calculate sales taxes on their income tax forms, \n     but the fact is most people don't do that. So it might be \n     said that Idahoans pay an extra 6 percent when they buy from \n     stores at home. That's money that pays to operate schools and \n     other public services, and it's estimated that Idaho would \n     collect about $35 million if Internet sales were taxed.\n       Because some states, like Idaho, have refused to authorize \n     collection of sales taxes on online purchases, Congress is \n     acting on behalf of hometown merchants with a federal law. \n     The legislation cleared its first procedural hurdle Thursday \n     on a bipartisan Senate vote, 63 to 30. Final Senate passage \n     is scheduled for Monday and that tally is likely to be even \n     more strongly in favor, according to The New York Times. \n     Earlier test votes won as many as 75 yeses, and House action, \n     once seemingly unthinkable, may be unstoppable.\n       Tax opponents like Grover Norquist and the Heritage \n     Foundation have long opposed any legislation that would \n     require collection of levies on Internet purchases, calling \n     it a tax increase. But Congress is hearing from their \n     hometown constituents, and the tide has turned. Even public \n     officials who signed Norquist's antitax pledge now are \n     changing their minds. Typical is Rep. Scott Rigell, \n     Republican of Virginia, who calls the struggling retailers \n     back home ``the hardworking men and women who have mortgaged \n     their homes to buy or rent a little brick-and-mortar shop.'' \n     Six percent may actually amount to their profit margin.\n       ``I have some concern about the legislation,'' concedes \n     Rep. Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, chairman of the House \n     Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction on the issue, \n     ``but we also recognize the fairness issue--certain items \n     being taxed in certain circumstances, other items being not--\n     is a problem, so we're going to try to solve that.'' It can \n     be done.\n       Norquist should not complain, though he characterizes the \n     bill as a ``money grab by cash-poor state and local \n     governments that would get the power to tax consumers who do \n     not have the power to vote them out of office.'' After all, \n     consumers are already supposed to pay sales taxes even if an \n     Internet merchant does not collect them.\n       The new law would rectify that, and that's why it is called \n     the Fairness Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Green Bay Press Gazette, May 5, 2013]\n\n       Congress Must Level Playing Field on Internet Sales Taxes\n\n                           (Editorial Board)\n\n       How many of you have entered a dollar amount on Line 36 of \n     the Wisconsin income tax Form 1?\n       That's the line where you self-report ``sales and use tax \n     due on Internet, mail order, or other out-of-state \n     purchases.'' In other words, if you've ever purchased \n     something from Amazon, for example, you should have entered a \n     dollar amount here when you filed your taxes.\n       But very few people do. About one of every 100 state \n     taxpayers did when they filed their 2010 income taxes, \n     according to a 2012 story by Steven Walters of WisconsinEye, \n     a nonprofit public affairs channel.\n       Currently, all retailers in Wisconsin collect sales tax on \n     purchases and pay that money to the state. If you buy \n     something, the state and county sales taxes are part of what \n     you pay.\n       If you purchase something online from a business that has a \n     physical presence in Wisconsin, you pay sales tax. But if \n     that business doesn't have a store or warehouse in Wisconsin, \n     it doesn't charge a sales tax.\n       For example, if you went online and purchased a shirt from \n     Lands' End, based in Wisconsin, you'd pay sales tax. If you \n     purchased a similar shirt from L.L. Bean, based in Maine, you \n     would not.\n       The loophole is courtesy of a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court \n     decision that exempts companies from collecting sales tax \n     from purchasers who live in a state where the business has no \n     physical presence.\n       A bill that the Senate is expected to vote on Monday would \n     change that. The Marketplace Fairness Act give states the \n     ability to require online and mail order retailers to collect \n     state and local sales tax based on the address of the \n     purchaser.\n       Wisconsin retailers say this would level the playing field. \n     In a meeting with Press-Gazette Media, area retailers said \n     they don't have a problem competing against other businesses, \n     as long as all play by the same rules and all charge a state \n     sales tax.\n       Without that level playing field, area businesses find \n     themselves answering a consumer's questions and concerns only \n     to have that consumer order the same item online and not have \n     to pay a sales tax. It reduces local businesses to showrooms. \n     They do all the work; the online retailer collects the money.\n       What's at stake is millions of dollars as well as the \n     fiscal health of the local community.\n       The state Department of Revenue estimates that Wisconsin \n     lost $157 million in revenue because taxes were not collected \n     on mail order and other remote sales in 2012--$78 million of \n     that from e-commerce sales.\n       Also, the health of area businesses is important. They pay \n     taxes, provide jobs and donate to local charitable \n     organizations yet lose sales and money when tax-free \n     purchases are made. The out-of-state online-only retailers \n     aren't invested in your community.\n       The bill before the Senate sets a threshold of $1 million \n     in online sales so small businesses will not be hurt and \n     calls for the state to provide free software so businesses \n     can comply.\n       One aspect of the bill calls for the state to ``establish a \n     uniform sales tax base for use throughout the state.'' That \n     concerns us because many counties, like Brown, have a 0.5 \n     percent county sales tax. We wouldn't want to lose out on \n     that money because the state must charge a uniform sales tax. \n     And it's hard to believe that the software will not be able \n     to determine the correct state and local sales taxes. The \n     technology that has given us the ease of online shopping \n     should also be able to clear that hurdle.\n       So far, the bill has bipartisan support in the Senate, but \n     faces a much more unclear fate in the House.\n       However, Congress needs to pass this bill. Local businesses \n     are willing to compete as\n\n[[Page S3081]]\n\n     long as it's a fair fight. Also, the bill is not asking for a \n     new tax; it's asking that the existing tax is applied fairly \n     and uniformly and doesn't put the burden on the consumer to \n     reimburse the state. That's not too much to ask.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Northwest Herald, May 2, 2013]\n\n                        What's Fair For Business\n\n                           (Editorial Board)\n\n       The scenario described by Play It Again Sports' owner Bob \n     Ruer happens all too often in local businesses.\n       A customer comes into his Crystal Lake store, looks around, \n     maybe tries out the wares, and then heads home to buy the \n     same product online. Why? Because Internet retailers aren't \n     required to collect sales tax at the buyer's local rate.\n       U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., is pushing to end that with \n     the Marketplace Fairness Act. We support Durbin's effort and \n     encourage lawmakers in Washington to pass the act.\n       The legislation would put the initial costs on the states \n     to provide retailers with the appropriate software to collect \n     taxes. Internet retailers with less than $1 million in annual \n     sales would be granted an exemption.\n       Opponents of the bill, including large online retailers \n     such as eBay and Overstock.com, have taken issue with the $1 \n     million exemption and suggested it should be bumped higher.\n       The bill has the support of big-box stores such as Walmart, \n     Best Buy and Target and online giant Amazon.\n       Beyond the unlevel playing field for businesses, the \n     situation causes the state of Illinois to lose out on a great \n     deal of revenue.\n       Now, Illinois taxpayers are on an honor system when it \n     comes to paying state sales tax for online purchases. \n     Residents are supposed to note the sales tax they owe from \n     Internet purchases on their state income-tax return. Durbin \n     estimates that only 5 percent of Illinois taxpayers do so. \n     Gov. Pat Quinn said the state stands to collect an additional \n     $200 million annually in sales-tax revenue if the bill \n     passed.\n       This is not a tax increase. It's not a new tax. These sales \n     taxes and tax rates are already in place.\n       This is a needed law to level the playing field for local \n     businesses who've been good corporate citizens, hired local \n     employees and paid property taxes that support local schools \n     and other taxing districts.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, what is happening with Internet sales? \nThey are growing dramatically. Listen to these numbers. In 2012 online \nsales accounted for $225 billion in sales in America. In the next 5 \nyears it will double to $435 billion. It is an endeavor that has become \npart of our lives. What we are asking in this bill is that those \nselling on the Internet be treated the same as those selling on the \ncorners of our streets, to make sure the brick-and-mortar businesses \nhave a level playing field. That is all we are asking.\n  This bill contains no new Federal tax, no new State and local tax. \nWhat it does is collect taxes already owed. It simplifies the system by \nsaying there will only be one taxing entity that identifies the taxes \nto be charged in every single State, one audit from each State. It \ntries to provide for the retailers the basic software they need to get \nthe job done.\n  This is a fascinating bill. For those who follow the Senate, it is a \nrare opportunity for us to have Republicans and Democrats together on \nthe floor supporting a bill that has the endorsement of business and \nlabor and local officials all across the United States. It is clearly \nan idea whose time has come. I hope we can pass it with a good strong \nvote and encourage our friends in the House to take it up quickly.\n  I close by thanking my colleague from Wyoming. He has been a great \npartner in this effort. He came to it before I did. I replaced Senator \nDorgan after Senator Dorgan's retirement and tried to keep this moving \nforward. Today is our day for a vote. I thank him for all of his hard \nwork on his side of the aisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank all of the people who have \nparticipated, particularly Senator Durbin who has helped to coalesce \nthings, Senator Alexander who came up with the idea for having a \nshorter bill, only 11 pages--never see it in the Senate--written in \nplain English, and it is States rights.\n  This does not cause the Federal Government to do anything. What it \nallows is for the States to do what they have already passed laws on. I \ncan see this from the standpoint of an individual. I know in Wyoming if \nyou buy something on the Internet and you are not charged a tax, you \nare supposed to fill out a form and send it in. That is a difficult \nthing to do, hard to even keep track of. This will eliminate that \nproblem of individuals wanting to pay the tax but not knowing exactly \nhow to do it.\n  I know it from the standpoint of a small businessman, if they had the \nexperience of somebody coming in, trying on the goods, finding out \nexactly what they want, the color, the style, the feel, everything, and \nthen ordering it on the Internet. The even more ironic part of it is \nwhen they have a problem with it, they bring it back to the local \nretailer to fix it.\n  I have seen it from the standpoint of a mayor. I know in Wyoming at \nleast 30 percent and up to 70 percent of the revenue of the \nmunicipalities comes from the sales tax. That is on a declining basis \nat the moment. That is not only what they run the city's streets and \nsnow removal on; a lot of the police, the fire protection, even \neducation is affected by the sales tax.\n  I have seen it from the standpoint of a legislator as well. I know \nwhen we passed those taxes, we did not say: Okay, we want to \ndiscriminate against the local business that pays the property tax, \nhires people locally, and participates in all the community stuff. If \nyou are out of State, we are going to let you off the hook.\n  No legislator ever passed a bill like that. This is one that corrects \nall of those things and brings fairness to the marketplace. I think it \nwill make a significant difference, particularly in communities where \nthey will still be able to help out some of the charitable \norganizations and activities that would have to go by the wayside if \nthis bill were not to pass.\n  I look forward to working with people on the House side. I wish to \nthank Senator Durbin, Senator Alexander, and Senator Heitkamp, \nparticularly, for all of their efforts on this bill. I thank Senator \nHeitkamp for her persistence over 22 years and knowing the intricacies \nof how it works on the Canadian border, as well as having been involved \nin the original case where the Supreme Court challenged us to fix this \nproblem.\n  Today we have a chance to fix this problem. I ask my colleagues to \nvote for the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/06/senate-section/article/S3081-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CON. RES. 25\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this afternoon I offered a consent agreement \ndealing with the budget. I withdrew that because we did not have anyone \nhere to object, and I had an inkling there would be an objection if a \nRepublican were here.\n  We have been asked to move with regular order. We have done that. We \nhave done our very best to do that. People wanted amendments. We have \ndone our best to have bills with amendments. We have been asked, let's \ndo as much work as we can with committees, and we have done that. We \nhave bills reported out from the committee. Those are the bills we have \nhandled here, with rare exception.\n  Now we have had our Republican friends saying for months and months, \nlet's do things with regular order. We know how hard it was to get a \nbudget passed. We have had over 100 amendments on which we actually \nvoted. We were here until 5 o'clock in the morning. We got a budget, \neven though--you know, we have been through this before. We do not need \nto go into more detail. We had a law signed by the President of the \nUnited States that gave us our budget allocations for several years. \nBut we decided to do a resolution. It didn't have to be signed by the \nPresident. I am glad we did. It was hard. Senators Murray and Sessions \ndid a good job allowing us to move forward on that, so now it is time \nto go forward. We have a budget resolution we passed in the Senate. We \nwant to meet with the House and work out our differences. That is what \nwe have done here for two centuries. We should do it on this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration \nof Calendar No. 33, H. Con. Res. 25; that the amendment which is at the \ndesk, the text of S. Con. Res. 8, the budget resolution passed by the \nSenate, be inserted in lieu thereof; that H. Con. Res. 25, as amended, \nbe agreed to, with the motions to reconsider being considered made and \nlaid on the table; that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a \nconference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, \nand the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the \nSenate, all without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, one of my \nconcerns is that this conference report could be used to pass a \nreconciliation bill that would increase the debt ceiling without \nsufficient input from the minority party and without addressing the \nfundamental structural spending problems we have in the Federal \nGovernment that are leading to our unsustainable debt. I believe this \nconcern is well founded in history in that reconciliation bills have \nbeen used to increase the debt ceiling at least three times--in 1986, \n1990, and in 1993. So for that reason, reserving the right to object, I \nask consent that the leader modify his request so that it not be in \norder for the Senate to consider a conference report that includes tax \nincreases or reconciliation instructions to increase taxes or to raise \nthe debt limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modified request?\n  Mr. REID. I would make a comment before making a decision on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. The Senate considered the budget--and that is an \nunderstatement. We voted on more than 100 amendments, as I mentioned a \nfew minutes ago. It was hard. The votes were hard. The Senate passed \nits budget. It should now go to conference, that which the Senate \npassed. It is our budget. The Senator from Texas was on the losing \nside. He had his view and it lost, but now he wants us to agree by \nconsent to adopt the losing side's view or else he is not going to \nallow us to go to conference.\n  For more than two centuries, I repeat, the two bodies have been able \nto go work out their differences. The Senate passes something. The \nHouse passes something. You talk about regular order, that is it. We \nare able at that time to sit down and talk about the differences. The \ndebt ceiling--he wants to talk about that. He wants to talk about \ntaxes. We are happy to do that, but let's do it in the context of \nregular order. That is what we should be doing around here.\n  My friend from Texas is like the schoolyard bully. He pushes \neverybody around and is losing, and instead of playing the game \naccording to the rules, he not only takes the ball home with him but \nchanges the rules. That way, no one wins--except the bully who tries to \nindicate to people that he has won. We are asking the Republicans to \nplay by the rules and let us go to conference.\n  I don't think it takes a lot of wizardry to figure out that we know \nhow the American people feel about what they want done in this country. \nThey want us to get on a pathway of growth and economic vitality. It \nhas been hindered.\n  The Republicans have things they want to do. We have things we want \nto do. Why can't we sit down as reasonable men and women and work out \nour differences? That is what a conference is all about.\n  I object to what my friend suggests. It is actually fairly \nridiculous, if you want the truth: Before we go to conference, \ndetermine what you are going to do or not do in the conference. That is \nnot how we do things around here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request? The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I was not aware we were at a schoolyard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, is there an objection or no objection? Let's \nhear about it. We have had enough.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Regular order.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is no such thing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Yes. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill for a third time.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n\n\n                             Implementation\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Marketplace \nFairness Act. I applaud Senator Enzi for his many years of work on this \nlegislation, of which I am a cosponsor. This bill rectifies a \nfundamental unfairness in our current system. Right now, out-of-State \nInternet sellers, so-called remote sellers, have an advantage over Main \nStreet businesses. Main Street businesses have to collect sales taxes \non every transaction. Because remote sellers don't have to charge this \ntax, they enjoy a price advantage over the mom-and-pop businesses that \nform the backbone of our communities. This bill would allow States to \ncollect sales taxes on remote sales, thereby leveling the playing field \nwith Main Street businesses.\n\n[[Page S3083]]\n\n  It is important to recognize that this bill does not authorize any \nnew or higher tax, nor does it impose an Internet tax. It simply helps \nensure that taxes already owed are paid.\n  I would like to engage Senator Enzi in a colloquy regarding the \nmanner in which the bill is to be implemented. As introduced, the bill \nwould require some businesses to start collecting sales taxes in as \nlittle as 90 days. I hope that my colleague from Wyoming would agree \nthat is too short a time period, and I appreciate the fact that he has \noffered an amendment that includes a 6-month delay. I believe, however, \nthat a delay of at least 1 year is needed to allow businesses time to \nimplement the new systems and software necessary for compliance. I do \nappreciate that the Senator from Wyoming exempted small businesses with \nsales under $1 million, as I had urged.\n  Nevertheless, from a covered seller's perspective, complying with the \nMarketplace Fairness Act requires more than just installing new \nsoftware. Multichannel retailers--those who sell online, through \ncatalogs, over the phones, and in stores--have their own unique order \nprocessing systems. Tax collection software must be programmed to link \nto each component of their order processing systems. This step alone \ncould involve considerable programming time for each online retailer.\n  Each retailer's tax department, or outside consultants, will be \nrequired to research and develop a comprehensive understanding of the \nunique sales and use tax policies in every State where their online \ncustomers reside to make sure the programming for their tax collection \nsoftware is correct. That involves answering a number of questions for \neach State.\n  The differing treatment of athletic apparel provides a great example \nof the complexity involved. In some States, clothing and athletic \nfootwear are exempt from tax. In others, they are exempt only up to a \ncertain price level. Yet other States make a distinction between \nclothing and footwear used for athletic purposes--which they tax--and \nclothing and footwear used for general purposes--which they do not tax. \nIn those States, systems must be programmed to correctly treat articles \nthat can be viewed as either athletic apparel or general clothing, \ndepending on the user. Board shorts, sneakers, and windbreakers are \njust a few examples of common items that give rise to substantial \ncomplexity.\n  Retailers will need to invest additional hours in tax analyst and \nprogrammer time to ensure their systems are able to address these \nissues seamlessly. Even with a 1-year delay, retailers will have to \nbegin early, and move quickly, to implement the Marketplace Fairness \nAct.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank my friend from Maine, and wholeheartedly agree with \nher conclusion that we must ensure that the Marketplace Fairness Act is \ncorrectly implemented. I have spent many years working on this \nlegislation and strongly believe that leveling the playing field for \nMain Street businesses is the right thing to do. We must implement the \nsolution to that problem in a reasonable manner, and I agree with the \nSenator that the 1-year delay she proposes is appropriate to do this.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I would also like to note that the collection of sales \ntaxes online will be new not only for many retailers, but also for \nconsumers who are used to the current system. It is important to \nimplement the new law correctly, from the outset, for these retailers \nand their customers.\n  In this regard, I believe that it is also important to make sure that \nthe implementation of the new law does not disrupt the busy holiday \nseason. For this reason, I believe that States should be prohibited \nfrom exercising their new authority under the Marketplace Fairness Act \nduring the last quarter of the first year after enactment.\n  Mr. ENZI. I think both the proposals made by my friend from Maine are \ncommonsense items that will improve the Marketplace Fairness Act. As \nthis bill moves through the legislative process, I suggest my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle--and in both Chambers--adopt a 1-\nyear delay in implementation and prohibit States from beginning to \nexercise their new authority to require the collection of sales taxes \nduring the holiday season.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \npassage of S. 743, as amended.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

No local jurisdiction may require a remote seller to \n     submit a sales and use tax return or to collect sales and use \n     taxes other than as provided by this paragraph.\n       (B) Provide a uniform sales and use tax base among the \n     State and the local taxing jurisdictions within the State \n     pursuant to paragraph (1).\n       (C) Source all remote sales in compliance with the sourcing \n     definition set forth in section 4(7).\n       (D) Provide--\n       (i) information indicating the taxability of products and \n     services along with any product and service exemptions from \n     sales and use tax in the State and a rates and boundary \n     database;\n       (ii) software free of charge for remote sellers that \n     calculates sales and use taxes due on each transaction at the \n     time the transaction is completed, that files sales and use \n     tax returns, and that is updated to reflect rate changes as \n     described in subparagraph (H); and\n       (iii) certification procedures for persons to be approved \n     as certified software providers.\n     For purposes of clause (iii), the software provided by \n     certified software providers shall be capable of calculating \n     and filing sales and use taxes in all States qualified under \n     this Act.\n       (E) Relieve remote sellers from liability to the State or \n     locality for the incorrect collection, remittance, or \n     noncollection of sales and use taxes, including any penalties \n     or interest, if the liability is the result of an error or \n     omission made by a certified software provider.\n       (F) Relieve certified software providers from liability to \n     the State or locality for the incorrect collection, \n     remittance, or noncollection of sales and use taxes, \n     including any penalties or interest, if the liability is the \n     result of misleading or inaccurate information provided by a \n     remote seller.\n       (G) Relieve remote sellers and certified software providers \n     from liability to the State or locality for incorrect \n     collection, remittance, or noncollection of sales and use \n     taxes, including any penalties or interest, if the liability \n     is the result of incorrect information or software provided \n     by the State.\n       (H) Provide remote sellers and certified software providers \n     with 90 days notice of a rate change by the State or any \n     locality in the State and update the information described in \n     subparagraph (D)(i) accordingly and relieve any remote seller \n     or certified software provider from liability for collecting \n     sales and use taxes at the immediately preceding effective \n     rate during the 90-day notice period if the required notice \n     is not provided.\n       (c) Small Seller Exception.--A State is authorized to \n     require a remote seller to collect sales and use taxes under \n     this Act only if the remote seller has gross annual receipts \n     in total remote sales in the United States in the preceding \n     calendar year exceeding $1,000,000. For purposes of \n     determining whether the threshold in this section is met, the \n     gross annual receipts from remote sales of 2 or more persons \n     shall be aggregated if--\n       (1) such persons are related to the remote seller within \n     the meaning of subsections (b) and (c) of section 267 or \n     section 707(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or\n       (2) such persons have 1 or more ownership relationships and \n     such relationships were designed with a principal purpose of \n     avoiding the application of these rules.\n\n     SEC. 3.

President, today I rise to recognize one of Congress' \nlongest-serving and loyal staffers, Charlie Houy. After three decades \nof service under Senators Ted Stevens, John Stennis\n\n[[Page S3085]]\n\nand Daniel Inouye, Charlie retired April 6, 2013. Today, on his one \nmonth retirement anniversary, we reflect on his quiet and steady \nleadership which was so important to the work of the Appropriations \nCommittee and the Senate.\n  Charlie began his career on the Appropriations Committee as a \nprofessional staff member for the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee \nin 1987. He was quickly promoted and assumed the role of democratic \nclerk starting in 1995. In that capacity, Charlie worked on nearly \nevery issue in the defense area from purchasing weapons to personnel \nissues.\n  Charlie's work on the Defense Subcommittee enabled our Nation's \nmilitary to transform itself from a Cold War-era force to the agile and \nquick response force that exists today. Charlie played a major role in \nhelping modernize our weapon systems, including helping secure funding \nfor the development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles--UAVs. Funding for UAVs \nhelped to change the tide of the latest conflict in our favor and will \ncontinue to play a major role as we continue to prosecute and disrupt \nterrorist activities worldwide.\n  The role of UAVs in today's warfare is especially evident in my home \nState of Nevada. Creech Air Force Base is home to the famed Predator \nand Reaper aerial vehicles. For decades, Creech Air Force Base was \ncomprised of a few buildings and a single runway, but Charlie's hard \nwork on the Appropriations Committee led to significant investment in \ninfrastructure and increases in Nevada military personnel. These \nadditional resources have transformed Indian Springs Auxiliary base to \nCreech Air Force Base, the premier UAV installation in the world, \nsupporting air and ground combat, reconnaissance, and search and \nrescue.\n  In 2009, Charlie assumed his current role as the staff director for \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee. As our Nation was dealing with the \neffects of the great recession, Charlie helped develop policies to \ninvest in American infrastructure and jumpstart the economy. His in-\ndepth knowledge about the intricacies of the legislative process, \ncoupled with his sense of humor, allowed him to keep order among the \nvarious subcommittees and continue the bipartisan nature of the \nCommittee.\n  Charlie played a major role in nearly every appropriation issue \nduring the last 5 years. From continuing resolutions to omnibus \nappropriations measures, Charlie helped navigate the Congressional \nlandscape to ensure passage into law. In particular, Charlie worked \nwith my staff to help avert a government shutdown and enact the Budget \nControl Act. I will always be grateful for Charlie's hard work on this \npiece of legislation.\n  Although the Senate and Nevada will miss Charlie's deep institutional \nknowledge about the appropriations process and the Federal budget, I am \nconfident that Charlie's work left a lasting mark on our Nation and on \nCongress. I am happy to thank Charlie for his three decades of service \nand wish him well in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/06/senate-section/article/S3085-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WORKERS MEMORIAL DAY\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, more than 20 years ago, family members of \nworkers killed on the job joined with safety advocates to launch \nWorkers Memorial Day--a day of remembrance and advocacy. To honor the \ncreation of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, \nApril 28 was chosen as Workers Memorial Day.\n  The passage of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which created \nOSHA, was one of the monumental legislative achievements of the 20th \ncentury. This landmark legislation, passed over four decades ago, \nreflects the values that all Americans share: that workers shouldn't \nhave to risk their lives to earn their livelihood, and that workers, \nemployers, and the government must all work together to keep people \nsafe and healthy on the job.\n  Since that time, workplace safety and health conditions have improved \ndramatically. In the year the OSH Act was enacted, our country saw \n13,800 on-the-job deaths. Forty years later, in 2010, that number is \ndown by more than 60 percent. It is without dispute that this \nlegislation has saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of American \nworkers in its 40-year lifespan, a remarkable accomplishment.\n  In addition to saving lives, OSHA saves our country money. The total \nfinancial cost of job injuries and illnesses is enormous--estimated at \n$250 billion to $300 billion a year. Preventing illnesses and injuries \nbefore they happen makes economic sense, in addition to being the right \nthing to do.\n  So today, on Worker's Memorial Day, we celebrate the success of OSHA. \nBut we also must acknowledge its limitations. Too many workers remain \nat serious risk of injury, illness or death on the job, as demonstrated \nby the recent fertilizer explosion in West Texas that killed at least \n14 and injured over 200. In 2011, according to data from the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics, 4,693 workers were killed on the job--an average of \n13 workers every day--and nearly 3 million nonfatal workplace injuries \nand illnesses were reported that same year. In our great State of Iowa, \n93 workers died on the job in 2011. Additionally, 43 Iowans died from \ninjuries sustained while working, and untold numbers of Iowans were \ninjured from exposures in the workplace. We absolutely can--and must--\ndo better.\n  That's why I am a co-sponsor of the Protecting America's Workers Act, \na piece of legislation that would build on OSHA's successes and save \nthe lives of countless additional workers. The bill makes commonsense \nreforms to bring our workplace safety laws into the 21st century, with \nminimal burden on the vast majority of employers that comply with the \nlaw.\n  One critical aspect of the Protecting America's Workers Act is that \nit will enhance the protection provided to workers who blow the whistle \non unsafe conditions in the workplace. OSHA does not have the necessary \nresources to inspect every workplace in the country on a regular basis, \nso whistleblowers play an essential role in identifying dangerous \nconditions. Because OSHA enforcement is aided by whistleblowers, it is \nin all of our interests to protect whistleblowers from unfair \nretaliation so they are not afraid to come forward. But the \nwhistleblower provision in OSHA has not been significantly amended or \nimproved since it was enacted and has fallen far behind similar \nretaliation protections in other worker protection, public health, and \nenvironmental laws. The Protecting America's Workers Act will remedy \nthat problem by strengthening whistleblower protections so more workers \nwill feel comfortable reporting dangerous conditions and work \nenvironments can improve for all.\n  In addition to protecting whistleblowers, the Protecting America's \nWorkers Act also extends OSHA protections to more workers, increases \npenalties for employers who break the law, enhances public \naccountability, and clarifies the duty of employers in providing a safe \nwork environment. These changes together comprise a critical step \ntowards providing a safer workplace for every worker in our country, \nand I plan to do everything possible to fight for this important \nlegislation.\n  While we have made tremendous progress in that last 40 years under \nOSHA, there is much more work to be done. All Americans have the right \nto a safe workplace, and we should not rest until all of our fathers, \nmothers, sisters, brothers, families, and friends can go to work each \nday knowing they will come home safely again each night.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/06/senate-section/article/S3085-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3085-S3086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ART GRATIAS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \ncongratulate Art Gratias of Mason City, IA on receiving the Legion of \nHonor from the French Government for his contribution to the liberation \nof France. Art Gratias enlisted in the U.S. Army in January of 1942, \nhaving begun the enlistment process before the attack on Pearl Harbor \nthat led to the formal participation of the United States in World War \nII. As a member of the 2nd Infantry Division, he participated in the D-\nday invasion of Normandy, which took place on his first wedding \nanniversary. Art fought in numerous campaigns in France and Central \nEurope, including the Battle of the Bulge. He was wounded on August 16, \n1944, receiving the Purple Heart and later returned to combat.\n  The French Government has expressed its gratitude to Art Gratias for \nwhat he did for their country. I would\n\n[[Page S3086]]\n\nnow like to take this opportunity to thank Art for his service to our \ncountry. In fact, despite the fact that he gave more to this country \nthrough his military service than we can ever thank him for, he \ncontinued to dedicate his life to public service. Art has been a school \nboard member, teacher, and school administrator. He has been very \nactive in the Kiwanis, American Legion, and his church. Art has served \non numerous volunteer boards, and in the Iowa Senate. Art Gratias is a \nprime example of that remarkable American spirit of voluntarism that \nthe French writer Alexis de Tocqueville discovered in the early years \nof our Nation so it is fitting that he was singled out by the French \nGovernment for its highest honor. I am proud to add my voice to those \nwho pay tribute to his life of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/06/senate-section/article/S3086-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, since 1974, the Community Development \nBlock Grant program has provided cities and counties with critical \nfunding to help low and moderate income people through community \nprojects for economic development, revitalization and infrastructure \nimprovements.\n  The Community Development Block Grant program also gives local \ngovernments the flexibility to use some of this funding to provide \nbasic public services directly to the most vulnerable people in their \ncommunities.\n  These essential services include providing meals, clean water, \nshelter and clothing to low income senior citizens, abused or neglected \nchildren, the disabled and the homeless.\n  For all the good programs that the Community Development Block Grant \nprogram does, communities are limited because local governments can \nonly spend a maximum of 15 percent of their funding on these vital \nservices.\n  For many of our local communities in Florida and across the country, \nthe 15 percent cap is too low to adequately help the number of people \nin need, especially during these tough times.\n  In one particular case, the City of Miami wants so desperately to use \nmore of its Community Development Block Grant funds for assistance to \nseniors for food programs, but they can't because of the 15 percent \ncap.\n  That is why I filed S. 855 on April 25, to raise that modest amount \nso that grant recipients can tailor the program to the needs of their \ncommunities, in this particular example, the needs of senior citizens.\n  This important legislation, which is being reintroduced in the House \nby Representative Ros-Lehtinen, allows local governments to spend up to \n25 percent of their funding for the Community Block Development program \non essential public services, rather than just 15 percent.\n  The bill does not require local governments to spend 25 percent of \ntheir funding on services, but it gives them the flexibility to do so \nif it is in the best interest of their communities.\n  Let me be clear, the bill does not increase funding to any part of \nthe Community Development Block Grant program. It simply allows local \ncommunities to do more with what they have, which is why both the U.S. \nConference of Mayors and the National League of Cities have supported \nthis position.\n  I hope that we in the Senate will take this critical step to help \nlocal governments to ensure that the most, vulnerable will continue to \nreceive the most basic services.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/06/senate-section/article/S3086-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          USS ``JOHN RODGERS''\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr President, I submit these remarks today to honor the \nachievements of the USS John Rodgers, DD-574, a Fletcher-class \ndestroyer of the United States Navy. The USS John Rodgers was \ncommissioned on February 9, 1943, with Commander H.O. Parish, USN, \ncommanding.\n  The USS John Rodgers joined the Pacific Fleet upon arrival in Pearl \nHarbor in June 1943. During her 2 years of almost constant service in \nthe forward area, the USS John Rodgers was under frequent air attacks, \nyet still assisted other ships and planes in destroying innumerable \nenemy aircraft.\n  The courageous crew of the USS John Rodgers sank an enemy patrol \ncraft, destroyed six mines, rescued twenty-five downed airmen, to \ninclude three British personnel, and engaged in eight bombardments of \nJapanese held territory in support of various amphibious operations.\n  The sailors of USS John Rodgers bravely executed an anti-shipping \nsweep 30 miles into Suruga Qan, the deepest penetration of Japanese \nhomewaters made by surface vessels during the war. The crew was \nrecognized by the commanding general, Third Marine Division, for \noutstanding performance while in contact with the enemy.\n  The commanding officers and squadron commanders who embarked in this \nvessel and honorably served the USS John Rodgers: Captain E.M. \nThompson, Captain Henry Crommelin, and Captain Joseph W. Ludewig, \nCommander H.O. Parish, and Commander J.G. Franklin.\n  The USS John Rodgers earned 12 battle stars in World War II, and \nremarkably she sustained zero personnel losses during her service. At \nall times the morale of the crew was excellent and in keeping with the \nhighest traditions of the naval service.\n  The USS John Rodgers was decommissioned on 25 May 1946. I would like \nto take this opportunity to personally thank the sailors and the \nfamilies of the USS John Rodgers for their commitment, patriotism, and \ndedication to the USS John Rodgers, the United States Navy, and the \nUnited States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/06/senate-section/article/S3086-3", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3086-S3087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING FUTURE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED SERVICES\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor 453 high school \nseniors in 8 northeast Ohio counties who deserve this Nation's eternal \ngratitude for their commendable decision to enlist in the United States \nArmed Forces. Of these 453 seniors from 130 high schools in 93 towns \nand cities, 86 will enter the Army, 171 will enter the Marine Corps, 62 \nwill enter the Navy, 43 will enter the Air Force, 3 will enter the \nCoast Guard, 82 will enter our Ohio Army National Guard, and 6 will \nenter into the Ohio Air National Guard. In the presence of their \nparents/guardians, and high school counselors, military leaders, city \nand business leaders, all 453 will be recognized on May 7, 2013 by \n``Our Community Salutes of Northeast Ohio.''\n  In a few short weeks, these young men and women will join with many \nof their classmates in celebration of their high school graduation. At \na time when many of their peers are looking forward to pursuing \nvocational training or college degrees, or are uncertain about their \nfuture, these young men and women instead have chosen to dedicate \nthemselves to military service in defense of our rights, our freedoms, \nand our country.\n  I have no doubt that many are anxious about the uncertainties that \nawait them as members of the Armed Forces. But they do not go forward \nfrom their homes and their families alone. They should rest assured \nthat the full support and resources of this Chamber, and the American \npeople, are with them in whatever challenges may lie ahead.\n  These 453 young men and women are the cornerstone of our liberties. \nIt is thanks to their dedication and the dedication of an untold number \nof patriots just like them that we are able to meet here today, in the \nU.S. Senate, and openly debate the best solutions to the many diverse \nproblems that confront our country. It is thanks to their sacrifices \nthat the United States of America remains a beacon of hope and freedom \nin a dangerous world. We are grateful to them, and we are grateful to \ntheir parents and their communities for instilling in them not only the \nmental and physical abilities our Armed Forces require, but more \nimportantly the character, the values, and the discipline that leads \nsomeone to put service to our Nation over self.\n  Their decision to serve our country will not go unrecognized, not by \nthe veterans who will stop to salute them as they pass, nor by the \neveryday Americans who will shake their hands in grocery stores and gas \nstations and airports, just to let them know how much we all appreciate \ntheir service. I would like to personally thank these 453 graduating \nseniors for their selflessness and the courage that they have shown by \nvolunteering to risk their lives in defense of our Nation. We owe them, \nalong with all those who\n\n[[Page S3087]]\n\nserve our country, a deep debt of gratitude.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe names of the 453 high school seniors.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n\n                         United States Army--86\n\n       Abee--Streetsboro;

Mr. President, my colleague Senator Jim Risch joins \nme today in recognizing the significant accomplishments of Sylvia \nMedina, who is retiring as president & chief executive officer of North \nWind, Inc.\n  Sylvia is influential locally, regionally, nationally and \ninternationally. She founded North Wind, headquartered in Idaho Falls, \nwhich provides engineering, construction and environmental services to \nFederal and State agencies and private industry. Through her hard work \nand innovation, she grew North Wind into a leading business employing \nmore than 300 scientific, engineering, construction and professional \npersonnel in 21 offices throughout the country. In 2009, Sylvia sold \nNorth Wind to Cook Inlet Regional, Inc., CIRI, but remained on as \npresident and chief executive officer.\n  Sylvia steps in to address community needs, and she has a strong \ncommitment to community service. She has supported youth and education \nprograms, the arts and environmental conservation efforts. She was also \ninstrumental in raising money for the construction of an animal shelter \nand dog park. In addition, Sylvia has served in leadership roles for \nseveral local and national organizations that include the Idaho State \nUniversity Foundation, Holy Rosary School, Women Impacting Public \nPolicy, Green Kids Inc., Grow Idaho Falls, Idaho Falls Symphony, the \nSnake River Animal Shelter, LLC and the Institute for Economic \nEmpowerment of Women.\n  Sylvia's strong leadership and dedication have been recognized \nthrough awards and her selection to assist with important initiatives. \nFor example, she was appointed by Governor Butch Otter to the \nLeadership in Nuclear Energy Commission. Among her numerous honors, the \nU.S. Small Business Administration recognized Sylvia as a Small \nBusiness Person of the Year in 2008. In 2009, she received the Latina \nWomen Entrepreneur of the Year Award from the Anna Maria Aras Memorial \nBusiness Fund and a Torch Award from the Better Business Bureau.\n  Sylvia leads by example and demonstrates a constant commitment to \nintegrity and bettering the community. It has been great to work with \nSylvia. Sylvia, your expertise and insight on small business issues \nhave been valuable and greatly appreciated, and we look forward to \ncontinuing to work with you on future joint efforts. We hope that your \nretirement from North Wind provides you deserved time with your family, \nincluding your husband and three children, and your many friends.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor William Lee \nRich, a career Navy man. Bill, on behalf of all Montanans and all \nAmericans, I stand to say ``thank you'' for your service to this \nNation.\n  It is my honor to share the story of Bill Rich's service in the U.S. \nNavy, because no story of heroism should ever fall through the cracks.\n  Bill was born in Jamestown, NY in 1947. After moving around the \ncountry with his family, he graduated from Spring Valley High School in \nNew York and enlisted with the U.S. Navy in Poughkeepsie in 1966.\n  Bill trained with the Seabees in Davisville, RI before transferring \nto Mobile Construction Battalion 21 at Seabee Headquarters in Gulfport, \nMS. From there he was deployed to Phu Bai with M-C-B 21, just south of \nHue City in Vietnam. While in Vietnam, Bill's unit was responsible for \ntransporting South Vietnamese refugees out of Hue.\n  In February 1968, his unit saw heavy action during the Tet Counter \nOffensive. They were responsible for transporting a group of South \nVietnamese out of Hue to the refuge center at Phu Bai. It was for their \ntime in Hue that the M-C-B 21 received the Presidential Unit Citation. \nBill also earned his Combat Action Ribbon.\n  Bill's deployment ended after 9 months, and his unit returned to \nGulfport, MS before going back to Vietnam, this time to Camp Eagle in \nthe Gia Lai Province. During his 8 months at Camp Eagle, Bill worked on \nvarious construction and electrical projects, both around the camp and \nin Hue. He also worked with the American-Vietnamese Civic Action \nProgram to help construct engineering projects in the region.\n  After his two tours in Vietnam, Bill transferred to Naval Reserve \nConstruction Battalion 19 for 4 years before returning to active duty.\n  Back with the Seabees, Bill was assigned to Italy and New Zealand \nbefore spending a year in Antarctica as part of Operation Deep Freeze. \nHe was then assigned to Harold E. Holt station in Australia where he \nmarried his wife, Debby, a Helena native.\n  From Australia, Bill went to Winter Harbor, ME and then to M-C-B 74 \nin Gulfport. He deployed from Gulfport to Japan and Puerto Rico. From \nbattalion he went to Manama, Bahrain in the Persian Gulf as a contract \ninspector.\n  From Bahrain, Bill went to the Naval Headquarters in London, England \nfor 4 years where his daughter Mariah was born.\n  Bill's last assignment was part of a five-man active duty staff for \nReserve Construction Battalion 13 at Camp Smith, Peekskill, NY. Before \nhe retired, Bill received both the New York State Conspicuous Service \nCross and the Long and Faithful Service Medal.\n  Upon his retirement, he received both the Navy and Army Achievement \nMedals. Bill retired with the rank of E-6 Construction Electrician \nFirst Class.\n  Bill transferred to Fleet Reserve and retired after a 30-year naval \ncareer.\n  Petty Officer Bill Rich moved to Helena to start his new life with \nhis wife and daughter.

Mr. President, on April 22, 1970--after years of \nplanning--Earth Day activities stretched from college campuses, to city \nparks, to community halls across the country.\n  The landscape has changed since students, activists, and \nenvironmentalists celebrated the first Earth Day. That citizen call to \naction spurred a new season of environmental protections that have \nimproved the health of our Nation's air, lands, rivers, and the Great \nLakes.\n  Just several decades ago, polluted air and water threatened the \npublic health and safety of our Nation. The Cuyahoga River in Cleveland \nhad caught on fire and oil spills marred the beaches of Santa Barbara.\n  These catastrophic events served as catalysts that established the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA, passed the Clean Air and Clean \nWater Acts, and formed a public and political consciousness of the need \nto safeguard our environment.\n  Today, the Cuyahoga River--44 years after the fire--is cleaner and \nhealthier, more than 60 different fish species are thriving, and \ncountless families are again enjoying its natural beauty.\n  Today, Earth Day is celebrated around the world.\n  Now communities across Ohio and the Nation are spurring on the next \ngeneration of environmental innovation.\n  Seeds planted in places such as Oregon, OH--a city just east of \nToledo in northwest Ohio--are beginning to grow.\n  To reduce energy costs, the Oregon City School District partnered \nwith the Toledo-Lucas County Port Authority to transition away from \ntraditional electricity to wind and solar power. Oregon City Schools \nset up wind turbines at Clay High School and Eisenhower Middle School. \nThey installed solar panels on the roofs of Jerusalem and Starr \nElementary Schools. And these innovative investments have paid off. In \njust 10 days in October, Clay Campus's wind turbine, Power Wind 56, \nproduced 149 percent of campus energy needs. All computers, all lights, \nall kitchen activity, and fans on Clay Campus are now wind-powered. \nThis includes the administration building, bus garage, and maintenance \nbuilding at the stadium. Besides saving on energy costs, as of March \n21, the school district is producing 800 fewer tons of carbon dioxide. \nThis means less acid rain-causing sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide \ngoing into the air.\n  This innovation and activism marks tremendous progress toward a more \nsustainable environment.\n  If we fail to protect our natural resources, we risk the health of \ncitizens, the viability of our coastal areas, and the productivity of \nour State's farms, forests, and fisheries. We risk our long-term \neconomic and national security. Yet we know that choosing between \neconomic growth and environmental protections is a false choice.\n  Despite our population growing by 50 percent in the past 40 years and \nthe number of cars on the road having doubled over that same time, our \nair is now 60 percent cleaner than at the time of the first Earth Day \nin 1970.\n  Done right, our Nation can become energy independent, improve its \nglobal competitiveness, and create new jobs and technologies for our \nworkforce. As we plant the seeds for economic growth--for new jobs in \nnew industries--we are also planting the seeds for a cleaner, more \nsustainable environment.\n  The students and parents of the Oregon City School District are a \nreminder that taking steps to protect our air and water is something \nthat we do every day, not just on April 22.\n  Earth Day reminds us of our ability and our history of innovation and \nperseverance to protect our environment for current and future \ngenerations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/06/senate-section/article/S3089-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3089]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO EARL HOLDING\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I wish to pay special tribute \nto a man I have admired for many years, Earl Holding. Sadly, Earl \npassed away April 19, 2013 leaving behind a lasting legacy that \ngarnered the respect of many throughout our State and Nation.\n  Earl was a Utah icon--a businessman who reached the highest echelons \nof the business world--yet spent time to help people from all walks of \nlife, and in many pursuits and interests. His work ethic is legendary. \nFrom a young age, Earl put in long days at whatever business he \npursued, and he was truly an example of someone who wasn't afraid to \nroll up his sleeves and get his hands dirty--right along with his \nemployees.\n  In 1949 Earl married his life's partner and eternal sweetheart, Carol \nOrme. Their marriage was a testament to their partnership as \ncompanions--at work and at home. Carol was almost always found at the \nside of Earl working the land, running hotels, and raising children. \nThey are the proud parents of three children and twelve grandchildren \nwhom they deeply love.\n  Earl's strength as a business leader has been witnessed by many \nemployees he tutored and led in many successful and important companies \nincluding the Little America and Grand America hotels, the Snowbasin \nSki Resort, and Sinclair Oil.\n  In the 1990s Earl was a driving force in helping to bring the Winter \nOlympic Games to Salt Lake City. His willingness to build world-class \nfacilities to help stage the games cannot be overlooked as one of the \nkey factors in the utmost success of the 2002 Winter Olympics. His \ncontributions will never be forgotten.\n  Earl and Carol loved the land and enjoyed spending time at their \nranches or property throughout the West. He loved to hike, bike, fish, \nor just enjoy nature in our wonderful part of the world. He had a great \nreverence for the beauty of our country and always sought to build \nedifices that paid tribute to that splendor.\n  Utah and our Nation lost a truly great business leader and giant of a \nman when Earl left this earthly existence. I know that many people will \ntruly miss his strength, leadership, and commitment to excellence. I \nwill miss all of those things, but I will also miss a cherished friend. \nI am grateful for the relationship Earl and I have enjoyed for many \nyears and the support and wisdom he always shared.\n  Elaine and I convey our deepest sympathies to Carol and their family. \nMay our Heavenly Father bless them with peace and comfort at this time. \nThe contributions and impact Earl made on his family, his community, \nUtah and our Nation will be felt and appreciated for generations to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/06/senate-section/article/S3089-3", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3089-S3090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING EXCEPTIONAL NEVADA MOTHERS\n\n Mr. HELLER.

American Mothers, Inc. is the official \nsponsor of Mother's Day and the Mother of the Year.\n  As a mother of five children and four grandchildren, Mrs. Hyer has \ndemonstrated the great responsibility of motherhood and dedication to \nliving and teaching her children outstanding qualities, such as love, \nunderstanding, courage, service, and compassion. As a recipient of this \naward, Mrs. Hyer will help deliver this message about motherhood to \ncommunity organizations in Southern Nevada and throughout the State. I \nwish her all the best in her future endeavors and congratulate her on \nthis well-deserved award.\n  Mrs. Wadsworth is also a devoted and honorable mother.

In 1984, he was appointed to the Warrant Officer Corps. In 2010, he \nbecame the regimental chief officer--the highest ranking warrant \nofficer--of the U.S. Army's Ordnance Corps. Chief Satterfield served in \nmultiple overseas tours and deployments to Germany, Panama, South \nKorea, Kuwait, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and numerous locations across the \nUnited States. His service earned him numerous military awards and \ndecorations, including the Legion of Merit and the Bronze Star, for his \nfaithful service and contribution to the Army's mission.\n  In retirement, I am confident that Chief Satterfield will continue to \nserve our Nation. On behalf of the Senate Armed Services Committee and \nthe U.S. Senate, I am proud to thank Chief Satterfield, his wife \nDeirdre, and their son Steven, for four decades of honorable service to \nour Nation.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nachievements of Laurel Sayer, who is retiring from congressional \nservice.\n  For the past 14 years, Laurel has served as the Natural Resources and \nIdaho National Laboratory policy adviser for my fellow Idaho \ncongressional delegation colleague, Representative Mike Simpson. \nThroughout her career, Laurel has served as a trusted advisor and \nresource to many. She has worked hard to develop partnerships and \nadvocate for the interests of Idahoans.\n  Prior to working for Representative Simpson, Laurel served as an \nintegral member of my staff for 6 years when I served in the U.S. House \nof Representatives. Among her responsibilities, she enhanced outreach \nefforts and provided valuable input on natural resources issues. Laurel \njoined my House staff with a wealth of community experience, which \nquickly translated into a great base for advocating for Idahoans in \neastern Idaho. The years that she spent doing volunteer efforts in the \ncommunity paid off for Idahoans as she transitioned into one of the \nmost effective congressional staffers in the State.\n  She has been very involved throughout eastern Idaho and developed \nvaluable relationships with local, State, regional, and Federal \nGovernment agencies and numerous organizations and individuals. For \nexample, she has served in leadership roles for the Yellowstone \nBusiness Partnership, the Idaho Commission on the Arts, the Idaho Falls \nArts Council, the Idaho Community Foundation, and the Education \nFoundation. Laurel has contributed significantly to the arts in Idaho, \nincluding promoting related projects, arts councils, and arts groups.\n  Laurel has served the community, State, and Nation with distinction, \nand I thank her for her hard work on behalf of Idahoans.

Res. 128\n\n       Whereas the aging of the baby boom generation will cause \n     the number of individuals in the United States who are 65 \n     years of age or older to increase from 40,000,000 to \n     70,000,000 during the next 2 decades;\n       Whereas 12,000,000 adults, nearly half of whom are under 65 \n     years of age, need long-term services and supports due to \n     functional limitations;\n       Whereas the decision of the Supreme Court in Olmstead v. \n     L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), mandates the end of unnecessary \n     segregation of individuals with disabilities in institutions, \n     and requires that individuals with disabilities receive \n     services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their \n     needs;\n       Whereas the vast majority of individuals in the United \n     States prefer to receive long-term services and supports in \n     their homes so that they may continue to live independently \n     and with dignity;\n       Whereas the costs of long-term services and supports for \n     seniors and individuals with disabilities are high;\n       Whereas the great expense of long-term services and \n     supports can affect all individuals, regardless of income;\n       Whereas 70 percent of individuals who are 65 years of age \n     or older will need some form of long-term services and \n     supports;\n       Whereas the number of individuals who need long-term \n     services and supports is projected to grow from 12,000,000 to \n     27,000,000 by 2050;\n       Whereas there are approximately 3,200,000 workers in the \n     direct care workforce, leaving a huge gap between the \n     services needed and the size of the current workforce;\n       Whereas the United States is experiencing a jobs crisis, as \n     25,000,000 individuals are unemployed or underemployed;\n       Whereas home care is one of the fastest growing industries \n     in the United States economy, providing critical daily care, \n     services, and supports to millions of individuals and \n     families across the country;\n       Whereas an estimated 1,800,000 additional home care workers \n     will be needed during the next decade to serve the growing \n     population of seniors and individuals with disabilities;\n       Whereas the quality of home care jobs is poor, with low \n     wages, few benefits, high turnover, and a high level of job \n     stress and hazards;\n       Whereas home care and personal assistance workers earn a \n     median hourly wage of $9.53, and nearly half of such workers \n     live in households that also rely on public assistance;\n       Whereas approximately 55 percent of home care workers work \n     part-time, and approximately 44 percent of those part-time \n     workers would prefer to work more hours;\n       Whereas nearly 21 percent of the individuals who provide \n     home care services were born outside the United States;\n       Whereas a stabilized home care workforce would lead to \n     improved continuity and quality of long-term services and \n     supports;\n       Whereas the issue of long-term services and supports is a \n     critical issue for women, as 70 percent of individuals who \n     need such care are women 65 years of age or older, 90 percent \n     of paid caregivers are women, and 85 percent of family \n     members and friends who informally provide care are women who \n     often have to leave the paid workforce to provide such care, \n     and thus are at a financial disadvantage during their working \n     years and face a reduction in Social Security benefits when \n     they retire;

which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 129\n\n       Whereas the United States joins together each May to pay \n     tribute to the contributions of generations of Asian \n     Americans and Pacific Islanders who have enriched the history \n     of the United States;\n       Whereas the history of Asian Americans and Pacific \n     Islanders in the United States is inextricably tied to the \n     story of the United States;\n       Whereas the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community \n     is an inherently diverse population comprised of more than 45 \n     distinct ethnicities and more than 100 language dialects;\n       Whereas, according to the Bureau of the Census, the Asian-\n     American population grew faster than any other racial or \n     ethnic group in the United States during the last decade, \n     surging nearly 46 percent between 2000 and 2010, which is a \n     growth rate 4 times faster than that of the total population \n     of the United States;\n       Whereas the 2010 decennial census estimated that there are \n     approximately 17,300,000 residents of the United States who \n     identify as Asian and approximately 1,200,000 residents of \n     the United States who identify themselves as Native Hawaiian \n     or other Pacific Islander, making up nearly 6 percent of the \n     total population of the United States;\n       Whereas the month of May was selected for Asian/Pacific \n     American Heritage Month because the first immigrants from \n     Japan arrived in the United States on May 7, 1843, and the \n     first transcontinental railroad was completed on May 10, \n     1869, with substantial contributions from immigrants from \n     China;\n       Whereas 2013 marks 70 years since the repeal of the Act of \n     May 5, 1892 (27 Stat. 25, chapter 60) (commonly known as the \n     ``Geary Act'' or the ``Chinese Exclusion Act''), and 25 years \n     since the passage of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 (50 \n     U.S.C. App. 1989b et seq.) that granted reparations to \n     Japanese Americans interned during World War II, both cases \n     in which Congress acted to address discriminatory laws that \n     targeted people of Asian descent;\n       Whereas section 102 of title 36, United States Code, \n     officially designates May as Asian/Pacific American Heritage \n     Month and requests the President to issue an annual \n     proclamation calling on the people of the United States to \n     observe the month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and \n     activities;\n       Whereas, in 2013, the Congressional Asian Pacific American \n     Caucus, a bicameral caucus of Members of Congress advocating \n     on behalf of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, is \n     composed of 40 Members, including 13 Members of Asian or \n     Pacific Islander descent;\n       Whereas, in 2013, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are \n     serving in State legislatures across the United States in \n     record numbers, including in the States of Alaska, Arizona, \n     California, Connecticut, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, \n     Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, \n     Vermont, Virginia, and Washington;\n       Whereas the number of Federal judges who are Asian \n     Americans or Pacific Islanders more than doubled between 2009 \n     and 2013, reflecting a commitment to diversity in the Federal \n     judiciary that has resulted in the confirmations of high \n     caliber Asian-American and Pacific Islander judicial \n     nominees;\n       Whereas there remains much to be done to ensure that Asian \n     Americans and Pacific Islanders have access to resources and \n     a voice in the Government of the United States and continue \n     to advance in the political landscape of the United States; \n     and\n       Whereas celebrating Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month \n     provides the people of the United States with an opportunity \n     to recognize the achievements, contributions, and history of \n     Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and to appreciate the \n     challenges faced by Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the significance of May 2013 as Asian/\n     Pacific American Heritage Month as an important time to \n     celebrate the significant contributions of Asian Americans \n     and Pacific Islanders to the history of the United States; \n     and\n       (2) recognizes that the Asian-American and Pacific Islander \n     community enhances the\n\n[[Page S3097]]\n\n     rich diversity of and strengthens the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/06/senate-section/article/S3097-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n               COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.
