Mr. President, we are now entering the second week of a \nRepublican government shutdown. The Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives is still sitting on the one bill that can reopen the \ngovernment. Speaker Boehner insists the Senate-passed bill to end the \nshutdown can't pass the House. Well, I am not the first to issue this \nchallenge--it has been issued all weekend and yesterday--and that is, \nprove it. Bring it up for a vote. If the Speaker really believes the \nbill will not pass, he shouldn't be worried about bringing it up.\n  The House, though, if we look at what has happened, has wasted weeks \nvoting--and I have really lost track of the number of times, but I \nthink it is 44 times--the House alone has acted to repeal ObamaCare 44 \ntimes. What is the result every time they vote? The same. Truly what \nEinstein said: The real definition of ``insanity'' is someone who keeps \ndoing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. If, \nin fact, Einstein is right, then that is insanity, what is going on \nover there--to vote more than 40 times on the same thing and lose every \ntime. So let's talk about wasting time. Has that been a waste of time? \nMaybe after 5 or 6 times they should have maybe gotten the message, but \nhow about 44 times? Talk about wasting time.\n  Could it be that the Speaker is really worried that reasonable \nRepublicans will join Democrats to pass legislation to open the \ngovernment? Sensible Republicans have grown increasingly fed up with \nthe shutdown, and they are looking for a way out. Just yesterday Peter \nKing of New York, a Republican, said:\n\n       Republicans should not have started this. Closing the \n     government down was the wrong thing to do.\n\n  Republican Congressman King called Speaker Boehner's unreasonable \nstrategy to shut down the government unless Democrats agree to defund \nor end ObamaCare--a law that will help 25 million uninsured Americans \ngain access to affordable care--doomed to failure. That is what Peter \nKing said.\n  Again quoting Congressman King:\n\n       If we want to defund something, we should repeal it, and do \n     it the same way the President got it signed--elect \n     Republicans to both Houses of Congress, repeal it, and have a \n     Republican President sign it.\n\n  Mr. President, it is pretty obvious what is going on. I have known it \nall the time. We have all known it all the time. When I say ``all the \ntime,'' at least in these last many months. But it was made very clear \nto the world on Sunday in a front-page story in the New York Times. \nThey worked a while on that story, but basically what the story said is \nthat very rich people in America who don't believe in government have \nused ObamaCare as a conduit to shut down the government. That is what \nthey wanted to do. That is what they have done, with huge amounts of \nmoney. We know this has been led by, according to the news article, a \nformer Attorney General of the United States, Ed Meese, and the Koch \nbrothers, who have been raising and spending hundreds of millions of \ndollars to get us where we are right now.\n  But what Peter King suggested is that we follow the democratic \nprocess. That has been turned on its head. I know Republicans don't \nlike ObamaCare, but the Affordable Care Act has been the law of the \nland for 4 years, been declared constitutional by the Supreme Court of \nthe United States, and millions of Americans--multimillions of \nAmericans--are already benefiting from this law.\n  There are rumors floating around. One of my rich friends from Nevada \ncalled me on Friday. He said: Harry, I am down here in southern \nCalifornia getting a little cosmetic surgery. My anesthesiologist told \nme one of his friends, who is a general surgeon, took somebody's \ngallbladder out. Do you know how much money he got back for that?\n  I don't know if it was a he or a she.\n  I said: No, I don't know.\n  He said: Fifty-eight dollars. That is what ObamaCare is all about.\n\n[[Page S7276]]\n\n  I said: That is not possible because ObamaCare, that aspect of it, \ndoesn't kick in until January 1.\n  He said: Are you sure you are right?\n  I said: Yes. All this signing up for exchanges and all that will take \n3 months.\n  These are the rumors floating around out there about ObamaCare.\n  If Republicans want to propose a legislative way to make the law work \nbetter or more efficiently, Peter King is right. We are willing to do \nthat and do it the way our democratic process provides.\n  (Mr. MARKEY assumed the Chair.)\n  I see the Senator from Massachusetts has taken the Chair, and he \nserved many years with Peter King. I personally have watched his voting \nrecord. I don't like most of it, but at least he is speaking out, and I \nadmire the man for doing that. By shutting down the government--and \nthat is what has happened--we are satisfying the Koch brothers and Ed \nMeese, but millions of people in America are suffering.\n  ObamaCare is not going to disappear. It is here. The senior Senator \nfrom Arizona gave a speech here within the last week or so, and he \nsaid: I don't like ObamaCare. I campaigned against ObamaCare when I ran \nfor President. I campaigned against it when Obama ran the next time. \nBut, he said, we lost. It passed. He is President. Elections have \nconsequences.\n  That is what the senior Senator from Arizona said, and he is right.\n  ObamaCare is not going to magically disappear.\n  Tom Friedman, a renowned journalist--his bipartisanship has been \nlegendary. He is a brilliant writer. He was chief correspondent for the \nNew York Times for many years in the Middle East. He has covered all \nparts of the world. He has won three Pulitzer prizes--maybe four--and \nhe has had five or six best-selling books. But even Tom Friedman has \ngiven up trying to be bipartisan. He wrote in the New York Times, where \nhe writes a column 3 days a week, that ObamaCare is not really at stake \nin this shutdown, it is democracy that is at stake.\n  Here is exactly what he said:\n\n       When extremists feel that insulated from playing by the \n     traditional rules of our system, if we do not defend those \n     rules--namely majority rule and the fact that if you don't \n     like a policy passed by Congress, signed by the president and \n     affirmed by the Supreme Court, then you have to go out and \n     win an election to overturn it; you can't just put a fiscal \n     gun to the country's head--then our democracy is imperiled.\n\n  He went on to say more:\n\n       President Obama is not defending health care. He's \n     defending the health of our democracy. Every American who \n     cherishes that should stand with him.\n\n  Mr. President, that is as true as anything could be. We stand with \nour President. We stand with a President who is President of everyone \nin America.\n  We believe deeply that ObamaCare is already saving lives and will \nsave many more in the future, but we are willing to work with \nRepublicans to change it if they think they can make it better. We want \nto do that.\n  I wrote a letter 1 week ago today to the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives--and he knows this--where I said: You know, we are in \nthis position because you asked me to put you in this position to do \nthis.\n  He said, going back as far as July and confirmed in the early part of \nSeptember, I--the Speaker of the House of Representatives--want to have \na clean CR, and the way we can do that is you agree to our number. He \nsaid this in July and early September.\n  I said: I hate your number. It is unfair. We passed a budget here--\n$70 billion more than that.\n  He said: But we have to avoid problems here. We can't have a \ngovernment shutdown. Work with me, take that number, and we will have a \nclean CR and go on to other things.\n  I did that. It was hard. Senator Mikulski, chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, hated it, and Senator Murray, chairman of the \nBudget Committee, hated it, but then they said: OK, we will go ahead \nand do it. We will work with you to help talk to the caucus.\n  We did that based on the assurances of the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives that we would get this out of the way in order to fund \nthe government for 1 year. Well, he didn't live up to what he committed \nto doing. In our business that is not good.\n  In addition to that I said in the letter: OK, you have sent us a \nlittle piece of legislation over here saying you want to have a \nconference. We agree. We will talk to you about anything you want to \ntalk about. You want to talk about discretionary spending, you want to \ntalk about the farm bill, you want to talk about postal reform, you \nwant to talk about health care, we will talk, but open the government \nand extend the debt ceiling.\n  He read the letter. I called him 45 minutes later. He said: No, can't \ndo that.\n  He can't take yes for an answer on the number in the CR or what he \nwants to talk about. I don't know what else is left to talk about.\n  All we are asking is that government be reopened. Stop threatening a \ncatastrophic default on the Nation's bills. We have to pay our bills. \nWhat kind of a country do we want?\n  As I do every 2 weeks, I met yesterday with someone who briefs me on \nwhat is going on around the world with our intelligence services. This \nperson told me his counterpart from a relatively small European country \nis making fun of our country because of what is going on here. In \ntoday's press China is complaining. They are doing pretty well \neconomically. They buy our securities and they need a place to invest \ntheir money that is secure. China is now complaining about the fiscal \nintegrity of the United States of America because we are arriving at a \npoint in a few days where we are not going to pay our bills.\n  This is America. We are not asking the Speaker to do something that \nis unreasonable. We want him to pass a bill that has his number in it, \nnot ours. Ours is $70 billion higher than that. We are also not asking \nhim to do anything unreasonable. He asked us to go to conference. We \nsay let's do it. All we want is the government open first, and we will \nagree to conference.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield to my friend, the distinguished \nPresident pro tempore.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was there, and I saw how hard the Senator \nworked to pass a continuing resolution--as a number of the Republican \nleadership of the House had asked and based on their assurances that we \nwould use it.\n  I would ask my friend, the majority leader, is that sort of a classic \nbait-and-switch operation? If it is, I can think of another one where \nthey asked us to pass a budget. Senator Murray led us in passing one \nwhere we finished the last vote at 5:30 or 6:00 on a Saturday morning, \nhaving gone around the clock. Then we wanted to go to conference after \nthe Republicans demanded we pass one, and they then refused to let us \ngo to conference with the Republican-led House. Is this bait and \nswitch?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through the Chair to my friend, the senior \nSenator from Vermont: We have a law in place. The Presiding Officer \nvoted for it when he was a Member of the House of Representatives. We \nvoted for it. There is a law that set spending levels for multiyear. We \ndid that. It was part of a deal. It was a law that was passed. But in \nspite of us having passed a law that set the standards for 2 years, the \nRepublicans kept coming to the floor many times saying Democrats need \nto pass a budget.\n  We didn't need to pass a budget. We already had those numbers in \nplace. But after this haranguing that went on for so long, we said, OK, \nwe want to get along. We don't want any problems. So Senator Murray, \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee, worked very hard to pass a \nbudget, and we did that. Lo and behold, after the Republicans kept \ntalking about regular order, we wanted to go to regular order, and they \nsaid: No, thanks. And she has been waiting 6 months. So the President \npro tempore's description is absolutely true.\n  Let me close by saying all we ask is for the Speaker to be \nreasonable. If he brings his bill, his resolution, to the floor, it \nwill pass. And then everyone has my commitment: Open the government, \nraise the debt ceiling, and we will talk about anything you want to \ntalk about. We are not afraid to go to conference. We are happy to go \nto conference. That is what we used to do\n\n[[Page S7277]]\n\nhere all the time. But we have a little problem: The Republicans won't \nlet us go to conference. Maybe they will in this instance because that \nis what he said he wants.\n  So open the government and get back to the so-called conversation, as \nhe talks about it. We will get back to the negotiating table and work \nout our budget disagreements. We can even start talking about ways to \nmake the Affordable Care Act better--not worse, but better. We can get \nback to the business of legislating. That is what our job has always \nbeen and should be.\n  I would ask the Chair to announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/08/senate-section/article/S7277-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of our \ndistinguished majority leader. He has probably the most frustrating job \nthere is because he has continuously brought up and passed bills to get \nus out of this and reopen the government, and he is blocked by the \nRepublican leadership in the other body.\n  Today marks the 8th day of this unnecessary government shutdown, more \nthan 192 hours since the world saw the doors to the United States \nGovernment closed for this embarrassing and needless shutdown. While \nthe Republicans in the House have the ability to end this shutdown \nright now--before noon today--they refuse to pass the clean continuing \nresolution approved by the Senate.\n  I have joined other Senators in coming to the floor to speak about \nthe pervasive impact of the shutdown, and there isn't a single family \nin Vermont or in America--Republican, Democratic, or Independent--that \nthis shutdown hasn't affected. All these families have been affected, \nbut now we face cascading worsening effects to come the longer this \nsenseless shutdown continues. I have joined the chorus of voices urging \nthe relatively few in the House of Representatives holding up this \nprocess to put an end to this political act of destruction. It might \nallow them to send out bumper stickers and raise money from their \nsupporters, but it is not helping the country.\n  If the human toll of the impact--if a Vermonter is not able to buy a \nhome, or children turned away from potentially life-saving clinical \ntrials, or the parents of our fallen soldiers who won't receive death \nbenefits to pay for their funerals--and that is not an exaggeration. We \nhave always had a program, when one of our soldiers dies overseas in \ncombat, there are benefits established so the family can at least be \nthere when the casket returns at Dover Air Force Base and to provide \nfor the funeral. Even that is cut out. We send our soldiers to war. We \ntell them we are there to take care of their families if something \nhappens. Now, because of a small group of tea party Republicans, we say \nwe can't even take care of their families when they die in the service \nof the country. For shame if that happens.\n  If all of these examples don't motivate them to do the right thing, \nmaybe I can speak their language for a moment and point to the fiscal \ncost of this Republican shutdown. The estimated cost per hour of the \nRepublican shutdown--that the government remains shut down--is $12.5 \nmillion. That is $300 million a day wasted or nearly $1.6 billion per \nweek. And what do the American people get for that? They get to watch \nfake budget conferences, staged photo ops, and the very Members \nshutting down the government and running to every single TV camera they \ncan find. Over the last 8 days we have spent more than $2 billion for \nthe government to not work, not function, and not serve the American \npeople.\n  Can you imagine the actual good that could have been done with that \n$2 billion that was just wasted? And that figure only covers the cost \nof work and services the government can't perform because 800,000 \nFederal workers are furloughed. It doesn't take into account the ripple \neffects throughout our overall economy.\n  Where are the deficit hawks who claim we don't have enough money to \nprovide SNAP benefits to hungry Americans in the farm bill? Where are \nthe Members who shamefully held up disaster relief after Tropical Storm \nIrene and Hurricane Sandy, while insisting that spending be offset? \nSurely, they would want to put a stop to the shutdown to end this \nwasteful government spending. Yet here we are, waiting for the \nRepublican leadership in the House of Representatives to pass the clean \ncontinuing resolution and put an end to this shutdown.\n  Instead of passing a clean Senate-passed continuing resolution \npending in the House--based on budget levels that, as the leader \npointed out, Republicans themselves wanted--the proposals being offered \nby House Republicans would actually expand the deficit.\n  First, the House proposed we repeal the Affordable Care Act because \nof claims it is harmful to our economy. But if we repeal it, we would \nactually accelerate the health care cost spiral and boost the Federal \ndeficit by $109 billion. They don't tell people they are voting to add \nanother $109 billion to our deficit. Then they suggest we repeal just a \nportion of the Affordable Care Act, but add $30 billion to the deficit \nfor which they don't want any offsets. Where were the Members in the \nHouse who attacked appropriations bills and insisted on cuts to funding \nfor law enforcement officers, disaster preparedness, and medical \nresearch? Where were the Members who insisted the devastating costs of \nsequestration must remain in place because we simply can't afford to \nspend and must reduce the deficit, no matter what it does to law \nenforcement or medical research or disaster preparedness?\n  They ditched their principles, and now they have forced a government \nshutdown which is costing more than if we had stayed open because of \nthe money wasted. It appears the only time the House is willing to \ncompromise is when it comes to adding to the deficit in order to \nprevent access to affordable health insurance for millions of \nAmericans.\n  We are here right now because the Republican leadership in the House \nrefuses to act. They could end the shutdown right now and make this the \nlast day we spend $300 million on nothing. Yet there is this faction \nwithin the majority of the House that has now brought the government of \nthe United States to a halt, wasting hundreds of millions of dollars \neach day, day after day, and they will not relent. They talk about the \nAffordable Care Act, which, if we have children in college, allows them \nto be on our insurance policy. They want to do away with that, but they \ndon't have any alternative. The Affordable Care Act allows a member of \nyour family with a preexisting health condition--heart, cancer, \nwhatever--to get insurance. They want to do away with that. They have \nno plan of their own.\n  I want to get back to work for Vermonters. I want help for the \nVermont company who can't start their new business because the \ncertificate is sitting on a desk at the Department of Treasury's \nAlcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau but nobody is there to sign \nit--I want pregnant Vermonters and new moms going without meals and \nwhose babies are going to go hungry because they are unable to get \nhealthy food and baby formula without the WIC benefits they are \nsupposed to have access to--I want to see them fed. I want to see our \nfarmers have the ability to continue to work as they do every single \nday and know the farm bill has been passed.\n  Let's stop the sloganeering here. Let's stop rushing to the TV \ncameras. Let's actually do what is best for America. Wouldn't that be a \nwonderful step in the right direction?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for\n\n[[Page S7278]]\n\nthe quorum call be rescinded and I be allowed to speak for up to 12 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, we are in the eighth day of a completely \nunnecessary partial government shutdown. Last week there was an \nofficial at the White House who said they were winning the shutdown \ndebate and they were not concerned about how long the shutdown lasts. \nWell, there may be Democrats and folks at the White House who are \ncontent with the current situation, but Republicans remain focused on \nfinding a solution to reopen the government.\n  The Republicans have offered multiple solutions to fund the \ngovernment and will continue to work to find common ground while \nproviding ObamaCare relief for middle-class Americans. Middle-class \nAmericans deserve the same relief from ObamaCare the Democrats have \nalready given themselves and big business. Senate Democrats even had \nthe opportunity to give the same 1-year relief from ObamaCare to their \nconstituents that President Obama has already given to big business.\n  We believe this is an issue of basic fairness. We believe this law \nshould be delayed--not just for big businesses and not just for the \nfavored constituencies but for all Americans because of the harmful \nimpact it is having.\n  In fact, there is bipartisan support for giving individuals and \nfamilies relief. A colleague of ours on the other side of the aisle--a \nSenate Democrat--recently said a delay for individuals would be very \nreasonable and sensible. There have been a number of votes in the House \nwhere Democrats have voted with Republicans in support of providing \nthat delay to middle-class Americans.\n  With regard to where we are right now, we have a near-term issue and \nwe have a slightly longer term issue. The near-term issue has an awful \nlot of folks increasingly concerned about the impact the government \nshutdown is having on people across this country. The House of \nRepresentatives has passed nine bills that have been sent to the Senate \nwhich are sitting here at the desk that would provide funding for some \nof these programs and services which impact people across this country \nthat could be picked up today and passed by unanimous consent. And, by \nthe way, many of those have passed with bipartisan support.\n  As recently as Saturday the House passed a bill that would provide \nback pay for Federal workers. There were 189 Democrats in the House of \nRepresentatives who voted in support of that bill. There have been up \nto 57 Democrats in the House of Representatives who have voted to give \npay to our National Guard and Reserve, the same thing we have done for \nour active-duty military. They have also voted to provide relief to our \nnational parks so they can open again. They have voted to provide \nfunding for the National Institutes of Health so that those lifesaving \nmedicines can continue to be provided. They have voted to provide \nfunding for FEMA so FEMA can respond to the natural disasters that are \noccurring across the country.\n  There are nine bills sitting at the desk of the Senate that could be \npicked up and passed today by unanimous consent. There wouldn't be a \nsingle Republican that I know of who would object to any of those \nmeasures being passed that would provide funding and relief in support \nof the services and programs which impact people across the country.\n  The House will pick up a couple of more bills today. They will do one \nthat funds Head Start and will then send it over here, so that will be \nthe tenth bill that will be sitting at the Senate. They will pass a \nbill that funds Impact Aid, something which is very important to the \npeople I represent in South Dakota. That will be the 11th bill that \nwill be sitting at the desk in the Senate awaiting action. As I said, \nthey could all be passed by unanimous consent. There would not be a \nsingle Republican that I know of who would be opposed to any of those \nbeing moved forward.\n  It is not a question of addressing the funding concerns and making \nsure the programs and services which impact people across this country \nare being funded; that can be done. It has been done by the House, and \nthose items have moved over here to the Senate. All that is necessary \nis for the majority leader to come over, pick them up, ask for \nunanimous consent to pass them, and those items would pass.\n  I see the near-term issue as being one that is very easy to solve, \nand all that it entails is for the leadership in the Senate to pick up \nthose bills and pass them.\n  The other issue I mentioned that is a little bit longer term, but not \nmuch, because it is about 9 days away, is we are going to hit the debt \nlimit, which means the United States of America will no longer have \nborrowing authority. We will hit up against the amount we are able to \nborrow on our credit card to fund the services of our government. There \nis a request obviously to increase the debt limit to allow the Federal \nGovernment to borrow more money. I have had private conversations with \nmembers of the administration's team. They said they would like to see \na debt limit increase that would take us through the next election--\nthrough November of 2014. To do that we would be looking somewhere in \nthe trillion-dollar range. It strikes me that--and I think it is \nsomething supported by the American people--if we are going to have a \ndebate about increasing the debt limit, we ought to do something about \nthe debt. I think that is a sensible position to take. By a 2-to-1 \nmargin, polls show the American people believe if we are going to raise \nthe debt limit, we ought to do something to fix and address the debt.\n  What we are simply saying is: Let's sit down and have a discussion \nabout things we can do that will put us on a different and sustainable \nfiscal trajectory for this country that won't saddle future generations \nof Americans with massive amounts--trillions and trillions of dollars--\nof additional debt. That issue is looming out there and it is not very \nfar away. We don't have a lot of time to deal with that. It is not, as \nI said, as immediate as the government shutdown, which can be addressed \nby the majority of the Senate. I think the debt limit is going to \nrequire both parties here in Congress and the President and his team to \nget together and figure out what it is we can do that would not only \nraise the debt limit--the amount we can borrow--but address the \nunderlying fundamental problem, and that is the fact that we have a $17 \ntrillion debt.\n\n  There has been a lot said about things that various Senators have \nsaid in the past on the floor and in the course of these various \ndebates we have had about debt limit increases, and I wanted to point \nout that the President of the United States, President Obama, when he \nwas here in 2006, said raising the debt limit is a failure of \nleadership. He said it is a failure of leadership and described it as \nunpatriotic. Unpatriotic--failure of leadership to raise the debt \nlimit.\n  Now he is saying he wants a clean debt limit increase--no \nnegotiation, period. No negotiation on the debt limit. Well, at the \ntime when he said that raising the debt limit was a leadership failure, \nthe total Federal debt was $8.3 trillion. Today it is $16.8 trillion, \n$16.9 trillion. So the Federal debt, literally, is double what it was \nwhen the current President said back in 2006, as a Member of this \nChamber in the Senate, that raising the debt limit would be a failure \nof leadership. Now it is twice that amount. It was $8.3 trillion in \n2006, and now we are going on $17 trillion.\n  It seems to me the President of the United States--who described \nraising the debt limit in 2006 when the debt was half of what it is \ntoday as a leadership failure--ought to be willing to exercise some \nleadership and engage himself in a process that would allow us to sit \ndown and talk about what we can do to get this debt under control.\n  There is a series of spending reforms that have been put forward by \nmany of my colleagues on this side of the aisle that would deal with \nthe out-of-control spending, particularly on what we call the mandatory \nspending part of the budget, those entitlement programs that currently \nare on an unsustainable path. We would like to try and get that \nspending under control. There are a number of other things that have \nbeen proposed that, frankly, would be good for the economy.\n  One of the best ways to get our fiscal house in order is to get the \neconomy growing and expanding at a faster rate. When the economy is \ngrowing and expanding, more people are working,\n\n[[Page S7279]]\n\nmore people are investing, more people are paying taxes, and government \nrevenues go up. When we have an economy growing at 3 to 4 percent \ninstead of an economy growing at 1 to 2 percent, which is what we have \ntoday, the result is a dramatic increase in the amount of tax revenue \nthat comes into the Federal Treasury.\n  When they are talking about raising the debt limit, we should look at \nwhat we can do in association with that discussion to actually reduce \nthe debt. One would be to put spending reforms in place, and the other \nwould be growing and expanding the economy.\n  One of the things that has been proposed that would grow the economy \nis tax reform. I happen to believe, and I think a lot of us do, that \nthe best thing we can do to get the economy growing at a faster rate is \nto reform our Tax Code in a way that makes us more competitive in the \nglobal marketplace. That would mean reducing the tax on business, which \nis the highest in the world. The United States has the highest \ncorporate tax rate in the entire world.\n  Lowering marginal income tax rates, broadening the tax base, doing \naway with many of the loopholes, deductions, exemptions, and \npreferences that are in the Tax Code today that benefit particular \nconstituencies and going to a broader based tax base, but one that has \nmarginal rates that are significantly lower than where they are today--\nI think that would dramatically unleash economic growth in this country \nand get people back to work so they can pay taxes and get government \nrevenues up.\n  In the context of raising the debt limit, we ought to do something \nabout the debt, and as I said, that is fairly straightforward.\n  One of the ideas that has been put forward here is that we need a \nclean debt limit increase; we can't have any discussion or negotiation \nabout this. If we look at history, it has been the case that many of \nthe big accomplishments, if you will, when it comes to deficit \nreduction, when it comes to fiscal plans being put into place, occurred \nin the context of increasing the debt limit. In fact, throughout our \nhistory, going back to 1978, the debt limit has been raised 53 times in \nthose 35 years. Of those 53 debt limit increases, 27, or more than \nhalf, were done around other policy considerations and policy \ndiscussions and legislation that was put forward to address issues--in \nmany cases to address the out-of-control spending and debt we have in \nthis country.\n  For 35 years now, with 53 debt limit increases, more than half have \ninvolved discussion of other matters. In fact, some of the biggest \naccomplishments we can point to in the history of the last 30 years \noccurred at a time when we had both sides trying to figure out a path \nforward for dealing with fiscal imbalances our country faced.\n  The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation passed in 1985, the Budget Acts \nin 1990 and 1993 and 1997, and more recently in 2011. All occurred in \nthe context of a debt limit increase. So there is ample precedent in \nhistory for doing big things that are good for the country and good for \nfuture generations around the debt limit increase. It defies history to \nsuggest we cannot come to the table and cannot negotiate in the context \nof a debt limit increase.\n  As I look at these issues that are converging on us now and what they \nmean for our children and our grandchildren and for future generations, \nit seems to me that taking a position of we will not negotiate, \nperiod--which is essentially what the President has said and what has \nbeen echoed here by the Senate majority--is not only wrong in terms of \nwhat we need to do to fix the debt and to get our country on a more \nsustainable fiscal path, but it is also completely at odds with what we \nknow to be the case throughout our history. We can do better by the \nAmerican people. We should do better by the American people. It \nrequires leadership.\n  The President of the United States, President Obama, as Senator Obama \nback in 2006, said at that time that raising the debt limit would be a \nleadership failure and described it as unpatriotic. Here we are these \nmany years later, with double--double--the amount of debt we had back \nwhen he made that statement.\n  This situation we are in today cries out for leadership. It cries out \nfor leadership from the President and from those of us in Congress. I \nhope we can find our way to get together, to sit down, to negotiate, to \ncome up with solutions that are good for the future of this country \nthat would deal not just with raising the borrowing limit so we can \nborrow more money to fund government, but to address the underlying \nproblem, and that is the fact that we have a $17 trillion debt that \ncontinues to grow at $600 billion, $700 billion a year.\n  We continue to have a chronically high unemployment rate. We continue \nto have a labor force, a workforce that is at historically low levels; \nin other words, the number of people who are working today as a \npercentage of those who could work is at the lowest level it has been \nin 35 years. We have a sluggish economy that is growing in the 1- to 2-\npercent range. Take-home pay for most Americans has gone down since the \nPresident took office by about $3,700.\n  We need to get middle-class Americans back to work, middle-class \nAmericans earning more, being able to provide for their families, \nincreasing family household income and take-home pay in this country, \nand the way to do that is to get the economy growing and expanding.\n  The other way to do that, I would argue, is to get spending here in \nWashington under control so we are not out there borrowing more and \nmore money all the time, so that more and more of our country's assets \nand resources can be deployed toward things that will yield a return, \nthat will put more people to work, that will grow the economy, and \nexpand the standard of living and the quality of life for people across \nthis country. Time is short. The clock is running. Time is a-wasting. \nWe need to get this done.\n  In the near term we need to bring up the nine bills sitting here in \nthe Senate that were passed by the House. That would put funding for a \nlot of these services and programs that impact people--which has been \nexpressed so many times by my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle--back in place.\n  Secondly, let's get together--the President, Democrats, and \nRepublicans here in Washington, DC--to talk about not only raising the \ndebt limit but what we are going to do to address the underlying debt.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. HAGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I rise to address the negative impact this \ngovernment shutdown is having on my home State of North Carolina. It is \na shame that some in Congress are playing political games with the most \nbasic function of keeping our government open. I did not get elected to \nshut down the government. With each minute that goes by, more and more \nNorth Carolinians are feeling the impact of this irresponsible \nshutdown.\n  North Carolina is proud to be home to almost 1 million veterans. But \nas of this spring, we are also home to one of the worst VA disability \nclaims backlogs in the country. We have pushed to have senior VA \npersonnel dispatched to North Carolina. More caseworkers have been \nadded. After a lot of attention and work, we were finally beginning to \nsee the needle move in the right direction.\n  Claims were being processed faster, which means veterans were getting \nthe benefits they deserved faster. But as of today, the Winston-Salem \nregional office is closed to the public. With claim processors \nfurloughed and just a skeleton staff operation inside, this government \nshutdown threatens to reverse the progress we have made in addressing \nthat backlog. So I ask, is it worth shutting down the government over a \npolitical game when veterans get caught in this crossfire? No.\n  In my home State we are also proud of the 11 national parks that are \nnot simply just beautiful places in our country and in our State but \nalso important drivers of our tourism economy.\n\n[[Page S7280]]\n\n  As families flock to enjoy these affordable destinations, they stop \nat our local small businesses, they eat at our restaurants, and they \nstay in our hotels. In 2011, out-of-State tourists to national parks in \nNorth Carolina spent $720 million during these trips, which supported \nnearly 12,000 jobs.\n  I do not know how many of my colleagues have been fortunate enough to \nvisit western North Carolina at this time of the year. But right now \nthe fall leaves are turning and western North Carolina is opening its \narms to welcome tourists from around the country and from around the \nworld who come to see this beautiful landscape.\n  On the other side of the State, in the east, we have Cape Hatteras \nNational Seashore and Cape Lookout. They are both closed. October is \nthe most popular surf-fishing month of the year. But with beach access \nclosed our fishermen cannot get to the fishing areas.\n  With parks from out west all the way to down east closed, we fear too \nmany families will decide to cancel their vacations. So I ask, is it \nworth shutting down the government over political games when our small \nbusiness owners who support our economy will be the ones to shoulder \nthis burden? No.\n  In my home State we are proud that our university system includes a \nnumber of distinguished research institutions that are on the cutting \nedge of new technologies and therapies that will make our world better. \nNIH supports roughly 20,000 jobs in North Carolina. But the NIH will \nnot take any action on grant applications or awards or admit new \npatients to clinical trials while our government is shut down.\n  So I ask, is it worth putting medical advances and thousands of jobs \nat risk just to play a tired political game? No. I could go on and on. \nWhile new vaccines are still being delivered, the CDC is not able to \ntrack flu cases as usual. They cannot support State and local partners \nwho help monitor infectious diseases.\n  The FDA is not able to support the majority of its food safety \nactivities. Pell grants and direct student loans could be delayed for \n14 million American students. School districts, colleges, and job \ntraining centers could face major cashflow problems without money for \nFederal programs and grants coming in the door.\n  Our research universities, in addition to doing this cutting-edge \nresearch that benefits our entire country, are huge employers. Some of \nthem receive tens of millions of dollars a month in reimbursement for \nwork already performed for the Federal Government. Without those funds \ncoming in the door, these universities can be put in an incredibly \ndifficult position with respect to managing their expenses--not to \nmention the time lost in Congress when we should be talking about how \nto continue repairing our economy; we should be talking about how to \nimprove job training programs; we should be talking about growing \nmanufacturing in our country. But instead, we are just manufacturing \ncrisis after crisis after another. There is no reason we cannot end \nthis shutdown.\n  Fortunately, there is a simple solution. The Senate has passed a \nresponsible bill that keeps the government running at currently reduced \nspending levels. The House of Representatives could pass that bill \ntoday. This shutdown could end within a matter of hours. Then we could \nhave the time and space to come together on a long-term, balanced, and \nbipartisan plan to finally put our fiscal house in order. Instead, the \nother side of the Capitol insists on sending us bills that they know \nhave zero chance of passing or becoming law over here just to stage a \npolitical stunt.\n  But political stunts will not process VA claims. Political stunts \nwill not help restaurant owners in western North Carolina make payroll \nwhile the national parks are closed. Political stunts will not get this \ngovernment reopened for business. I urge my colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives to stop playing this partisan game, take up the Senate-\npassed bill, end this government shutdown.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/08/senate-section/article/S7280-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Madam President, I rise today with just 9 days left \nuntil the United States hits the debt ceiling. Never before in our \nhistory have we failed to pay our bills, but in 9 days that possibility \nwill reach our doorstep.\n  Even though defaulting on our debt could send our economy into a \ntailspin, even possibly another Great Depression, there are already \nthose who are denying the impacts of default. The debt ceiling deniers \ntry to claim that this won't be a big deal and that middle-class \nfamilies won't be hurt. Well, these debt-ceiling deniers need a dose of \ndebt-ceiling reality.\n  The truth is that failing to pay our bills on time would most \nprobably be worse than in 2008 when Lehman Brothers and AIG went under \nand the economy went into a tailspin. We still haven't recovered from \nthat debacle. To this day there are people out of work. There are \nmiddle-class families whose income is lower than it was then because of \nwhat happened in 2008.\n  Why could it be worse--in all likelihood would be worse? Because just \nas housing securities had to be marked down because of the Lehman \ncrisis, if government bonds, which are much more widely held, have to \nbe marked down in lower value, we could have a freeze where banks are \nnot able to lend money.\n  What happened in 2008 was simple. Banks and other financial \ninstitutions had all these mortgage securities on their balance sheets. \nAll of a sudden their value seemed to be a lot less, so the banks' \nbalance sheets were in the red. That meant they couldn't lend money, \nand not just for long-term mortgages and car loans but also for \novernight lines of credit. Businesses were shaken. Many businesses \ncouldn't function. Wire transfers weren't allowed to be made, and the \nwhole financial system came to a startling and devastating halt.\n  Now the effects would be worse, in all likelihood, and for this \nreason: Mortgage securities were widely held but not close to as widely \nheld as U.S. Treasurys are. Imagine on the day of default or, God \nforbid, even a day or two before default, all of a sudden the markets \ndetermine--and they are mystical in some ways--that Treasurys should be \nwritten down significantly. There is a very real possibility that \ncould--and not 5 percent but significantly higher than that; I would \nestimate a 30-, 40-, 50-percent chance--send us into a tailspin that \nmight make the 2008 recession look like child's play.\n  How would that affect the average family? Well, if the United States \ndefaults, middle-class family paychecks would be raided by higher \ninterest rates on everyday expenses. Already interest rates on short-\nterm Treasury bonds are creeping upward as the possibility of default \nlooms over us. If we default, investors who always considered U.S. debt \nrisk free will demand higher interest rates due to the heightened risk \nthat they might not be paid. For the first time ever investors question \nwhether the U.S. Government would honor its commitments.\n  The domino effect on interest rates that affect family budgets would \nbe endless and cataclysmic. Credit card interest rates would go up, \nadding hundreds of dollars to monthly bills. Young families seeking to \ntake out a mortgage on a new home would be faced with thousands of \ndollars in higher payments over the life of the mortgage. Many might \nnot even buy that home, putting a crimp in one of the bright spots of \nour economy--the housing market. Someone wanting to take out a loan to \nbuy a new car should prepare to pay hundreds or thousands of\n\n[[Page S7281]]\n\ndollars more in higher interest rates. That means car sales would \ndecline and automobile manufacturers could lay off people. Do you have \nprivately held student loans? Prepare for monthly payments to shoot \nupward. Innocent families, millions of them--tens of millions--would be \nhit with thousands of dollars in additional bills through no fault of \ntheir own if U.S. Treasurys were devalued.\n  The damage doesn't stop there. If we default on our debt, the dollar \nloses value, and a trip to the gas station or the grocery store gets \nmore expensive. The dollar won't go as far. Americans will have to \nshell out more for gas and for milk to feed their kids.\n  Think of the effect of a default on 10,000 baby boomers who are \nretiring each day. In 2011 the stock market lost 2,000 points. How much \nmore might it lose now? We gained that back by the beginning of 2012, \nbut that is no comfort to the thousands of people retiring every day. \nAnd when you are dealing with U.S. Treasurys--and these are not \ncertainties, but these are possibilities--it could be a lot worse. You \ncan check your 401(k) and see that political brinkmanship took a huge \nbite out of your retirement savings. Imagine the pain of saving wisely, \nmaking smart choices, only to have your retirement account and family \nbudget wrecked by dangerous brinkmanship from tea party Republicans in \nWashington. If there were ever a governmental action that merited the \nwords ``playing with fire,'' this is it.\n  The devastation doesn't end there. If we don't raise the debt \nceiling, the Federal Government will be faced with impossible choices. \nDo we pay foreign debts--because if we don't, those countries won't \nlend to us anymore--or do we pay veterans' benefits? Do we make sure \nSocial Security benefits go out or Medicare? Do we pay our troops? Do \nwe fund border security? What do we pay for education? These are all \ntough choices.\n  Make no mistake about it. If the debt ceiling is not lifted, we can't \nmeet all our obligations.\n  So the chances of this are not 80 percent, but they are close enough \nto 50 percent that anyone who risks this, particularly for this forlorn \ngoal: we won't raise the debt ceiling unless we repeal ObamaCare--which \nwe know isn't happening--it is madness. Risk the economy of the United \nStates, the possibility of going through worse than what we went \nthrough in 2008 because you demand ObamaCare be repealed when we know \nit won't happen? Wow. I have rarely seen such madness coming out of \nlegislators, but it is coming out of a few.\n  So the consequences of failing to raise the debt ceiling are crystal \nclear: interest rates on the middle-class expenses such as home \nmortgages, car loans, and student loans will shoot up. Housing markets, \nautomobile markets, and others decline as many are laid off, and then \nothers are laid off in a cyclical cycle. The dollar will lose its \nvalue, making everyday purchases more expensive, and the Federal \nGovernment faces terrible choices about who we pay--seniors, veterans, \nmilitary, creditors. To risk these consequences would be a terrible \nmistake.\n  In conclusion, I come here with a simple plea--not to our tea party \nactivist colleagues but to mainstream conservative Republican friends. \nPlease help us avoid the default crash. Please help us avoid an \neconomic apocalypse. We are ready to talk. We are ready to negotiate on \nanything. But first open the government and pay our bills. Then we can \nsit down and debate our differences. The future of our financial \nsystem, the future of millions of Americans, is at stake. We don't play \naround with that. We don't hold that hostage.\n  To my mainstream conservative Republican colleagues, please do the \nright thing. Let us pay our bills and take the threat of severe \neconomic collapse off the table now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/08/senate-section/article/S7281-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7281-S7282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to speak as the chair of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, who would like to reopen government \nand have our committee get back to regular order to be able to move our \nappropriations bills, to be able to debate them on the floor, amend \nthem on the floor, and go to conference to resolve either fiscal or \nother issues we might have with the House. But we can't do it because \nwe are in lockdown politics.\n  There is much about where we find ourselves that is very frustrating \nto me. One of the main ones is the fact that the tea party Republicans \nare out there saying things that simply are not accurate. Tea party \nRepublicans say President Obama won't negotiate. That is not true. Tea \nparty Republicans are saying Democrats in the Senate won't negotiate. \nThat is not true. Tea party Republicans say the Senate has not moved \nappropriations bills. That is not true. The Appropriation Committee \nhas. Tea party Republicans say the House doesn't have the votes to \nreopen the government. That is not true. And tea party Republicans say \nthe debt limit is not a big deal. That is not true. So let me elaborate \non these point by point.\n  Tea party Republicans say President Obama won't negotiate. The \nPresident has negotiated time and time again. He had a framework for a \ngrand bargain in his 2014 budget. Read it. Let the print speak for \nitself. He had $1.8 trillion of deficit reduction over 10 years, \nincluding $400 billion in health care savings, $200 billion in savings \nfrom mandatory programs, $200 billion in further discretionary cuts in \nstrategic funding and discretionary spending. And, yes, he would even \nchange the cost-of-living calculation for Social Security. But the \nRepublicans couldn't take yes for an answer. Here was Obama, here was \nhis budget, here is what he was offering--to reduce debt, to take on \nmandatory spending, to take on discretionary spending. They couldn't \ntake yes for an answer. It included items in there I didn't agree with, \nbut they were to be negotiated, to be discussed. Since he became \nPresident, the deficit has gone down by 50 percent, from $1.4 trillion \nin 2009 to an estimated $700 billion in 2013. High? Yes. But cut in \nhalf.\n  Now let's go to this President who they say won't negotiate. He \nnegotiated in December of 2012 on a fiscal cliff deal. He wanted a 2-\nyear delay in sequester, but we got 2 months. He wanted tax cuts for \nthe wealthy to be eliminated above $250,000. He agreed to an estate tax \nexemption. He wanted a $3.5 million exemption, the Republicans wanted \n$5 million. He said OK. The 2-percent Social Security payroll tax was \nending without offsetting stimulus provisions. He gave and we supported \nhim. Now they say he won't negotiate.\n  Speaker Boehner says, we just want to have a conversation. That is \nwhat the President did. What were those summits at Andrews Air Force \nBase? I thought that was going to be kumbaya. The President has had \nprivate one-on-one meetings, and nothing has come from that. Then he \ndid a larger charm offensive--he had dinner with Republicans both at \nthe White House and at different restaurants around town. Nobody seems \nto be able to take yes for an answer. This is the President who has \ninvited people to the White House, invited leadership to play golf with \nhim to build relationships, he has had dinner there. But instead of \nhaving lunch with the President, they want to have his lunch--over and \nover again.\n  The President has expressed a willingness continually to negotiate. \nAnd where are we now? We need to reopen the government. The House needs \nto pass the Senate clean short-term CR and raise the debt limit. Once \nit is open for business, we can talk about other matters.\n\n  Now let's go to tea party Republicans saying Democrats won't \nnegotiate. Senate Democrats have tried to negotiate on the budget since \nwe passed it on March 23. We were here for a marathon session led by \nSenator Murray--vote after vote, amendment after amendment--and we \npassed a budget resolution.\n  The rules of engagement and the rules for dispute resolution in the \nCongress are, take what one body passes, like the Senate, and meet with \nthe House in a conference. Senator Murray was ready to go. She asked \npermission--which she has to do under the rules of the Senate--to have \nher budget conference to hammer out the budget with Paul Ryan and other \nHouse Members.\n  Nineteen times since March 23 Senator Murray has stood on this floor \nand asked for the ability to negotiate\n\n[[Page S7282]]\n\nwith the House. Nineteen times she was blocked by six tea party \nRepublicans. Nineteen times, using the rules to protect the voice of \nthe minority--which I understand they used not only their voice but \nwhat was used to protect them to prohibit the Senate from meeting with \ntheir House counterparts.\n  So Senate Democrats want to negotiate. There is Paul Ryan. There is \nPatty Murray. Let's have the budget conference and hammer it out. The \nDemocrats have been ready to negotiate on a budget since March 23, \n2013.\n  Let's have a conversation? We have been trying to have that \nconversation since March. Who has stopped us? Harry Reid didn't stop \nPatty Murray. Chuck Schumer didn't stop the Budget Committee. Barbara \nMikulski is not stopping it. Six tea party Republicans have stopped the \nability of the Senate from going to the House to negotiate a budget.\n  Free the Budget Committee. Why is that so important? Because they not \nonly come up with an overall budget in discretionary spending, \nmandatory spending, and revenues, but they put a cap on us \nappropriators. One of the outcomes of a budget agreement is they set \nthe total amount of money the Appropriations Committee can spend on \ndiscretionary spending. To the shock of everybody, there is actually a \ncap on discretionary spending established by the Budget Committee. That \nhas been the rule of the Budget Act going back to the 1970s. I would \naccept a cap agreed upon in a duly constituted process established by \nthe rules of the House and the Senate--which is, we pass a budget, we \nmeet in conference, we come back and give the appropriators what they \ncall the 302(a)--the total cap we can spend--we take a look at it, and \nwe meet and we follow the law. It also says what revenue should be and \nthen total mandatory spending.\n  So when we hear Democrats won't negotiate--the Democrats have \nnegotiated.\n  Going to this situation where we know the fiscal year expires October \n1, the Senate put forth a bill. It came out of the Appropriations \nCommittee. It was really, as the Chair, at my suggestion we would have \na short-term funding resolution so we could deal with issues such as \ndebt limit, canceling sequester for 2 years, and what our funding as a \ncap should be for 2014--short term, no new money, but a goal of getting \nus to canceling the sequester, following what the Budget Committee \nwould set as the cap on us.\n  In order to get there, I was willing to compromise. I didn't want to. \nI felt it was too harsh, too rough on important discretionary spending. \nBut sometimes you have to negotiate and compromise. So I was willing to \ncompromise in order to get to negotiations. What was the compromise? \nThe House has a level of $986 billion. It follows fiscal 2013 at the \nsequester level, meaning reduced by over $100 billion. I thought that \n$986 billion was too low. The Senate bill was $1.058 trillion. That is \nover a $70 billion difference.\n  But that is what a conference is. That is what negotiation is. So in \norder to get us across the dome into negotiations, I was willing to \ncompromise, particularly on very important domestic spending.\n  The liberals who want to fund Head Start, who want to fund NIH--well, \nmaybe we are not liberals. Maybe we are just Americans and, I believe, \nfriends on the other side of the aisle--we were ready to go. So in my \nmind, as an appropriator, I have already compromised just to get us \ninto the room. But they won't even take up that bill. They won't take \nup the bill that Speaker Boehner said he would pass if we agreed to \ntheir number--$986 billion--to get us into the room to talk. If you \ntell the Senate: If you agree with us on this, just to get a short-term \nnegotiation going, we will pass it, and then you don't, why should we \nbelieve it will be any different?\n  But as the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I am ready to \nnegotiate. I am ready to compromise. I have reached out to my House \ncounterpart, the chair of Appropriations. We have a marvelous, civil, \ncandid relationship. We are ready to go to work.\n\n  We differ on money. There is no doubt. The chairman of the House \nAppropriations Committee, Congressman Hal Rogers, is a wonderful \ngentleman, but I will tell you he is a rock-ribbed, no-nonsense fiscal \nconservative. But that is OK by Senator Barb because that is what \ncompromise is. That is doing what Colin Powell asked us to do: Let's \ntalk things over. Let's find some sensible center. Let's make sure we \nrun the U.S. Government in a smart, frugal, effective way. That is what \nit would take.\n  We are ready to do it, but we need--I need Speaker Boehner to pass \nthe short-term CR so we can even get into the room to do this. So when \nyou say Senate Democrats will not negotiate or will not compromise, it \nis not true.\n  Also, I heard the junior Senator from Kentucky say that the Senate \nhas not approved appropriations bills. The Appropriations Committee, \ndespite being hamstrung by not having a budget, reported 11 \nappropriations bills. Eight of them were supported by Republicans. By \nAugust 1, our Appropriations Committee had marked up every single bill \nexcept one, Interior. We had marked them up with bipartisan support. \nEight of them had bipartisan support; three did not: Labor-HHS, \nFinancial Services, and Legislative Branch.\n  Why did we not get that? Because the Labor-HHS bill and Financial \nServices play a role in funding ObamaCare. There we go again. Don't do \nanything that would fund ObamaCare. There we go again.\n  I am so fed up with those riders, those poison-pen riders. We could \nhave done that to them. We chose not to. I would like to see the \ncomprehensive immigration bill passed. I didn't put any riders on the \nappropriations bills coming out of the Senate. I would have liked to \nhave seen a farm bill. That has been worked on so hard by Senator \nStabenow, the Senator from Michigan, and Senator Roberts, the Senator \nfrom Kansas--they worked wonderfully on a bipartisan farm bill. It was \nsomething to be proud of in the Senate. I would have liked to have \nattached that to the continuing. But we decided no riders, nothing \ncute, nothing clever, no earmarks, nothing like that--straightforward \nmoney bills ready to go to conference.\n  We could not get it, but they are passed. They are passed in the \nAppropriations Committee and we are waiting to get to work.\n  The Republicans, the tea party Republicans say they do not have the \nvotes in the House to reopen government. Give it a chance. Put the vote \nto the floor. If we win, government is reopened. If we lose, at least \nwe offered a suggestion and we can go back to the drawing board. But \nthe solution to reopening the government lies on Speaker Boehner's \ndesk. He says he wants to have a conversation. We say pick it up, have \nthe vote. That puts the conversation to work for a short-term funding \nresolution.\n  We say to our six Republican Senators who have blocked the Budget \nCommittee, let the Budget Committee go to conference. Let Senator Patty \nMurray and Congressman Paul Ryan meet to resolve these issues. Let's \nfollow the regular order. Let's get back to the way this government and \nthis country should function.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. As soon as I finish my remarks, we will enter into an \nagreement on how the speakers will go forward.\n  The shutdown of the Federal Government is now affecting some families \nmore than others. It is affecting families who are the most vulnerable, \ndenying them the benefits to help with the funeral expenses of loved \nones killed while serving our country.\n  This part of my presentation is not something I got from my staff; \nthis is in the press right now:\n  The families of five U.S. servicemembers who were killed over the \nweekend in Afghanistan have been notified that they won't be receiving \ntheir benefit, normally wired to relatives within 36 hours of the \ndeath. The death gratuity is extended to help cover funeral costs and \nhelp with immediate living expenses until survivor benefits typically \nbegin. The money also helps cover costs to fly families to Dover Air \nForce Base to witness a return of their loved ones in a flag-draped \ncoffin.\n  ``Washington may be shut down, but it's still asking people to go to \nwar,'' says the head of the Council on Foreign Relations, Gayle Lemmon. \n``When people realize that they can serve and fight for their country, \nbut that their families will get an I.O.U. until the shutdown is over, \nI think they're just shocked.''\n  I know I am.\n  For example, LCpl Jeremiah Collins, 19 years old, was a marine who \ndied Saturday while supporting combat operations in Afghanistan. He was \none of the five killed, including four troop members who died Sunday by \nan improvised explosive device.\n\n       A law passed last week to continue paying civilian members \n     of the military during the shutdown, but does not allow for \n     payouts of the death benefit to the families of the fallen, \n     officials told Andrea Mitchell of NBC.\n\n  One senior official said he was disgusted by the predicament.\n  That is where we are.\n  I have asked each Senator to come to the floor today because it is \nimportant that we have an opportunity to talk about the crisis facing \nthis great Nation. This government shutdown is an embarrassment to our \nNation--not only to the people of America but around the world. An \neconomic conference in the Far East that President Obama was to \nattend--he couldn't because of the government shutdown. So who is there \npontificating about how bad things are in America? The President of \nChina. And that is what he is talking about--America can't pay its \nbills.\n  The families who lost five loved ones--it is an unbearable loss, but \nnow they are being denied death benefits because of this senseless \nshutdown. It is shameful and embarrassing. There are no words to \ndescribe this situation that at least I am capable of expressing, that \nAmerica could fail the families of our fallen heroes. Appalling, \nfrightening--everyone can come up with their own description.\n  It is time for us, Members of this august body, to stand before the \nAmerican people and publicly discuss the path forward. Democrats stand \nunified, asking the Speaker to reopen the government--the whole \ngovernment, not bits and pieces of the government. It is bad enough \nwith all of the sequestration that has cut, for example, the National \nInstitutes of Health this year by $1.6 billion, and add to that the \ngovernment shutdown, add to that the second year of sequestration, \nwhich will be another $2 billion for the National Institutes of Health. \nThis premier search we have in America for cures for disease, there has \nnever been anything like it in the world; the Library of Congress, \nthere has never been anyplace like it in the world. The great library \nin Egypt didn't compare to the Library of Congress. But there has been \nnothing ever in the history of the world like the National Institutes \nof Health. We are mindlessly going forward and cutting these scientists \nby billions of dollars.\n  We need to reopen the whole government--not in some piecemeal fashion \nthat further demonstrates to the world that we are unable to find real \nsolutions. Open the whole government so we can get back to work. Allow \nthe government to do its duty by our military families and by every \nAmerican family.\n  Quickly--I have said it before--in July of this year the Speaker of \nthe House of Representatives and I sat down in his office. I was there, \nmy chief of staff was there, and his chief of staff was there--the four \nof us. The Speaker wanted to figure out a way to go forward. We talked \nabout a number of things. The one thing he was firm in, he said, it has \nto be at 2013 levels. I said: I can't do that; it is $70 billion less \nthan the budget we passed just a short time ago. So the conversation \ncontinued. In September we talked and talked.\n  I spoke to Chairman Murray and to Chairman Mikulski. It was really \nhard. They had worked so hard to get regular order back in the Senate. \nBut, like the good soldiers they are, we decided to try to talk to the \nrest of the caucus and swallow really hard because we had the \nassurance--I had the assurance that we would have a clean CR now, in \nSeptember. That didn't work. The Speaker didn't deliver on what he said \nhe would deliver.\n  So the government closes and we have one thing after another coming \nover here and we send it right back.\n\n[[Page S7284]]\n\nThe last thing they sent over a week ago was to say let's go to \nconference. So last Tuesday I sent him a letter, and in the first \nletter I talked about a very decisive time in my life when I voted for \nthe Iraq war. Within weeks of that I felt I had been misled. But \nregardless of that, that is how I felt. So I became an opponent of that \nwar, and I did everything I could to focus on that war, which was \nhaving our military subjected to violence, and that is an \nunderstatement. Thousands were being killed, tens of thousands wounded. \nThe number of Iraqis who were being killed is really hard to \ndemonstrate adequately.\n  There was a time that came in my life when we had an opportunity, \nunder my direction, to shut the government down. How? By not funding \nthe war. I made a decision--and that is in my letter to the Speaker--\nnot to do that.\n  (Ms. BALDWIN assumed the Chair.)\n  I, frankly, received a lot of help from around the country. But that \nis what I did. And I do not look back at all. So I was trying to tell \nthe Speaker: Do not do this. However, I said: You have done it, and you \nhave asked for a conference. We will go to conference on anything you \nwant to go to conference on. We don't care. But first you have to open \nthe government and allow us to pay our bills. That is in the letter of \nlast Tuesday.\n  Forty-five minutes after he got the letter, I called him. He said: \nNo, I can't do that. So for someone to suggest we have not negotiated \nis just absolutely wrong.\n  Madam President, $70 billion--it is the biggest compromise I have \never made in my career as a Member of Congress--some 31 years. It may \nnot sound like much to some people, but it was really big. My caucus \nremembers what I asked them to do. So for someone to suggest to any of \nmy Senators that we have not negotiated is simply unfair, and to say \nthat we will not negotiate is unfair. I put it in writing. We are happy \nto go to conference. But you have to open the government. This is \nunfair--just like these five soldiers killed. So open the government, \nlet us pay our bills, and we will negotiate on anything you want to \nnegotiate.\n  I have spoken to the President. I am certainly not name-dropping. I \nhave told my caucus this several times over the last 2 days. He cannot, \nas President of the United States, negotiate on paying the bills of the \ncountry, the debt ceiling. I think there are Senators over here who he \nhas sat down with and talked to individually and as groups to talk \nabout a budget deal. There were many conversations in the Oval Office \nthat I attended to talk about a budget deal. He has put in writing \nthings that he would be willing to do that, quite frankly, our base is \nnot excited about. But he put it in writing. He is still waiting for \nthe first sentence from the people he invited to dinner and met with--\nthe first sentence--as to what they were willing to do.\n  As said late last week by Haley Barbour and Ed Gillespie, former \nchairs of the national Republican Party, Republicans--now, they said \nthis, not me--there is a time now when Republicans have to start being \nfor something, not against everything.\n  So I do not come here to argue and badger people. I am happy to talk \nabout anything. Senator Murray will deliver a presentation in just a \nlittle bit. We know how hard she has worked. She has the respect of \nboth Democrats and Republicans. But I repeat, when the Speaker said he \nwanted to go to conference last week, we said: Good. We will do that. I \nam not a one-man show over here. I clear everything with my caucus, \nwith rare exception, before I go marching off into the blue.\n  So I repeat, we are ready to go to conference as soon as the Speaker \nreopens the government and removes the threat of default. He has to \ntake yes for an answer. You folks have to take yes for an answer. We \nare just as willing to sit down and talk today as we were in the spring \nand as we were this summer. In the meantime, let's open the government \nand live up to our obligations as a country.\n  To that end, I will introduce a bill to allow the United States to \npay it bills with no preconditions or strings attached. I will do that \nlater today and start the so-called rule XIV process.\n  We may have our differences, Democrats and Republicans, but we should \nnot hold the full faith and credit of this great country hostage while \nwe resolve it. At a later time Senator Baucus will talk, and I hope he \nrepeats here on this Senate floor what he told us in our caucus that we \njust completed: Great nations are not guaranteed greatness. There have \nbeen books written about it, and he will talk about one author, a \nfamous author, who recently wrote a book about how great nations have \nto meet expectations. We are great today. That does not mean we will be \nforever. How is this country going to look to the world community if we \nno longer have the full faith and credit of the United States meaning \nanything?\n  I hope we can get Republican cooperation to move this bill quickly; \nthat is, the debt ceiling bill. If not, the process could take us right \nup to the deadline--one day before.\n  I am optimistic, however, that my Republican colleagues here in the \nSenate will not filibuster this bill. I am cynical by nature. That way \nI am not disappointed as much as those who are optimistic. My friend, \nSenator Schumer, and I have ongoing issues. He is optimistic about \neverything. I am cynical about everything. But I am optimistic, even \nthough that is against my nature, that Republicans are not going to \nhold the full faith and credit of the United States hostage. I hope I \nam right.\n  We need to reopen the Federal Government now--not 10 minutes before \nthe debt ceiling is gone. We need to get back to the business of \nprotecting American families, back to the job of legislating. We are \nnot doing anything in this body anymore. It is our job to legislate. \nThat has always been our job; it always will be our job. Open the \ngovernment, pay our bills, and let's negotiate.\n  It is my understanding that this consent request has been cleared. We \nwill hear from the Republican leader. Then we will hear at that time \nfrom Senator McCain for 15 minutes, followed by Senators Durbin, \nSchumer, and Murray. I ask unanimous consent that be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that Senator McConnell be \nrecognized, which we really do not need consent for him. He has time \nunder his leader time. Following his statement I ask unanimous consent \nthat Senator McCain be recognized for 15 minutes, then Senator Durbin \nfor 10, Senator Schumer for 10, Senator Murray for 10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I would ask the distinguished majority \nleader if he would consider modifying his consent request so that we \ncould alternate back and forth across the aisle. With that \nmodification, I have no objection.\n  Mr. REID. Well, after we get this out of the way, you mean?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, the majority leader asked for a number \nof Democratic Senators to speak without any intervening speeches or \nremarks by Republicans. All I am suggesting is, after he and the \nRepublican leader speak----\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I say to my friend from Texas----\n  Mr. CORNYN. And after Senator McCain speaks and a Democrat speaks, \nthat a Republican gets to speak and so forth. That is all I am asking.\n  Mr. REID. I say, Madam President, through the Chair to my friend: \nthree Democrats, two Republicans. It does not sound too outrageous to \nme. So would the Senator object to that?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. OK. So following Senator McConnell, I will call upon \nSenator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of my good \nfriend, the majority leader. I might say, however, that as much as I \nappreciate his comments to all of us, the real challenge is his \nrelationship with the House and whether or not we can begin the \ndiscussion process to get to an outcome.\n  Nobody is happy with the government shutdown, certainly not anybody \non this side, and not anybody on the other side. But I would remind \neverybody on both sides of the aisle that\n\n[[Page S7285]]\n\nDemocratic Senators have said repeatedly ObamaCare is the law of the \nland and, basically, we should get used to it.\n  We have suggested various modifications, some of which enjoy \nbipartisan support. But, obviously, so far that is not something our \nfriends on the other side are willing to do.\n  But let me also point out to all of you that the Budget Control Act \nis also the law of the land. It was negotiated on a bipartisan basis, \nsigned by the President of the United States, and the Budget Control \nAct is the law of the land.\n  When my good friend the majority leader says he was negotiating with \nthe House over the CR level, my view was that was not a negotiation, \nthat was current law, in place, passed on a bipartisan basis, signed by \nthe President of the United States--current law.\n  So I think I can pretty safely say that nobody on this side believes \nthat we ought to revisit a law that has reduced government spending for \n2 years in a row for the first time since the Korean War, at a time \nwhen we have a debt the size of our economy which makes it look a lot \nlike a Western European country.\n  So as we go into whatever discussions we end up having to solve the \nshutdown problem, I would say to my friends on the other side, \nrevisiting a law negotiated by the President, passed on a bipartisan \nbasis, that is actually reducing government spending ought not to be a \npart of the final outcome.\n  But talk we should. The American people have given us divided \ngovernment. And when you have divided government, it means you have to \ntalk to each other. This is not 2009 and 2010 when our friends on the \nother side had a total hammerlock on all the government. We now have \ndivided government. It means we have to talk to each other and get to \nan outcome.\n  I think it is far past time to get that done. I hope, given where we \nare today, there is adequate incentive to get those talks started, \nprincipally between the majority leader and the Speaker, to get us to \nthe outcome we all want, and to get us there soon.\n  But let me just conclude by saying the Budget Control Act is the law \nof the land. If you believe in reducing government spending, it is \nworking. My Members and the American people think reducing government \nspending is a good idea. So we have a law in place that is achieving \nthose kinds of results. That is not something at a time when we have a \ndebt the size of our economy that we ought to lightly walk away from.\n  So I hope my good friend, the majority leader, will, in addition to \ntalking to us, which we appreciate, talk to the Speaker because that is \nhow we resolve this crisis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, since the beginning of this great \nNation, 1,948 men and women have served in the U.S. Senate. That \nservice is a singular honor and carries with it an important \nresponsibility. James Madison said the ``use of the Senate is to \nconsist in its proceeding with more coolness, with more system, and \nwith more wisdom, than the popular branch.''\n  Throughout our history it was this Senate, many times in this very \nroom, that took on the most difficult challenges facing America: the \ncreation of the Federal judiciary, the abolition of slavery, decisions \nto go to war, and the advancement of civil rights.\n  At each of those moments, skeptics questioned whether there were \nSenators capable of resisting political pressure and whether there were \nSenators prepared to lead a divided nation.\n  My colleagues, this is our moment. This is our chance--our chance--to \nbring this Nation back from the precipice. We should agree to restore \nthe functions of government, not in a piecemeal fashion but in an \norderly process befitting a great nation. We should spare America's \nworkers and businesses the tragic consequences of a first-ever default \non our Nation's debt. And we should restore the time-honored process of \nlegislating--legislating--by adopting a bipartisan budget with the \nHouse, by considering spending bills on the floor of this Chamber, and \npassing appropriations bills in an orderly process.\n  We can vote today, this afternoon, to go to conference on the budget \nand begin to resolve our differences with the House. If we fail, we \nknow we will have diminished this great body and our great Nation--a \nnation which we have all taken a solemn oath to serve and protect.\n  So let's agree to restore the functions of government--all of it. I \nhave spoken with many of my colleagues and friends--and they are my \nfriends--on the Republican side of the aisle. We have shared our \nfrustrations at the current situation. To a person, each one of you has \nsaid to me: We have to bring this impasse to an end.\n  Waiting for the House of Representatives to save us is beneath the \nU.S. Senate.\n  We have our own responsibility and our own opportunity. We can come \nup with bipartisan Senate solutions. We can show the House of \nRepresentatives the path to end this crisis. Why are we waiting for \nthem to show us? Let's begin to restore the confidence of the American \npeople in this institution, in the Senate. We can fund the government, \nwe can go to conference on a budget, and we can extend our debt \nauthority.\n  I see my friend Senator McCain on the floor. I know he is going to \nspeak in just a moment. Over the last year I have seen moments in the \nSenate where we have defied our cynics and our critics: our successful \nbipartisan effort to pass a comprehensive immigration bill, a historic \nfarm bill with far-reaching reforms, and a bipartisan extension of the \nStudent Loan Program.\n  We came together and we found common ground. We led as the Senate. \nNow we need to summon the political courage and purpose to find a \nbipartisan way to meet this challenge. I know it will not be easy, but \nI know we are up to the job. I know we have an opportunity that comes \nonce perhaps in a political lifetime.\n  But I wish to say this: What we are dealing with in the Senate is not \njust another political dustup. This confrontation is of historic \nproportion. Let's not wait on the House to find a solution. It is our \nresponsibility as elected Members of the Senate to find that solution.\n  The solution I think is clear. Summon the political courage and the \nsense of purpose that comes down to us in the Senate, and throughout \nour Nation's history it always has.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the order now before the Senate is \nSenators be allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes each. I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator McCain be recognized for 15 minutes. Everyone else \nwill continue on the other order of 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to return to the normal one side \nand then the other side as far as speakers are concerned.\n  Mr. REID. That is fine. That is our plan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I say to my colleagues, I bring to your \nattention two events today that I think deserve our attention. The \nfirst one is a story entitled, ``Grand Canyon food shortage turns \ndire.'' The St. Mary's Food Bank is set to deliver food boxes to Grand \nCanyon National Park today as a Federal shutdown strands thousands of \nemployees inside the park without work and pay.\n  The Grand Canyon, thousands of people inside the park without food or \npay. This great Nation, we are having to have charities deliver food to \npeople who are trapped in the Grand Canyon.\n  Also today, ``Shutdown outrage: Military death benefits denied to \nfamilies of fallen troops.''\n\n       At least five families of U.S. military members killed . . \n     . in Afghanistan over the weekend were given a double-whammy \n     by federal officials. Not only have your loved ones died, but \n     due to the government shutdown, you won't receive a death \n     benefit.\n\n  The approval rating of Congress we joke about, about being 12 percent \nor 11 percent. I have a line I use all of the time: We are down to \nblood relatives and paid staffers. But should not we as a body, \nRepublicans, Democrats, no\n\n[[Page S7286]]\n\nmatter who we are, should we not be embarrassed about this? Should we \nnot be ashamed?\n  What do the American people think when they see that for those who \nserved and sacrificed in the most honorable way, their families are not \neven eligible for death benefits? I am ashamed. I am embarrassed. All \nof us should be. The list goes on and on of people, of innocent \nAmericans who have fallen victim to the reality that we cannot sit down \nand talk as grownups and address this issue.\n  I am not going to take the full 15 minutes because I frankly get a \nlittle bit emotional. But we started with a false premise on this side \nof the aisle that somehow we were going to repeal ObamaCare. That is \nafter 25 days of debate, including up until Christmas Eve morning \nfighting against ObamaCare, and that is after a 2012 election where I \ntraveled this country with passion, the first thing saying that the \nfirst thing we are going to do when Mitt Romney is President of the \nUnited States is repeal and replace ObamaCare. The American people \nspoke.\n  So somehow to think we were going to repeal ObamaCare, which would \nhave required 67 Republican votes, of course, was a false premise and I \nthink did the American people a grave disservice by convincing them \nthat somehow we could.\n  Now, 70 percent of the American people, according to a Washington \nPost poll this morning, disapprove of Republicans, but they disapprove \nof Democrats as well. They disapprove of the President of the United \nStates as well. Meanwhile, the Chinese, great role models of democracy, \nare now criticizing us because of a looming failure by the American \nGovernment to pay its debts, both domestic and abroad.\n  I say to my friend the majority leader, and he is my friend--we use \nthat word with great abandon around here, but he and I have known each \nother now for 30 years--let's find a way to allow the adversary--I ask \nmy good friend from Utah who is a history major, the words of Abraham \nLincoln, ``Charity toward all, malice toward none.''\n  Let's find a way out of this. Let's find a way that we can sit down. \nI do not care if it is appointing people. I do not care if it is the \ninformal conversations that we have been having back and forth. But \nthere should be a way out of both of these dead ends that we are in.\n  How is this going to end? We know how it is going to end. We know how \nit is going to end. Sooner or later the government will resume its \nfunctions. Sooner or later we will raise the debt limit.\n  The question is, How do we get there? If there is anybody who \ndisagrees that we are not going to reach that point, I would like to \nhear from them. So why don't we do this sooner rather than later? Why \ndoesn't the Senate lead? I have great respect for the other side of the \nCapitol, but I understand the contradictions that are there and the \ndifficulties the Speaker has. I am in great sympathy there.\n  So why don't we get together? Why don't we sit down and--look, this \nbody voted 70 to 29, I think it was, to repeal the medical device tax. \nDo my colleagues want to renounce that vote they took on the budget? \nWhy don't we use that as one of the areas where we could reach \nagreement? What about the issue out there the American people believe \nthat we are under a different health care system than they are and ours \nis a better deal than theirs?\n  There are a number of issues that we could sit down and negotiate \nwithin an hour if we will stop--stop attacking each other and impugning \npeople's integrity and honor. So all I can say is let's start this \nafternoon. I do not care who it is or how it is shaped, but let's sit \ndown and get out of this, so that these families whose loved ones just \ndied--just died--will receive the benefits at least that would give \nthem some comfort and solace in this terrible hour of tragedy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that those on the \nDemocratic side be in this order: Schumer, Murray, Baucus, Mikulski, \nWarner, Cardin, Klobuchar, Whitehouse, Stabenow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise because we are getting very close \nto a time of crisis, perhaps one of the greatest economic crises this \ncountry has known. I have many good friends on the other side of the \naisle. I do not doubt for a moment their motivation, their desire, and \ntheir love of country. It is every bit as strong as those of us on this \nside of the aisle.\n  So I make a heartfelt plea: We must come together and avoid a default \nof the United States. Many have said, I heard some even say on the \nother side, that default does not matter or it does not mean much. Let \nme explain the danger. There is a very real chance that if we default, \nthere will be a recession greater than what occurred in 2008 and all \ntoo real a possibility it could put us into a depression.\n  Let me explain why. What happened in 2008 was simple. Mortgage \nsecurities declined in value immediately--dramatically they declined in \nvalue after Lehman and AIG went down. Banks' balance sheets instantly \nflipped from black to red. Loans were frozen, not only long-term loans \nbut even overnight loans, lines of credit. The economy came to a \nscreeching halt. We had to offer huge rescues or bailouts to overcome \nthat. But even so, interest rates climbed.\n  If that happened with mortgage securities, the likelihood of it \nhappening with Treasurys is all the more frightening because Treasurys \nare more widely held, more internationally held, the currency of the \nland, of the world. If Treasurys were to dramatically drop in value the \nday we defaulted or, make no mistake about it, it could happen a day or \ntwo before, here is what would happen: The economy would decline \ndramatically. Things would freeze. Interest rates would go way up. The \ncost of a mortgage, the cost of a car loan, dramatically increasing, \nhurting every middle-class family. Home sales would decline. Auto sales \nwould decline. Hundreds of thousands, millions would be laid off.\n  Why risk that? We all have political goals. They differ. That is \nreasonable. There is a time and a place, as the Scriptures say, ``A \nseason for everything.'' There is a time and a place to debate these \nthings. It is not while our government is shut down and while our debt \nhangs in the balance, risking default. There is a simple and logical \nsolution which good men and good women on both sides of the aisle can \ncome to.\n  Let's open the government. Let's pay our bills. Then let's debate \nevery issue you wish to debate. Nothing should be off the table. We are \nhappy to go to a committee, a conference committee. The Senator from \nWashington has asked, I believe it is 18 times--will ask again in a few \nminutes. Of course we want a conference committee where we can discuss \nthings but not at the price of keeping the government closed, hurting \nmillions of families in every way, not at the price, even worse, of \ndefaulting on our debt.\n  I would say, with all due respect to my colleagues in the House, they \nhave it backward: First, go to conference and then decide whether to \nopen the government or default. No one--liberal, conservative, \nDemocrat, Republican--could say that is a rational strategy if you care \nabout the country and worry about the risk of doing these things.\n  I understand the frustration with ObamaCare. We would argue there was \nan election in 2012. We would argue that every Democratic incumbent had \nto debate that issue over and over, as did President Obama when \nGovernor Romney made it a major issue. The electorate decided they \ndidn't want to get rid of ObamaCare. But we understand how passionately \npeople feel, and we understand you will continue to try and do that. \nBut again, there is a time and a season, and now is not the time and it \nis not the season when the government is shut down or default hangs in \nthe balance.\n\n  I plead with my colleagues to allow us to come together. We want to \nnegotiate. We want to sit down and talk to you. We are eager to do it. \nBut first let's open the government, pay our bills, and then let's \nnegotiate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, my understanding is we were going to go\n\n[[Page S7287]]\n\nback and forth, and if the Senator from Texas wishes to go, I will \nyield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \nimpassioned remarks today, and all of us weep for those service men and \nwomen who have lost their lives in defense of this great Nation.\n  I would note this Senate can right now, today, move to correct the \nproblem the majority leader described. The House of Representatives has \npassed eight separate bills funding vital priorities of the government. \nAll eight of those bills now sit on the majority leader's desk. This \nSenate has not voted on those bills. To date, the majority leader has \nnot allowed the Senate to have even one vote on the bills that would \nfund vital government functions. One of those bills is a bill that \nfunds the VA--funds the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  It seems to me we are going to have political differences, and those \npolitical differences are not going away anytime soon, but we ought to \nbe able to say, regardless of what happens in the battle over the \nshutdown, that our veterans should be beyond politics. We should have \nbipartisan agreement on standing for our veterans.\n  Right now veterans disability payments are not funded. The House has \npassed legislation to fund that. That was bipartisan legislation, with \na number of Democrats in the House, and yet the majority leader has not \nallowed the Senate to vote on it. The only thing in the way of funding \nthe VA today is the Senate voting to do so--is the objection the \nmajority leader has raised to funding the VA.\n  Let me note that the bill the House passed funding the VA is a clean \nCR on the VA. It doesn't mention ObamaCare. It doesn't say a word about \nObamaCare. It simply says our veterans should be beyond partisan \npolitics, regardless of the shutdown.\n  Let me also note this body has already engaged in bipartisan \ncooperation. Earlier in the course of this debate, the House of \nRepresentatives passed a bill to fund the men and women of the \nmilitary--to pay their paychecks. For weeks there had been politicians \nsuggesting if there were a government shutdown the men and women of the \nmilitary would not be paid. The House passed a bill, a clean CR, that \nsaid we will fund the men and women in the military. I commend my \nfriends on the Democratic side of the aisle, and I commend the majority \nleader, because the 54 Democrats in this body made the right decision \nto act in a bipartisan way and cooperate with the Republicans in this \nbody and with the House of Representatives, and in 24 hours the bill \nfunding the men and women of our military became law, went to the \nPresident and was signed into law. That is the way we are supposed to \noperate.\n  So I would ask: If we could work together in a bipartisan manner to \nsay we are not going to hold the men and women of the military hostage, \nwhy can't we work together in a bipartisan manner to say we are not \ngoing to hold our veterans hostage; that regardless of what happens in \nthe shutdown, let's fund the VA now?\n  Likewise, the House of Representatives has passed a bill funding our \nparks and national memorials. We have seen day after day our World War \nII veterans coming to the World War II Memorial and facing barricades \nthe administration has put up. The administration has expended money to \nkeep them out. The House has passed a bill to fund our parks and our \nmemorials. Let me suggest if the Senate would only vote, we could open \nevery park and memorial in the country.\n  The House has passed a bill to fund FEMA. If the Senate would only \nvote, FEMA could be funded.\n  The House has passed a bill to fund the National Institutes of Health \nso we can provide vital cancer research. The majority leader spoke \nquite passionately just moments ago about the need to fund the National \nInstitutes of Health. I agree with the majority leader, and I would ask \nthe majority leader to withdraw the objection he has raised to funding \nthe NIH.\n  Let me note, some have disparaged the House's approach as a piecemeal \napproach. Yet that is the traditional means of appropriating and \nlegislating that for centuries this body has done. The VA is usually \nfunded--just the VA--not connected to anything else. Why would the \nSenate want to hold veterans hostage because of disagreements over \nObamaCare? I don't think we should. I think we should fund the VA right \nnow.\n  Why would the Senate want to hold our parks and memorials hostage?\n  Why would the Senate want to hold the National Institutes of Health \nhostage?\n  Why would the Senate want to hold Federal workers hostage?\n  On Saturday, the House of Representatives unanimously passed a bill \nto provide back pay for Federal workers who had been furloughed. Every \nHouse Democrat who voted voted in favor of that. Yet the majority \nleader has not allowed this body to vote. I am going to say right now I \nagree with those House Democrats, and I urge that Senate Democrats \nstand with House Democrats who voted unanimously in favor of back pay \nfor Federal workers.\n  We can work together with bipartisan compromise, but we can only do \nso if both sides come to the table. Right now the House of \nRepresentatives is working constructively to fund vital priorities and, \nunfortunately, President Obama, the majority leader, and Senate \nDemocrats are refusing to negotiate, refusing to compromise. That is \nnot a reasonable approach. It is not a path that will lead to resolving \nthis.\n  I hope we come together, resolve this, fund our vital priorities and, \nat the same time, respond to the millions of people who are hurting \nbecause of ObamaCare--who are losing their jobs, who are pushed into \npart-time work, who are facing skyrocketing insurance premiums and who \nare losing their health insurance.\n  We need to answer the call of our constituents. We need to answer the \ncall of Teamsters president James Hoffa who put in writing that \nObamaCare right now is destroying the health care of millions of \nworking men and women. ``Destroying'' is the word Mr. Hoffa used. I \nthink the Senate should respond to the concern Mr. Hoffa raised, and we \nshould stand with millions of working men and women and we should \nprotect their health care so the hundreds of millions of Americans who \nhave health care right now don't lose it.\n  People all across this country are getting letters in the mail \ntelling them they are losing their health care because of ObamaCare. We \nneed to listen to them. So let's fund our government, let's fund our \nvital priorities, and let's listen to the American people and stop the \nNo. 1 job killer in this country that is ObamaCare.\n  I urge this body to work together in a bipartisan manner to listen to \nthe American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I think there is one thing every one of \nus can agree on: There are innumerable problems across our country--\nfamilies who have been challenged, sad stories that should be taken \ncare of in every part of our country, in each of our States, with \nfamilies we know who are hurting because of this government shutdown. \nThere is one answer to that, and it is an easy one. It is for the House \nof Representatives to simply take up the bill that is in the House \ntoday and pass it. We know there are enough Members of Congress who can \npass that today and every problem we have heard about or haven't heard \nabout yet will be solved. Republicans simply need to end this \ngovernment shutdown so Americans stop hurting.\n  Our families also need to know they are not going to be threatened by \na catastrophic default. And when that happens, we will be waiting at \nthe table, as we are today, to negotiate a long-term deal in the budget \nconference that the other side has spent months blocking.\n  We have been trying to work with Republicans toward a fair, long-term \nbudget deal for years. Since 2011, Democrats from the Senate to the \nHouse to the administration have sat in rooms, we have negotiated, we \nhave talked, we have discussed, and we have offered compromise after \ncompromise. We have tried regular committees, we have tried \nsupercommittees. If there was a room where Democrats and Republicans \ncould sit and talk, we found it and we got to work. But no matter\n\n[[Page S7288]]\n\nwhat we did, no matter how much we offered, we were unable to come to a \nplace that we could agree was a fair and balanced approach that the \nAmerican people deserved.\n  So this year, our Republican friends on the other side of the aisle \nasked us to return to regular order. That was the most important thing \nthey said--for us to get to a place where we could find a budget deal \nthat could be agreeable and we could move forward. That is exactly what \nwe did. In the Senate we passed our budget more than 6 months ago. The \nHouse of Representatives did the same. Since that time we have asked 19 \ntimes to go to conference to work out our differences. Nineteen times \nwe have come to the floor to say let's have regular order, let's work \nout our differences in a conference committee.\n  We wanted to get in a room with the House Republicans to sit at a \ntable and do everything possible to bridge the divide between our two \nbudgets. We knew it would not be easy. There are significant \ndifferences between the House and Senate budget. But the American \npeople expected us to try and we were committed to doing that. \nImportantly, we wanted to make sure we had enough time to bridge that \ndivide and get to this difficult deal so we would not be here today \nwhere we have lurched into another manufactured crisis.\n  Republicans rejected our attempts to sit down and negotiate. Every \ntime we asked to go to a budget conference, we were shot down. \nDemocrats came to the floor again and again, along with, I would add, a \nnumber of responsible Republicans who agreed. Even though they did not \nsupport the budget that was passed here, they agreed we should go to \nconference with the House Republicans and work out our deals. But each \ntime we asked, a handful of Republicans objected and said: No \ndiscussions. They refused to allow us to go to a table. They had no \ninterest in any discussions or negotiations or talk, and they pushed us \nuntil they got exactly what those few Republicans here wanted, and that \nwas an avoidable--completely avoidable--government shutdown.\n  After spending 6 months rejecting talks, causing this crisis, now all \nof a sudden some of our Republican friends seem desperate to make it \nlook as though they are the ones interested in negotiating. They know \nit is clear to families across the country the only reason this crisis \ncontinues is the House Republicans' refusal to take up the bill and \npass it right now--a bill that will get our government open and running \nagain.\n  And, by the way, they are now trying to do everything they can to \ndistract their constituents from that simple fact. But the American \npeople are smarter than that. They know the world did not begin the day \nof the government shutdown. They know it is not possible for \nRepublicans to have just discovered negotiations 20 minutes before a \nshutdown, when all they need to do is take up the bill and vote.\n  The latest gimmick the House seems to be considering is to start \nanother supercommittee to debate this issue. Instead of simply taking a \nvote to end this crisis, they want a repeat of 2011. They want another \nsupercommittee. Well, as everyone here knows, I cochaired that \nsupercommittee, the Senator from Montana worked for hours and hours and \ndays on end with me on that committee, and it failed. For reasons that \nwe believe in and they believe in, which could be debated, the \nsupercommitte did not come up with a resolution. I think House \nRepublicans are going to have a lot of trouble explaining to those \nfamilies who haven't seen a paycheck since this shutdown started that \nthey should wait for another supercommittee to go to work.\n  Here is what should happen. House Republicans should end this crisis. \nThey should simply allow a vote on our bill to end the shutdown, which \nwould pass with bipartisan support.\n  They should stop threatening an economic catastrophe if they don't \nget their way, and we are happy to sit down and negotiate. We know on \nour side that negotiation on a budget deal is not going to make us \nhappy. We know the House Republicans won't be happy. But that is how a \ndemocracy works--by working out our differences. Democrats are here \ntoday to say we are willing to negotiate and we are willing to work \nwith our Republican counterparts to find a path forward. Of course we \nwant to negotiate. We have tried to start a budget conference for 6 \nmonths.\n  I know the vast majority of my Republican colleagues came here to \nhelp our families and to help our communities. I know they came here to \nsolve problems. The vast majority came here to work across the aisle to \nmake the country better. So I urge our Republican colleagues here in \nthe Senate today to support the unanimous consent we are about to offer \nto end this crisis, take the threats off the table, and sit down and \nwork with us toward a balanced and bipartisan budget deal that I know \nso many of us in this room want.\n\n\n              Unanimous Consent Requests--H. Con. Res. 25\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate receives \na message from the House that they have passed H.J. Res. 59, as amended \nby the Senate, the Senate then proceed to the consideration of Calendar \nNo. 33, H. Con. Res. 25; that the amendment at the desk, which is the \ntext of S. Con. Res. 8, the budget resolution passed by the Senate, be \ninserted in lieu thereof; that H. Con. Res. 25, as amended, be agreed \nto; that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the \ntable; that the Senate proceed to vote on a motion to insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes \nof the two Houses, and authorize the Chair to appoint conferees on the \npart of the Senate, with all of the above occurring with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I think \nwe should all note that this unanimous consent agreement essentially \nasks the Senate to direct the House on what to pass and to pass the CR \nthe Senate desires. There won't be any need to, in effect, deal in that \nfashion. That won't work.\n  I would also note in response that there is a unanimous consent \nrequest agreement I could agree to and I think Members of this side \nwould agree to, and that is that the Senate proceed to Calendar No. 33, \nH. Con. Res. 25; that the amendment at the desk, which is the text of \nS. Con. Res. 8, the budget resolution passed by the Senate, be inserted \nin lieu thereof; that H. Con. Res. 25, as amended, be agreed to, the \nmotion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that \nthe Senate proceed to a vote on a motion to insist on its amendment, \nrequests a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the \ntwo Houses, and authorize the Chair to appoint conferees on the part of \nthe Senate, with all of the above occurring with no intervening action \nor debate. I further ask consent that it not be in order for the Senate \nto consider a conference report that includes reconciliation \ninstructions to raise the debt limit.\n  That is the reason there has been an objection over here--because, \nunder the way we believe we should proceed, raising the debt limit is a \nlegislative act that should be subject to 60 votes. The concern from \nMembers of our conference who have objected is that if we put the debt \nlimit on the budget, then we would only have to have 51 votes. They \nhave insisted they would approve going to the House and having \nconference on the budget, but they want an agreement that they are not \ngoing to attempt to slip that through. And if it is not a problem, why \nwon't they agree?\n  So for these reasons, we are not able to agree, and I would object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, responding to the unanimous consent \nrequest the Senator from Alabama propounded, I reserve the right to \nobject. We may have just reached the heart of the matter. While we hear \nday after day that our House Republican friends want to negotiate on \nthe debt limit, the Senator from Alabama asked us now to specifically \npreclude ourselves from talking about that very subject. I respectfully \nsuggest that perhaps the real problem here isn't that Democrats aren't \ntalking to Republicans; it is that Republicans aren't even talking to \neach other.\n  I also would note that this modification the Senator from Alabama is \nasking would leave us in a shutdown facing hundreds of thousands of \nfamilies\n\n[[Page S7289]]\n\nwho would wonder when their next paycheck would come while we do our \nwork.\n  So I object to the Senator's request, and I renew my unanimous \nconsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama objected to the \nrequest from the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. And I believe I understood she has renewed it, and so I \nwould renew my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to all requests.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, just briefly, I appreciate Senator \nMurray having passed a budget this year in the Senate for the first \ntime in 4 years. It is a budget that is far from the kind of budget we \nshould have, but it was one they stood up and voted for. That is \nsomething of value to begin our process around here.\n  I would note that the reason it is such an unacceptable proposal from \nmy Democratic colleagues--very similar to what President Obama asked \nfor--is that it raises taxes $1 trillion over 10 years and raises \nspending $1 trillion over 10 years. That is above the lawful Budget \nControl Act levels we agreed to on a bipartisan basis in August of \n2011.\n  If we remember, the President insisted we have a debt ceiling \nincrease then. He said that we couldn't negotiate on it, that the \ncountry would sink into oblivion if we even got close to the debt \nlimit, and we all had to back down and just agree to raise the debt \nlimit without any limits.\n  Polling data showed the American people did not believe we should \nraise the debt limit of America without at least cutting spending and \nreducing our deficits; the credit card Congress was on was going to be \npulled back. So Republicans stood firm. An agreement was reached, and \nthe President approved it. It had no tax increases and raised the debt \nceiling $2.1 trillion over 10 years. How much is that? We were \nprojected to increase spending over 10 years by $10 trillion. This \nwould reduce the increase in spending from $10 trillion to $8 \ntrillion--not enough to throw the government into default, disaster, \nand confusion if properly executed. And it certainly wasn't the best \nway it was done. So that was the agreement. Before the ink is dry, with \na year or so under it, now our colleagues have already abandoned ship, \nthrown in the towel, and want to raise spending by $1 trillion over \nwhat they agreed and raise taxes by another $1 trillion. That is why we \nhave a big disagreement.\n  What do our colleagues want? They want to tax more, spend more, with \nmore debt. It is not the way to run America, and the American people \nknow it. So somehow, in this debt crisis, we all have to work together. \nAnd I respect my colleagues, but I cannot agree to doing something in \nthis process that violates the solemn agreement. We told the American \npeople: OK, we have raised the debt ceiling $2 trillion, but we reduced \nspending by $2 trillion. The debt ceiling has already eased up by $2.1 \ntrillion, but we still made a promise we have to honor--that we will \nsave $2.1 trillion of growth over the next 10 years. That is our \nresponsibility and duty.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next two Republican \nSenators to be recognized would be Senator Collins from Maine followed \nby Senator Murkowski from Alaska and that we would continue to \nalternate between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Collins be \nrecognized at this time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, would the Senator repeat \nhis request.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the two Republican \nspeakers on this side be Senator Collins from Maine and Senator \nMurkowski and that we continue to alternate between both sides. Since I \njust butted in as part of our budget debate, I did not intend or desire \nto take Senator Collins' time. She has been patiently waiting next in \nline.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I certainly will not object to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to underline the gravity of the \nfinancial condition our country is headed to at this point. I think in \nthe back-and-forth we tend to overlook just how serious this matter is. \nHere in the Capitol we walk in the footprints of our forefathers. \nWalking through these halls, their presence is felt at every turn. Just \noutside this Chamber are the likenesses of Washington, Jefferson, \nLincoln, and dozens of statesmen cast in bronze and marble.\n  At the end of this month a new leader will be added to the halls of \nCongress--Winston Churchill. A bust of the late Prime Minister will be \nadded to the Capitol collection in the National Statutory Hall later \nthis month.\n  Churchill once said, ``The price of greatness is responsibility.'' We \nhere in Congress have a great responsibility--a responsibility to \nconduct the business of this Nation, to represent and do what is right \nfor our people and help the people we represent. That is our \nresponsibility here. However, the inaction of a small group of Members \nin the House has crippled Congress and is now threatening to impede the \nability of the United States to fulfill one of its greatest \nresponsibilities--to pay the government's bills. It is completely \nirresponsible to threaten to default on the Nation's debt. Since 1789 \nthis country has always honored its obligations. Even when the White \nHouse and Capitol were burned to the ground right here in 1814, America \nstill honored its debts.\n  America is the greatest country on Earth. We are the leaders of the \nfree world. Nations look to us as examples in democracy. We are \nsupposed to be ``the shining city upon a hill,'' but unfortunately the \nshine risks being tarnished by a debt default.\n  I agree with many of my colleagues that more could be done to reduce \nthe deficit and promote economic growth, but, as the President said, we \ncannot negotiate under the threat of default of the Nation's debt. It \nreminds me of what President Franklin Delano Roosevelt once said: Never \nfear to negotiate, but do not negotiate out of fear. Failing to raise \nthe debt limit and shutting down the government are two fearful actions \nthat should not be on the table as we attempt to negotiate other \nmatters in our Nation's fiscal policy.\n  The path is clear. We need to open the government and raise the \nNation's borrowing limit. Take away those two guns to our head as a \ncountry. Then and only then can we responsibly address the Nation's \nlong-term budget challenges.\n  Right now we need to come together to ensure that we do not permit \nanother self-inflicted wound to our Nation's economy, and that is what \ndefaulting of the debt is--a self-inflicted wound with global \nconsequences.\n  When is the X date? When is the date on which the U.S. Government can \nno longer pay its bills? We don't know exactly. It is uncertain, and \nthat is part of the problem. Uncertainty creates unpredictability. \nNobody knows for sure. The Treasury Secretary says it is October 17. \nThat is as good a date as any. At that time we will have exhausted all \n``extraordinary measures'' to stay under the debt limit. I reminded my \ncolleagues that we have been over the debt limit since I think it is \nMay. But we have been taking extraordinary measures; that is, not \nfulfilling other obligations; that is, not making the government \ncontribution to, say, the government retirement system, for example--we \nare not doing that anymore. That is an extraordinary measure. We are \nnot making that contribution so we can make other payments such as \nMedicare payments and other payments the government is obligated to \nmake.\n\n  After October 17, after all extraordinary measures are exhausted, we \nwould risk defaulting on payments. This is dangerous territory. As of \nnext Thursday it is expected the Treasury Department will have only \nabout $30 billion cash on hand, barely enough to support the government \nfor 1 or 2 weeks. After that the government's wallet is empty. We are \nin uncharted waters.\n  Again, this country has never in its history defaulted on the \nnational debt. If the debt ceiling is reached, government would \nimmediately have to slash its spending by 20 or 30 percent, driving the \nNation back into recession.\n  Make no mistake about it. Social Security payments and Medicare would \nhave to be slashed, veterans' benefits\n\n[[Page S7290]]\n\nhit, farm payments, farm funding, Department of Defense, payments to \nthe disabled--every program this government runs will be devastated by \ncuts.\n  The default would also have global consequences, not just here in \nAmerica but worldwide. Christine Lagarde, the Managing Director of the \nInternational Monetary Fund, warned that a failure of the United States \nto raise the debt ceiling could damage the entire global economy. She \nis right. Look at how precarious the European economy is right now, and \nthe great effort the European countries have been undertaking to try to \nstabilize the southern countries in Europe, along with the creditors of \nthe northern nations of Europe. She said it is ``mission critical'' \nthat the debt limit be resolved as soon as possible. Mission critical, \nsays Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of the IMF.\n  We are the most important economy in the world. We are the reserve \ncurrency for the world. Our Treasury bonds are the very foundation of \nthe global financial system. Default would put the global economy in \nchaos. The New York Times has an article today entitled ``Default \nThreat Generates Fear Around the Globe.''\n\n       Five years after the financial crisis in the United States \n     helped spread a deep global recession--\n\n  Don't forget, Lehman Brothers collapsed 5 years ago in December.\n\n     --policy makers around the world again fear collateral \n     damage, this time with their nations becoming victims not of \n     Wall Street's excesses but of a political system in \n     Washington that to many foreign eyes no longer seems to be \n     able to function efficiently.\n\n  We have read the article. We know it is true. The plug has been \npulled on negotiations between the United States and Europe on their \ntrade agreements. Why? Because of the government shutdown, not so much \nthe debt limit but the shutdown.\n  We also read articles, I am sure it is true, that President Obama had \nto cancel his trip to Southeast Asia because he had to stay here and \ntry to work out this crisis. The United States is losing influence in \nSoutheast Asia because he is not there. Who is there? President Xi, the \nPresident of China. President Xi is there, explaining to the Southeast \nAsian countries that China is their friend and he is making loans, an \ninternational development bank sponsored by China, tens and twenties of \nbillions of dollars--not by the United States but China.\n  Those countries are trying to escape the gravitational pull of \nmainland China. President Xi's presence there helps increase their \ngravitational pull. The President of the United States is not there, \nnot there to show to those other Southeast Asian countries that we \ncare. He is not there because we are not doing our work. That is why he \nis not there.\n  His absence creates another almost deeper concern among countries, \nlet's say in Southeast Asia. Where is the United States going to be \nmilitarily if there is some military difficulty in Southeast Asia? \nWhere is the United States going to be? Can the United States be \ncounted on? Can the United States be trusted?\n  It seems as though there is a question there because the President is \nnot in Southeast Asia and the other question is there because there is \na question whether the United States is going to pay its debts, going \nto pay its bills. I think we eventually will, as the Senator from \nArizona Senator McCain said. I think most Members of this body think we \neventually will. But let's get there now, not later.\n  There is a real danger here, a big danger here. The danger is we are \ngoing to get close to the cliff and get so close to it that we will go \nover it. We know the cliff is out there. The cliff is default. We know \nit is not too far away. We know we do not want to go over the cliff. We \ndo not know exactly where that cliff is. We don't know. It may be \ncloser than we think. We do not know what payments we have to make, \nwhen they are due. We do not know what the revenue is going to be. That \nis why the X date is so uncertain.\n  In addition to that, something might happen that triggers a \ncatastrophic economic global response. I don't want to overstate this \npoint, but back in 1914, the Archduke of Austria was assassinated--\nSerbia. That spark started World War I, that spark caused it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Very briefly, in addition, there have been other \ninstances when pressure was being built up, people did not heed \nwarnings, they let fate tempt them, and the result was collapse. There \nhave been financial bubbles. The tulip bubble, for example. Lehman \nBrothers is another example. We knew with the mortgages being written \nthat a bubble was building in that market, but we let it. We would say, \noh, nothing is going to happen, but it eventually did.\n  I plead with my colleagues here. Remember, we cannot control fate. We \ncan't control it. We can do our best. We all know that we are going to \nraise the debt ceiling, we all know we are going to open the \ngovernment, so let's do it early rather than late.\n  I know it was exceeding my time a little bit, but I think it is \nimportant to remind ourselves.\n  I know we are the greatest country in the world.\n  The leader asked me to refer to a book I mentioned a couple of hours \nago in the Democratic luncheon by Paul Kennedy, a Princeton historian. \nHe pointed out in the sweep of history, civilizations and countries \nrise and fall. There is no guarantee that any country or civilization \ncontinues forever--Greeks, Romans, Persians, Genghis Khan, the United \nKingdom--they rise and they fall. We are No. 1 right now. How long can \nwe continue to be No. 1?\n  He also pointed out, Paul Kennedy, in the sweep of history, countries \nare defeated not by external armies but by internal decay. So I am \nsaying let's not decay here. Let's resolve this as adults and let's be \nresponsible in the spirit of Winston Churchill.\n  I apologize to my good friend from Maine for speaking on her time.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the government shutdown represents a \nfailure to govern and must be brought to an end. Disabled veterans who \nhave sacrificed so much for our country are waiting for their claims to \nbe handled. Pregnant women and small children are at risk of their WIC \nbenefits not being funded. Crucial biomedical research is being \ndisrupted and the sickest of children are being turned away from \nclinical trials at the National Institutes of Health.\n  The impact goes far beyond the direct consequences for Federal \nemployees and the programs they administer. One has only to look at the \nimpact of the closure of Acadia National Park in my State of Maine to \nsee the ripple effects on shopkeepers, servers at restaurants, inn \nowners and others who depend on revenue from these disappointed \ntourists.\n  That is why I have worked hard to put together a three-point plan to \nbring this impasse to a speedy end. I am very delighted that my friend \nand colleague from Alaska Senator Murkowski has joined me in shaping \nand supporting this plan. Let me quickly describe it and let me give \ncredit to those who have talked about concepts that have been \nincorporated into this plan--people such as my colleagues Senator Hatch \nand Senator Toomey, and on the House side, Representative Kind and \nRepresentative Dent.\n  The first point of the plan would fund government for the next 6 \nmonths at the level of $986 billion, so that would allow government to \nimmediately reopen.\n  Second, it would repeal the tax on medical devices and equipment such \nas x ray machines and pacemakers. This tax will only serve to drive up \nthe cost of health care because it will be inevitably passed on to the \nconsumer, it will stifle innovation, and industry estimates that it \nwill lead to the loss of some 43,000 jobs. It is a tax that does not \nmake sense.\n  The administration has pointed to the $30 billion that would be \nraised by this tax over the next 10 years. Fair enough. There is a way \nto replace that revenue and it is a way that has beneficial \nconsequences to many employers who are struggling to make pension \ncontributions in this difficult economy. It would do so without in any \nway weakening the pension obligation to their workers. It is a \ncomplicated issue. It is called pension smoothing. But it is one that \nthis body has dealt with before in the transportation bill known as MAP \n21. We would extend that pension smoothing on the contributions which \nhave been produced\n\n[[Page S7291]]\n\nby the fact that the Federal Reserve has held interest rates at a very \nlow level.\n  I will describe this in more detail in a written statement. It is in \nthe statement that I made on the Senate floor on Saturday. But suffice \nit to say that by smoothing these pension contributions, we can replace \nthe lost revenue that would result from the repeal of the 2.3-percent \ntax on medical devices and equipment.\n  The third point of our plan, the Collins-Murkowski plan, includes a \nbill that Senator Mark Udall and I introduced earlier this year that \nwould provide flexibility to Federal managers in dealing with \nsequestration, but it does so in a way that preserves the important \ncongressional oversight. Sequestration is a flawed policy because it \ndoes not discriminate between essential programs and those that are \nduplicative and wasteful. But if we are to have sequestration, surely \nwe should give Federal managers the ability to set priorities and apply \ncommon sense in its administration instead of having across-the-board, \nequal meat axe cuts for every line item in their budgets.\n  But to ensure that this flexibility is not abused, we would have the \nAppropriations Committee oversee this process and have the right to \nreject the plans. It is very similar to the reprogramming requests that \nthe Appropriations Committee receives now and either accepts or rejects \nwhen agencies want to move money from one account to another.\n  This would represent a modest proposal that could bring this impasse \nto an end, allow government to reopen, give those on both sides of the \naisle who have voted during the course of the budget resolution by 79 \nvotes to 20-something votes to repeal this harmful tax on medical \nequipment and devices and yet replace the revenue. I don't see how the \nadministration could object to that because the revenue would be \nreplaced. Yet this harmful tax would be repealed and we would give \nFederal agencies the flexibility to deal with sequestration.\n  There is something in the Collins-Murkowski plan that everyone on \nboth sides of the aisle can point to. Yet it would get us out of this \nimpasse that is increasingly harmful to our country and its image in \nthe world.\n  It is past time for us to come out of our partisan corners, it is \npast time for us to stop fighting, and it is past time for us to reopen \ngovernment. We have all made crystal clear what our positions are on \nObamaCare at this point. Let's proceed with governing rather than \ncontinuing to embrace a strategy that will lead us only to a dead-end \nand whose consequences will be increasingly felt by our economy and by \nthe American people. We can do this.\n  I ask my Democratic colleagues to take a close look at the plan we \nare putting forward. It is a reasonable approach. I ask my Democratic \nand Republican colleagues to come together. Let's get this done. We can \ndo it. We can legislate responsibly and in good faith.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to respectfully say that we in \nthe Senate and we in the Congress have to do what our constituents \nelected us to do and what the Constitution requires us to do: keep the \nUnited States Government open and make sure the United States of \nAmerica pays its bills. To do that, we are open to negotiation and \nexamining a variety of ideas, but the main idea is to go through the \nregular order in the committee process.\n  We can keep the government open and we can meet our responsibility on \nthe public debt if we embark upon two solutions and they are in the \nhands of the other party. We call upon the House to pass the Senate \ncontinuing funding resolution that would reopen government and keep it \ngoing until November 15. It is not a long-term solution. If we get to \nit right now, we will fund it at 2013 levels, acknowledging the \nsequester level. That was a big compromise. I compromised, as the chair \nof the Appropriations Committee, to move that continuing funding \nresolution. It was $70 billion less than what I wanted, but in order to \nget us in a room and get the conversation going and the negotiations \ngoing, I was willing to compromise.\n  I call upon the House to pass that. I call upon the Senate \nRepublicans who have objected to going to the Budget Committee to lift \ntheir objection so we can take the Senate-passed budget and go to \nconference so we can get a budget.\n  Why is this important? For those who say we have to control spending, \nthere is nobody who disputes that, but the way we control spending is \nto go through the regular budget process. I say to many of my \ncolleagues who might not understand the Budget Control Act and I say to \nthe American people who are listening, the way to control discretionary \nspending is to pass a budget that sets a cap on what the appropriators \ncan spend in domestic spending.\n  I heard the wonderful Senator and distinguished war hero from Arizona \nJohn McCain ask us to get to it today. I agree. Let's get to it today \nand lift the objection for Senator Murray, the chair of the Budget \nCommittee, to take appointed conferees so they can negotiate on the \nbudget.\n  I say to my colleagues--again, to explain the Budget Control Act--we \nappropriators are not wild spenders. We appropriators can't go rogue in \nterms of wild runaway spending. We have a budget cap imposed upon us \nthrough a budget process and something called a 302(a), but we can't \nget the cap on spending unless the Budget Committee is able to move. \nThis is very serious.\n  I have the high honor of representing the State of Maryland, and I \nsee my colleague from Maryland, Senator Cardin, on the floor. We \nrepresent 5\\1/2\\ million people and a lot of civilian agencies. I note \nalso on the floor are the distinguished Senators from Virginia, both of \nwhom are former Governors of Virginia.\n  Between the four of us, we represent the largest concentration of \nFederal employees in the world. We represent Federal employees from the \nDepartment of Defense to the National Institutes of Health, to the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology. There is a rollcall of \nhonor in service and duty that makes the United States a stronger \ncountry, a stronger economy, and so on.\n  When we speak about government, we know what we are talking about, \nand we know what is going on. Many have spoken about opening NIH. I \nwant to open NIH. NIH, which is a clinical hospital, is not accepting \nnew patients. This week 200 people have been turned away. Children in \nthe United States of America were turned away. It is not just Barb \nMikulski talking, the Washington Post reported on a lady who has cancer \nand wants to come to NIH, but she can't get into a clinical trial \nbecause it is closed down. They say: Senator Barb, open NIH. But we \nhave to open the rest of the government.\n  Right now the Centers for Disease Control has a substantial number of \nits workforce furloughed. Having the CDC closed constitutes a danger to \npublic health. Right this minute in 18 States, 278 people have been \nsickened by salmonella. Thank God there have been no deaths, but it is \nmaking people very sick. We don't have CDC on the job to track diseases \nand alert the public health departments around the United States of \nAmerica so they can stand sentry to protect people against salmonella. \nOpen the CDC. Open the whole government.\n  Just this week, in our own metropolitan area, a worker was killed \ntrying to service the Metro. This should be under investigation. There \nwas one death and several injuries. There was a bus crash in Tennessee, \nbut right this very minute the National Transportation Safety Board has \nthe majority of their people furloughed. They can't investigate the \nMetro accident, and they can't investigate the bus crash in Tennessee.\n  A few weeks ago Senator Cardin and I were informed that a person had \na terrible accident on the Bay Bridge in which a car went over the side \nof the bridge. We asked for an investigation to make sure our bridge is \nsafe. That was under way, but now it is going to be delayed.\n  Let's take our FBI. Our FBI agents are on the job. They are being \npaid with IOUs. A group of FBI agents, called Voices from the Field, \nsaid to us, their U.S. Government: Guess what. We don't have gas for \nour cars. The FBI does not have gas for its cars. The agents' gas \nallowance is limited to 200 miles per week, and they can't even buy gas \nout of their own pocket.\n\n[[Page S7292]]\n\n  Not only is the FBI running out of gas, I think we are running out of \ngas here. The way we fuel our tanks and get America running and rolling \nagain is to reopen government. The way we reopen government is for Mr. \nBoehner, the Speaker of the House, in his job as Speaker, to bring up \nthe vote on reopening the government and vote on the Senate-passed \nresolution.\n  We say to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to lift their \nobjection to the Budget Committee going to conference so the Budget \nCommittee can come up with a budget with their caps on domestic \ndiscretionary spending. We will cap all discretionary spending. We \nappropriators will abide by the cap. We will not have runaway spending, \nand we will not go rogue. We will follow the rules, but I think we all \nneed to follow the rules. Under the statutory requirement of the Budget \nControl Act, they were supposed to bring the budget back April 15. We \npassed one on March 23 and we have been waiting and waiting.\n  I wish to join with my colleague from Arizona. Let's get to it. Let's \nget the job done. Let's reopen government. Let's pay our bills. I am \nwilling to negotiate. I am willing to compromise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, from what I heard from those who have \njust spoken prior to me, it sounds as if we ought to be able to get \nsomething done. We listened to the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, with her commitment to advancing issues through the budget \nprocess. I think we too need to go to conference and get that moving.\n  We are sitting here in a kind of a rarefied world in the Senate \nChamber. Some would suggest we live in a little bit of a bubble. Let me \ntell everyone about the folks who are not living in a bubble: the \nfurloughed Federal employees and those who have been shut out of \nwhatever it is that they had hoped they were going to be doing this \npast week and those in my State, for instance, who are looking to fill \nthe family freezer.\n  It is moose season in my State, but now they were told they cannot \naccess any of the refuge lands because Fish and Wildlife has said they \ncannot access the land regardless of what ANILCA provides and \nregardless of the full public access to these Federal lands. Those \nfolks who are feeling the real impact of a government shutdown are not \nliving in a bubble.\n  We just heard the chairman of the Finance Committee talk about the \nlooming threat we are facing as we approach the debt limit, and he \nrefers to a fiscal cliff. In fact, as a nation, we could lose our \nfinancial footing. We could go over that fiscal cliff.\n  For a lot of folks, they are already looking at their own fiscal \ncliff. They are not waiting for us to figure out what we are going to \ndo or not do when it comes to dealing with the debt limit. They are not \ngetting paid. They are perhaps a small business, such as Seong's Sushi \nBar & Chinese, which is located across the street from the Federal \nBuilding in Juneau. They are sitting there losing revenues on a daily \nbasis because they don't have the customers they anticipate every day. \nThe folks who frequent Capital Brew, which is a drive-through coffee \nshop that is also in Juneau across from the Federal Building, Bill's \nMini Cache, which is a snack shop inside the Anchorage Federal \nbuilding, these are folks who are looking at it, and they are feeling \ntheir own fiscal cliff right now, with or without the threat of the \ndebt limit.\n\n  So they are looking at us and they are saying: Wait a minute. You \ntold us a couple weeks ago that we were going to avert this shutdown, \nthat we would figure out how we were going to pass a continuing \nresolution.\n  We didn't pass a continuing resolution. Somehow, that all gets \nwrapped up in ObamaCare. They are trying to figure out where the nexus \nis here between funding the government and what is going on with the \nAffordable Care Act. They then find out: We are in a government \nshutdown. What does that mean for me? I am sitting here in Alaska, \n4,000 miles from Washington, DC. But then they learn Fish and Wildlife \nis saying: No, you can't go out and get the moose to put in your \nfreezer to make it through the winter. Or you are the crab fisherman \nwho is waiting at the crab grounds beginning October 15, but the quotas \nhave not yet been determined from within the National Marine Fisheries \nService center yet, so you can't go out. The revenues the industry \nmight be able to derive, about $7 million from the sale of great king \ncrab that we would all love--a great market out there--but they are not \ngoing to be able to get out in the water because some Federal agency \n4,000 miles from home hasn't delivered to them the quota.\n  So when we talk about these fiscal cliffs, it is not just waiting for \nus to hit a debt limit. It is what is happening with this government \nshutdown.\n  So what they are asking me--and I know each and every one of us is \nhearing from our constituents--is: So what is your plan? And oh, by the \nway, you better get on it pretty quick, because you have my attention \nnow. What is the plan? So they see some of the things coming out of the \nHouse. The House has these mini efforts to fund a specific section, and \nit doesn't go anywhere here. We are told: Well, we want to open the \nwhole thing. So if we can't open the whole thing and we can't open a \nportion of it, nothing happens. Nothing happens. So where is the plan? \nWhat are we going to do?\n  So I am pleased to stand with my friend from Maine Senator Collins as \nshe has described a plan which I think is pretty reasonable. I think it \nis pretty sensible. When we think about those small, rational, \nreasonable steps that might get us to a place where we can stop the \nmadness, if you will, break this impasse--a proposal that would pull \nback on the medical device tax, with an offset, so that we are not \neroding, we are not undercutting the revenues that would come in for \nthe Affordable Care Act, a 6-month extension of the continuing \nresolution, as well as a sequestration with a little bit of flexibility \nand, oh, let's add in some oversight, it sounds pretty rational.\n  Some suggest maybe the President doesn't want to do this because it \nis a small incursion in his signature bill. Do my colleagues know what. \nRight now, what we need to be thinking about is who we work for, \nwhether it is the crab fisherman who wants to get out in the water and \nwho is waiting for NMFS to step it up, whether it is the family out in \nGalena who is hoping they are going to be able to get their moose \nbefore moose season closes, whether it is the guy at Seong's Sushi Bar \nand Chinese there in Juneau, or whether it is the Alaska family. I got \nan e-mail a couple of days ago. This family has been planning for a \nyear to bring all the kids together, including boyfriends and \ngirlfriends. They are going to do a great hike out in the Moab National \nPark for a week, and they are stuck. Nothing is going on, and their \nfamily vacation is ruined.\n  What about what is going on--this is an amazing one--in the Kenai \nRiver, which happens to proceed through some refuge areas. People can \nstill go fishing now, and there is good rainbow fishing out there. But \nwhen you move down river through that refuge park, you better bring \nyour lines in because we are going to have enforcement action on the \nriver.\n  There are so many stories we can all attest to, and some of them are \nhorrible. Some of them, as Senator McCain has indicated, are about \nfamilies who are grieving the loss of their loved one--someone who has \nserved this country with honor--being denied death benefits.\n  The country expects us to get our act together, and they expect us to \ndo it without delay. They are not interested in knowing which side is \ngoing to gain more leverage the further we delay. Nobody is winning. I \ntell my friends the Democrats: You are not winning. And I tell my \nfriends the Republicans: We are not winning. The administration is not \nwinning. Everybody is losing when we cannot come together with a plan, \nwith the resolve to do the job we are tasked to do, which is basic \ngoverning, and keeping the government open is basic governing.\n  So whether it is Senator Collins' plan, whether it is an effort that \nis yet to be created, as the Senator from Arizona challenged us, let's \nstart this now. Let's not delay any further because real people--the \npeople we care for, the people we are charged to help--are hurting \nright now. This goes beyond mere inconvenience. This is hurt.\n  So let's do what we have pledged to do. Let's do what we have signed \nup to\n\n[[Page S7293]]\n\ndo, which is to work together. At the end of the day, this is not going \nto be a Republican plan or a Democratic plan or a Senate plan or a \nHouse plan. It is going to be a plan that allows us to govern.\n  With that, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/08/senate-section/article/S7293-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I wish to follow up on the remarks of my \ncolleagues and the Senators who have spoken before me.\n  It seems as though we have accepted this new normal, that shutting \ndown the operations of the largest enterprise in America is acceptable. \nI concur with my colleague, the Senator from Alaska, about the real \nstories and real pain that is taking place because of this government \nshutdown. I commend some of my colleagues for their comments. When we \nread these tragic stories, whether it concerns NIH or it concerns our \nveterans or concerns our National Park Service, they say: Oh, but that \npart of the government we want to reopen. Does that mean that every \nother aspect of government remains closed until we can find that story?\n  I point out stories to my colleagues that were in both The Washington \nPost and The New York Times today--stories we should be celebrating \nabout--three American Nobel Prize winners. Does that mean we should now \nreopen the NSF, because if the National Science Foundation isn't \nfunded, there may not be a next generation of American Nobel Prize \nwinners? Do we have to bring in a story about some child being hurt \nbecause their food or their meat or their fish wasn't inspected \ncorrectly?\n  I have to tell my colleagues, I spent a lot longer in business than I \nhave in politics, and I have been involved in a lot of business \nnegotiations. But I have never been involved in a negotiation that says \nduring the negotiation we have to shut down the operations of our \nbusiness and inflict pain not only upon our employees but upon the \ngeneral economy across the board.\n  That is not the way to govern.\n  We have talked about stories about Federal workers. But I agree with \nthe Senator from Alaska. It also hurts the hotel owners along the \nSkyline Drive in our State of Virginia and the government contractors \nwho start and stop because they don't understand how government is \ngoing to operate. I heard a story this morning about a small business \noutside a government facility in St. Louis that is hurting as well.\n  This piecemeal approach to reopening government makes no sense. What \nmight be better--as we hear from some folks who want to have this \npiecemeal effect--is to ask: What parts of the government should stay \nclosed. This is not the way to operate. We ought to reopen this \ngovernment, put our people back to work, get this economy going again, \nand continue the very real conversations we have to have about getting \nour fiscal house in order.\n  What makes this different to me, in the 4\\1/2\\ years I have been in \nthe Senate, than previous discussions and debates is that we have \nthis--the first in my tenure in the Senate--government shutdown which \ndisproportionately is hurting Virginia and Maryland. But it is \nliterally hurting every community across America. But we have this \ntragedy, this catastrophe merging now into a deadline that is going to \nhit us next week where there are certain Members of Congress who say: \nIt is OK if America defaults.\n  I find that stunning.\n  When we look back, we find there has never been a major industrial \ncountry in modern history that has defaulted. As a matter of fact, the \nlast major country to default was Argentina, back in December of 2001. \nIn the aftermath of that default, they had over 100 percent per annum \ninflation. Every family in Argentina saw literally 60 percent of their \nnet worth disappear within a few weeks. America is not Argentina, but \nwhy would we even get close to that kind of potential economic \ncatastrophe?\n  It has been mentioned already that America holds a record as the \nreserve currency for the world. When crises happen, as have happened \naround the world recently in many countries, people and capital flow \ninto the dollar. That is because the dollar and the full faith and \ncredit of the United States has never been suspect. There has never \nbeen a question of whether we are going to honor our commitments. Next \nweek, or very shortly after, that history is going to be put \npotentially in jeopardy.\n  I have heard those who say we can prioritize payments. There is no \nbusiness group in America or no economist that I know of, from left to \nright, who believes that somehow America can partially default and \nprioritize payments. Are we going to pay interest? Are we going to pay \nour troops?\n  Those of us who served at State levels realize that sometimes our \nbudgets are close to 50 percent passthroughs from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The Presiding Officer was the governor of the great State of West \nVirginia. How long before West Virginia defaults if America starts \nprioritizing its payments? How many other Detroits will there be all \nacross America if we were to take this type of irresponsible action? \nEven if there were some possibility that there might be some chance of \nsome logic behind this partial payment scheme, it has never been tried \nbefore. No industrial country has ever gotten this close to a default. \nWhy would we take the chance? Why would we play Russian roulette with \nonly one bullet in two chambers? It is something that at this moment, \nfor our national economy and the world economy, can be devastating.\n  I know we seem to all be repeating ourselves on both sides, but to me \nit seems very easy in a negotiation; we have differences. I would say \nto my colleagues I probably make folks on my side more angry than \nalmost anyone else on these issues around getting our country's balance \nsheet in order. I am anxious to continue those discussions about tax \nreform, about entitlement reform, about bringing our debt-to-GDP ratio \ndown. But that kind of negotiation hasn't happened while we have this \ngovernment shutdown and the full faith and credit of the United States \npotentially in jeopardy.\n  So let's open the government, not just because we hear some tragic \nstory about one component of the government, not just because we need \nto make the case about food inspectors, about the National Science \nFoundation, about NASA Langley where we do aeronautics research--3,500 \npeople and 7 people were at work last week. China, India, other nations \naround the world are not stopping their research, not stopping their \ninvestments because we can't get our act together. Open this \ngovernment. Take off the table the idea that America will default. Then \nI am anxious to join with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get \nour country's balance sheet in order. But to continue to hold this \neconomy and these stories of these Americans lives in this limbo is \nirresponsible beyond words.\n\n  So I hope we will go ahead and--agreeing with my colleagues who have \nspoken already, let's get this government open. Let's take and make \nsure we are going to honor and pay our debts, and let's get to the very \nreal, important questions of how we get our Nation's balance sheet \nright.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                Unanimous Consent Request--H.J. Res. 72\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I want to again thank the majority leader \nfor bringing the attention of this body to the tragedy of those \nservicemen who lost their lives and the fact that, unfortunately, their \nfamilies had been notified improperly, I believe, that they will not be \npaid the tax-free death gratuity they are entitled to under law. This \nis wrong. Every Member of this body agrees this is wrong. Every \nRepublican agrees this is wrong, and I am confident every Democrat \nagrees it is wrong as well.\n  Indeed, the way this announcement that was made was highly troubling.\n\n[[Page S7294]]\n\nThe Department of Defense notified our military families via Twitter \nthat those servicemembers who die in battle will not be paid their tax-\nfree death gratuities due to the partial Federal Government shutdown.\n  I think this is yet another pattern that we have seen distressingly \nfrom the Obama administration of politicizing this shutdown and playing \npartisan games to maximize the pain that is inflicted on Americans. It \nis part and parcel of the pattern we have seen, barricading the World \nWar II memorial, barricading the parking lot at Mount Vernon, George \nWashington's home, even though Mount Vernon is privately operated, \nbarricading the roads leaving Mount Rushmore, even though they are \nState roads and not Federal roads.\n  The actions by the Department of Defense are also contrary to the \nstatute that this body just passed. The military death gratuity is by \nstatute a pay and personnel benefit. Accordingly, it is clearly funded \nby Public Law 113-39, the Pay Our Military Act that was passed in a \nbipartisan manner this week. We already acted to prevent this and, \nunfortunately, the Defense Department is declining to follow that law \nthat we passed.\n  The legislation this body already passed would immediately act to \ntake the families of those soldiers and sailors and airmen and marines \nwhose lives are tragically taken--to take them off the table and say: \nRegardless of what happens in a government shutdown, we are going to \nstand by the men and women fighting for America.\n  Indeed, the House of Representatives has introduced a bipartisan bill \nto immediately fund death gratuity payments. When that bill is passed, \nthe Senate should pass that bill immediately. Indeed, the Pentagon \nshould abandon this policy to begin with and simply follow the law that \nwas already passed. But if they do not, I call upon all 100 Senators to \ncome together, to listen to the majority leader, who spoke powerfully \nabout the need to stand by our service men and women whose lives are \ntragically taken. When the House passes that bill, which I am confident \nit will do so with considerable speed, I would call upon every Senator \nto listen to the majority leader's call and to stand with our service \nmen and women.\n  But there is something else we can do right here today to demonstrate \nthat this body does not have to be locked in partisan gridlock, to \ndemonstrate that bipartisan cooperation is possible, and to demonstrate \nthat our veterans are truly not the subject of partisan dispute but are \nseparate and deserve to be treated fairly, deserve to have the \ncommitments, the promises we made to our veterans honored; that is, \nthis body can stop blocking the legislation that the House of \nRepresentatives has already passed--bipartisan legislation to fund the \nVA, to fund disability payments--so we do not hold them hostage to what \nis happening in Washington.\n  Accordingly, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of H.J. Res. 72, making continuing appropriations for \nveterans benefits for fiscal year 2014; that the measure be read three \ntimes and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and \nlaid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Texas has \nstated again what has already been talked about here a lot, and that is \na piecemeal approach to funding our government.\n  As do most Americans, we Democrats support the purpose of this bill \nto fund the Veterans' Administration. But there is no reason for us to \nhave to choose between this important government function and disease \ncontrol, NIH, highway safety, FBI, poor children, workplace safety, or \nprotecting the environment.\n  We could do all these things if the House Republican leadership would \njust allow the House to vote on the Senate-passed measure to end the \nshutdown. Everyone knows the votes are there.\n  Our position is simple: Open the government, pay our bills, and then \nwe will be happy to negotiate about anything.\n  We need to end this government shutdown.\n  First of all, my friend talks about these five families who are in \nbereavement, and that is an understatement. Five sons, husbands, \nfriends were killed over the weekend.\n  Providing the funding that my friend requests would not enable DOD to \npay a death gratuity to the families of 17 servicemembers--five over \nthe weekend. We have had others die who have given their lives to \nprotect the Nation since the shutdown began on October 1. Seventeen.\n  This is but one example of how the efforts of the Senator from Texas \nto fund the government on a piecemeal basis does not work.\n  If the Speaker would allow the House to pass the Senate continuing \nresolution, the Department of Defense would have the authority it needs \nto bring families to Dover, DE, to receive the remains of their family \nmembers and to pay the death gratuity benefits.\n  The junior Senator from Texas expresses concern for America's \nveterans. But his consent request addresses only some of the ways in \nwhich the American people, through their government, have committed to \nhelp our veterans.\n  Let me quote from the remarks of the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nMurphy. He gave these remarks on October 3. Here is exactly what he \nsaid:\n\n       I would note also that I believe the resolution the Senator \n     is offering and suggested be passed provides only partial \n     funding for the VA. There is no funding here to operate the \n     national cemeteries. There is no funding for the Board of \n     Veterans' Appeals. There is no funding for constructing VA \n     hospitals and their clinics. There is no funding, actually, \n     to operate the IT system that the entire VA needs in order to \n     continue going forward.\n\n  So there could not be a better example of: Why we are involved in \nthis? Why could not we just open the government? Let our former \ncolleague, the former Senator from Georgia, Max Cleland, a decorated, \ndisabled American veteran who runs the cemeteries, do his job. He \ncannot do that. Let's get it all over with. Let's have the NIH go \nforward, the Centers for Disease Control, the Park Service. We cannot \nhave this piecemeal approach, because you wind up with the same \nsituation in which we now find ourselves. We want to do something for \nthe veterans, but it does not take care of much of what the veterans \nneed.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that my friend's request be modified as \nfollows: That an amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; that \nthe joint resolution, as amended, then be read a third time and passed; \nand the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate. This amendment is the text \nthat passed the Senate and is a clean continuing resolution for the \nentire government--everything; veterans, there are cemeteries, there \nare benefits, everything--and it is something that is already over in \nthe House and reportedly has the support of a majority of the Members \nof the House of Representatives.\n  So I would ask my friend to really surprise the world, surprise the \ncountry, and say: I agree. Modify it. Let's fund the government.\n  And then, as we have said, as I have said--and everyone listen: We \nare happy, when the government is open, when we can pay our bills, to \nsit down and talk about anything they want to talk about. It does not \nmatter. No restrictions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Does the Senator so modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask \nunanimous consent that the majority leader and I be able to engage in a \ncolloquy so that we may perhaps be able to, as the majority leader \nsaid, surprise the world by finding some avenues of bipartisan \ncooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy to sit down and talk to the \nSenator--his office or my office. The point we have right here today is \nthat we need the government open. With all due respect to my friend, \nthe junior Senator from Texas--I want to say this in a most respectful \nway--he and I, with the dialog here on the Senate floor, we are not \ngoing to work this out. I have asked that the government be open so\n\n[[Page S7295]]\n\nthat everyone can have benefits. The veterans measure he proposes \nleaves many veterans out in the cold--out in the cold--including the \nfamilies of 17 of our servicemen who were killed since this came into \neffect, this shutdown.\n  So we will go as we have. I object to his proposal. I assume he will \nobject to mine. And then we will go through the 10 minutes per person \nand see what happens later today. But I do--I am happy to sit down and \ntalk to the Senator in my office, his office, any place he suggests, \nprivately or publicly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, was there----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, just a clarification: Was there objection to \nthe request that we be able to engage in a colloquy? I was not clear as \nto what the majority leader was objecting to.\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Is there objection to the modified request?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will note \nwith regret that the majority leader objected to engaging in a \ndiscussion, to engaging in negotiations here on the Senate floor. I \nthink that is unfortunate.\n  So I will promulgate the questions I would have asked him directly, \nand he may choose whether he may wish to answer.\n  The majority leader read from comments that Senator Murphy made on \nthe Senate floor, suggesting that the House bill funding the VA was not \nbroad enough. I would note, in my office we have drafted legislation \nthat would fund the VA in its entirety. And if his objection is that it \nis not broad enough, I will readily offer that I would happily work \nwith the majority leader to fund every bit of the VA as it is right now \ntoday, and we could introduce that bill. Indeed, I would be happy to \nhave it labeled the Reid-Cruz bill and to give lead authorship to the \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator be willing to take care of the 560,000 \nveterans who are Federal employees, many of whom have now been \nfurloughed?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend from Illinois for that question. Indeed, \nI enthusiastically support the proposal that the House unanimously \npassed to give backpay to Federal workers. Indeed, I would ask a \nquestion of the assistant majority leader: whether the Senate will even \nvote on that proposal because there are eight bills funding the Federal \nGovernment that are sitting on the majority leader's desk. We have not \nbeen allowed to vote on any of them.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Texas is asking me a question, I \nwould respond through the Chair that we have given the Senator from \nTexas ample opportunity to completely fund the government, including \nall of the veterans who work for the Federal Government, and all of the \nfunctions of the Federal Government so we do not run into the \nembarrassment of these poor families in their bereavement being denied \nthe most basic benefits that our government gives.\n  He has had a chance to do that over and over. I believe he has \ndeclined that opportunity. So he bears some responsibility for the \nunfortunate circumstances we face.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I would note the fact that there are some \nissues on which we have partisan disagreements does not mean there are \nnot other issues on which we can come together.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield to my friend for a question.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Through the Chair to the Senator from Texas, I am \nwondering if his motion includes the full funding of the VA medical \nsystem, which is a completely government-run, government-controlled \nhealth care system?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend for that question. As I said, I would \nreadily support legislation fully funding the VA, because the VA is a \nvital government system. It is a promise we have made. It is unrelated \nto ObamaCare. My principal complaint this past week has been that the \nDemocratic majority in this body is holding programs unrelated to \nObamaCare hostage in order to force ObamaCare on everyone. We agreed \nfor active-duty military.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, if I might, just to clarify so that I \nunderstand, because the Senator from Texas has, in fact, made the \nending of a private sector competitive health care system for up to 30 \nmillion Americans part of what he wants to stop, I wanted to be clear \nthat the fully government-funded, government-run, with government \ndoctors system through the Veterans' Administration is something the \nSenator is advocating that we continue to fund through the Federal \nGovernment?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend from Michigan for that question. Yet \nagain, the answer is yes. I believe we should fully fund the VA. The \ntwo questions I would promulgate----\n  Mr. REID. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modified request?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. REID. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modified request?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I would note the majority leader seems not to want to \nengage in debate. So I object. I hope the majority leader will start \nnegotiating.\n  Mr. REID. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the modified request.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, using leader time, we have a number of \npeople who are wishing to speak. They should be able to do that. But I \nsay as nicely as I can, the problem we have here is what people are \nsaying, like my friend from Texas, little bits and pieces of \ngovernment. It will not work. We have to open the government. So until \nthat happens--we have to open the government. We have to make sure we \ncan pay our debts. Then we will negotiate.\n  I know he is fixed on ObamaCare. We know that. But the problem is \nthat is not going to change. So I would hope we can do what needs to be \ndone, open the government, make sure we pay our bills, and then we \nnegotiate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I want to join with most of my colleagues who have talked \nabout the urgency of us getting the government open. It is causing \ngreat harm to our country. Make no mistake about it, it is hurting our \neconomy. I could talk about my own State of Maryland. Our Governor has \nestimated that we are losing $15 million every day. So every day is \nprecious.\n  I could talk about over 100,000 Federal workers in Maryland who are \nfurloughed out of the 800,000 nationally, having a huge impact on our \neconomy.\n  This morning Senator Boxer held a news briefing where we talked about \nthe impact on the Environmental Protection Agency where 93 percent of \nits employees have been furloughed. We can talk about the direct impact \nof those employees not being there.\n  There was a representative from the Ding Darling Refuge in Florida \nsaying not only did it hurt the local economy directly, but she talked \nabout one of the contract services that provided the touring service to \nthe refuge had to lay off 20-some employees.\n  There are private sector jobs that are directly being lost as a \nresult of this furlough. It is going to be very difficult to get back \nthat loss in our economy the longer the government shutdown lasts. It \nis wasteful to the taxpayer. The last shutdown cost the taxpayers $2 \nbillion. Here we talk about conservatives who want to do something \nabout the national debt and they are wasting taxpayer dollars by \nkeeping government closed.\n  Yes, it is hurting our Federal workforce. I joined with Senator \nMikulski in the comments she made a little bit earlier. Our Federal \nworkforce has had to endure freezes in salaries, furloughs as a result \nof sequestration, freezes in the number of employees who can be hired, \ndoing more work with less, and now furloughs again under a government \nshutdown. Those who are working do not know when they are going to get \npaid. It is not what we should be\n\n[[Page S7296]]\n\ndoing to our Federal workforce. They have suffered. This is wrong. It \nis totally avoidable.\n  The furloughs at the Environmental Protection Agency are jeopardizing \nour public health. We had experts come in today and talk about the fact \nthat we do not have the people on guard to protect our waters, to \nprotect our air, to protect our environment. It is jeopardizing public \nhealth. It is jeopardizing our environment.\n  I mentioned this morning, and let me mention again, the Blackwater \nNational Wildlife Refuge located on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, in \nCambridge. This is a community in which that refuge is a huge part of \ntheir economy. This is a popular month for visitors to visit \nBlackwater. Well, the local businesses are hurting. The restaurants \nhave less customers; the hotels, less rooms are being rented. It goes \non and on and on, the damage to our economy.\n  Harbor Point is one of the most important economic developments in \ndowntown Baltimore. It is an RCRA site, which means it is under court \norder requiring the Environmental Protection Agency to sign off on the \ndevelopment plan. Well, we have a development plan. The city council is \nacting. We are ready to move forward. But guess what. We cannot get EPA \nto sign off on it because the people responsible are now on furlough. \nThat is holding up economic growth and economic development in \nBaltimore. That is what this is doing. It is harming us.\n  Maryland farmers on the Chesapeake Bay are doing what is right to try \nto help our bay. They depend upon the protections of the programs that \nare out there on soil conservation. The Senator from Michigan knows \nthrough how hard she has been working on the agriculture bill to \nprovide the tools that are necessary to help our farmers be responsible \nfarmers on land conservation.\n  I received a call from a farmer near Centerville, MD, on Monday that \nsums up pretty well how important the Natural Resources Conservation \nService is to their work. This person is enrolled in the Conservation \nStewardship Program, the CSP. That means he is planting bumper crops in \nan effort to help us deal with the runoff issues of pesticides and \ninsecticides into the bay, helping us in helping the bay.\n  He receives certain payments as a result of participation in the \nprogram. He is no longer getting those payments. We are asking him to \nmake sacrifices, but we are not giving him the Federal partnership. \nThat is not right. He is hurt. He said: What am I supposed to do? Am I \nsupposed to continue to do this? He told me he has a son with a medical \ncondition that requires regular clinical eye treatment. He does not \nknow whether he can afford that this month. He was helping us with the \nenvironment. Now what do we do? We back off of what is necessary.\n  I could give you many more examples. There is no piecemeal way you \ncan correct each one of those.\n  On our foreign policy issues, I have the honor of chairing the East \nAsia and Pacific Subcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee. \nPresident Obama was supposed to be the headliner at the East Asia \nEconomic Summit this past week. Guess who stole the headline. President \nXi of China rather than our President. Asia is wondering whether \nAmerica is open for business. We were missing at the table. That is no \nway for America to be conducting its business. We need to be open. We \nneed to get government open.\n  I hear my colleagues who want to negotiate budget deals. I am all for \nthat. I think I have a reputation around here and people know I am \ninterested in getting Democrats and Republicans together and getting a \nbudget that makes sense for our country. But let me quote from the \nBaltimore Sun from this morning, because I think they say it better \nthan I could say it. This is an exact quote from the Baltimore Sun \nabout negotiations and how we have to go through negotiations.\n\n       Passing a ``clean'' continuing resolution keeping \n     government fully operating at funding levels that GOP has \n     already endorsed is no compromise. It's status quo. Raising \n     the debt ceiling isn't a concession either--it allows the \n     nation to pay the bills Congress has already incurred and \n     prevents the possibility of a government default, which would \n     hurt the economy, raise borrowing costs and increase the \n     Federal deficit.\n       So when Speaker Boehner lashes out at President Obama for \n     failing to negotiate, one has to ask, what is this thing he \n     describes as negotiation? House Republicans are not merely \n     leveraging their political position--as some dryly claim--\n     they are threatening to do grievous harm to the global \n     economy and the American public.\n       The gun isn't raised to Mr. Obama's head or to the \n     Senate's. The Democrats have no particular stake in passing a \n     continuing resolution or in raising the debt ceiling other \n     than keeping public order and doing what any reasonable \n     person expects Congress to do. No, the gun is raised at the \n     nation as a whole. That's why descriptions like ``ransom'' \n     and ``hostage'' are not mere hyperbole, they are as close as \n     the English language gets to accurately describing the GOP \n     strategy.\n\n  The editorial ends by saying:\n\n       It's time for Mr. Boehner to put down the gun and put more \n     faith in the democratic process.\n\n  We need to negotiate a budget for next year. We absolutely need to do \nit. We tried to go to budget conference many times. The majority leader \nhas repeated that request today. The formula of what is right for this \ncountry to do--and it is not one side getting advantage over another--\nthe right thing to do is open government, pay our bills, and, yes, \nlet's negotiate a budget that will not be what the Democrats want, will \nnot be what the Republicans want. We are going to have to compromise as \nthe Framers of our Constitution envisioned that we would do. That is \nwhat we should have done months ago. We passed our budget in March. We \nshould have been negotiating months ago.\n  But what we need to do right now is open government, pay our bills, \nand, yes, then it is ripe for us to sit down and negotiate. I can tell \nyou, we are ready to do that. But it is up to Speaker Boehner now to \nvote, to vote on the resolution that will keep government open, to vote \non a way we can make sure that we will continue to pay our bills, and \nthen accept our offer to sit down and negotiate a budget for the coming \nyear. That would be the best thing we can do for the American people.\n  I urge my colleagues with a sense of urgency that we move this \nimmediately because of the damage we are causing to our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, there can be no doubt that no one wants to be \nhere. Not one Member of this body wants to be in shutdown. We all may \nhave different reasons, different explanations as to why we are here. \nWe might differ with regard to our own beliefs as to how best we should \nget out of this. But not one of us wants to be here. Every one of us \nrecognizes how awful it is to be in a shutdown posture.\n  I would like to take a few moments and explain my thoughts on both of \nthose two points. I believe perhaps the single most important reason, \nsingle most undisputable reason why we are in a shutdown posture has to \ndo with the fact that for a variety of reasons we have been operating \non the basis of continuing resolutions for several years in a row. A \ncontinuing resolution, of course, is a bill, a legislative vehicle \nthrough which Congress may choose to keep government programs funded at \ncurrent levels. It is kind of a reset button. It propels us forward on \nthe basis of our current spending pattern, rather than on the basis of \nan independently, freshly negotiated set of priorities.\n  This is a different way of running government. Normally this is \nreserved for unusual circumstances. It usually does not last as long as \nwe have been going this time around, for about 4\\1/2\\ years this way. \nBut this causes us to do things in a way that is different than one \nwould otherwise choose to do them. It is certainly very different than \nthe manner in which we would operate in any other aspect of our lives.\n  To use one familiar example, let's analogize Congress's spending \npattern, its spending decisions, to a consumer going to the grocery \nstore. Suppose you went to the grocery store having been informed by \nyour spouse that you need to bring home bread, milk, and eggs. So you \nwent to that grocery store, you put bread and milk and eggs in your \nbasket. You go to the checkout counter. You place the bread, the milk, \nand the eggs on the counter. The cashier rings you up. The cashier at \nthat point says: Okay, here is what you will owe us for these items, \nbut we will not allow you to buy just bread, milk, and\n\n[[Page S7297]]\n\neggs. In order to buy these items at this store, we will also require \nyou to purchase a half ton of iron ore, a bucket of nails, a book about \ncowboy poetry, and a Barry Manilow album.\n  Of course, anyone being told that would be a little surprised. Anyone \nbeing told that would be reluctant to shop at that same store in the \nfuture. And if another store existed, another alternative, very few, if \nany, consumers would continue shopping at that institution.\n\n  Yet that in some ways is the way we are asked to spend money here in \nCongress when we are operating on the basis of back-to-back continuing \nresolutions, just pushing reset on our spending button, keeping a \nFederal Government that spends about $3.7 trillion a year operating \nsort of on economic autopilot.\n  It would actually be a little bit closer analogy if we changed the \nhypothetical to a circumstance in which the cashier said not just that \nyou have to buy half a ton of iron ore, a bucket of nails, a book about \ncowboy poetry, and a Barry Manilow album, but you also have to buy one \nof every single item in the entire grocery store in order to buy \nanything--no bread, no milk, no eggs, nothing unless you buy one of \neverything in the entire store. That would bring us a little closer to \nthe analogy we are dealing with here where we have to choose to fund \neverything or alternatively to fund nothing. Neither one of those, it \nseems to me, is a terribly good solution. Neither one of those fairly \nrepresents good decisionmaking practices.\n  We ought to be able to proceed, as past Congresses have historically, \npassing a dozen or so--sometimes more--appropriations bills and going \nthrough our Federal Government category by category debating and \ndiscussing each appropriations measure, discussing the contents of that \nmeasure to make sure there is sufficient agreement within this body and \nwithin the House of Representatives to continue funding the government \nfunction in question.\n  We have a new item in the store, so to speak, as we are shopping this \nyear. This new item in the store is called ObamaCare, one that is about \nto take full effect on January 1, 2014. Yes, it is the law of the land, \nbut we do have the final choice, the final option, the final authority \nto choose whether to fund that moving forward or, alternatively, to \ndefund it. We can take that out of the grocery cart.\n  It is a new item that has caused a lot of people a lot of concern. A \nlot of people are fearing and experiencing job losses, cuts to their \nwages, having their hours slashed and losing their health care benefits \nas a result of this law, and they see more of these disturbing trends \ncoming in the near future. So they are asking for Congress to help. \nThey are asking for Congress to defund the implementation of this law.\n  A lot of people and many of my colleagues in this body have responded \nby saying: Yes, but it is the law. That is true. It was passed by \nCongress 3\\1/2\\ years ago and signed into law by President Obama. It is \nimportant to remember two facts about this, however.\n  First of all, the President himself has announced that he is not \nfollowing the law. He himself says the law is not ready to implement as \nit is written. He himself has refused to follow it as it is written.\n  Secondly, it is not unusual, it is not unheard of by any means to \nhave a law that puts in place one standard, one program, and then have \na subsequent appropriations decision made by Congress that results in \nthe defunding of that very program. Let me cite one of many examples I \ncould point to. Under Federal law, currently there is designated \nsomething known as the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository. That is \nour official nuclear waste repository. Yet for many years it has been \ndefunded by the Congress. That is Congress's prerogative. Congress \nholds the power of the purse. Congress may decide to do that.\n  It is also important to remember that this was by design that it \nwould work this way. Our Founding Fathers understood and set up the \nsystem so that it would work this way, and they put the power of the \npurse in the hands of the House of Representatives, understanding the \nHouse of Representatives would act first when exercising the power of \nthe purse.\n  James Madison acknowledged this fact in Federalist No. 58, and if I \ncan quote from that in pertinent part, James Madison wrote:\n\n       The House of Representatives can not only refuse, but they \n     alone can propose the supplies requisite for the support of \n     Government. They, in a word, hold the purse; that powerful \n     instrument by which we behold, in the history of the British \n     Constitution, an infant and humble representation of the \n     People gradually enlarging the sphere of its activity and \n     importance, and finally reducing, as far as it seems to have \n     wished, all the overgrown prerogatives of the other branches \n     of the Government. This power over the purse may, in fact, be \n     regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which \n     any Constitution can arm the immediate Representatives of the \n     People, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for \n     carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.\n\n  So we find ourselves now in a position in which the House of \nRepresentatives is wanting to get the government funded again and is \nacting to keep the government funded on a step-by-step basis, starting \nwith those areas as to which there is the most broad-based bipartisan \nsupport, those areas of government that have nothing to do with the \nimplementation and enforcement of ObamaCare. Moving step by step in \nthis fashion, we can get the government funded again. We should be \ngetting the government funded again.\n  In many respects, what we have seen over the last week--the conduct \nof the Obama administration during the first week of this shutdown--may \nwell serve as the single best argument against ObamaCare. What we have \nseen is a willingness of this President and his administration to \nutilize the already vast resources of the Federal Government to make it \nhurt--to hurt families, to hurt businesses, to hurt those who depend on \ntheir access to Federal lands, to national monuments, national parks, \nand other Federal installations. This itself is evidence of the fact \nthat when we give government too much power, that power may, and \nultimately will, be abused.\n  I want to be clear that this is not a problem that is distinctively \nDemocratic. It is not something that belongs uniquely to liberals. This \nis equally a Republican problem. Republican and Democratic \nadministrations in the past and in the future will have chosen at times \nto abuse power when it suits their interests in order to get their way \npolitically. We need to not give yet another source of power to the \nFederal Government--a source of power that intrudes into one of the \nmost personal aspects of human existence.\n  When we give the Federal Government control of our health care \nsystem, we give them control of aspects of our lives that are intensely \npersonal, very intimate, and, frankly, not the business of the Federal \nGovernment. We don't want to give that power to a government that may \none day be used against us for someone's partisan political gain. It is \nfor that reason we are having this discussion. It is for that reason we \nneed to keep the government funded.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, we are now in day 8 of the government \nshutdown, and the pain has been felt by all across the country--by the \ncancer patients being denied access to new clinical trials at NIH, by \nthe mom whose son has muscular dystrophy. His name is Jackson. She told \nme that every day those researchers aren't working on a cure for her \nson's disease is a day lost. She said every day counts. Small \nbusinesses can't get affordable loans through the SBA. Farmers write me \nabout not being able to get their conservation loans.\n  I have here a letter I read on the floor on Saturday:\n\n       Please do whatever you can to stop the government shutdown. \n     We have 14 acres of land enrolled in the Conservation Reserve \n     Program. Our rental payment is made to us this first week of \n     October. We depend on this money. It is not a small amount \n     for our family.\n\n  Kathy, from Minnesota:\n\n       I am an employee of the Social Security Administration, \n     Office of Disability . . . I have seen you intervene on \n     matters for claimants who have disability hearings pending. I \n     am furloughed as part of the government shutdown. If you want \n     your constituents' hearings addressed, I need to be at work \n     in my office.\n\n  Alicia, from Hastings, MN:\n\n       I am writing to express my extreme concern over the federal \n     government shutdown.\n\n[[Page S7298]]\n\n     I am a teacher, a mother of three boys, and the wife of a \n     furloughed veteran who works for the Minnesota Air National \n     Guard. I have never before written a letter to my \n     representatives, but feel so utterly helpless and frustrated \n     at this time; I needed to voice my concern. . . . At this \n     point in time, my husband, who is a veteran . . . is out of \n     work because he is a federal employee not deemed essential. I \n     am afraid that not only are the other 800,000 laid-off \n     federal employees deemed non-essential, but the rest of the \n     American citizens are non-essential as well.\n\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       Our struggles are real-life struggles; not a game, not \n     philosophical, not in theory, not distant, and not imaginary. \n     My hope is that these struggles and hardships matter to you . \n     . . That is your duty. That is your charge. That is your \n     enormous task. Shutting down the government is not one of \n     those responsible actions.\n\n  That is what we are hearing from the people in my State, the people \nall over the country.\n  It is time to end the shutdown, and I will continue to urge my \ncolleagues in the House to do the right thing and pass the \nstraightforward bill the Senate passed on September 27 that would get \nthe government back to work and get those employees back to their jobs.\n  It is great that the House passed a bill to pay them. That is a good \nthing. But now they are paying them to stay home. They are paying them \nto not do their job. They want to come back to work.\n  As you know, Madam President, we are now facing another critical \ndeadline--the deadline for paying our bills or facing default. Next \nThursday, on October 17, our country will hit its legal borrowing \nlimit, and when that happens we will be asked to do what Congress has \nroutinely done 70 times over the past 50 years; that is, pay our \ncountry's bills.\n  Let me be clear. This is about making good on commitments we have \nalready made. This is about doing what regular Americans do every month \nwhen they pay their credit card bills. Yet lately we have heard voices \nfrom the other side from a number of people who seem to think this is \njust no big deal.\n  Just the other day Republican Congressman Joe Barton of Texas said:\n\n       Some bills have to be paid and some bills we can defer and \n     only pay partially, but that doesn't mean that we have to pay \n     every bill the day it comes in.\n\n  Then there was Dan Mitchell, a senior fellow at the conservative Cato \nInstitute, who said:\n\n       There's no need to fret.\n\n  No need to fret? That is not what history teaches us.\n  As chair on the Senate side of the Joint Economic Committee, I had a \nhearing a few weeks ago about the cost of this brinkmanship, about what \nhappens if we go over that cliff, if we let our bills go, if we don't \npay them.\n  Let's turn back to 2011. We have a very clear lesson of what happens \nwhen the mere prospect of a default sent shock waves through our \neconomy. I recently released a report examining the fallout of that \nbrinkmanship. The results were ugly. The Dow Jones plummeted more than \n2,000 points, our credit rating was downgraded, and $2.4 trillion in \nAmerican household wealth was wiped away.\n  I think it is important for everyone to remember that in 2011 all of \nthis happened before we averted default. The Treasury Secretary sent a \nletter to Congress about the looming debt ceiling starting on January \n6, 2011. On May 2 he announced that the debt limit would be reached on \nAugust 2. That was the magic day. We now have people saying maybe it is \nnot October 17. They were saying that back then. But do you know what \nhappened in the lead-up to August 2? On July 14 Standard & Poor's \nwarned that it may downgrade the U.S. credit rating. They followed \nthrough on that. They downgraded it after the magic day of August 2, \nbut it was 2 weeks before that they warned they might do it. What \nhappened then? Well, over late July and early August, leading up to the \ndate, the Dow Jones dropped more than 2,000 points.\n  So the next time someone says there is no need to fret over playing \ngames with the debt ceiling, tell them to talk to the families whose \nretirement plans took a hit.\n  Make no mistake. This brinkmanship has very real consequences for our \neconomy. We can't afford to go down this path again because this time \naround the fall could be so much harder. Our Joint Economic Committee \nanalysis indicates that rates could rise on everything from credit \ncards and home mortgages to borrowing costs for businesses. At a time \nwhen our economy is finally turning a corner, this would put a real \nstrain on families and small business owners.\n  But don't take my word for it. Secretary Lew has said extraordinary \nmeasures will be exhausted by mid-October. Already our government is \nnot matching the retirement fund that Federal workers put in. Already \nthey are not issuing some of the municipal bonds. Already they are not \nmaking some of the typical investments they would normally make. The \nbusiness community and my friends on the other side of the aisle know \nbusinesses are overwhelmingly opposed to the idea of America not paying \nits bills, including key leaders such as Randall Stephenson, CEO of \nAT, who said:\n\n       It is unthinkable that the US could default, and it would \n     be the height of irresponsibility for a public official to \n     consider such a course.\n\n  Our country cannot afford to keep lurching from crisis to crisis. It \nis time for both parties to focus on real solutions and get the \ngovernment back to work in the short term so we can focus on \nresponsibly reducing our deficit in the long term. I supported the work \nof the Gang of 6, the work of the Gang of 8, the work that was being \ndone by the Domenici-Rivlin Commission, the work that was being done by \nthe debt commission. I was one of 14 Senators who pushed for that work \nto be done, and I think it is a great basis. I don't agree with \neverything in it, but it is a good start for how we can negotiate a \nmajor deal. We cannot do that in the next few days. We need time to do \nit, and that is why the Senate proposal is 6 weeks--6 weeks to allow \nthe government to open again so we can truly negotiate the kind of \nlong-term debt reduction deal that we should.\n  We need to be forward-looking. We need to be forward-looking enough \nto recognize the decisions we make today go far beyond the next \nelection cycle; they will be felt by generations to come. We have a \nresponsibility to get things right. We can't allow our country to go \nover the brink. It is not the American way.\n  In a 1987 address to the American people when he was talking about \nthe debt ceiling and the need to pay our country's bills, President \nRonald Reagan said:\n\n       The United States has a special responsibility to itself \n     and the world to meet its obligations. It means we have a \n     well-earned reputation for reliability and credibility--two \n     things that set us apart from much of the world.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to take these words seriously and to join me in \nensuring that Congress acts responsibly and in the best interest of \nthis country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that 10 minutes \nbe divided between myself and the senior Senator from Texas, Mr. \nCornyn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, not to object, I wish to clarify and \nask if we might expand that to indicate the order which I believe we \nagreed to on the floor; that I be allowed to speak after my two \ndistinguished colleagues, then Senator Whitehouse, and then Senator \nCoburn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator modify her request?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Absolutely, I modify the request to reflect what the \nsenior the Senator from Michigan said.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I think it is time for us to end this \ngovernment shutdown. I said on the floor twice last week, and prior to \nthat, that I didn't think the strategy of defunding ObamaCare was a \nstrategy which would be successful. While I support repealing and \nreplacing ObamaCare, because I have seen the negative impact in my own \nState of New Hampshire, we have already seen the government is shut \ndown and yet the ObamaCare exchanges have opened--showing already many \nof the problems with those exchanges, with the computer system, what \nare called glitches but are major flaws at this point. So it is time \nfor\n\n[[Page S7299]]\n\nboth sides to come together and resolve this on behalf of the American \npeople.\n  Let me say it is appalling that we have soldiers who have been killed \nin the line of duty and their families aren't receiving death benefits. \nIt is wrong. It is outrageous. We need to solve this right away and we \nneed to solve this overall government shutdown.\n  In New Hampshire, we have private campgrounds which contract with the \nWhite Mountain National Forest which are closed, despite the fact that \nthey actually bring revenue into the Treasury. They are run privately \nand actually make money for the Federal Government. I think the \nadministration is playing games with things like that, and they should \nopen those campgrounds. But ultimately we have to get this government \nopen.\n  I wish to praise my colleague, the senior Senator from Maine Senator \nCollins, who came to the floor earlier today with an idea she has drawn \nnot only from Members in this Chamber but in the House of \nRepresentatives of a way we could resolve this impasse, and that is \ntaking something we have already voted on in this Chamber on the budget \nresolution. There was a vote in this Chamber on the medical device tax \nrepeal, and that vote got on the budget resolution 79 to 20. We voted \non a bipartisan basis to repeal this tax. I have been against this tax \nsince I campaigned, because in New Hampshire we see the impact on our \ncompanies. It is going to increase health care costs. Many companies in \nNew Hampshire, such as Smiths Medical and Corflex, are negatively \nimpacted by this tax. Their workers are put in a difficult place when \nthese companies can't expand or they have to reduce their workforce \nbecause of this onerous tax--which, by the way, is a 2.3-percent tax on \nrevenue, a tax on innovation and new ideas in health care, rather than \na tax on profit. But ultimately we should repeal this tax. It is wrong.\n  I wish to support what my colleague from Maine came to the floor on \ntoday as something we should take up and discuss in this Chamber; that \nis, a repeal of the medical device tax with a pay-for, a CR proposed \nfor a longer period of time within the Budget Control Act numbers. She \nhas proposed 6 months, and flexibility for the agencies to address the \nsequester in a way that is best and most sensible for the American \npeople.\n  I thank my colleague from Maine. We can come together and resolve \nthis. I hope that along with Members on the other side of the aisle who \nvoted for the repeal, we can work together with Members of the House of \nRepresentatives, we can work this out, get the government open, and \nalso address concerns that we have with ObamaCare which is impacting an \nimportant industry, the medical device industry that provides \ninnovation and important lifesaving devices for people in this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, four times the House of Representatives \nhas sent over continuing resolutions with various additions for \nconsideration by the Senate. Each time Senator Reid and the majority \nparty have tabled those provisions, essentially shutting them down \nwithout giving them an opportunity for a vote on the merits.\n  The last time, though, I believe Senator Reid led his colleagues down \na very treacherous path, because the provisions of this otherwise clean \nCR would have repealed the provision that carves out Congress and \nmembers of our staff and gives us preferential treatment under \nObamaCare. The second part of it has to do with delaying penalties on \nindividuals, just as the President has unilaterally done in delaying \npenalties on employers.\n  There is no good reason for us not to pass both of those provisions. \nBut instead of trying to deal constructively with the House of \nRepresentatives--which has sent four separate bills over here on the \ncontinuing resolution--the majority leader has chosen to stiff-arm each \nof those efforts.\n  So when the majority leader comes to the floor and bemoans the \ngovernment shutdown--something we all agree we should try our best to \navoid--he claims they are willing to negotiate and the President is \nwilling to negotiate a change in the outcome. But we know that is not \ntrue. We know each time they have shut out Republican proposals from \nthe House of Representatives which would open the Federal Government \nwith reasonable bipartisan agreements.\n  But what really is beyond belief is when I hear our colleagues come \nto the floor and they say, Why can't we have cancer research for \nchildren at NIH continue? Yet we come to the floor and offer bills \nwhich would open funding at the National Institutes of Health, that \nvery same cancer research, and they are objected to by the Democratic \nside of the aisle. I don't know any other word to describe it than \nhypocrisy.\n  This morning, the Washington Post talks about the case of Michelle \nLangbehn from California, who was diagnosed with sarcoma and is unable \nto have an opportunity to participate in a clinical trial at NIH. This \nis the very same sort of program which would have been funded by the \nbill we offered on this side of the aisle and was objected to by the \nmajority leader and the Democratic side.\n  There is one bright spot of agreement, and that is we were able to \nagree unanimously to pass the House bill that funded our troops which \npassed the House 423 to 0. That is the good news. But the bad news is \nthis has now all morphed into a debate not only on the continuing \nresolution but on the debt ceiling. What the majority leader and his \nside of the aisle are apparently proposing is that without making any \narrangements whatsoever to pay for the $17 trillion in debt that has \nalready been accumulated, they want another clean debt ceiling \nincrease, and the President says he won't negotiate, but in all \nlikelihood we will be voting later this week on another $1 trillion \nadded to our maxed-out credit card without doing anything whatsoever to \ntake care of the debt which has already been incurred.\n  That is fundamentally irresponsible. That is not me saying it. The \nAmerican people have said this. The Congressional Budget Office has \nsaid this. The President's own bipartisan fiscal commission has said \nthat.\n  In a recent poll from NBC-Wall Street Journal, when people were given \nthe choice between raising the debt ceiling or not raising the debt \nceiling, 44 percent said don't raise the debt ceiling, 22 percent said \nraise the debt ceiling. I realize we have more choices than that. There \ncould be, coupled together with the raising of the debt ceiling, some \nreal reforms of our broken entitlement programs to shore up Social \nSecurity and Medicare. But our colleagues and the President himself \nhave said, No, I am not going to negotiate. No, I want a clean debt \nceiling. No, I want the freedom to max out the credit card another $1 \ntrillion, without doing anything to pay off the debt that threatens not \nonly our future prosperity, but our national security.\n  I remember very clearly when ADM Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, was asked what the greatest national security threat \nto the United States was, and he said the national debt.\n  Why would our colleagues and the President of the United States \nignore what the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff called the most \nsignificant national security threat to our country by saying, We are \nnot interested in any reforms, we are not interested in anything that \nwould actually pay down the debt and remove that threat to our national \nsecurity and our future prosperity? Why would they say, No, we want to \nkeep on spending money--money we don't actually have--and continue to \nborrow from our creditors like China and other foreign countries that \nhold a majority of our national debt? And when interest rates start to \ntick back up again as the Federal Reserve begins to taper its purchase \nof our own debt, we are going to see more and more of our national \nexpenditures go to pay interest on that debt, crowding out not only \nnational security but the safety net programs for the most vulnerable \npeople in our country.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, first I apologize for the hoarse \nvoice. I have been recovering from a cold. But it is important for me \nto have the opportunity to speak on behalf of the people from Michigan \nabout what is happening, as everyone at home is scratching their head \ntrying to figure\n\n[[Page S7300]]\n\nout why, in the greatest country in the world, we have seen government \nservices now shut down and why there are those who think it is all \nright for us not to pay our bills and default on the full faith and \ncredit of the United States of America, and why folks aren't willing to \njust open the government, pay our bills, and then negotiate.\n  In fact, we have been negotiating. We have negotiated on a lot. I am \nproud to say we negotiated a successful bipartisan farm bill not that \nlong ago, a real deficit reduction proposal which actually passed the \nSenate with over a two-thirds vote. So we certainly are willing to \nnegotiate.\n  Our leader Senator Reid was willing to negotiate and in fact did \nnegotiate with the Speaker of the House. As we all know, the Speaker \ncalled him in September and indicated he would like to see a 6-week \nextension of the current funding levels for the government while we \nwere negotiating something more broadly on a budget. It was at a \nfunding level which we don't believe is the right one in terms of \ninvesting in education, innovation, and creating jobs, but it was 6 \nweeks. After talking with us, our leader said that in the interest of \nnegotiating and compromising, we would be willing to do that.\n  As we know now from Republican colleagues in the House who said that \nwas the intent, unfortunately the Speaker could not follow through on \nthe agreement he had negotiated.\n  That is because a minority of the minority in the House that is \nextremely intent on--and in fact has successfully achieved one of the \ngoals they ran on--shutting down the government. But we have \nnegotiated.\n  We also have negotiated on the big picture. We know that a few years \nago with the Bowles-Simpson Commission, with others, that $4 trillion \nin deficit reduction over 10 years was picked as an important goal to \nbe able to rightsize and bring down our long-term debt. The good news \nis that not only have we cut the annual deficit in half, but of that $4 \ntrillion we have already agreed to $2.5 trillion of that in deficit \nreduction over the next 10 years. So over half of that has already been \nachieved.\n  When my friends on the other side of the aisle act as if nothing is \nhappening, I have to say the deficit has been cut in half and, second, \nover half of a long-term goal on the debt has been achieved. We need to \nkeep going. We don't need to shut down the government to do that. We do \nnot need to default on our debts as the greatest country in the world \nto do that. We just need to work together to do that. That is why we \nwould say we need to open the government, pay our bills, and continue \nto negotiate. Let's negotiate, but it is a continuation of negotiating.\n  In fact, weakening the full faith and credit of the United States of \nAmerica--think of that, the greatest country in the world, the full \nfaith and credit of the United States of America, that has been the \nhighest standard in the world, when you say the full faith and credit \nof the United States of America--right now there are folks playing \nRussian roulette with that who are willing to weaken that and undermine \nour recovery, if not take us over another horrible economic cliff and \ncost billions of dollars for American consumers.\n  Given the seriousness of it and the fact that we are very close to \nhaving that happen and the fact that we are the world's leader, 30 \nyears ago President Ronald Reagan warned about the consequences of the \nrichest, most powerful nation in the world suddenly running out of \nmoney to pay its bills. He said:\n\n       The full consequences of a default--or even the serious \n     prospect of a default--\n\n  As people are flippantly discussing these days--\n\n     by the United States of America are impossible to predict and \n     awesome to contemplate.\n       Denigration of the full faith and credit of the United \n     States of America [would cause] incalculable damage.\n\n  This is President Ronald Reagan.\n  President Reagan reminded Congress:\n\n       Never before in our history has the Federal Government \n     failed to honor its financial obligations. To fail to do so \n     now would be an outrage.\n\n  His words.\n\n       The Congress must understand this and bear full \n     responsibility.\n\n  We know if the United States defaults on its obligations, if we don't \npay our bills, the result will be a financial crisis worse than what we \nwent through in 2008. Frankly, I don't want any part of that. I know \nwhat happened in Michigan in 2008, 2009. I know our Presiding Officer, \nthe distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, understands that as well, \nwhat happened to families and businesses all across America. To even \ncome close to that is irresponsible.\n  If that were to happen, 57.5 million Americans could very well not \nget their Social Security checks on time.\n  My mom called me the other night. She is 87 years old, doing great. \nShe said I was at church on Sunday and my friends were asking: That \ncouldn't really happen, could it?\n  I didn't know what to tell her. No, Mom, it should not happen. It has \nnot happened before. But I can't promise, given the words of people on \nthe other side of the aisle who believe it is no big deal or of what is \nbeing said by the Speaker and by the tea party Republicans in the \nHouse--I couldn't absolutely say to her don't worry about that.\n  Madam President, 3.4 million veterans might not get their disability \nbenefits on time. We have just been debating whether we should make \nsure, as we must, that the VA is fully funded. Yet next week if we do \nnot back up the full faith and credit of the United States of America, \nveterans could very easily be in a situation of not getting disability \nchecks or seniors' Social Security, Medicare. Children, families, \ncommunities, businesses, farmers, that is who will pay the cost of this \ndefault. Middle-class families will pay the cost of this.\n  It will be catastrophic in terms of interest rate increases and loss \nof jobs if we do not stand together as Republicans and Democrats in the \nCongress of the United States and back up the full faith and credit of \nthe United States of America.\n  According to Goldman Sachs, if we adopt the ``China first'' model of \nonly paying the interest on our debt, which has been proposed by the \nHouse, where we pay some of our debts but not others, the drag on our \neconomy would be massive. They estimate we would lose 4.2 percent of \nour gross domestic product. To put that in perspective, when the \nrecession hit bottom in 2009 we lost 4.1 percent of GDP, from the peak \nin 2007. That was the worst recession in our lifetime.\n  This is not a game. This is serious.\n  Even more concerning to me is that this would drive up borrowing \ncosts for families, for small businesses, for our manufacturers who are \nback on their feet now and roaring and bringing back our economy. For \nevery 1-percent increase in interest rates, we are told Americans will \npay $75 billion--$75 billion lost to the economy. When Republicans in \nthe House took us to the brink of default 2 years ago, which resulted \nin the lowering of America's credit rating for the first time in \nhistory--even though we didn't default, just talk of default ended up \nlowering our credit rating for the first time in America's history--it \ncost the average family buying a home at the time about $100 every \nmonth for the life of their mortgage in higher interest rates; $100 a \nmonth for the life of the mortgage. That is outrageous and \nirresponsible.\n  That same default crisis in 2011 cost taxpayers $19 billion in \nadditional interest when our credit rating fell and interest rates went \nup. Where did that $19 billion go? Right back on top of the national \ndebt, not only adding to the national debt, it threatens to erase \nAmerica's retirement savings. In 2011, over $800 billion was lost in \nretirement accounts after the House Republicans played politics with \nthe full faith and credit of the United States of America.\n  If I might just take 1 more minute, I ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. This time, if we actually default, the fall could be \neven worse and the damage could be permanent. This is the greatest, \nwealthiest, most powerful country in the world and it is outrageous \nthat this would even be considered.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe National Association of Manufacturers, expressing their deep \nconcern about the possibility of default.\n\n[[Page S7301]]\n\n  I will share, finally, remarks of the chairman of AT\n\n       It is unthinkable that the United States could default on \n     its financial commitments and it would be the height of \n     irresponsibility for any public official to consider such a \n     course.\n\n  Our country deserves better. The people of this country deserve \nbetter. We have to do better for them.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                                Manufacturers,\n\n                                                  October 8, 2013.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President, Speaker Boehner and Leaders Pelosi, \n     Reid and McConnell: On behalf of the National Association of \n     Manufacturers (NAM)--the largest manufacturing association in \n     the United States, representing small and large manufacturers \n     in every industrial sector and in all 50 states--I write to \n     strongly urge you to act as soon as possible to raise the \n     statutory debt limit.\n       The failure of policymakers to address this critical issue \n     is injecting uncertainty in the U.S. economy, hampering the \n     ability of manufacturers and the broader business community \n     to compete, invest and create new jobs. In a recent survey of \n     NAM members, almost two-thirds of respondents said it is \n     extremely important for the President and Congress to make \n     progress on funding the government for fiscal year 2014 and \n     extending the nation's debt ceiling. More than 90 percent \n     said that addressing the nation's fiscal challenges was \n     important for their company.\n       Manufacturers believe the United States must meet our \n     financial obligations to ensure global investors' continuing \n     confidence in the nation's creditworthiness. Our nation has \n     never defaulted in the past, and failing to raise the debt \n     limit in a timely fashion will seriously disrupt our fragile \n     economy and have a ripple effect throughout the world. In \n     particular, a default would put upward pressure on interest \n     rates, raising both the short- and long-term cost of capital \n     and discouraging business investment and job creation. In \n     addition, a default would create an uncertain fiscal \n     environment that will discourage foreign direct investment in \n     the United States that could harm our economy for years to \n     come.\n       Our nation's economic future depends on your actions. Now \n     is the time to rise above partisan differences and put the \n     nation's best interests first by addressing the debt limit. \n     Thank you in advance for the leadership that will be \n     necessary to appropriately resolve this critical issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Jay Timmons.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am glad to join this debate, which \nthroughout the afternoon has been peppered with the assertion that \neither Majority Leader Reid or the President or Democrats in general \nwill not negotiate--that we will not negotiate. I remember when I was \nyounger there was a radio commentator, a man named Paul Harvey, and his \nlittle motto in his radio bits was to surprise you with ``the rest of \nthe story.''\n  On ``will not negotiate,'' we don't even have to go to the rest of \nthe story. Go to the rest of the sentence. The rest of the sentence is \nthat the President and the majority leader will not negotiate--while \nthe other side is holding hostages, while the tea party is holding \nhostages.\n  Here is what our former colleague, my former ranking member on the \nBudget Committee, Senator Judd Gregg, has said about this:\n\n       A small group of Republican legislators led by the junior \n     Senator from Texas, decided to take as hostages government \n     operations and the raising of the debt ceiling.\n\n  Those are exactly the hostages, Federal employees who cannot work, \npeople and businesses that want or need Federal services, those \nfamilies we have heard so much about today who lost loved ones on the \nfield of battle and cannot get their death benefits.\n  There is an even bigger hostage out there, which is the threat of a \ncatastrophic default which would be the result of a failure to lift the \ndebt limit. Our country has been through a lot, through Civil Wars and \nworld wars, through depressions and calamities of various kinds. \nThrough all of that we have never defaulted on our debt. But there is a \ngroup in Congress so desperate that they are willing to use that, that \nthreat as a hostage for leverage in negotiations.\n  When colleagues on the other side invite us in the old phrase, \n``Come, let us reason together,'' let us negotiate, they do not mean \ncome let us reason together, let us negotiate; they mean let us \nnegotiate, but we want a blackjack in our pocket. If the negotiations \ndon't go just the way we want, we want to keep hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans out of their jobs and we want to threaten the economic \nsecurity of this country.\n  There is a difference that every American understands between \nnegotiating and negotiating while threatening the hostages. I will say \nthat sanctimoniously offering to release a hostage here or a hostage \nthere when a program becomes too popular or there is too much scrutiny \non the damage that one thing is doing, to say, oh, we will give up that \nhostage, we will let us vote on that hostage, doesn't change the \nprinciple. There is a difference between negotiating in good faith, \nnegotiating on the merits, and negotiating with threats to hostages. \nThat is no road to go down. That is a very dangerous threat.\n  As President Reagan warned us:\n\n       Congress must realize that by failing to act they are \n     entering very dangerous territory if we don't raise the debt \n     limit. Never before in our history has the Federal Government \n     failed to honor its financial obligations. Too fail to do so \n     now would be an outrage.\n\n  Ronald Reagan:\n\n       The Congress must understand this and bear full \n     responsibility.\n\n  We have to address these problems in the traditional order of \ngovernment with real negotiations because if we don't, if we yield to \nhostage-taking as the new way of governance in this country, where does \nit end? The continuing resolution that we proposed that the Speaker has \nrefused to have a vote on--in all this time he has never had a vote on \nthe continuing resolution that we passed that would open the \ngovernment--it would only extend the operations of government for 6 \nweeks. We would be back at it again. What would the price be next time? \nAfter we defunded ObamaCare, would they want to privatize Social \nSecurity? They tried that before. Over and over, the popular will has \nto rule. That we do through our American procedures. The vaunted \nprocedures of our American system of government would be lost in a \ndevil's game of threats and hostage-taking on both sides because two \ncan play at this game if those are the new rules. We don't want to go \nthere.\n  America is a great country and in part we are a great country because \nour democracy is an example to the world. We are no example to anyone \nwhen we legislate by threats of default, disaster, and confusion, to \nuse the felicitous phrase of our colleague from Alabama.\n\n  There is a condition that sometimes befalls pilots called target \nfixation. It happens when a pilot diving on a target becomes so fixated \non hitting that target that they become disoriented with their \nsurroundings. The worst thing that befalls somebody who has target \nfixation is that they crash the plane.\n  Right now we have Republican target fixation on repeal ObamaCare. \nImagine passing it 40-some times in the House, which they have done. If \nthat is not a sign of target fixation, I don't know what is. Not seeing \nthe damage that is being done by closing down the government, not \nseeing the damage to families, not seeing the damage to employees, not \nseeing the damage to people who depend on government services and \nlicenses and safety checks seems to me to be a sign of target fixation.\n  If they have target fixation this badly, they may not even see \nPresident Ronald Reagan's warnings of how dire and dangerous it is to \nplay around with our debt limit. On the House side, they are already \ntalking about playing around with our debt limit. They want to go into \nthe danger zone, and who knows how close to the flame they are willing \nto fly. When they have target fixation, their judgment is not very \ngood.\n  They are certainly not seeing the damage to American values and \nAmerican procedure that an insistence on\n\n[[Page S7302]]\n\nlegislating by holding hostages and threatening them does. It does \ndamage to our values, and it does damage to our procedures.\n  A great observer of the American system of government once described \nprocedure as its bone structure. We can throw it all out, the \nConstitution, the bicameralism, and we can go back to the basic animal \nstate that whoever can make the worst threat wins the argument. That is \nnot the American way. The American way isn't to win the argument by \nseeing how many people you can put at risk and how badly you can \nthreaten them, but that is the stage we are in right now.\n  Let's negotiate, indeed, but let's negotiate as Americans. Let's \nnegotiate under our proper procedures. Let's open the government. There \nis no reason for it to be closed other than bargaining leverage and \nhostage-taking. There is no other reason. That is exactly why the tea \nparty has shut down the government, just for that purpose. They say it. \nThey use nicer words. I think the word that was used earlier in debate \ntoday was to create adequate incentive. When somebody else is holding \nhostages, we have incentive, but it is not an appropriate incentive.\n  So open the government and stop threatening the debt limit. That is \nwildly irresponsible. If they don't believe us, believe Ronald Reagan, \nbelieve the Secretary of the Treasury, believe the National Association \nof Manufacturers, believe the CEO of AT, believe virtually every \nresponsible, knowledgeable adult who has observed what the dangers are \nof blowing the debt limit and default.\n  Open the government, stop threatening the debt limit and, by all \nmeans, let's negotiate. We could set a date tomorrow. I am sure the \nPresident would have a meeting at the White House the next day. \nAnything people wanted could be on the table, but they would have to \ncome in and negotiate like Americans. They would have to negotiate on \nthe merits fairly and not with a blackjack in their back pocket, with \nthreats that if they don't get what they want, they are going to start \nwrecking things such as our economy and our government. That is not the \nright way to proceed. If we go down that road, who knows what evil \nlurks at the end.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I have listened very carefully to the \ntwo previous speakers on the floor, and I understand a lot of their \nfrustration. We are where we are.\n  I think we have two big problems. Actually, we have two major \nproblems. One is our country is bankrupt. People don't like to hear \nthat, but let me give the facts. The total unfunded liability of the \nUnited States of America is $126 trillion. If we add all the net worth \nof everybody in the country and all the assets of the Federal \nGovernment and all the assets of the States and combine them, we have \n$94 trillion worth of assets. We are already in the hole $30 trillion. \nThat doesn't include the $17 trillion in debt we have.\n  So I would like to correct a couple of things. One, the Senator from \nMichigan mentioned that we were downgraded because of the impasse in \nCongress. No, we were downgraded because Congress has failed to address \nthe real problems of our debt and deficits. Go read their statements. \nIt had nothing to do with action here. It had to do with the fact that \nwe will not address the biggest problems in front of us.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have some scissors on the floor because I \nwish to make a point in a minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. We have a credit card. I want you to think about your own \npersonal life that if, in fact, you have a limit on your credit card \nand your financial situation worsens, you are still paying the \npayments, but you are not bringing down the principal on your credit \ncards and you are not earning significantly more money and you go to \nCitibank or American Express or Chase and say: I want you to raise my \nlimit. The first thing they are going to ask you is: What have you done \nto improve your financial situation so we might consider raising your \ncredit limit? That is what happens to every other American.\n  We have this big talk about a debt limit. There is no debt limit in \nthis country. We have increased it every time it has come up. There is \nno limit right now in this country on the debt we have.\n  We hear all of these speeches about the risk. You know what the real \nrisk is? The risk is continuing to do nothing to address the underlying \nproblems of our country. The risk is continuing to add entitlement \nprograms that have no way to pay for themselves and no reform of the \nentitlements we have today. That is the risk.\n  How does that play out? We have heard all of these dire warnings of \nwhat will happen. What is going to happen to your children and \ngrandchildren is what has happened over the last 15 years in this \ncountry. Do you realize that the average median income in real dollars \nnow is at the same level it was in 1989? We are going backward right \nnow. We are not addressing the real problems.\n  Since I am a doctor, I will put it in medical terms. If, in fact, you \ntreat symptoms of disease by raising the debt limit rather than \ntreating the real disease, which is reforming the problems, reforming \nour spending, quit having 100 percent involvement by the Federal \nGovernment in everything Americans do, if you continue to borrow the \nmoney and treat that as the symptom, when there is a lack of oversight \nby Congress and lack of real work by the Members of this body to \nactually eliminate waste, which is over $250 billion a year as outlined \nby the Government Accountability Office, we ignore that for the \npolitical arena we have seen over the last couple of weeks in \nWashington.\n  The real disease is not fixing the real problem. All of the \npoliticians--Republicans and Democrats alike--want to give you a soft \nanswer. Here is the answer: If you are $30 trillion in debt that you \ncannot pay for, what you have to do is have everybody have some pain, \nbut we refuse to do that. There is no leadership in Congress to address \nthe real disease we are facing. This is a government that has totally \nignored the enumerated powers, totally ignored the 10th Amendment. We \nhave a Justice Department that ignores the rule of law in terms of how \nthey decide what they will enforce and what they will not enforce on a \npolitical basis rather than on what the law says. Those are the real \nproblems in front of us.\n  We have heard all the dire warnings about how we cannot raise the \ndebt limit. What does default mean? They always say we can't raise the \ndebt limit, but they will not talk about what default means. Default in \nthe international financial community means you will not pay the \ninterest and you will not pay back the principal on your bonds. That \nwill never happen to us. It would require less than 6 percent of the \ncash we are taking in now to manage the debt we have right now--less \nthan 6 percent.\n  So only somebody who wants to hurt us further would play the \npolitical game if we ever got there. I am not saying we should get \nthere, but if we got there, it would only be to play the political game \nto not pay Social Security or not to pay Medicare. We have more than \nenough money to do that. But what we have is a bloated, oversized, \ninefficient, ineffective Federal Government that nobody wants to hold \naccountable except the American people.\n  So the question is, Who gets to decide? Congress obviously is not \ndeciding very well. The President has not shown any leadership. Maybe \nit is time for the American people to decide. Maybe it is time to take \nsome of the power away from Washington and restore it to where our \nFounders thought it should reside: by respecting the enumerated powers \nvery specifically listed by our Founders with great commentary so it \nwould not be distorted, but we have distorted it anyway. We need to \nreembrace the 10th Amendment which says: Everything that is not \nspecifically enumerated in these powers is left to the power of the \npeople and the States.\n  We find ourselves with a credit card. This happens to be our debt. \nThe number I chose to put on here was our debt this morning: \n$16,747,458,528.90. We need to cut this up just like we would do for an \nadolescent or young adult kid when you are responsible for their credit\n\n[[Page S7303]]\n\ncard. If they are not responsible, you cut up the credit card. You fix \nthe real problem. You don't continue to ask for an increase in their \npropagate spending.\n  Members of Congress who will not do oversight and get rid of $250 \ntrillion of fraud, waste, and abuse every year should not be rewarded, \nbut that is what we will end up doing because we don't have the \ncourage, nor the leadership, to address the real problem in front of \nour country. The real problem is cowardice. The real problem is to not \nrecognize where we are and not act on making decisive decisions.\n  We heard how bad it will be if we don't raise the debt limit. I \nagree, it will be tough. There will be ramifications. How bad will it \nbe if we do? What happens to your children? What happens to the \ndeclining family income in this country if we continue to let the \nFederal Government run uncontrolled and out of control? What happens if \nwe continue to not hold Congress accountable for forcing efficiencies \non the Federal Government.\n  I know what could be done. There was an agreement called the Budget \nControl Act, and what it did is it forced sequester. Sequester is a \nstupid way to cut funding in the Federal Government, but it is far \nbetter than not cutting it at all.\n  What has the sequester done? The sequester has forced agencies--\nbecause Congress will not force them because we are afraid we might \noffend somebody--to start making choices. They are still making tons of \nbad choices. For instance, on the last day of the State Department's \nbudget, they spent all the remaining money. They just spent $5 million \nfor new crystalware for all of our embassies. Do we have $5 million? \nWhat is wrong with the crystalware we have now? They had to spend the \nmoney because they couldn't come back to Congress and say we saved $5 \nmillion.\n  We are addressing the wrong problems. We are not holding people \naccountable. Consequently, maybe it is time for the States and the \npeople to exert some common sense on us. I dare say there is not one \nMember of this body who would let their adolescent child run up a bill \nand then not eventually try to intercede on a credit card but just let \nthem continue to run it up.\n  Congress and the U.S. Government is that adolescent child. We are the \nadolescents and the people and the States are the grownups. We are at \nan impasse, and it does kind of sound like a kid. I am not going to \ntalk to you. I don't like the way you did that.\n  We had the majority leader the other day claim that the House was out \nof bounds because they got to pick and choose what we pay for. It just \nso happens that in the Constitution, that is what it says. The House of \nRepresentatives gets to pick and choose. All spending bills start in \nthe House. They have to start in the House. They get to pick and \nchoose. We don't have to accept it, but they get to pick and choose. So \nthere is a lack of understanding on the basic concepts our Founders set \nup.\n  We know the history and they know the history of republics. Republics \nalways die. There isn't one that has survived as long as we have. They \ndecline and die over the same thing: They get in trouble financially.\n  We are in trouble financially. We are $30 trillion in the hole, plus \nanother $17 trillion in debt. Wouldn't it be smart if we started \naddressing that problem before we blankly allow an increase in the \nlevel of the credit card? Actually, what we should do is cut this \ncredit card up, which is what I am going to do because that is the way \nI vote. I think it is time we quit borrowing money--actually, I think I \nbetter tear it up--it is time we quit borrowing money for the future of \nour kids. It is time we quit mortgaging their future. It is time we \nstart taking responsibility for the actions of the Federal Government \nrather than giving excuses on why we can't get together and address the \nreal problems of this country. Congress fails to do the oversight.\n  We just had a hearing yesterday where we showed one of the problems \ninside the Social Security and disability system. It was a bipartisan \nhearing, with lots of work done. There are real problems. The trust \nfund for those people who are truly disabled in this country will run \nout of money within 18 to 24 months. The Finance Committee hasn't \noffered any bill to fix it. The House Committee on Ways and Means \nhasn't offered any programs to fix it. Yet it is going to be bankrupt. \nWhat does that mean for somebody who is truly disabled? It means their \ncheck is going to get cut. Now tell me whether we would rather spend $5 \nmillion on new glassware for our embassies--crystal--or $5 million for \nsomeone who is truly disabled. That is where the real decisions need to \nbe made, but we won't make them.\n  If we talk about our national debt--when I came to the Senate in 2005 \nevery American owed $24,000 on the national debt. It is now almost \n$53,000--in a little over 8\\1/2\\ years. So we now owe 2\\1/2\\ times what \nwe used to owe. How did we get there? Why did we let that happen? Why \ndon't we learn to live within our means? Is there always a political \nreason? Is there always a reason where we can game somebody and say \nthey don't care if they don't want to do this? They certainly couldn't \ncare about Americans if they want to spend money we don't have on \nthings we don't need.\n  If we look at the $125.8 trillion, that works out to $1.1 million per \nfamily. Think about that. That is our unfunded liabilities, and that is \ngoing to come due over the next 50 years. If a person has children or \ngrandchildren, as I do, I really don't want their opportunities to be \ntotally limited by this debt load we have.\n  So we have all of this politicking and posturing and political \nexpediency going on in both bodies, and nobody is talking about what \nthe real problem is. The real problem is we are spending a lot of money \nwe don't have, and we are borrowing from other countries for things we \ndon't absolutely need.\n  The second part of the problem is we have programs that are designed \nto benefit people which are riddled with waste and fraud--$100 million \nin Medicaid and Medicare. Nobody really questions that number. It has \nbeen authenticated by four separate studies outside of the government, \nand inside the government we say it is $80 million. Why would we \ncontinue to let a system run that has that kind of fraud in it?\n  We are getting ready to crank up the Affordable Care Act--we are \ncranking it up--and we have now said we are not going to authenticate \nsomebody's reliability as to their income? What do we think the fraud \nrate on that is going to be? We know what the fraud rate is with the \nchild tax credit. It is well over 20 percent. In the earned-income tax \ncredit, we know it is well over 20 percent. So $1 out of every $5 we \npay out is to people who don't deserve it. We are going to see the same \nthing with this. Why would we do that when we have this kind of problem \nin front of us?\n  In the last 2 years our debt limit has increased twice what our \neconomy has grown. For every dollar of new debt we take in, we are \ngetting about 2 or 3 cents of economic growth out of that new debt. It \nused to be that when America borrowed a dollar, it would get 35 or 40 \ncents of growth out of that debt. So in the last 2 years we have \nincreased the debt limit $2.405 trillion and the economy has grown less \nthan $1.2 trillion over the last 2 years.\n  We are adding $26,000 to our national debt every second--every \nsecond. There is no question that our economy is growing some--some--\nfar less than marginal. Why isn't it growing? It isn't growing because \nthe American people don't have confidence in the future. How do we \nrestore confidence in the future? We restore confidence by modeling a \nbehavior that says we are going to act responsibly with our future, \nwhich means we are going to make the hard choices, even if it costs us \nour political career, to solve the problems in Washington so the \ngenerations that follow us will not suffer a lower standard of living \nbut also so we can instill confidence in the American economy.\n  There is $3 trillion in cash sitting in this country right now--not \nFederal Government money, private money--$3 trillion. Why is it sitting \nthere and why is it not being invested? That $3 trillion would create \n700,000 or 800,000 new jobs a year--that $3 trillion. Why is it not \nbeing used? Because people don't have confidence in the future.\n  I want to tell a story about Virgil Jurgensmeyer. Virgil grows \nmushrooms and other vegetables in a business. This past August he told \nme he was thinking about expanding his business, a $5 million \nexpansion, adding a\n\n[[Page S7304]]\n\ncouple hundred jobs in a very small town in northeastern Oklahoma. He \nwas afraid to do that. He has plenty of business. He is buying $50,000 \nto $100,000 of product from his competitor every month because he can't \nproduce it. He says: I don't think it is worth the risk right now given \nwhere our country is. That is happening all across this country. There \nis no confidence.\n\n  It brings me to another point I wish to speak about. We are not just \nbankrupt as a nation. Our leadership is bankrupt. Leadership is about \ncreating a vision and bringing people together, not creating \ncontroversy and dividing people. It is not about pointing out the worst \nflaws of somebody. It is about reinforcing the best flaws. It is about \nselling the confidence that we can do this together.\n  Do my colleagues realize we can do this together as a nation? There \nisn't a problem in front of us that we can't solve if we choose to \nsolve it. Do my colleagues remember the debt commission? I was a member \nof that committee. We voted on some big plans that would have solved a \nlot of the problems we are facing this very week in this body. I didn't \nlike every bit of it, but it was a chance to try to solve--bring \ntogether both sides and solve it. Not once was it taken up on the floor \nby the majority leader. The President never embraced it--his own \ncommission, his own fiscal commission--never embraced it. It was the \ngreatest failure of leadership I have ever seen. We had conservatives \nand liberals agreeing that here is a plan we can work out. Yet it was \nthrown away.\n  With the politics we see in Washington today, the only time we are \ngoing to solve these big problems is when both political parties take \nthe pain evenly. Nobody wants to do that. Everybody wants to win. It is \nall short-term political expediency.\n  In the words of my friend Erskine Bowles, where we are today is the \nmost easily predictable problem we ever would have seen. All we have to \ndo is look at the path of the numbers. It is true that our deficits are \ndown a little bit, that we raised $70 billion in taxes last year, and \nthe economy is growing. It just shows what potential there is if we \nwould put the economy on steam, where we had confidence. We could have \nhad $500 billion, $600 billion a year in revenues to the Federal \nGovernment. But we won't do that.\n  Today we find ourselves in worse condition than we were in 2011, and \nin 2011 we were told we can't do big things. We have to wait.\n  So we had a debt limit increase. So tell me how we have gotten better \nsince then. We have unfunded liabilities that are growing faster every \nyear. Our true debt-to-GDP ratio is now over 100 percent, counting all \ndebt, internal and external. We have not done it.\n  Hundreds of thousands of Federal workers right now are furloughed \nbecause Congress--not Republicans, Congress--has failed to do its job, \nhas failed to compromise, has failed to reach a meaningful agreement \nthat gives both groups something they can claim they actually worked on \nthe real disease.\n  Madam President, how much time have I consumed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 23 minutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will finish. Would the Chair let me know in about 28 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Let me describe also what is going to happen in about 20 \nyears, maybe 10. If we don't address these problems, it won't matter \nwhat the debt rating agencies say; we will have developed a pattern \nthat says we think we can continue to borrow and continue to raise the \ndebt limit and not make the structural changes that put us on a path to \nsolvency. So what does that look like? What that looks like is \nborrowing costs going up.\n  My friends all say--and the President said today--maybe our borrowing \ncosts will go up if we don't, in fact, raise the debt limit. Guess \nwhat. Our borrowing costs are going up every day we don't address these \nproblems whether we address the debt limit or not because eventually \nthe rest of the world is going to say: We don't think they are willing \nto cut up the credit card. They are not willing to make the sacrifices \nnecessary to put their country on a path of prosperity.\n  We have all the capabilities in the world to address our problems. We \ndo not have the leadership that will get us there. I am not just \ndirecting that at the President; I am directing that at my own party.\n  So what is the solution?\n  I am going to spend the next couple days outlining waste in the \nFederal Government, fraud in the Federal Government, duplication in the \nFederal Government. But the solution is called sacrificial leadership. \nIt means modeling the behavior that says you are willing to give up \nsomething--maybe the prestige of being in office--to actually fix the \nlong-term problems of our country. It is leadership that calls out the \nbest in us instead of pointing out the worst in us. You do not see that \nvery often here. You did when I first came. You certainly do not now, \nand that is a function of leadership in the Senate.\n  Majority Leader Reid and I do not agree on much. That is obvious. But \nin a previous discussion on the Senate floor, Leader Reid said: \n``Meaningful deficit reduction requires shared sacrifice.'' We are \nnever going to get there unless everybody shares in it.\n  The other point I would make is that we are living off the next \ngeneration right now. We are going to borrow $2,000 against the future \nof every man, woman, and child in this country this year alone. They \nare going to have to pay it back. Another way of putting it is that 1 \nout of every 4 hours you work, the Federal Government right now is \nconfiscating--of everybody in our economy. It is soon going to be 2 out \nof every 4 hours you work.\n  Our country was founded on the idea of liberty and freedom. When the \nconfiscatory rates that will have to be there to pay back our debt or \nto at least borrow more money come, half of your work is going to be \nfor the Federal Government--not your State or local governments; it is \ngoing to be to pay the bills of the Federal Government. So money that \nis going to go for interest is money that is not going to be invested. \nIt is money that is not going to improve education. It is not going to \ninvent the new technology.\n  So I believe we can solve our problems, but I think it requires an \ninformed public. Do you realize the Federal Government is twice the \nsize it was in 1999? It is twice that size. It is two times as big as \nit was in 1999. Think about that for a minute. If you extrapolate that, \nthat means in another 12, 13 years, it is going to be four times as big \nas it was in 1999. The question comes: Are you getting value? Is it \nefficient? It is productive? Is it what we want to do?\n  I think we can cheat history as a republic. As a constitutional \nrepublic, I think we can cheat history. I do not think we have to go \ndown the path every other republic has gone down, but it is going to \nrequire real leadership and shared sacrifice on the part of everybody \nin this country. It is going to require that we take the spending out \nof the Tax Code for the well-heeled who have placed special benefits in \nthe Tax Code for themselves. It is going to require that we reform \nMedicare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 28 minutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  It is going to require that we reform Medicare, that we fix Medicaid, \nthat we control how the Federal Government buys and uses things. It is \ngoing to require us to eliminate multitudes of duplicative programs \nthat have no real benefit other than to benefit the politicians. It is \ngoing to require shared sacrifice.\n  So we can go down that path, unite our country, bring us together \nwith a vision that through this, together we can all accomplish what is \nneeded for our children and grandchildren or we can continue this petty \nlittle kindergarten game that is going on in Washington right now where \neverybody's nose gets bent out of shape, saying they are right or they \nare right, and playing off the American people.\n  None of us in Washington are right. The Founders were right. The \nenumerated powers were right. The 10th Amendment was right. We are dead \nwrong. It is time we grow up and start understanding the vision of our \nFounders that secures our liberty and preserves our future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n[[Page S7305]]\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, before he leaves the floor, I want to \nthank the Senator from Oklahoma for his commitment to this issue, for \nhis candor. We do not necessarily agree on every single thing, but I do \nknow he is a man of great conviction and we are lucky to have him in \nthe Senate. It is my hope we can get to a place where we actually are \ntogether addressing these budget issues in a way that is not management \nby crisis or one across-the-board cut after another but actually is a \nthoughtful plan to relieve our children and our grandchildren of this \nburden we are threatening them with.\n  So, through the Chair, I thank my colleague.\n  Madam President, I come to the floor today, after the Senator from \nOklahoma described today as a day of petty kindergarten political \ngames, to talk about a place where they are not playing any of those \nright now, and that is a town in Colorado that I represent called Estes \nPark, which has been a beacon of resilience. It is in the mountains \njust northwest of Boulder. It is the gateway to Rocky Mountain National \nPark.\n  I can see from the Presiding Officer's reaction that she may have \nbeen there.\n  The town has several thousand residents and hosts close to 3 million \nvisitors a year, including an average of over half a million visitors \nin the month of September.\n  This time of year is peak tourist season. The weather is beautiful. \nThe aspens' leaves are even more beautiful than the weather, and the \nelk famously wander through the park and through the town. Whether you \nare coming to rest or recreate, Estes Park welcomes you, and it always \nhas.\n  In 2011 visitors generated $196 million in tourism spending and \nsupported more than 2,700 jobs. By some estimates tourism accounts for \n43 percent of local employment. But when the floods hit in Colorado, \nEstes Park was almost entirely cut off from the outside world.\n  As shown in this picture, here is Route 34 going to Estes Park.\n  Two of the major roads into town were wiped out for miles at a \nstretch, leaving only one road into town. Many homes and businesses \nwere destroyed. But the residents of Estes Park picked themselves up \nand began the recovery process. Limited access to the town has been \nrestored. Folks had just started opening their businesses again. \nVisitors had just started to return to Rocky Mountain National Park. \nAnd then Congress stepped in and dealt an unbelievably cruel blow by \nshutting down this government.\n  Let me quote what Estes Park resident Tom Johnson said on the Tuesday \nof the shutdown:\n\n       I think politicians are playing around, like they do, and \n     it's the people who wind up--\n\n  ``And it's the people who wind up''--\n\n     with all the problems for it. Man, they did it to Estes Park, \n     when they shut down that park.\n\n  Rocky Mountain National Park closed with the shutdown. Hundreds of \ncampers have had to cancel their reservations, and likely thousands \nmore canceled their plans to visit.\n  The Denver Post reported that if visitors to Estes Park decline by 70 \npercent, it could mean the loss of 1,100 jobs, $90 million in spending, \n$5.8 million in State sales tax revenue, and $4.4 million in local \ntaxes. This is one community in Colorado, one community in the United \nStates of America tonight, as we horse around here in the Congress.\n  The shutdown is a kick in the teeth to our local governments and \nsmall businesses in their efforts to recover from these floods.\n  One of the area's more famous businesses is the Stanley Hotel. John \nCullen, the hotel's owner, told us that while it is booking visitors \nfor long weekend trips, it has been slow to bring in the usual number \nof guests during the week. He says it is because locals cannot come to \nRocky Mountain National Park for the fall foliage. He tells us they \nhave done everything they can to keep the hotel open because it is a \nmajor employer in Estes Park, but he is losing money on a daily basis.\n  Diane Muno is a local business owner in Estes Park, with four retail \nshops. The Spruce House and the Christmas Shop are two local Christmas \nand holiday stores; the White Orchid and the White Orchid Bridal Shop \nsell clothing and other apparel.\n  Some of these businesses have been serving customers in Estes Park \nsince 1969. They are institutions in this Colorado community.\n  The flooding damaged three of four of her businesses. One was \nseriously damaged and has not yet reopened. The other two rushed to \nreopen to recover, and they would have been fine except we closed Rocky \nMountain National Park, and that has slowed foot traffic in a \nsignificant way. Diane's October revenue for these four stores is down \n67 percent--two-thirds down--from this point in October last year. She \ntypically has 12 to 15 employees, but she is working a skeleton crew of \n6.\n  Another business damaged by the floods was Kind Coffee. Its owner, \nAmy Hamrick, has been relying on Internet sales while she is working to \nreopen the store. The community has rallied around the store, as our \ncommunities that have been struck by the floods have done. It bought \ncoffee beans and mugs and T-shirts online and helped clean up \nfloodwaters. But the same story holds: She took a huge hit when the \ngovernment shut down. Making horrible things worse, Amy's husband David \nHamrick, a firefighter with the U.S. Forest Service, has been \nfurloughed.\n  This is what this inability of Washington's politicians to get done \nthe most basic function we have--to keep the government running--has \nwrought in this one Colorado community.\n  Amy told National Public Radio:\n\n       We carry on through the middle of October with tourism \n     dollars and locals coming to see the elk rut and to go into \n     the park and see the color. . . . And the national park is \n     also our largest employer in town. So our community now has \n     lost a lot of jobs in the interim.\n\n  This is exactly why it is the wrong moment for Colorado, for Estes \nPark, to have Washington's dysfunction come crashing down. They do not \ndeserve it. They do not deserve it. But, as they are now saying in \nEstes Park, they are mountain strong and they will get through it. And \nI know they will.\n  Amy Hamrick took the time to remind us that 90 percent of the town is \nopen, dry, and ready for customers. She said:\n\n       The town . . . is beautiful and the golf courses have elk \n     on them 24 hours a day.\n\n  Estes Park, like much of Colorado, has taken a hit, but it will not \nstay down. The community continues to pull together and recover. As \nexpected, its neighbors are going the extra mile to help everybody out.\n  This quote from Jeannie Bier captures the spirit of Colorado. She \nsaid:\n\n       We live down in Loveland and it is difficult for the people \n     down there right now--\n\n  I know it is difficult down there because I was there last week with \nthe mayor and county commissioners and others looking at devastation in \nLoveland--\n\n     but we also knew it is just as difficult up here in Estes and \n     they are our neighbors, so we took the roundabout way to get \n     up here to support Estes as well.\n\n  The floods will not deter them, and neither will the outrageous \nstupidity of this shutdown.\n  Rocky Mountain National Park is closed, but there are still plenty of \nother reasons to come and enjoy Estes Park.\n  Earlier today somebody who works with me named James Thompson spoke \nwith the town's mayor Bill Pinkham and asked him what is the one thing \nhe would want me to say on this floor. The message was plain and \nsimple. He said:\n\n       Michael, tell them it's spectacularly beautiful up here. \n     It's still a great experience. We're open for business!\n\n  This town has been through a lot and has risen to its challenges.\n  So I say to everybody, come to Estes Park. Enjoy the beauty. Shop at \nour businesses. Dine at our restaurants. And meet the folks who would \nnot let a natural disaster or a manmade disaster stop them from \nsucceeding. You can learn more about a trip to Estes Park at \nvisitestespark.com.\n  To my colleagues, I urge you to come to Colorado for a different \nreason. Maybe we could all learn something from these incredible people \nabout what it means to pull together in the face of a crisis.\n  For those of us playing politics with this shutdown and playing \npolitics with this fiscal cliff, I would really encourage you to spend \na single moment in one of our flood-ravaged towns. That\n\n[[Page S7306]]\n\nmight bring some welcome clarity to the debate.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, most of us here in the Senate have read \nat least something about our Nation's founding. Although it is \nstriking, what is almost always overlooked is the Founders' use of the \nlanguage of ``the republic.''\n  Asked by a citizen on the street which was being created behind \nclosed doors in Philadelphia, ``a Republic or a monarchy,'' Benjamin \nFranklin famously said: ``A republic, if you can keep it.''\n  As with most foundational decisions, the Founders made this choice \ndeliberately. The idea of democracy frightened Hamilton, Adams, and \nothers, because they equated it with mobs in the street. They worried \nthat mob rule would overcome rights bestowed not by their government \nbut by their Creator. They studied the classics and their models were \nthe Greek and Roman republics.\n  They set out to do something never done before, to create a republic \nof the scope and scale never before attempted, and one that could \nexpand as the country grew.\n  Today we are the world's oldest and greatest democracy. During the \nlast century, America has expanded the constitutional rights of women \nand people of color well beyond landowning White men, originally \nprivileged. In our time, we have come to understand that democracies \nare about the rights of citizens, but a republic, the Founders \nunderstood, is about the duties of citizens, the obligations a citizen \nhas to a society whose constitution guarantees his or her rights.\n  Basic duties are to pay taxes levied by a representative government, \nto defend our country when called upon, and to obey the law. Our \nFounders had something even greater in mind, qualities that would make \na republic endure. Like republics from ancient Athens forward, they \nbelieved in popular sovereignty, based on citizen participation in \ngovernment. They believed in the commonwealth, all those things we hold \nand value in common, such as our defense and our shared infrastructure, \nand the welfare of the next generation of Americans.\n  They believed in putting the common interest above personal or narrow \ninterests, a sense of the national interest. How else could committed \nslaveowners and abolitionists form a country and a government?\n  They believed in resistance to corruption, those who would turn the \nnational interest to personal gain. We were founded as a republic and \nwe have become more democratic across time. We are democratic and \nrepublican. Interestingly enough, what came to be the semblance of the \nfirst political party in America called itself the Democratic \nRepublicans. It was founded in 1791. Sounds pretty weird today, I know, \nbut it simply meant those who believed in democratic equality and \nfreedom, working to uphold the ideals of the Republic. One of our \nbedrock American principles is that we must protect our rights through \nperformance of our duties. That is not some abstract political theory. \nThis is a definition of who we are and how we must govern ourselves.\n  We have rights and responsibilities as citizens and as Senators. We \nhave the right to free speech but the responsibility not to shout \n``fire'' in a crowded theater. We have the right to assemble but the \nresponsibility to do so peacefully. In this body we have the right to \nfilibuster but the responsibility to govern on behalf of the American \npeople.\n  But the fewer the Americans who exercise the most fundamental right, \nI would say duty, of voting, the more political influence extreme \ngroups in our society have. This is where we find ourselves at the dawn \nof the 21st century, with a Senate that at times is dominated by a \nsmall faction that does not represent the mainstream of American \npolitical thought, and a House that is gerrymandered into dysfunction. \nThis institutional paralysis has created a vacuum into which a million \nspecial interests happily roam.\n  Actually, I should call them narrow, not special, interests. From \nancient Athens onward, narrow interests have been the enemy of every \nrepublic. That has never been truer than it is today. Keeping the \nRepublic created by our Founders should concern every generation of \nAmericans, including our own. The sovereign power belongs to all the \npeople, not just a vocal few. It is our responsibility, it is our duty, \nas elected officials when that ideal is tested, to work together to \nrestore a sense of the commonwealth and the common good that enabled us \nto prevail in world wars and to overcome depressions.\n  This is our cause, but we are stuck. We are stuck because we are \nfighting over yesterday's battles instead of seeking to anticipate, as \nour Founders did, how we will manage change. To one degree or another, \nall Senators and possibly all Americans are conservative. If \nconservative means to protect our Nation's principles and ideals, I am \na conservative. If conservative means to preserve a culture of \ntolerance, justice, and equality, I am a conservative. If conservative \nmeans to respect the unique cultural heritage of America, I am a \nconservative. If conservative means to protect our natural heritage, I \nam very much a conservative.\n  But while we protect and preserve the best of what makes us who we \nare, we must adapt to change. Scarcely one of us in the Senate has ever \nsought office without advocating some kind of change: change of \nofficeholder, change of party, change of policy. That is good, because \nthe future is arriving faster and faster and we have gotten no better \nat anticipating it.\n  Even with the seemingly endless crawls of the words ``breaking news'' \nat the bottom of our screens, no one predicted the Arab spring before \nit sprung. That is the most closely watched region in the world.\n  There are great historic tides that demand that we change and adapt \nto them in order to preserve and protect and conserve our central \nvalues. We do not live in a stagnant world. Indeed, we are living in \nthe midst of great revolution that makes the 21st century as different \nfrom the 20th as the 18th century was from the 17th. We are living \nthrough what may be the peak years of change on the scale of the \nIndustrial Revolution. But even though we may come here oriented to \nchange, the institutions of government, Congress included, are oriented \nto the past. Our committee structure and our regulatory agencies \nimagine an economy that existed deep in the last century. We are \ndesigned to support incumbent interests, not the innovators that will \ndrive job growth and wage growth in the 21st century. This is a fatal \nflaw, if we are ever going to tackle the growing income inequality that \nour Nation faces, an inequality that has been unmatched since 1928.\n  We are regulating the telegraph when the world is wireless. Just one \nexample: Almost a year ago I visited Apple out in Silicon Valley to \nlearn something about their work in education. A little over 4 years \nago, when I was superintendent of Denver Public Schools, I did not \nspend one second thinking about how to apply a tablet to the education \nof our kids, because there was no such thing as a tablet--a little over \n4 years ago.\n  Today the tablet, combined with platforms such as the iTunes \nplatform, presents an unbelievable opportunity for our children and \nchildren all over the world to learn and to teach each other. It was \namazing to see.\n  In any case, Apple presented a slide showing that 75 percent of their \nlast 12 months of revenue was derived from products they did not sell 5 \nyears before--75 percent of their revenue came from things they did not \nsell 5 years before.\n  We have not updated our Tax Code since 1986. I was in college in \n1986. What are the chances that our Tax Code is helping drive job and \nwage growth in 2013, 27 years later, more than a quarter of a century \nlater?\n  In this Congress and in this government, we are desperately out of \nsync with the world as it is. It is, in fact, an irony that we must \nchange and adapt to preserve the principles that we treasure. But we \nmust.\n  Today, many flying the tea party banner resist all change. Indeed, \nthey\n\n[[Page S7307]]\n\nwant to go back, often to a past that never existed, or to a time that \nhas no relation to our time. Too often, their politics embrace old \ninterests that will not drive us forward to an economy that is creating \njobs and raising wages.\n  Our founding principles should not change. I agree with that. But our \npractices and methods must change to become relevant. These two \nparties, or three with the tea party, have to escape their orthodoxies \nfor this to be possible. Efforts to maintain the status quo or to \nreturn to some mythical past are doomed to fail. That is simply because \ntime and the tides of human affairs will not stand still. We do not \ncontrol history and cannot dictate to it. Change is the one constant. \nHow we attempt to shape it to our purposes, by creative, imaginative \npublic policies will determine whether we can preserve the best of our \npast, our principles, our heritage, and our values.\n  Those who seek to protect our Nation against change by sitting on the \nbeach before a massive incoming tide with shovel in hand will be swept \naway as surely as King Canute. As I mentioned earlier, anyone who \nbelieves their orthodoxy or their ideological orientation prepared them \nfor the Arab spring or made us safer is deluded. Our job must be to \ncreate a shared understanding of the facts when we work in a town that \nis arranged to obscure them.\n  Despite the desires of nostalgia, we are not going back to the \nlaissez faire world of Herbert Hoover. Social safety nets are here to \nstay to protect children, the elderly, the poor, the disabled, and to \nprotect our ability to call ourselves a civilized nation. But even they \nwill have to be changed if they are going to survive for the next \ngeneration of Americans.\n  The revolution of globalization and information has transformed the \nworld's economy and cultures and societies all across the globe, \nincluding here in the United States. These revolutions, like the \nIndustrial Revolution before them, cannot be stopped. It is up to us to \ndecide whether we can accept this new reality and position our country \nto lead, as it has since our founding, or whether we shrink into an \nimaginary conception of what the world once was and what the United \nStates once was.\n  With all of this change and pace of globalization comes fear of the \nfuture and a sense of loss of what once was. That is human nature. I do \nnot exempt myself from that. At a time of uncertainty, it has become \nfashionable in some political circles to capitalize on it politically. \nThis kind of demagoguery is not unknown in American history. Anytime \nAmericans become fearful or worried, there have always been those who \nsaw personal advantage in fanning those flames. But they do not join an \nhonor roll of history, an assembly of our greatest leaders. Media \nattention, which is easy and cheap, is not a measure of leadership. \nDivision does not require moral authority.\n  If we are at another of history's turning points, as many believe, as \nI believe, one road leads to the worst of our past. The other leads to \na new definition of our freedoms. We treasure the freedoms incorporated \nin the First Amendment to our Constitution.\n  We remember at the height of the Great Depression that Franklin \nRoosevelt declared four new freedoms: Freedom of speech and worship and \nfreedom from want and fear. Today, in the middle of what one might \ncharacterize as a political depression, let's consider some new \nfreedoms for the 21st century: Freedom from foreign oil; freedom from \nfalse patriotism; freedom from the politics of division; freedom to \ncreate a constructive future; and, yes, freedom from unconstitutional \ngovernment surveillance.\n  We have duties to perform far greater than merely funding the \ngovernment. Just ask any poor child or her teacher in a typical \nAmerican school. The good news is that fear has never and will not now \ndictate the fate of our Republic. History's dustbin is filled with \nfailed demagogues. And we are not going back. But we need to hurry. The \nworld is not waiting for us.\n\n  Americans want us to move forward into the 21st century with the \nimagination, creativity, adaptability, and values that have made this \ncountry so great from its founding. The stakes are simply too high in \nour time to allow our institutions to be crippled by politicians who \ncolor far outside the lines of conventional American political thought \nand who react with angry and mock surprise when their policy objectives \nare not achieved.\n  It is time to close this sorry chapter in the history of the \nCongress, reopen our government, preserve the full faith and credit of \nthe United States, and work together as Senators from the various \nStates on the people's business. I suspect that is why most of us \nwanted to serve to begin with.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PAUL R. RAO\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam President, today I wish to \nhonor an outstanding gentleman and friend, the man who guided me \nthrough years of speech recovery. Dr. Paul R. Rao, a recognized leader \nin his field of speech-language pathology, will retire from his work as \nvice president of Inpatient Operations at the National Rehabilitation \nHospital, NRH, on October 17, 2013, his 67th birthday and 43rd wedding \nanniversary.\n  Dr. Rao began his professional career more than 32 years ago at \nMedStar Health and skillfully guided the development of the new speech \nand language department when MedStar opened the National Rehabilitation \nHospital in Washington, DC, 27 years ago.\n  I met Dr. Rao when I entered NRH in February 2007, following an AVM \nand a month in intensive care. Over the months he became more than a \ntherapist for me, he was a friend and a coach. When I returned to South \nDakota in August of that year, Dr. Rao took his own time to join me as \nI greeted the people of South Dakota for the first time since the AVM. \nI continued to work with Dr. Rao in outpatient therapy, despite his \ndemanding schedule as a vice-president for NRH, for another 3 years. I \nhave been told that we were truly the odd couple, he the ebullient, \nloquacious Italian and I the stoic, reticent Norwegian.\n  He is widely recognized for his professional skills and is a sought \nafter public speaker. Among his honors is the Clinical Achievement \nAward by the American Speech-Language Hearing Foundation that he \nreceived not once but twice, in 1989 and 2001. The DC Association for \nHealthcare Quality conferred on Dr. Rao the Janis Willis Annual Award \nfor Educational Excellence in 2001 and the Beth Lang Award for \nOutstanding Leadership in 2003.\n  In addition, he is a national leader in medical rehabilitation, \nserving as president of the American Speech and Hearing Association, \nand as fellow of the American College of Healthcare Executives.\n  Dr. Rao is the editor of Managing Stroke: A Guide to Living Well \nAfter Stroke published in 2000 and the lead editor for the second \nedition of this text in 2009.\n  He has made invaluable contributions to MedStar's National \nRehabilitation Network and was recognized for his leadership as steward \nof the patient safety journey when he was awarded the National \nRehabilitation Hospital's John W. Goldschmidt Award for Excellence in \nRehabilitation.\n  I am pleased to take this opportunity to thank Paul for sharing his \ntalents with me. I wish him and Martina a wonderful retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/08/senate-section/article/S7307-3", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7307-S7308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:02 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following joint resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n\n[[Page S7308]]\n\n\n       H.J.
