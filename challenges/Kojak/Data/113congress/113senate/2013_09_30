Mr. President, we are at the brink. We are only hours \naway from a possible government shutdown. All over my State and all \nover the Nation there are very devoted Federal employees who are \nwaiting to hear: Are we going to be called nonessential to performing \nimportant government services?\n  Should they come in tomorrow? People have applied for small business \nloans. Are those loans going to be processed? People have applied for \nstudent loans. Are they going to be processed?\n  What is going to happen to the National Weather Service? What is \ngoing to happen at NIH? What is going to happen at the Food and Drug \nAdministration, where people stand sentry over the safety of our food \nsupply and our drug supply.\n  We don't know because we have just tabled the radical bill that the \nHouse sent over to us. It was deliberately designed to be politically \nprovocative. Continuing resolutions were always about disputes over \nmoney. They were not about political, ideological viewpoints over past \nlegislation.\n  I am pleased that what we did was to table it and send it back to the \nHouse. The Senate acted very responsibly last week on a short-term \ncontinuing funding resolution that got rid of politically motivated \nriders and kept the government working for the American people until \nNovember 15 to work out our differences on funding bills.\n  The House sent this back--yet one more bill that says if you don't \ndelay the Affordable Care Act for 1 year, we will shut down the \ngovernment. If you don't eliminate the benefits affecting prevention \nand particularly women's health, we will shut down the government. If \nthe government shuts down tomorrow, it will be because of the House's \nviewpoint: My way or the highway.\n  A government shutdown is a serious matter. These are a few things \nthat will happen if we don't come together across the aisle, across the \ndome, and across town to pass a clean short-term continuing resolution. \nI wish to take a minute to highlight how damaging a government shutdown \nis on the day-to-day lives of our American people and our economy.\n  Shutting down the Federal Government will have immediate and harmful \nconsequences on our economy. Small Business Administration approval \nloans will be put on hold, and 28 million small businesses will no \nlonger have access to federally assisted loans or technical assistance.\n  In the rural areas, the USDA Rural Development housing, farm loan and \ngrant program will stop.\n  Let's go to the safety of our waterways. The Army Corps of Engineers \nwill stop work on all flood control and navigation projects. This is \nwhat helps ensure that our ships can travel through America's \nwaterways, whether they are coming up the Chesapeake Bay into the Port \nof Baltimore or they are traveling down the Mississippi River or the \nMissouri River or coming into the gulf.\n  The Department of Commerce will stop economic development, minority \nbusiness, and international trade assistance programs.\n  I know that the House passed a separate amendment funding active duty \nmilitary. I would hope so. These are men and women who put themselves \nin the line of duty.\n  I also wish to remind people that there are other people every day \nwho are doing a job to protect the health, safety, and laws of the \nAmerican people. I represent all of the men and women who work at the \nFood and Drug Administration. It is headquartered in my State, and \n2,000 people--or 55 percent--will be furloughed at midnight.\n  FDA will stop monitoring imports at our borders. What does that mean? \nThose men and women whose job it is to stand sentry over the food \nsupply of the United States of America, we are going to tell them they \nare nonessential. If they stand sentry over the safety of our drugs and \nour medical devices, we are telling them they are nonessential. I don't \nthink the American people support that. They might be a little bit \ncranky about the Federal Government here or there, but I think they \nwant their food to be safe, their drugs to be safe, and they want us to \nmove ahead with these devices to make sure they are in clinical \npractice.\n  Over at the National Institutes of Health, which is located in \nBethesda, MD--the National Institutes of Health and their subsidiaries \nthat receive extramural funding throughout the United States of \nAmerica--70 percent of the staff at NIH will be furloughed. Seventy \npercent of the 10,000 men and women who work at NIH will be furloughed \nat midnight. These are the people who are working on the cure for \nAlzheimer's, they are working on the cure for autism, and they are \nworking on the cure for arthritis, and I am just going through the \n``a'' words. We could go on to the ``b'' words. How about breast \ncancer? How about cancer itself? Last year, when the NIH announced that \ncancer rates in America had been reduced by 15 percent, instead of \npinning medals on the people at NIH and the private sector who worked \nwith us on important drugs and biological products, we announced \nsequester. What kind of government would destroy the very agency that \nis set up to come up with cures in the case of Alzheimer's cognitive \nstretch-out? Seventy percent. And who are they? They are the lab \ntechnician people. They are the people who help run the administrative \nend of things, which enables those talented researchers to be able to \ndo this.\n  The NIH Clinical Center won't be able to admit new patients or start \nnew clinical trials. The NIH Clinical Center is a hospital at NIH. You \ndon't go there unless you are really sick and unless you are really \ndesperate and unless you really have no place to go. You go in with no \nhope. But that is what they have nicknamed NIH around America--not the \nNational Institutes of Health but the National Institutes of Hope, that \nwhat they are doing today is going to lead to solving the problems of \ntomorrow. Why? Why are we furloughing 70 percent? And not only are we \nfurloughing, we are saying: Bye-bye for now. You are nonessential.\n  Well, I think they are crucial. I think they are not only essential, \nbut I think they are crucial. So I worry about what are our priorities.\n  Then we go to the weather forecasters. Oh, they will be on the job. \nThey are located in my State too.\n  You might say: Well, do you have any people who work in the private \nsector?\n  People in Maryland work in the private sector because of the public \nsector.\n  Our law enforcement, our FBI, will be on the job. They are in the \nline of fire too, but they will be getting an IOU. Instead of an IOU, \nwe should say to the FBI and to our border patrol and to our marshals, \nwho are chasing sexual predators and human traffickers, not an IOU, we \nowe you a debt of gratitude. We owe you getting your pay on time. We \nshouldn't hide the fact you haven't received a cost of living for 3 \nyears. And we shouldn't be dancing around with ideologically motivated \nshutdowns.\n  Social Security checks will go out, but the 18,000 people who will \nvisit Social Security offices will find they are understaffed. On the \naverage, half a million people call Social Security every day. They are \ngoing to get either no answer or a busy signal.\n  I could go on and on about what the consequences of a shutdown will \nbe. We really cannot do that. So I say to my colleagues on the other \nside of the dome, please, let's pass a clean CR. Let's pass it to \nNovember 15. Let's negotiate on a middle-ground number. They have a \nbudget number of $988 billion, and they accept sequester as the new \nnorm. Let's find a way to cancel sequester at least for 2 years.\n  I marked up the appropriations bills at $1.058 trillion. That is the \nnumber the Senate passed in its Budget Committee in April. There is a \n$70 billion\n\n[[Page S7013]]\n\ndifference. I am ready to negotiate, but we can't capitulate. Let's \nfind a middle ground.\n  There was a great American general and a great statesman and a real \nAmerican icon--Colin Powell. Over and over during the Reagan \nadministration he would say: Let's find that sensible center. Let's \nfind that sensible center.\n  Let's avoid a shutdown. Let's stop playing slam-down politics. Let's \ncome together and find a way to solve the problem of keeping the \ngovernment open as well as a long-term fiscal solution for paying down \nour government's debt. I understand that. But also let's make sure we \nhave a progrowth budget that lowers the unemployment rate, raises \neducational achievement, finds those cures for diseases affecting the \nAmerican people. Let's have an FDA that can get them approved, ensuring \nsafety and efficacy in the hands of our doctors here and doctors all \nover the world. Let's make sure that when we talk about American \nexceptionalism, we know where it comes from.\n  Mr. President, I know there are other colleagues who wish to speak. I \nnow yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I find the position we are in right \nnow beyond frustrating, and I can imagine what the American people must \nbe thinking right now. It is very hard from a distance to figure out \nwho has really lost their minds--one party, the other party, all of us, \nthe President. But I really want to boil down what has occurred because \nit is stunning when you boil it down.\n  The House sent us a piece of legislation where they wanted to defund \nthe health care reforms--ObamaCare--and that was the price they were \ndemanding in order for the government to stay open. The ticket to \nadmission for an open government was our getting rid of the health care \nbill. Well, we took that up and we defeated that bill. By a 10-vote \nmargin, 54 to 44, we defeated that bill, and we sent it back to them \nwith just the ticket to keep the government open--without an extra \nprice of admission.\n  This is where it gets interesting. What happened after we sent that \nback? Did they take it up and defeat it? No. No. They didn't vote. I \nwant to make sure the American people understand this. All of the \nMembers of Congress who were elected to serve the people of this \ncountry didn't get a chance to vote because the Speaker decided there \nwouldn't be a vote in the House of Representatives on the Senate-passed \nmeasure.\n  Somebody said: Well, it is the Hastert rule.\n  I have searched the Constitution, and I can't find the Hastert rule. \nIt is not there. So the question we have to ask right now is, Why won't \nthey let the House vote? Maybe they will defeat a clean attempt just to \nkeep the government open.\n  By the way, nobody here is against negotiating or compromise. We have \ncompromised on the number in this continuing resolution, and we are \nperfectly willing and, in fact, we have been desperately trying to \nnegotiate and compromise on the budget for months. Senator Cruz has \nblocked our attempts to go to conference on the budget.\n  So it is not that none of us are willing to compromise. Maybe some of \nus aren't, but there is a good healthy bipartisan margin of Senators \nwho want to compromise on issues surrounding Federal spending but not \non keeping the government open and not on paying our bills. Let's get \nthose done. Let's get those done. That is basic. Let's get it done.\n  So my plea today to Speaker Boehner is this: Quit making decisions on \nbehalf of all your Members--a small group of you huddled in a back \nroom--because that is what is happening. There are two or three men in \na back room down the hall, and they are deciding whether they are going \nto allow the elected representatives of this country to vote. I say let \nthe House vote. I think the American people may be surprised that there \nwould be a healthy bipartisan margin to, in fact, keep the government \nopen when the clock strikes midnight tonight.\n  Elections matter, and elections are what dictate what happens around \nhere. We had an election last November. I remember it very well. I \nstood for election last November. There were two candidates for \nPresident of the United States, and every American citizen had a chance \nto decide who they wanted to lead this country. The contrast was very \nclear. One candidate said he was going to repeal ObamaCare on the very \nfirst day he was President. He was going to, by Executive order, wipe \nout ObamaCare on day one. The other candidate said: I am going to \nimplement ObamaCare. That candidate won, and it wasn't even close.\n  Every single Democratic Senator who ran for reelection and voted for \nObamaCare was reelected. Red State, purple State, blue State--all of us \nwere reelected who voted for ObamaCare. In fact, a couple more were \nelected in States where Republicans had represented those States. We \ndidn't lose seats, we picked up seats. Even in the House of \nRepresentatives, the raw votes, there were more Democratic votes cast \nin the House of Representatives than Republican votes. They have the \nmajority because of the way the districts are drawn. And I understand \nthey control that House, but should they control whether people get to \nvote? Let the House vote.\n  They say: ObamaCare is so unpopular; the American people don't want \nit.\n  Now, I get that the polling is not good for this reform, and I am \nperfectly willing, as we implement it, if we need to, to make tweaks \nand changes to make it better.\n  I hope my friends across the aisle will quit using this as a \npolitical 2 by 4 and help us make it as good as we can possibly make it \nbecause this isn't about any plot, this is about accessible and \naffordable health care for all Americans with a free market solution. \nThese are all private insurance companies. There is not a government \nprogram in this. People are going to be able to choose between various \nprivate policies and various options, and they are never going to have \nto pay more than 9\\1/2\\ percent of their income for their insurance. \nThe insurance companies aren't going to be able to swallow fat profits \nfor golden parachutes for big CEOs anymore. They are going to have to \nspend 80 cents of every dollar for your health care. But it is all free \nmarket.\n  This was a Republican solution in the beginning. The candidate for \nPresident forgot that--former Governor Romney--this was his solution \nfor Massachusetts when he was Governor.\n  Now, I will give the Republicans this: It is unpopular in the polls \nright now. But let's take this proposition: Guess what background \nchecks for guns polls right now? I know the Presiding Officer knows \npainfully well what those numbers are because of the tragedy in his \nState. It is much higher, frankly, than those who say they think \nObamaCare should be repealed--the Americans who support background \nchecks on weapons purchases. So what would everyone on the other side \nof the aisle think if we decided, well, you know, we are going to shut \ndown the government if you won't pass background checks on guns. It is \nwhat the American people want. We will just shut down the government if \nyou won't pass it. That is not the way we legislate. That is not the \nconstitutional framework our Founding Fathers put together. There would \nbe outrage that we would try to shut down the government over \nbackground checks on guns. Yet the very same premise would apply to \nwhat they are doing.\n  The President won. The majority of the Senate are in fact individuals \nwho support this valiant attempt to try to do something with a health \ncare system that was headed off the rails, becoming more and more \nunaffordable every day. By the way, everything that is bad now is \nObamaCare. I laughingly made a joke in my State that our university's \nteam didn't do very well in offense during the first half. I said, it \nmust be ObamaCare. Because no matter what is out there that people are \nupset about, somehow they manage to paint it with the ObamaCare brush.\n  I think people are going to be pleasantly surprised. It is not going \nto be as intrusive as some of the talking heads warned. It is going to \nprovide a marketplace where people can pool risk and get a better deal. \nIt is going to provide a lot more nights where parents can rest easy \nbecause they are not rolling the dice every day and depending on the \nemergency room for their day-to-day health needs.\n  My message today is very simple. All of this is premised on the \nnotion that\n\n[[Page S7014]]\n\none should be able to shut down our government because they don't get \ntheir way in an election. I don't think that is the role model we want \nto serve to the other governments in the world, much less to our kids. \nI think we can compromise on a lot. We can even work on making this \nbill better. But let's keep the government open, let's pay our bills, \nand then let's sit down and have some meaningful negotiation and \ncompromise about Federal spending. I am somebody in my caucus who is \nalways open to other ways we can cut spending. Some in my caucus don't \nfeel as strongly as I do about that, but I am willing to listen to all \nsides and negotiate around the budget.\n  Let's not hold our economy hostage in the process. Real people are \ngoing to be hurt. This isn't just about who is on the Sunday morning \nshows, who is your primary opponent, what are they saying on cable \nnews. This is about real folks, and we need to be focused on them.\n  I implore Speaker Boehner, let the Members vote. Just let them vote. \nPut it on the floor. He can do it in an hour. Put it on the floor and \nlet them vote. If it is defeated, then let's talk. I will bet it won't \nbe.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I believe the Deficit-Neutral \nDisaster Relief Act Senator Bennet and I have drafted is at the desk. \nIt is my understanding both sides have cleared the bill, I would add, \nafter a lot of pushing from Senator Bennet and me and other Coloradans, \nalong with the Governor and Department of Transportation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of S. 1560, introduced earlier by Senators Bennet and \nUdall of Colorado, that the bill be read three times and passed, and \nthe motions to reconsider be made and laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1560) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1560\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Deficit Neutral Disaster \n     Relief Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EMERGENCY RELIEF PROJECTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Secretary of Transportation may obligate not more \n     than $450,000,000 of the amounts made available to carry out \n     section 125 of title 23, United States Code, under chapter 9 \n     of title X of division A of the Disaster Relief \n     Appropriations Act, 2013 (Public Law 113-2; 127 Stat. 34) \n     under the heading ``emergency relief program'' under the \n     heading ``federal-aid highways'' under the heading ``Federal \n     Highway Administration'' for emergency relief projects in the \n     State of Colorado arising from damage caused by flooding \n     events in that State in calendar year 2013.\n       (b) Emergency Designation for Congressional Enforcement.--\n     In the Senate, this Act is designated as an emergency \n     requirement pursuant to section 403(a) of S. Con. Res. 13 \n     (111th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 2010.\n       (c) Emergency Designation for Statutory PAYGO.--This Act is \n     designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section \n     4(g) of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (Public Law \n     111-139; 2 U.S.C. 933(g)).\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleagues \nand once again outline what this important act we passed will do. It is \ncritically important.\n  I was on the floor Friday, and the Presiding Officer was here on \nFriday and was patient and listened to the case Senator Bennet and I \nmade at that time. This is critically important because it will allow \nColorado to begin rebuilding our battered roads and bridges and \nhighways without having to wait years for relief. We are close now to \ngetting this legislation to the President's desk, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in the House, with Senator Bennet, to get \nthis bill signed into law as soon as possible.\n  Senator Bennet and I have been on the floor on a number of occasions \nin recent days to highlight how devastated certain parts of our \nbeautiful State are as a result of these biblical floods we suffered a \nfew weeks ago. Many communities are just now beginning to comprehend \nhow serious the damage is and to see firsthand how many hundreds of \nmiles of highways, roads, bridges, and other parts of our \ninfrastructure are ruined or in some cases even washed away entirely.\n  I have had many occasions to see this damage firsthand in the last \nfew weeks, starting in my own neighborhood, which was evacuated, but \nall over the northern front range. I was in Jamestown on Saturday. \nSenator Bennet was there a few days earlier. It is one of the worst-hit \ncommunities in Boulder Canyon. It is almost beyond description. The \nhomes are literally washed off their foundations, cars were embedded in \nthe ground, completely buried. Families were left in some cases with 2 \nto 3 feet of mud and silt, river cobbles literally inside their homes. \nI was in one home in Jamestown standing on the mud and silt, and my \nhead was touching the ceiling because of the 3 feet of debris that was \ninside that house. We have seen entire roads and highways completely \ndecimated. Without this help, it is a fact that communities will not be \nable to rebuild.\n  By passing the Deficit-Neutral Disaster Relief Act, we have lifted \nthe statutory cap of $100 million to a limit of $450 million. The money \napplies to highway relief, so it will be enough to help us rebuild \nswiftly.\n  As I have done here before, I want to again make it clear that this \nisn't new money. It doesn't increase budget authority or increase net \noutlays. It simply allows us to access an already existing appropriated \nfund of money.\n  Historically, this $100 million cap on relief has routinely been \nrecognized by Congress as an unwise impediment to helping States \nrecover and it has been raised for nearly every natural disaster in \nrecent years. Examples would be familiar to anybody listening. We \nraised the cap on transportation disaster relief for Hurricanes Gustav, \nIke, Irene, Sandy, as well as during the Missouri River basin flooding \nin 2011.\n  I am truly appreciative and truly grateful that all of our colleagues \nhave come together to recognize that the floods in Colorado are no \nexception. We are all in this together when it comes to responding to \nnational disasters. I am glad that today we can say to Coloradans \nMembers of Congress from all across the United States of America have \nstood with us in our recovery efforts, and we will stand with them in \ntheir recovery efforts as we have in the past as we experience natural \ndisasters.\n  I thank the Senate for clearing this crucial legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and look forward to the remarks of \nmy colleague Senator Bennet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I will be brief because I think Senator \nUdall has covered it very well. But I also want to rise today on this \nfloor to thank all 100 of our colleges who were necessary for getting \nthis done and for getting it passed. We have to move it along to the \nPresident's desk.\n  There are a lot of times when people at home wonder whether anybody \nin this place is listening to them and whether we are doing something \nother than playing politics with each other. This is a clear case where \npeople here have listened to the people in Colorado, who have \ngenerously from time to time helped people in other States that were \nconfronting disasters. Now it is our turn to ask for help, and that \nhelp has been granted.\n  I wish to thank Senator Udall for his leadership in particular, but \nalso all the Members in the Senate who made this possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/30/senate-section/article/S7014-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7014-S7015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. BENNET.

Mr. President, I want to make a few comments about the \ncrisis that is unfolding before us. Right now some colleagues in the \nSenate and others over on the House side are holding the entire \nAmerican economy hostage to make their favorite point on policy. I must \nsay that this blackmail against ordinary working class Americans--\nthreatening to steal whatever momentum our economy has rather than \nbuild greater momentum and greater job growth--is deeply misguided. \nThat is really as polite a way as I can possibly put it.\n  Think about what working families have been through over the last few \nyears. The deregulation of Wall Street leading to predatory mortgages \nthat hurt millions of families, and then the securities that those were \nbased on, proceeded to derail our entire economy, hurting millions \nmore. Families lost their savings. They lost their jobs. They lost the \nequity in their house.\n  All that working families are asking for is a little bit of common \nsense. Don't do further damage to the economy that is struggling to \nrecover. Yet certain colleagues here in the Senate and over in the \nHouse seem to believe that the little people don't matter, the working \npeople do not matter, the stability of the foundation for families and \nliving-wage jobs doesn't matter because they can play whatever \npolitical games they want and the only people hurt are ones they do not \nsee in their life. Maybe they live in a gated community. Maybe they \nlive in a bubble. But I see those people. I see them every day. They \nare the salt of the Earth. They are the workshop that takes America \nforward. They are the small businesses across this Nation. All they are \nasking for is a little reasonableness and common sense.\n  Some of my colleagues have said this crisis comes because the \nmajority party in the Senate has refused to negotiate. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth. Negotiation in the budget process starts with \neach side passing a budget resolution and holding a conference \ncommittee. But it is Members of the minority of this Chamber who have \ncome to this floor at least 18 times to block the start of a conference \ncommittee in order to work out the budget. I cannot imagine in my \nwildest dreams why they are terrified of there being a conversation \nbetween leadership in the House and leadership in the Senate, meeting \nwith the television cameras on to work out the details of a budget \ncompromise. But they seem terrified, petrified, scared to death that \nthere will be a conversation between the House and Senate that would \nlead to a compromise.\n  So, indeed, there has been obstruction on compromise, and we know \nexactly where it is. They are the same individuals who are trying to \ndrive the economy over the cliff right now. Moreover, members of this \nparty said let's go further. The Senate has a number. The House has a \nnumber. But the budget conference committee is being blocked. Let's \nsimply accept the House number, and not split it down the middle, not \ninsist on our number, let's take the House number. That is going far \nbeyond the middle path, if you will. That is a major compromise. If you \nare looking for compromise, it is happening with the leadership of the \nSenate putting forward a compromise that takes the House number for the \nbudget. It appears that certain individuals in this body just do not \nwant to take yes for an answer.\n  I am going to conclude my remarks. I see my colleague, the esteemed \nSenator from Illinois has arrived. I want to close with this notion. \nThis is not the first crisis that has been artificially manufactured \nthat has damaged the American economy. Let us remember that similarly \nwe faced this in April 2011 with the continuing resolution. We faced a \nmanufactured crisis with the debt ceiling in July of 2011. We faced the \nDecember 2012 fiscal cliff that did substantial damage; in March of \nthis year, the continuing resolution, which brings us up to right now.\n  This is not all. The same individuals who are threatening at this \nmoment to drive our economy over a cliff are saying we will do it again \nin a couple of weeks over another debt ceiling issue and when this \ncontinuing resolution expires a few weeks from now, if we get one done, \nwe will do it again a few weeks from now--three crises in a period of \njust a few weeks. If you want to destroy the economy for working \nAmericans, this is how it is done, and it is unacceptable. We need a \nbipartisan, commonsense caucus to come together and simply say no to \nthose who are trying to create this terrible blackmail using American \nworking families in the process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, we are just hours away from a government \nshutdown. I think tea party Republicans saw the ``Breaking Bad'' \ndramatic depiction of reckless behavior last night and thought they \ncould put on an even better finale, create even more drama, and cook up \neven more toxic ideas. They thought they could break this government in \nevery bad way possible. These tea party antics are the stuff of fairy \ntales. The way the GOP is writing this story at the stroke of midnight \nas we turn the calendar toward October, our government and potentially \nour economic recovery turn into a pumpkin.\n  But it is the tea party GOP who are in fantasyland by thinking we \nwill allow them to cut off ObamaCare, shut down government, and melt \ndown our economy. Democrats are not going to allow them to do this.\n  What do the American people want? Americans want our military to get \npaid on time. Americans want our seniors to get the benefits they have \nearned and depend on. Americans want to be able to respond to floods in \nColorado or wildfires in the West.\n  The American people don't want the government to shut down. Americans \nwant a business plan that completes this recovery, creates jobs, and \ngets our economy back on track. They want us to work together to \naccomplish this goal.\n  What are the effects of the tea party Republican tactics? By forcing \nCongress to govern by going from crisis to crisis, tea party \nRepublicans hope to chip away at the bedrock programs that run our \ncountry and help our people.\n  First, the tea party did this with sequestration, which is a fancy \nword for mindless cuts in programs that help ordinary families in our \ncountry. Now they are going after the ObamaCare law. What is next are \ntheir enduring targets such as Social Security, Medicare, and the \nsafety net programs that millions of Americans depend on. These are the \nsame Republicans who want to privatize Social Security. They want to \nturn Medicare into a voucher program. Now they want to reverse the \nprogress achieved by the legendary Ted Kennedy, who made it clear that \nin the United States of America health care is a right and not a \nprivilege.\n  The tea party Republicans are playing high-wire politics with our \neconomy so they can take away the social safety net for millions of \nAmerican families. This bill is just a preview of coming attractions. \nTwo weeks from now we will be careening to the next crisis, this time \nover whether America will pay its debts. If we do not raise the debt \nceiling, we will not be able to pay our bills starting on October 17.\n  What is the harm of defaulting on our debts? Our Nation's stock and \nbond markets could go into a free fall that will damage the full faith \nand credit of our country, the bedrock of the entire American economy. \nWhat does that mean? The full faith and credit of the United States is \nin question.\n  If you took out a mortgage, had a car loan, bought some furniture, \nand when the bill came due you said: I am not going to pay these bills, \nwhat do you think would happen? Your credit score would plummet. It \nwould throw your financial life into chaos for years. No one would lend \nyou money, or, at a minimum, you would be hit with sky-high interest \npayments because of the risk that you wouldn't pay the next time \neither.\n\n[[Page S7016]]\n\n  Americans ran up these bills. We promised these payments. We should \npay what we promise, and then we need to stop lurching from one crisis \nto another, scrambling to stitch together last-minute deals that only \nlast until the very next crisis.\n  It is time to end these games. It is time to end the uncertainty. It \nis time to do what we were sent here to do--to get to work creating \njobs for American families so they can have a mortgage and put their \nkids through school. That is what we should be talking about here, the \nprosperity of all Americans.\n  This shutdown today is a preview of a debate over a meltdown of the \nAmerican economy. If, in fact, we go to a debt ceiling and we haven't \nfound a way of working together here on the Senate floor, Democrats and \nRepublicans, along with Democrats and Republicans from the House of \nRepresentatives, those who are in the most jeopardy are those who are \nwatching us with their mouths open, agape, wondering how their system \nof government can operate this way.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield back the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in less than 9 hours, unless there is an \nintervening effort that is successful, the government will shut down. I \nknow people across America are scratching their heads and saying: Why? \nHow did it ever reach this point?\n  I went through O'Hare this morning--I have done that a lot in my \nlife--on my way back to work, and the reaction of people was \ninteresting. People I didn't know walked up to me and said: Hang in \nthere. Good luck. We hope you can do it.\n  I realized people across America are listening and watching this, and \nthey are trying to figure out who is right, who is wrong, and what \ndifference does it make?\n  About an hour ago I was presiding as we took the vote on the latest \nHouse amendments. In the middle of the vote, my staffer came up and \nhanded me an e-mail. The e-mail said there was a House e-mail that was \ncirculating, and here is what it said: After the Senate tables the \nHouse amendments to the CR later this afternoon, and the papers come \nback to the House, we will send it back to the Senate with another \namendment delaying the individual mandate and ObamaCare for a year and \naffect the Members' health subsidy as well.\n  Unfortunately, that message kind of betrays what is going on here. We \nmade it clear on the Senate side that we are sending a clean CR, with \nno political strings attached to it, to extend the government services \nand allow them to continue for at least 6 weeks while we try to work \nthings out on a bipartisan basis. What we keep getting back from the \nHouse of Representatives is all sorts of political strings, such as the \nmedical device tax, ObamaCare, conscience clause when it comes to \nfamily planning. All of these are being thrown back to us as conditions \nfor us if we are going to fund our government.\n  If we want to on the Democratic side, we have the votes to put our \nown conditions on this. I can think of a couple: that the House takes \nup the bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill we passed \nmonths ago here and they have never even addressed in the House. That \nwould be a good one, wouldn't it? At least from my point of view.\n  How about the bipartisan farm bill we passed twice in the Senate that \nthey failed to pass in the House of Representatives for years? Why \nwouldn't we make that one of the conditions? I can think of a few more. \nBut we didn't do it. We sent them a clean CR, a clean spending bill, \nand said to them: Let's extend the functions of government.\n\n  John Kennedy's book, ``Profiles In Courage,'' talks about men and \nwomen who served our Nation and showed extraordinary courage. Some of \nus would like to think that at least once or twice in our public \ncareers we get close to that standard. There is no political courage in \nwhat the House Republicans are doing. They are not standing up, putting \nthemselves at any political risk. They are threatening to shut down the \ngovernment to affect the jobs of hundreds of thousands of innocent \nFederal employees. These are people who get up and go to work every \nsingle day for this country because they love their jobs and they love \nthis country and they do a great job every day. They are viewed with \ndisdain by so many critics of government, but were it not for those men \nand women and the contribution they make, we would not be the great \nNation we are at this moment in time.\n  At midnight tonight--in less than 9 hours--our government will shut \ndown. Many--hundreds of thousands of them--will be told: Don't come to \nwork. If that happens, we will be lesser for it--not just the fact that \nwe cannot produce the services our government needs to produce to help \nour people, and not just the fact that innocent Federal employees will \nlose their paychecks. Many of them will not get paid for the time we \nare losing.\n  But equally important is what it says about us and what it says about \nAmerica. We stand and we say: We are different, and we are proud of \nbeing different. We are the oldest democracy on the face of the Earth. \nWe are, in many ways, different from some other Nations, and we are \nproud of that difference.\n  Sadly, at midnight tonight the difference is not going to be \nsomething of which we can be proud. It is the failure of political \nleaders in Congress to fund the government of the United States of \nAmerica. It is the failure of political leaders in Congress to fund our \ngovernment.\n  What this comes down to is very basic. There is a reason why we have \nelections. There is a reason why ultimately the decision on this issue, \nand all the other issues, will be given to the American people. What I \nask them to do is to watch carefully what is happening in Washington \nand whether they want to continue it.\n  Senator Merkley of Oregon came to the floor and talked about the \nbeginning of this tea party effort and the first threat to shut down \nthe government. This is not altogether new, but it is unusual that we \nface this. Now it is becoming more frequent, more regular, business as \nusual that we are going to shut down the government. That is the tea \nparty approach. That is how they get their attention: 21 hours speaking \non the floor or threatening to shut down the government. I don't think \nthat is the answer to America's future. I think it is a problem.\n  If you listened to Senator Merkley from Oregon, he talked about the \nfact that we passed a budget resolution in the Senate--I thought it was \na good effort--to try to figure out what our spending will be in the \nnext fiscal year. We came up with a number, and the House came up with \na different number. The Founding Fathers of the Constitution \nanticipated that and created an opportunity for the House and Senate to \nwork out their differences through a conference committee.\n  Senator Murray of Washington chairs our Budget Committee. She brought \nthis to the floor and asked for unanimous consent to take this budget \nresolution to the conference committee so we could agree. She brought \nthat request to the floor 6 months ago. The tea party Republicans \nstood--some of the same Republicans we are seeing now--and objected to \nthis meeting. They said: No way. We won't allow this meeting between \nthe Democrats and Republicans.\n  Senator Murray and her backers, on the committee and off, renewed \nthat request over and over and over, and every time the tea party \nRepublicans objected. They did not want us to do the orderly, \nconstitutional thing of sitting down to work out our differences. They \nwanted a confrontation, and now they have it. We were unable to reach a \nbudget number, unable to pass appropriation bills because of their \nobjections, and now we face a government shutdown.\n  If this is what you want as the ordinary course of business in \nWashington, if this is what you want for America and our Federal \nGovernment and the good people who work for it, then keep on voting for \ntea party folks. This is their attitude and their idea. This is their \nidea of the new normal.\n  Well, it shouldn't be the new normal. America is better than this.\n  There is something that is encouraging. There are a handful of \nRepublicans who are finally standing and saying: I have had enough of \nit.\n  Senator John McCain and I disagree on so many things, and agree on a \nfew things, but we are different politically.\n\n[[Page S7017]]\n\nI admire him not just for his service in the Senate but what he has \ngiven to this country. He came to the floor and gave a 10-minute speech \nafter the Texas Senator finished his 21-hour speech. Senator McCain \nmade more sense in 10 minutes than in the 21 hours that preceded it.\n  He said: I don't like ObamaCare. I voted against it. I want to change \nit, but get real; it is the law. It was found to be constitutional by \nthe Court. The President, who authored it, was reelected by 5 million \nvotes in America. That is how a democracy works. Those who won't accept \nObamaCare and want to try to stop it will not accept the verdict of \nthis democracy. We need to go forward and prove it. That was Senator \nMcCain's speech to us. It was a good speech.\n  Upstairs Senator Schumer talked about what we could have done in the \npast. What if we said: Unless all of the Bush tax cuts are repealed, we \nare not going to allow the government to be funded? We didn't do that. \nWe shouldn't have done that. It is not responsible.\n  I hope this doesn't come to pass. I hope at midnight we don't shut \ndown this government. There will be a lot of unhappy people in the \nFederal service, and they don't deserve it. These are innocent people \nwho want to do a good job for this Nation. There will be a lot of \npeople hurt on the outside because they can't have access to government \nservices. There will be things that we will miss doing that will have \nan impact, and we may never know it.\n  What impact will it have at the National Institutes of Health if they \nsuspend medical research until this is over, just put it off a couple \nof days or maybe a couple of weeks if it gets really awful? Then what \nhappens? A delay in finding a cure, a drug, a medical device. All of \nthese things make a difference in the lives of a lot of innocent \npeople. So it is not an act of courage to play politics with the lives \nof other people, with the future of America, and with the future of our \neconomy.\n\n  Yes, this is why we have elections, so the American people can say: \nEnough. We are not going to put up with this anymore. We need to have \nresponsible Republicans and Democrats working together to solve our \nproblems.\n  I think that is why we were sent here, not to lurch from one \nconfrontation to the next.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask to speak in morning business for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, after 5 years of being a parent, I have \ngotten used to temper tantrums. It is an unavoidable part of having \nkids. They demand something--they want a second dessert, they want \nanother 10 minutes before bedtime--and if they don't get it, they storm \nout of the room. That aspect of early human nature--the inability to \ndeal with defeat and the unwillingness to compromise--luckily goes away \nover time as we get older and wiser and more thoughtful--everywhere \nexcept for Washington, DC.\n  By now everybody gets what is going on. As Senator Durbin said, we \nare only a handful of hours away from a government shutdown--another \nmanufactured, made-up, totally avoidable crisis. This one is just \nbecause we can't pass a 6-month continuing resolution. We are having a \nproblem just keeping the government open under the exact same rules \nthat it has been open because a small set of tea party Senators and \nCongressmen are basically throwing a temper tantrum because they \nhaven't gotten their way.\n  It is not news to anybody that Republicans oppose the health care \nlaw. They opposed it back when it was passed by both Chambers and \nsigned by the President. They opposed it when the Supreme Court upheld \nthe legislation. Their Presidential candidate opposed it when he got \nroundly defeated in the 2012 election. My opponent and the opponent of \nevery single Senator who stood for election who voted for the law \nopposed it as well, and every single time they lost.\n  Over and over Republicans have made it clear that they don't like the \nAffordable Care Act. They voted 40 times to repeal it or defund it or \npostpone it in the House of Representatives. This is despite the fact \nthat today the Affordable Care Act is saving millions of seniors \nmillions of dollars because they don't have to pay for drugs in the \ndoughnut hole. This is despite the fact that starting in January it is \ngoing to save millions of people across the country from having to go \ninto bankruptcy because they can't afford their health care. But \nRepublicans are refusing to vote for a budget that will keep the \ngovernment operating unless this health care bill is stopped.\n  For too many of those urging a government shutdown, government has \njust become an abstraction. They have sold themselves on the idea that \ngovernment is so twisted and malignant that shutting it down just \nwouldn't really do anything. After all, if the goal is to starve the \nbeast, then what better way than putting the beast into a coma for a \ncouple of days or a week.\n  But that is not how this works. Government does real things for real \npeople. It provides paychecks for 9,000 people in Connecticut. It pays \nSocial Security benefits and processes claims for disabled veterans. It \ninspects our food. At the NIH, it comes up with cures for diseases. The \nmarkets watch whether the government operates because they actually \nknow that the private sector works better when the public sector is \nworking better. So that is why today the market once again has been \nfalling through the floor, as it will if we move forward with this \nmadness.\n  Just as we don't give in to our kids when they threaten us if we \ndon't give them what they want, America cannot reward this ``my way or \nthe highway'' approach from the tea party. I have strong beliefs, just \nas my tea party Republican friends do, but I also get that I am part of \na majoritarian deliberative body. Senator McCaskill and Senator Durbin \nmade the point, as did the Presiding Officer. We all would love to \nattach things to this continuing resolution. There are 20 grieving \nfamilies in Newtown, CT, who do not understand why 90 percent of the \nAmerican public wants background checks on weapons and we can't pass \nthat in the Senate. I bet some of them would think it might make sense \nfor us to condition our support of the continuing resolution on getting \nbackground checks on gun purchases. Ninety percent of the American \npublic supports that. But we are not doing that. That is not how we \ngovern--hold the entire Federal Government hostage to get what we want.\n  Ultimately, though, this just can't be how this place works. This is \na 6-week continuing resolution. As the Presiding Officer said, it is \njust going to happen 6 weeks from now and 6 weeks after that.\n  I heard that a long time ago this place used to actually be involved \nin the business of running the country. It doesn't feel like that \nanymore. As I sat there on the dais a week ago now watching the middle \nact of Senator Cruz's long, long, long speech, it didn't feel a lot \ndifferent than it has for most days that I have watched the tea party \nover the last several years. It felt as if I were a theater goer.\n  What is happening this week really isn't exceptional. It is just the \nlatest and worst example of a long trendline away from legislating and \ntoward playacting. With rare exceptions usually prompted only by \ndeadlines and cliffs and fake crises, we don't do anything here any \nlonger. We just dig trenches and we make arguments. We pass fake bills. \nWe playact. Occasionally, when the stacks of all the things around us \nare about to come teetering down we stop and we push them back up again \ninstead of thinking for a couple of seconds that if we just stopped, \nsat back, and actually restacked those sets of things so they didn't \ncome crashing down, we would probably be better off. We just play \nparts.\n  There is nobody better at playing their part than the tea party \nRepublicans. Their character is recalcitrant, uncompromising, and \ndestructive, and we have seen all of that on display this week. If we \nget beyond this crisis, we will just see it once again. But there is no \ncurtain call here in Congress after which we can pull back our masks \nand share a good laugh. We are still all going to be left on stage \ntasked with picking up the pieces.\n  I think I am past believing that these folks are just going to start \nplaying a different role. It is time for the American public to start \nasking some questions about people before they send\n\n[[Page S7018]]\n\nthem here: Are you willing to compromise? Are you interested in \nactually running the government? Are you going to score your term based \non whether you deliver for the American people rather than how many \nTwitter followers you have or how many times you showed up on the TV \nnews that week?\n  If this government shuts down tonight, it is just because of a temper \ntantrum or, put another way, a really, really bad play, the third act \nof which has gone on way, way too long.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the unanimous consent request the \nmajority leader just propounded was one a number of my colleagues were \nabout to ask that dealt with a military pay issue, and a number of them \nare here on the floor. I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy \non the issue of protecting military pay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as the Republican leader noted, there are \na number of Members here on the floor who have come en masse from a \nmeeting we just held following the tabling of the latest House proposal \nthat would keep the Federal Government operating and make sure all of \nour uniformed military would continue to get paid, together with the \nother operations of the Federal Government. It is clear that it was \nunder the pressure of the knowledge that we were coming to the floor to \nask for unanimous consent and the knowledge of how, frankly, untenable \nit would be to object to that that the majority leader has quite \nskillfully come to the floor to try to preempt this issue. The truth is \nthat none of us should be under any illusion that the majority leader \nhas done anything other than make it more likely that we will have a \nshutdown of the Federal Government tonight.\n  The House has sent over several reasonable proposals which would keep \nthe Federal Government operating and which would also make sure our \ntroops would be paid--not just uniformed military but other government \npersonnel performing important jobs. Rather than calling us in \nyesterday after the House acted--we know that perhaps the majority \nleader and other Members enjoyed watching a little bit of professional \nfootball yesterday--they waited until this afternoon to cut the legs \nout from under the House proposal and make it much more likely that the \ngovernment will shut down.\n  The House worked late into the night this weekend to draft a \ncompromise proposal that would fund the government and avert a \nshutdown. The House Members sent the proposal over to the Senate, and \nthe majority leader did nothing until today--no emergency session, no \nbipartisan negotiations.\n  There is a report in Politico that President Obama was suggesting \ncalling the leadership in both of the Houses--Republicans and Democrats \nalike--to the White House to have a meeting to say: What can we do to \nsolve this impasse? If the story is to be believed, it was Harry Reid \nwho shut that down, just as he is going to be responsible for shutting \ndown the Federal Government by the actions he took earlier today.\n  So the question is, Who is really being unreasonable? Who is really \nbeing stubborn? Who is really seeking to gain partisan advantage over \nthe best interests of the country?\n  Of course, we know the President has been eager to negotiate with the \nPresident of Iran about a very serious issue: Iran's nuclear \naspirations, but he will not talk to the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives or the Republican leader of the Senate. He will not \ntalk to them, but he will negotiate with the Iranian President.\n  He seems absolutely allergic to doing his job. He can give a heck of \na speech. He is a skillful orator. But when it comes to actually doing \nhis job, he is missing in action. He will not negotiate over a \ngovernment shutdown, and he will not negotiate over raising the debt \nlimit.\n  In the past, President Obama has urged Republicans to offer just a \nlittle bit of compromise when he likes to be the voice of reason. But \nnow he himself refuses to engage in any sort of negotiation and refuses \nto offer any kind of compromise whatsoever.\n  Is it possible the President of the United States thinks his own \nhealth care law is perfect in every way? Seventy-nine Members of this \nbody voted against the medical device tax. The House could pass that \npiece of legislation and send it over here and attach it to the \ncontinuing resolution. The President himself has repeatedly delayed \ndifferent provisions of the health care law, including the employer \nmandate. What we would like to do is get the same break for the rest of \nthe American people as he gave businesses.\n  The bill that was passed by the House of Representatives would have \ndelayed ObamaCare for 1 year, and it would also have repealed the \nmedical device tax, which is already killing jobs and hammering medical \ninnovation.\n  Now we are being told that those sort of very same proposals, which \nmirror the same proposals the President has unilaterally taken or which \nare supported by a bipartisan majority of the Senate--they are called \nan act of extremism.\n  What is more extreme, trying to negotiate through an impasse to \nresolve this issue of the Federal Government functioning or to refuse \nto negotiate, to stonewall against any reasonable proposal by the House \nand to make it more likely that the Federal Government will shut down \ntonight? I ask who is being more unreasonable and more stubborn?\n  We know the clock is ticking. The American people are absolutely \ndisgusted. I share their frustration. I can only hope cooler heads will \nprevail among our friends on the other side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I appreciate being part of the colloquy \nwith the Senator from Texas, and I was listening to his comments.\n  I remember being asked by Senator McConnell and the House Speaker \nJohn Boehner to speak on behalf of Republicans at the President's \nhealth care summit 3 years ago about the new\n\n[[Page S7019]]\n\nhealth care law. I was the first speaker there and since that time have \ndone my best to try to void its passage and then to repeal and replace \nit.\n  But I'm not in the shut down the government crowd. I'm in the let's-\ntake-over-the-government crowd and elect a number of more Republicans \nand even a Republican President who agrees with us and who wants a \ndifferent kind of health care law, one that introduces choice and \ncompetition and that actually reduces health care costs for most \nAmericans.\n  What bothers me so much about this impasse today is the effect it \nmight have on our military men and women around the world. I'm trying \nto imagine what it must be like for someone fighting in Afghanistan \nwhose check might be late, whose spouse is at Fort Campbell, and whose \nmortgage is due today or tomorrow or the next day, or what if the \nDepartment of Defense school closes there and that spouse has a job and \nno childcare? These are very practical problems we need to be thinking \nabout. We need not be thinking about shutting down the government. We \nneed to be thinking about a way to fund the government and change the \nhealth care law at the same time.\n  Now, the House of Representatives has tried once and now is trying it \nagain to make a reasonable offer. These discussions are all about \ncompromise, about taking suggestions that come from one body to the \nother body and taking what you can. So if they have come back and said: \nWell, the United States Senate had 79 Senators, including many \nDemocrats, who voted to repeal the medical device tax. And they said: \nLet's delay the individual mandate for a year.\n  I'm surprised the President himself has not done that. The President \nhimself has delayed seven provisions, major provisions in the health \ncare law, including the employer mandate. The regulations aren't ready. \nThe program is supposed to start tomorrow. It would seem to me it would \nactually be to the President's benefit, as well as the country's \nbenefit, to say instead of just delaying parts and exempting these \npeople, let's get it right. Let's delay it for 1 year.\n  That is what the House of Representatives, the Republican House, has \nsaid to the Senate. They have said let's repeal the medical device tax, \na particularly onerous 2.3% tax on top of revenues that increases the \ncost of medical devices for millions of Americans. We all agree we \nought to get rid of it--79 of us do anyway, including about as many \nDemocrats as Republicans. And the President himself has acknowledged \nthis law isn't ready. The chairman of the Democratic Committee that \nwrote it says it is a coming train wreck.\n  So it seems to me this is a reasonable suggestion from the House of \nRepresentatives to say let's work on getting rid of ObamaCare, that is \nwhat we would like to do, or changing it, that is what they would like \nto do to make it work, but let's fund the government. Let's not run the \nrisk that one single soldier fighting in Afghanistan has a paycheck \nthat is one day late because his spouse is home in Fort Campbell and \nthe mortgage can't be paid or the Department of Defense School is \nclosed and there is no childcare for the spouse who has a job while her \nhusband or his wife is fighting overseas. Now, that's something we \nshould not allow to happen, whether it's Republicans or Democrats.\n  It may be that the majority leader agrees with that and he has \nbrought that up and we have brought that up, but we should do more than \nbring up political points. People expect us to act like adults, work \ntogether, come to a result, so we can change the health care law and we \ncan keep the government going.\n  I've said for three years that instead of the historic mistake we \npassed which expanded health care delivery systems that already cost \ntoo much, we should go step by step to have a health care law that \nactually reduces health care costs: Make Medicare solvent instead of \ntaking one-half trillion dollars out of it for other programs. Give \nMedicaid more flexibility so Governors can serve more people. Repeal \nthe medical device tax. Make it easier for employers who want to help \nemployees have a healthier lifestyle so they can have cheaper \ninsurance. Allow people to buy insurance across state lines. Allow \nsmall businesses to pool their resources and offer insurance. I have \nlisted a half dozen already, steps we could agree on that would reduce \nhealth care costs in the country.\n  I'm not in the shut down the government crowd, and neither are most \neverybody I know around here. We are in the take-over-the-government \ncrowd, and let's elect enough Republicans and a Republican President to \nchange the health care law.\n  But in the meantime, we should make absolutely sure that men and \nwomen, whether on Active Duty or in the National Guard, not on Active \nDuty at this time, we should make sure they are paid on the day they \nare supposed to be paid and their spouses are not waiting for the \ncheck.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas for engaging in this colloquy, and I \nwish to join him in this effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, thank you.\n  The idea that ObamaCare--the Affordable Health Care Act--over time \nwill be seen in history as having been a good thing for the American \npeople, I guess that is a bit in doubt. The President keeps saying \nthere will come a day when we will look back and claim to have voted \nfor this. Maybe he is right. Maybe that day, around the bend, down the \nroad, over the hill, is there.\n  All I can say is don't we know enough now about the Affordable Health \nCare Act--ObamaCare--to slow down, take a time out, and see if we can \nmake it better? Because the problems associated with the act are real. \nWe do not need any more information. We do not need any more time. We \njust need to fix it in a bipartisan fashion. We passed it in a partisan \nfashion. Can we begin to look at the law anew in a bipartisan fashion? \nAmerica would be better off.\n  What do we know? We know a lot of people are working 29 hours, when \nthey had 40-hour work. If you do not believe me, ask the unions. I \nnever thought I would live to say this: Just listen to the unions. I do \nnot say that a lot about their positions, but they are telling the \nPresident and anybody who will listen that ObamaCare--the Affordable \nHealth Care Act--is denying the 40-hour workweek. Why can't we do \nsomething about that?\n  The medical device manufacturers, the people who do all the very neat \nthings to make life better, particularly for people who have been \ndevastated in Iraq and Afghanistan, coming up with ways to make better \nthe lives of people who had catastrophic injury--thirty-four of our \nDemocratic friends have said this tax is not a good idea for that \nsector of the economy.\n  So the jury is in on enough for us to slow down and start over and \nget this thing right. The good news for today is that we are not going \nto agree to blame each other. They are not going to accept blame. We \nare not going to accept blame about where we are. But the one thing \ntoday is I think we have solved the problem, at least partially, for \nthe military. The people on the civilian side who work for the \nmilitary, I do not know if they are covered.\n  But I want America to understand that the Congress did something \nappropriate just a few minutes ago; that is, to tell the men and women \nin the military: Do not worry about this debacle up here in Washington \nwhen it comes to your paycheck. You are going to get paid. I will talk \nlater on down the road about what kind of military we are handing to \nthe next generation, what kind of funding we have for the military and \nhow smart sequestration is.\n  But I just want to ask my colleagues, don't we know enough already \nabout the Affordable Health Care Act to stop and work together before \nwe plunge on, because it starts tomorrow. I do not know why our \nDemocratic friends are so insistent that we cannot take a timeout, \nstart over, and see if we can find some bipartisan consensus. Until we \ndo that, this problem only gets worse.\n  I would conclude with this thought: The Democratic Party came up with \nthe Affordable Care Act. They passed it on a party-line vote. But this \nthing is just not helping Democrats or hurting Republicans, it is \nhurting the economy as a whole.\n  So the one thing I can tell you about big ideas: When one party \npushes it through and nobody else on the other side signs up, we need \nto be wary about that product.\n\n[[Page S7020]]\n\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I see my colleague from Texas who gave a \nvery high-profile speech for about 21 hours the other night on the \nsubject of ObamaCare. I know he feels passionately about it, and his \nefforts have captured the imagination of the American people and \nreminded them of the various failures of this piece of legislation, \nsome of which we have talked about perhaps fixing in the course of this \nping-ponging of the continuing resolution.\n  But I might ask him, through the Chair, there have been so many \nfailures, so many promises that have been made about ObamaCare that are \nobviously not going to be kept--things such as, if you like what you \nhave, you can keep it. I think that is one of the complaints the \nSenator from South Carolina mentioned earlier, that organized labor--\nMr. Trumka, among others--went to the White House to get a special \ncarve-out for. We were told the President said: The average family of \nfour would see a reduction of $2,500 in the cost of their health care, \nand that had not proven to be true--so many promises that have not been \nkept, so many broken promises, so many reasons why we ought to be \nworking together through the course of this to fix it.\n  So I would ask my colleague, through the Chair, perhaps he can list a \nfew more reasons why he believes we need to be dealing with ObamaCare.\n  I know his preferred method was defunding ObamaCare. I know he has \nnot given up on that. I am a cosponsor of his legislation that would \naccomplish that. But I would ask my colleague, through the Chair, if he \nmight comment on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, the majority leader is \nto be recognized at 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was happy to ask unanimous consent to pass \nthe bill that we just passed to ensure that the troops will be paid. \nBut I do disagree with the remarks of my Republican colleagues and much \nof what they said in the last few minutes.\n  Let's talk about what was in this amendment that they sent us, this \nmessage they sent to us. Among other things, here is what it had in it: \nA provision--this is hard to comprehend, but listen to this--that would \nallow any employer, insurance plan or individual to refuse to cover any \nof the women's health preventative services that were included by \nSenator Mikulski in her women's health amendment, things like \ncontraception, for virtually any reason during the 1-year delay.\n  That was in their amendment. It was spoken of clearly--I will talk \nabout it a little later--by a cancer survivor in the House of \nRepresentatives, Debbie Wasserman Schultz. It would have an adverse \neffect on cancer survivors, on women. That is one thing they did. There \nhas been a lot of talk here about the medical devices revenue issue. \nThis is something that we will take a look at. We need to do that. But \nremember this magnanimous offer to get rid of this by the Republicans \nin the House and in the Senate would run up the debt by $30 billion. \nHow do you like that? $30 billion. No offset. No pay-go. What does it \nmatter? They are fixated on ObamaCare. I mean fixated on it.\n  My friend from Texas referred to it as a bill. It is not a bill. It \nis the law. It has been for 4 years. My friend from Tennessee said he \nthinks that this should be resolved by having a Republican President. \nLess than a year ago, the American people took a look at that. The No. \n1 issue in the campaign: ObamaCare. That was the No. 1 issue.\n  Overwhelmingly, the American people said: We reject the Republicans' \nefforts to get rid of it. Republicans always oppose big things. They \nopposed Social Security. They opposed Medicare. I have carried with me \nfor 25 years--I have it in my wallet here, and it is getting old and \nfrayed. But here is what it says:\n\n       I was there fighting the fight, one of 12 voting against \n     Medicare because we knew it would not work in 1965.\n\n  Senator Dole.\n\n       Now, we did not get rid of it in round one because we do \n     not think it's politically smart. But we believe Medicare is \n     going to wither on the vine.\n\n  Newt Gingrich.\n\n       Medicare has no place in a free world. Social Security is a \n     rotten trick. I think we are going to have to bite the bullet \n     on Social Security and phase it out over time.\n\n  Former leader in the House Dick Armey.\n  They opposed Social Security and they opposed Medicare. But even \nthough they opposed it, Social Security is popular with Democrats, \nRepublicans, and Independents. Medicare is popular. Why is it popular? \nMy first elected job was on a big hospital district in Nevada. It was \nan indigent hospital, in some frame of reference.\n  But 40 percent of the people that were senior citizens that were \nadmitted to that hospital had no health insurance. We made sure that \nsomebody vouched for their hospital bill: father, mother, son, brother, \nneighbor. If they did not pay, we went after them. We had a big \ncollection agency in the hospital.\n  The reason they like Medicare is because today virtually 100 percent \nof seniors that come into a hospital have Medicare. That is why they \nlike it.\n  ObamaCare. Tomorrow in Nevada 600,000 people will have the \nopportunity to sign up on the exchanges. By the way, the exchanges were \nestablished by a Republican Governor, Brian Sandoval. People there can \nbuy--some people can buy health insurance for $100, people who have \nnothing. Just give this ObamaCare a little time, and it will be looked \nback at as Social Security and Medicare. Right now, people love what \nthey are able to get off this. I will go through some of that stuff.\n  Let's review where we are. This weekend Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives did what we all feared they would do; they voted to \nshut down the government. Republicans knew their empty political stunt \nwould fall on its face in the Senate. It did. Yet they voted to hold \nthe government hostage until Democrats agree to return to the days when \ninsurance companies put profits before patient care. That is the way it \nwas.\n  Their vote was strikingly irresponsible and stunningly callous. \nRepublicans do not seem to understand that stripping health insurance \nfrom millions of Americans would literally cost lives. Maybe none of \nthose Republicans have received a doctor's bill that they could not \npay. Maybe none of those Republicans spent a night awake worrying about \nwhether a heart attack or a car accident would drive them into \nbankruptcy or what they would do with their mom or their dad, their \nbrother or sister who has no health insurance and who is sick.\n  Millions of Americans have experienced the fears I just described. \nFor a glimpse of just how little regard Republicans have for struggling \nAmerican families, look no further than the chief Senate rabble rouser, \nSenator Ted Cruz. Listen to this. He told David Gregory of Meet the \nPress how easy it is for the average American to get health insurance, \neven during these difficult times. Here is what he said: ``If you want \npeople to get health insurance, the best way for them to get health \ninsurance is to get a job.'' That is what he said. I am not making this \nup.\n  His comment comes at a time when more than 11 million Americans are \nstill struggling to find work and when millions more who already have \njobs still lack health insurance. That is why we passed ObamaCare in \nthe first place, to ensure access to quality, affordable health \ninsurance for all Americans.\n  To Republicans, ObamaCare is a punch line to rile up their base. But \nfor American families, ObamaCare is not a punch line, it is a lifeline. \nFor millions of Americans, the Affordable Care Act is the only option \nto access quality health care at an affordable price. I have indicated \nthat 600,000 uninsured Nevadans who are eligible to purchase insurance \nfrom Nevada's Health Link beginning tomorrow.\n\n  ObamaCare means access to affordable doctors and hospital stays, \nprescription drugs, and more. Uninsured Nevadans will have access to \ngood insurance plans that cost as little as $100 a month. In fact, many \nNevadans will get quality coverage for less than they pay for their \nmonthly cell phone bill. Republicans would rip that lifeline away.\n  Republicans want to return to the days when insurance companies could \ndiscriminate against women. Why? Because they are women. I am not \nmaking that up. That is the way it was. That is how it was before \nObamaCare.\n\n[[Page S7021]]\n\n  Republicans want to return to the days when insurance companies could \ndeny care because of preexisting conditions, like diabetes, epilepsy, \nand breast cancer. Even acne was a preexisting condition. Again, I am \nnot making this up. That is the way it was before ObamaCare.\n  Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, she is a breast cancer \nsurvivor. Sunday, I saw her say on the House floor that Republicans are \ntrying to ``make sure that every single day . . . each of us who \nsurvived cancer or another life-threatening illness . . . stay living \nin fear for an insurance company to boot you off your insurance.''\n  That is what it would do. I am not making this up. That is the way it \nwas before ObamaCare. They want to return to the days when even \nchildren could be denied lifesaving coverage because they were born \nwith a heart murmur or some other disability. Again, I am not making \nthis up. That was the way it was before ObamaCare.\n  They want to return to the days when insurance companies could \novercharge you when you were well and drop your policy when you were \nsick. That is the way it was. I am not making it up. That is the way it \nwas before ObamaCare.\n  Because of the Affordable Care Act, millions of seniors are saving \nmoney on prescription drugs. No one can dispute that. The doughnut hole \nis being filled. That is all because of the Affordable Care Act. \nMillions of seniors are saving money on prescription drugs and many \nother things. Seniors today at no cost can go get a wellness check. \nThey could never do that before.\n  Millions of young people are staying on their parents' insurance. \nDoes the presiding officer know how important that is? I will tell you \nhow important it is. In the little town of Searchlight where I am from, \na woman who was assistant postmaster retired and her husband retired. \nThey have a son Jeff. He is going to school. He was going to school at \na community college. He had to go off his parents' insurance when he \nturned 23.\n  Within a few weeks of his turning 23, he was sick. He did not know \nwhat was wrong. But he went to the doctor. He had testicular cancer. He \nhad to interrupt his education. He had three surgeries, and his parents \nstruggled to pay for that. They are not people of means. One doctor \nfriend of mine did one of the surgeries for nothing. But other people \ndid not have the benefit of my being able to help them or parents like \nhis who struggled to take care of their son. That is why more of that \nwill not happen. Again, the Jeff Hill story, I am not making it up. \nThat is the way it was before ObamaCare.\n  Because of the Affordable Care Act millions of seniors are saving \nmoney. That is the way it is. I have said that. Millions of young \npeople are staying on their parents' insurance, and hundreds of \nthousands of businesses that already offer their employees health \ninsurance are getting tax credits for doing the right thing.\n  But the Republicans want to turn back the clock on all of these \nbenefits and more. They want to force more than 25 million families to \nonce again rely on crowded, expensive emergency rooms or go without the \nlifesaving care they need. Many of them go without that care.\n  That is how it was before ObamaCare. Unless Democrats agree to all of \ntheir demands, unless we agree to strip tens of millions of Americans \nof their health insurance and force tens of millions more to live in \nfear, they will shut down the government. That is where we are headed. \nWhy do you think the Republicans came over here thinking by some reason \nwe would not agree to fund the troops? They know that Boehner is going \nto shut down the government. The House of Representatives could have \nvoted yesterday--they could vote today--to keep the government running.\n  But they are going to vote, I am sure, to shut it down. Many House \nRepublicans have admitted that Speaker Boehner has the votes to pass a \nclean bill to keep the government open and functioning. Here is what \nRepublican Raul Labrador from Idaho said. He said this on Meet the \nPress:\n\n       I am not willing to vote for a clean continuing resolution. \n     But I think there are enough votes in the Republican party \n     who are willing to do that. I think that is what you are \n     going to see.\n\n  Republican Congressman Charlie Dent from Pennsylvania, here is what \nhe said: ``I am prepared to vote for a clean resolution tomorrow. . . \n.''\n  That is today. He said that yesterday.\n  It is time to govern. I don't intend to support the fool's errand--\nand it is a fool's errand. That is what he called it and that is what \nit is.\n  These reasonable Republicans are correct. The House easily could and \nshould pass a clean continuing resolution today. All Speaker Boehner \nhas to do is let every Member of the House of Representatives, \nDemocrats and Republicans, all 435 of them vote on a clean CR, and it \nwould pass big time. The Speaker has another opportunity to do the \nright thing.\n  This afternoon, the Senate voted to strip the hollow political ransom \nnotes from the House. We rejected the House amendments. The House has \nwhat we passed. They have had it since last Friday. The Republicans \nwill face the same choice tonight, this afternoon, or this evening, \nwhenever they choose, as they did this weekend, to pass the Senate's \nclean bill to keep the government functioning or force a government \nshutdown. Democrats have already met Republicans in the middle and \nagreed to their lower funding level even though Republicans have \nrefused to negotiate a responsible budget for more than 6 months.\n  Let's talk about what a lot of my Republican friends have talked \nabout this afternoon. They need more time to negotiate. Democrats have \nalready met Republicans in the middle.\n  Senator Murray, the chairperson of our Budget Committee--because the \nRepublicans said they wanted it and it was the right thing to do, and \nwe acknowledged that, we passed a budget 6 months ago. Where are the \nRepublicans in this 6 months, a half a year? Why couldn't we go to \nconference? Because they wouldn't let us.\n  What has happened and why they can't take yes for an answer is hard \nfor me to understand. Our number was a lot higher than theirs. We took \ntheir lower number.\n  Senator Murray doesn't like it; Senator Mikulski doesn't like it. We \ntook their lower number, 98. Why can't they take yes for an answer?\n  In addition, all these people who whine that we haven't done any \nnegotiating--how many times has the President taken Republican Senators \nto dinner at the White House, this restaurant, and that restaurant?\n  What did he do? He put in writing what he was willing to do. Many of \nus were concerned that he had given far too much. We didn't like it, \nbut that is what the President did because he wants a deal. He wants \nsomething big to help the government.\n  All of these meals that he paid for, have we gotten anything from the \nRepublicans? Not a single sentence. Not a single sentence. They refused \nto put anything in writing.\n  Let's not talk about not negotiating. We have negotiated, negotiated, \nand negotiated. The last 2 weeks, we have had enough, and we are not \ngoing to negotiate. That is where we are.\n  For shrill Republicans in the House to demand more time to negotiate \nis simply ludicrous. I looked up today what ludicrous means. It means \ncomically ridiculous. That is a good definition. When I put in \nludicrous, I wasn't sure what it meant. I wanted to make sure I had the \nright word and I got it--comically ridiculous.\n  The President met with Republicans at the White House over dinner and \nother places. He has given a list of difficult cuts he is willing to \nmake to reduce the deficit, but Republicans haven't reciprocated. They \nhave never once put down in writing what they are willing to concede, \nnot once. Democrats are through negotiating with ourselves. This is \nwhat it amounts to.\n  The fate of our country and our economy now rests with John Boehner. \nTonight we will see whether the Speaker is willing to shut down our \ngovernment and risk our economic recovery to extract callous political \nconcessions. I hope he makes a responsible decision. I doubt that he \nwill, but I hope he does, and helps avert a government shutdown.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, it is no secret that the majority leader \nHarry Reid and I disagree on a great many\n\n[[Page S7022]]\n\ntopics. Yet I rise today in praise of Senator Reid. In particular, I \nwish to praise Senator Reid for agreeing to pass the bill the House of \nRepresentatives passed at 12:30 in the morning yesterday that would \nfund our military.\n  For weeks President Obama and Senate Democrats have been threatening \nto hold in jeopardy the paychecks of the men and women of our military \nif there is a government shutdown. I commend the majority leader for \nagreeing to pass it, for not objecting, for not standing in the way.\n  For everyone who thinks that compromise is impossible in Washington, \nthat working together is impossible in Washington, I would point to \nthis as an example. That bill passed the House of Representatives \nunanimously. It came over to the Senate, and a few minutes ago we all \nsaw it pass the Senate unanimously. It should be able to be on \nPresident Obama's desk for signature by tonight.\n  That is exactly as it should be. The soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines who risk their lives defending our Nation should not have their \npaychecks held hostage to any potential government shutdown in \nWashington. I salute the majority leader for doing the right thing. I \nsalute the Senate Democrats for not blocking the paychecks of the men \nand women in the military, taking them off the table and saying, \nregardless of what happens, we are going to pay our troops. That was \nthe right thing to do.\n  I also note, for those who would like to see a resolution of this \nimpasse, I, for one, don't wish to see a government shutdown. I think \nit is unfortunate that the majority leader seems bound and determined \nto force a government shutdown. In the course of the past several weeks \nwe have seen the House of Representatives repeatedly attempt to \ncompromise. In my view and the view of a great many Republicans is that \nObamaCare is a disaster, a train wreck, a nightmare. Of those last two \nterms, the term train wreck comes from the Democratic Senator who was \nthe lead author of ObamaCare. Nightmare is the term that was used by \nTeamsters president James Hoffa.\n  My view is we should repeal it in its entirety. I would note that was \nnot my starting position on this debate. It was not the starting \nposition of the House of Representatives. Instead, they started with \nthe position that it should be defunded, which itself represented a \ncompromise. The House of Representatives passed a bill to fund the \nentire Federal Government, every bit of it, except for ObamaCare and to \ndefund ObamaCare.\n  They sent it over to the Senate and what did the majority leader, \nwhat did the Democrats do on a straight party-line vote? Every Democrat \nvoted no, absolutely not. We reject it in its entirety. They voted, in \neffect, to force us into a shutdown.\n  The House of Representatives was not done with that. They came back \nat 12:30 in the morning late Saturday night, early Sunday morning and \npassed yet another continuing resolution that represented a second \ncompromise where yet again the House said, we want to fund the \ngovernment, we don't want to shut down, we want to keep government \ngoing. Instead of defunding, which is what the House preferred, the \nHouse instead said: Let's delay ObamaCare, let's delay it. President \nObama has already delayed it for giant corporations. He has already \nexempted Members of Congress. Both of those actions were contrary to \nlaw.\n  The House of Representatives said let's delay it for ordinary \nfamilies the same way it has been delayed for big companies. It \nshouldn't be the case that giant corporations get treated better by the \nFederal Government than hard-working American families.\n  That was a compromise, and it was a compromise even though the Senate \nunder Majority Leader Reid had not compromised at all and held an \nabsolutist position. At 12:30 in the morning, early Sunday morning, the \nHouse voted on that.\n  Did the Senate come back yesterday? No, we did not. The majority \nleader could have called the Senate back. We should have called the \nSenate back. We were only 48 hours away from a government shutdown, but \napparently the majority leader made the decision it was more important \nfor Senators to be home on vacation, home playing golf, home doing \nanything but being here on the floor of the Senate doing the people's \nbusiness.\n  Instead, many Senators came back today. We voted only a couple of \nhours ago and once again Majority Leader Reid and every single Senate \nDemocrat voted to shut down the government, responded to the House's \nsecond compromise--not with any discussion, any compromise, not with \nany middle ground, but simply said no.\n  The position of the Senate Democrats is absolutely not. Are we going \nto listen to the millions of young people coming out of schools who are \nnot able to find jobs because of ObamaCare? The majority leader says \nno. Are we going to listen to the millions of single moms who are \nstruggling to feed their kids and finding themselves forcibly put into \n29 hours a week because of ObamaCare? The majority leader says no. Are \nwe going to listen to millions of recent immigrants who are struggling \nto provide for their families and facing skyrocketing health insurance \npremiums? The majority leader says no. Are we going to listen to \nmillions of retirees, people with disabilities, and spouses who are \ncovered on their spouse's health insurance plans, all of whom are \nlosing or at risk of losing their health insurance? The majority leader \nsays no.\n  Instead, the majority leader shared with this body that I was--and I \nwrote this down--the ``chief Senate rabble-rouser.'' I am not entirely \nsure what that is. I wasn't aware that was an official designation.\n  I would note previously the majority leader from the floor of the \nSenate had described me as a ``schoolyard bully.''\n  It is entirely the majority leader's prerogative if he views the way \nto carry out his job as engaging in personal insult and ad hominem \nattacks. I, for one, do not intend to reciprocate.\n  I note that what he seems most dismayed about is in the past 2 weeks \nthe voices of the American people have begun to be heard in this body. \nIn the past 2 weeks the voices of millions of Americans losing their \nhealth insurance, losing their jobs, being forced into part-time work, \nmillions of Americans who are struggling, have begun to be heard. We \nhave begun to make DC listen. Apparently, the voices from our \nconstituents, from the men and women of America, apparently to the \nmajority leader, constitute ``rabble-rousing.'' I have a different view \nof what our responsibility is.\n  I would also note that the majority leader told us only moments ago, \n``We have had enough. We are not going to negotiate.''\n  I find that quite remarkable because to date it has been the House of \nRepresentatives that has been negotiating, that has been compromising \nand has been trying to find a way to resolve this so we can keep the \ngovernment running and at the same time answer millions of Americans \nwho have been hurting. The answer from the majority leader over and \nover has been no, no, no, we will not compromise, we will not talk.\n  As the majority leader said, he hasn't compromised yet and he doesn't \nintend even to negotiate. This is unfortunate.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I yield to the Senator from Texas for a question.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The Senator has described accurately the back-and-forth \nbetween the absolutist position the majority leader has taken that says \nnothing can change ObamaCare because apparently he thinks it is \nabsolutely perfect--we shouldn't change a letter, even though, as the \nSenator pointed out, a number of ObamaCare's biggest advocates are now \ncoming back and saying it is a nightmare. I think the Senator quoted \nJimmy Hoffa as one of them.\n  But is the Senator aware, reportedly, the House is going to be voting \nlater on today and be changing once again the continuing resolution and \nsending it back over here? This time the report is that they will vote \nto delay the individual mandate to make it match--as the Senator points \nout, the employer mandate that has already been unilaterally delayed by \nthe President, in an act of lawlessness. Unfortunately, it is not an \nisolated event.\n  Then the Vitter language, which will overturn the Office of Personnel \nManagement interpretation, which basically carves out Congress and \ncongressional staff from the law that would apply to everyone else, \nstrikes me as\n\n[[Page S7023]]\n\nanother attempt by the House to enter into some negotiation.\n  Would the Senator care to venture a guess as to what sort of good-\nfaith attempt by the House to keep negotiations open--what that will \nlead to? I would be interested in the Senator's observation about \nwhether he believes, as I do, that Senator Reid is marching toward a \ngovernment shutdown. Nothing the House does, nothing the House passes \nwill deter him from shutting down the Federal Government at midnight \ntonight.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend, the senior Senator from Texas. I think \nhe is exactly right. Indeed, the conduct of the majority leader, as it \nhas recently been reported in the press, the majority leader advised \nPresident Obama do not even engage in conversations or negotiations \nwith congressional leaders.\n  As the senior Senator from Texas observed, the House is repeatedly \ntrying to solve this problem to keep the government funded and to do it \nin a way that responds to the millions of people who are hurting under \nObamaCare.\n  The answer for the majority leader over and over and over has simply \nbeen, no, we will not talk, we will not negotiate, we will not \ncompromise, we will not listen to the American people.\n  I am reminded of the old philosophical question: If a tree falls in \nthe woods and no one is around to hear, does it make a noise?\n  Likewise, if the House endeavors to compromise responsibly, and the \nmajority leader and the President refuse to participate at all, can you \nsolve the problem?\n  Ultimately, the only way to solve the problem is for Washington to \nlisten to the people. If Majority Leader Reid insists on forcing a \ngovernment shutdown, then we may face a government shutdown. I think \nthat is an irresponsible course of action.\n  If the House of Representatives acts tonight, I believe this Senate \nshould come back immediately and pass the continuing resolution, \nwhatever the House passes. I don't know what it will be, but it will be \nyet another good-faith effort to keep the government running and to \naddress the train wreck of a law that is ObamaCare, and I very much \nhope this body begins to listen to the people.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we have listened to the people. I recall \nwe had a Presidential election. We had two people running in a bad \neconomy. Normally, the nonincumbent would win. That was a Republican. \nHe ran on the platform: I will repeal ObamaCare if you elect me \nPresident. He was actually ahead in the polls when he started saying \nthat, but we all know what happened--he lost disastrously. Did the \nAmerican people speak? Yes, they spoke pretty clearly on that one.\n  Now, the other body has voted countless times to repeal the \nAffordable Care Act. They all get out their press releases and talk \nabout how they stand up against the Affordable Care Act as they vote to \nrepeal it 40 times knowing it will go nowhere.\n  Wouldn't it make a lot more sense if the other body's leadership \nsaid: Look, we lost the Presidential election saying we were running on \ndoing away with ObamaCare. The American people shut us down on that. We \nhave become the butt of late-night jokes every time we vote like this.\n  Maybe it would help if their leadership said: Why don't we take 10 \nRepublicans, 10 Democrats, and those folks can deliberate and suggest \nhow we can make improvements to ObamaCare. If they have improvements, \nthey can bring it back by June, and we can vote those specific \nimprovements up or down. We have already shown that after 40 votes to \nrepeal and a Presidential election, we are not going to get rid of it. \nIf they have improvements, let's debate and vote on them. That would \nmake some sense.\n  Or we could return to regular order and between now and the end of \nthe year, we could vote up or down on every single appropriations bill \nso we are on record as voting yes or no.\n  Instead, we have a small group of extremists insisting on shutting \ndown the Federal Government, putting their own political agenda ahead \nof the rest of the country, throwing people out of work, costing \nhundreds of billions and making the United States look like the \nlaughing stock of the world. The obsession with defunding or delaying \nthe Affordable Care Act, which will continue to be implemented in the \nevent of a government shutdown, is out of touch and it poses serious \nthreats for our economy and the well-being of thousands of hardworking \nFederal employees and those who rely on important government services.\n  Defunding or delaying the Affordable Care Act will do nothing to \nsolve our fiscal troubles. In fact, some repeals sought by House \nRepublicans will add $30 billion to our national deficit. It is a shame \nthat some members who claim to be concerned about wasteful spending are \nwilling to throw away the billions of dollars that a government \nshutdown will cost, all simply to prevent access to affordable health \ncare for Americans.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, will the Senator from Vermont yield for \na question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course I will yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator from Vermont, I just missed \nSenator Cruz. I was rushing down from my office to ask the junior \nSenator from Texas a question, which I have asked him repeatedly. He \nhas come to the floor and spoken at great length about why ObamaCare \nand the health care reform act is unnecessary for Americans. What I \nread is that 40 million Americans as of tomorrow will be able to shop \non these insurance exchanges to buy their health insurance.\n  He has also spoken--as the other Senator from Texas did--about \nMembers of Congress and their own health insurance. I have asked the \njunior Senator, Senator Cruz of Texas, to tell us about his health \ninsurance. He has told us he is not in the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program. Since he is addressing the health insurance of \nmillions of Americans, I think it is not unreasonable for him to \ndisclose publicly what his health insurance is, how much he is paying \nfor it, and how much the employer contribution is on his health \ninsurance.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much of a tax break he is getting on it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is a reasonable question. I am prepared to disclose \nthat, and I think most Members are.\n  So I say to the Senator from Vermont, shutting down the government to \nkeep the American people--40 million uninsured people--away from the \nopportunity under the Affordable Care Act is hardly the kind of work we \nwant to be part of.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont for his leadership on so many \nissues, and I thank him for coming here today in personal witness to \nthe need for good medical care, even for Senators.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my colleague.\n  The Senator from Illinois has heard me mention--and with pride--the \ntime I was able to serve in law enforcement as a prosecutor. Well, I \nwas talking to some police officers in Vermont this weekend. They were \nsaying: What happens here in Vermont? Will the Department of Homeland \nSecurity discontinue the training it provides for state and local law \nenforcement?\n  As the other distinguished Senator from Vermont knows, in a small \nState such as ours, support from federal agencies for our law \nenforcement is extremely important. It is one of the reasons we are \nable to keep our crime rate down.\n  The Vermont Passport Agency provides spectacular passport services \nout of St. Albans, Vermont. What is going to happen? Oh, you have a \ndying relative abroad and you need your passport in a hurry? Sorry, we \nmay not be able to get you your passport on time.\n  Members of Congress are elected to lead, not to play bumper-sticker \npolitics. It erodes confidence to continue to bring government to the \nbrink in every debate. There is too much in the country and around the \nworld of tremendous importance that demands our attention.\n  Instead of helping Americans get back to work and stimulating the \neconomy, House Republicans are intent on playing political games that \ndo nothing but weaken America and harm Americans. When they showed they \nweren't willing to do anything, the stock market collapsed, just as it \nhas the last 3 days. How many people have seen their savings for their \nchildren to go to college wiped out while they play political games? \nHow many people have seen their retirement wiped out\n\n[[Page S7024]]\n\nwhile they play political games? It is wrong.\n  I hope those who have set this course will reconsider before more \ndamage is done. Congress has a real opportunity to reject the slogans, \nthe politicking, the influence of pressure groups, and show real \nleadership. It is what we have done in the past. We have to do that now \nand in the future. Stop this always voting for slogans. Let's debate \nthe appropriations bills and vote for them or against them. Vote to \nrepair those crumbling bridges or vote against doing it. Vote for that \nmedical research in cancer or vote against it. Right now they are \nallowed to go home and say: I am on your side, whatever side you are \non. No. It is damaging our economy, it is destroying our image abroad, \nand it is stopping everything from cancer research to the education of \nour children. And in a rural State such as mine, in Vermont, it is of \nextreme danger.\n  We have seen this before, in 1995 and 1996, when a handful of \nRepublicans turned a looming debt limit crisis into a political \nstandoff with President Clinton that led to a shutdown of the \ngovernment for three weeks. It is now happening again, as some \nRepublicans seek to gain political advantage over President Obama. \nContinuing operation of our government's responsibilities to its \ncitizens is too important to be sacrificed for partisan political \nadvantage.\n  The effect of a government shutdown on law enforcement operations is \nalso significant. Agencies like the FBI are already strapped for \nresources due to sequestration and the general budget environment. \nAccording to the Washington Post, FBI Director James Comey learned from \nhis field agents across the country that funding was so limited that \nagents were left unable to put gas in their cars and training for new \nrecruits has ceased. Agents are unable to build anti-fraud cases at a \ntime when incidents of mortgage and investment fraud are on the rise, \nand staffing constraints have meant fewer cases opened overall and \nslower hiring throughout the Bureau. The needless shutdown of the \nFederal government will only compound an already challenging situation \nand make the job of law enforcement more difficult.\n  According to the Department of Homeland Security's shutdown plan, \nstaffing at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center will go from \n1,074 employees to 61. This means that all training for Federal, state, \nlocal and tribal law enforcement officers will cease immediately. Last \nyear, the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center trained nearly 70,000 \npeople. The Department of Homeland Security would be compelled to \nreduce staffing at the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office from 115 \nemployees to six. This office plays an important role coordinating \nnuclear detection efforts among Federal, state, local, and \ninternational governmental entities.\n  The partisan brinksmanship in 2011 that led to the downgrade of our \nnational creditworthiness should be a cautionary tale that convinces \nall Americans that the risks of a government shutdown and ideological \nimpasses to them, to interest rates, to financial markets, and to our \nhousehold budgets are too great.\n  Madam President, I am privileged to be the President pro tempore of \nthis Senate as the most senior Member here. I have seen Republicans and \nDemocrats come together. Democrats are prepared to come together here. \nWhere is the Republican leadership, as it has been in the past?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I wish to concur with much of what my \ncolleague from Vermont just said. Clearly, in our small State a \ngovernment shutdown will be devastating--devastating for many thousands \nof Federal employees. If a shutdown continues, it will be devastating \nfor families who have kids in Head Start. If a shutdown continues, it \nwill be devastating for seniors who are on the Meals On Wheels Program \nand for pregnant women and young mothers and their kids who are on the \nWIC Program. This is going to hit Vermont hard, and it is going to hit \nAmerica hard, and this is something that should not be taking place.\n  This debate is not about the Affordable Care Act. That is something \nwhich should be debated. I think it can be improved. What this debate \nis about is blackmail and hostage-taking.\n  What my Republican colleagues--especially the rightwing extremists in \nthe House--are upset about is not so much ObamaCare; what they are \nupset about is that they lost the election in November. President Obama \nwon by some 5 million votes. They lost seats. The Republicans lost \nseats in the Senate and they lost some seats in the House.\n  What they are upset about is that they cannot legislatively \naccomplish what they want to through the normal legislative process. \nWhat legislation is about is the House passes a bill, the Senate passes \na bill, they both get together, work on something, compromise, and then \nthe President signs it. They do not have the support to do that, so \nwhat they have now concluded is the only way they can go forward is to \nsay: If we don't get our way, if we don't shut down the government or \nkill ObamaCare or delay ObamaCare--that is the only game in town. That \nis all we are going to do. We can't do it the normal way.\n  So what they are doing is holding the Congress and the American \npeople hostage. That is unacceptable. It is unacceptable not only in \nterms of the Affordable Care Act, but let's be very clear: If we were \nto succumb and agree to this type of blackmail, does anybody not \nbelieve that 2 weeks from now, when the United States needs to pay its \ndebts, we will be threatened and for the first time in the history of \nthis country we will be in a situation where we may not be able to pay \nour debts, which economists tell us could lead not only to a major \nfinancial and economic crisis in this country, but it could impact the \nentire world.\n  So if we say: Hey, no problem, we are going to yield to your \nblackmail now, what do you think will happen in 2 weeks? They will be \nback then. And next year when we go through this process again, it may \nnot be the Affordable Care Act, it may be Social Security. Many of our \nrightwing extremist Republicans want to end Social Security. If we go \nthrough this process and submit to this blackmail now, I certainly will \nnot be surprised if a year from now this same group of people says: \nHey, look, you are not going to have a budget unless we end Social \nSecurity or we end Medicare as we know it right now.\n  So I think submitting and allowing blackmail to take place is very \nbad public policy. If Republicans or anybody else wants to have a \ndiscussion about how we can improve the Affordable Care Act--and I \ncertainly think we can because I think it is too complicated in many \nrespects, I think it leaves many people still uninsured. We are the \nonly country in the industrialized world that does not provide health \ncare to all of our people as a right, and ObamaCare doesn't do that. So \nI want to see some improvements made in it, but let's do it in the \nnormal legislative process, and let's not say that if we don't get our \nway, we are going to shut down the government; we are going to impact \nhundreds of thousands of Federal workers; we are going to impact many \nvulnerable people who are dependent on Federal programs.\n  Another point I wish to make is that we hear from some of our \nRepublican colleagues that the world is about to come to an end because \nthe Affordable Care Act will be implemented. But it is important to \nunderstand that many of these same arguments have been made in the past \naround the time or shortly after major pieces of legislation were \npassed which today are enormously popular.\n  Right now we have over 50 million people who benefit from Social \nSecurity. Social Security is an enormously important and popular \nprogram in this country. But let me take you back to April of 1935 when \nSocial Security was just passed, and I will quote what some Republicans \nhad to say about Social Security at that time.\n  April 19, 1935, Republican Congressman John Taber said this about \nSocial Security:\n\n       Never in the history of the world has any measure been \n     brought here so insidiously designed as to prevent business \n     recovery, to enslave workers and to prevent any possibility \n     of the employers providing work for people.\n\n  Ask most working people in Hawaii and in Vermont whether Social \nSecurity is enslaving them. I think they\n\n[[Page S7025]]\n\nwould not understand what you are talking about because since its \ninception Social Security has been enormously successful in reducing \nthe poverty rate among seniors.\n  But it was not only Congressman Taber in 1935. Here is what \nRepublican Congressman James Wadsworth told the American people:\n\n       This bill opens the door and invites the entrance into the \n     political field of a power so vast, so powerful as to \n     threaten the integrity of our institutions and to pull the \n     pillars of the temple down upon the heads of our descendants.\n\n  The world was just about coming to an end in 1935 because they passed \nSocial Security.\n  Republican Senator Daniel Hastings in 1935 called Social Security \n``un-American'' and told the American people that Social Security would \n``end the progress of a great country and bring its people to the level \nof the average European.''\n  I am not sure what that means but looks pretty scary.\n  On May 6, 1935, former President Herbert Hoover said:\n\n       As a matter of economic security alone, we can find it in \n     our jails. The slaves had it. Our people are not ready to be \n     turned into a national zoo, our citizens classified, labeled \n     and directed by a form of self-approved keepers.\n\n  That is a former President of the United States on Social Security.\n  It is not widely known, but in 1936 the Republicans campaigned to \nrepeal Social Security. That year the Republican nominee for President \nsaid that Social Security is unjust, unworkable, stupidly drafted, and \nwastefully financed. He called Social Security a fraud on the working \nman and a cruel hoax and said: We must repeal Social Security. The \nRepublican Party has pledged to do this.\n  It has turned out not quite to be the case. It turned out that Social \nSecurity will probably go down in history as maybe the most important \nand successful program ever passed by the U.S. Congress, and it plays \nan enormous role in keeping seniors out of poverty, helps people with \ndisabilities, helps widows and orphans. It has been enormously \nsuccessful and enormously popular despite all of these cries about how \nit was going to destroy our Nation. Maybe we should learn something \nfrom these prophets of doom.\n  Furthermore, we have a similar situation regarding Medicare. In the \nfairly dysfunctional health care system we currently have today where \nso many people are uninsured, so many people have high copayments, so \nmany people have high deductibles, and yet we end up spending almost \ntwice as much per capita on health care as do the other industrialized \nnations with guaranteed health care to all of their people--in 1965 \nCongress passed Medicare. Today Medicare is a very popular program. \nToday nearly 50 million seniors are receiving guaranteed health care \nbenefits through Medicare. But when Medicare legislation was being \ndebated in 1965, this is what some of the Republicans from Washington \nhad to say. Remember, today Medicare is quite a popular program, \ngenerally regarded as a successful health care program for seniors.\n  On April 8, 1965, Republican Congressman Durward Hall had this to say \nabout Medicare:\n\n       We cannot stand idly by now as the nation is urged to \n     embark on an ill-conceived adventure in government medicine, \n     the end of which no one can see and from which the patient is \n     certain to be the ultimate sufferer.\n\n  I don't know where Mr. Hall is today, but I think if he were to ask \nthe seniors throughout this country whether they are suffering from \nMedicare or whether they approve of Medicare, I think most of them \nwould say they approve of Medicare.\n  In terms of the Medicare debate we had on July 8, 1965, Republican \nSenator Milward Simpson said this about Medicare:\n\n       This program could destroy private initiative for our aged \n     to protect themselves with insurance against the cost of \n     illness. . . . Presently, over 60 percent of our older \n     citizens purchase hospital and medical insurance without \n     Government assistance. This private effort would cease if \n     government efforts were given to all older citizens.\n\n  In 1965 Congressman Joel Broyhill wrote:\n\n       Medicare would initiate what would ultimately become a \n     Federal monopoly in regard to the financing and rendering of \n     health care with respect to our aged to the detriment of \n     endeavors of the private sector; this would impair the \n     quality of health care, retard the advancement of medical \n     science, and displace private insurance.\n\n  In 1961 Ronald Reagan warned that ``Medicare will usher in Federal \nprograms that will invade every area of freedom as we have known it in \nthis country. If you don't speak out against Medicare, one of these \ndays you and I are going to spend our sunset years telling our children \nand our children's children what it was like in America when men were \nfree.''\n\n  On and on it goes.\n  So the point to be made is not that the Affordable Care Act does not \nhave its share of problems--it does--and not that it will take some \nwork to implement it--it will--but what we have heard from Republicans \nin the past whenever a major government initiative was introduced was \nconstant doomsday discussion about how the world would collapse.\n  Let me conclude by getting back to my major point that, in fact, this \ndebate really is not about the Affordable Care Act. We can argue about \nthe Affordable Care Act. We can change the Affordable Care Act. All of \nthat is certainly legitimate. What this debate is about is whether 20 \nor 30 extreme rightwing Members of the House of Representatives are \nable to hold our entire government hostage. Hundreds of thousands of \nFederal workers, many of whom are trying to bring up their families, \nare going to lose their paychecks, lose their jobs. People who are \ngoing to be applying for Social Security, for Medicare, for veterans \nbenefits will have that process significantly slowed down. Depending on \nhow long the shutdown continues, if it takes place--and I certainly \nhope it doesn't--it will mean that Head Start centers will be closing \nand other important programs will not be available to the people who \nneed them.\n  Once again, this is not a discussion about the Affordable Care Act. \nWhat this is about is whether a small number of Members of the House \nare able to use their position to blackmail the American people and the \nPresident and the Senate and say: If you do not do what we could not \naccomplish--what they could not accomplish legislatively--we are going \ndo render terrible harm to our country.\n  Furthermore, as bad as the government shutdown may be--and I \ncertainly hope it does not take place--what we are looking at in 2 \nweeks is something that may be even worse. If some get their way, for \nthe first time in the history of the United States of America, we, the \nlargest economy on Earth, may not pay our bills. That will certainly \ncause a huge eruption not only in our country but throughout the world \nin terms of markets, rising interest rates, and all kinds of terrible \nthings.\n  Once again, their understanding of government is, well, I guess it is \ntoo bad we lost the election for the White House, we lost seats in this \nSenate, and we lost seats in the House. That is too bad, but we are \nstill going to do what we want to do regardless of what the election \nwas about.\n  We cannot allow that to happen because if we do, it is not going to \nstop now. It will continue and continue.\n  So my hope is that Speaker Boehner will do something he should do. He \nis not the Speaker of the Republican Party; he is the Speaker of the \nU.S. House of Representatives. I suspect very strongly that if he put \nthe bill that we passed on the floor of the House, he would have \nvirtually all Democrats and a number of Republicans voting for it, and \na majority would say: We are not going to shut down the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  So my request to Speaker Boehner is let the people in his body--all \nof the people, not just Republicans--vote on what we passed here. If he \ndoes that, I suspect we will not see a government shutdown and we will \nhave some common sense over there.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, we have just a few hours, absent some\n\n[[Page S7026]]\n\nlast-minute agreements on the continuing resolution, to a government \nshutdown. This is a manufactured crisis that we are imposing upon our \ncountry. Make no mistake about it, it will cause harm. People will be \nhurt by a government shutdown.\n  I am honored to represent the people of Maryland. We have one of the \nlargest number of Federal workers on a per capita basis of any State in \nthe Nation and I am proud of the work they do every day keeping our \ncountry safe, doing the important research into incredible life \nsciences, protecting our food supply, making sure people get their \nSocial Security checks--the list goes on and on. These are men and \nwomen who are on the front lines of public service. At midnight they \nwill be asked to have another sacrifice added to their public service.\n  These public workers have gone through a lot: 3 years of a pay \nfreeze, fewer Federal workers to do more work, furloughs as a result of \nsequestration--in other words, they are not getting their full pay \ntoday. Now what will happen after midnight? Some will be asked to work \nand not be clear whether they will get a paycheck or when they will get \ntheir paycheck. Others will be furloughed not knowing if they will ever \nget paid for the time they are off.\n  This is unfair to our Federal workers once again. Our Federal workers \nwant to show up at work, do their work, and get fair pay for what they \ndo on behalf of their country. That is what each one of us wants. Yet \nonce more they are going to be the victims of the fight we see taking \nplace here on Capitol Hill, particularly among our Republican \ncolleagues in the House.\n  This is going to hurt people of this country such as small business \nowners trying to get an SBA loan, finding out there is no one there to \nhelp them process that loan. That person's business cannot wait. Yet a \ngovernment shutdown will jeopardize that person's ability to get badly \nneeded capital for their business. It will affect people who are now \nentitled to get Medicare benefits or Social Security benefits or they \nmay have some questions about it or veterans trying to get their \nveterans' benefits worked out. Those issues will be delayed as a result \nof a government shutdown.\n  Individuals who depend upon the basic research which will be done by \ngovernment--slowed down or in some cases stopped as a result of a \ngovernment shutdown. People will get hurt as a result of a government \nshutdown.\n  This is going to be wasteful for the taxpayers of this country. It \nwill cost the country valuable resources which should be used to \nprovide services to the people of this country. This is wasteful. It \nwill hurt our economy. When people do not get a paycheck, they do not \ngo to the local shops as they would otherwise; they do not travel as \nmuch. Our whole economy will suffer.\n  From a logical point of view, it is hard to understand why we have \nreached this point. Let me explain. This body passed what is known as a \ncontinuing resolution. That continuing resolution would keep government \nopen until the middle of November. It did not represent one party or \nthe other's view as to what that level should be. If anything, it \nrepresents the Republican view because the number we picked for \ncontinuing government is the number the Republicans thought was the \nright number. We did not take the number that was in the Senate-passed \nbudget bill. So we have already made an accommodation in an effort to \nmake sure we do not get into that budget fight as we keep government \noperating.\n  We passed that resolution, known as a clean CR, and sent it over to \nthe House. We are told--you listen to the comments of Members on both \nsides of the aisle--it looks as though we have the votes to pass that \non the House side. Yet the Speaker will not bring it up for a vote. He \nrefuses to do that. Talk about democracy. We passed it here, looks like \nthe votes are on the other side to pass it, the President is prepared \nto sign it, and government will not shut down in 7 hours, but there is \nno indication that the majority will prevail in the House of \nRepresentatives. Instead, a minority, with extreme views, is saying we \nare going to use this shutdown of government to try to advance our \nextreme agenda.\n  It gets us to what we have seen in other parts of history. This is \nnot much different than some of the tactics that were deployed to try \nto prevent Medicare from coming into law, or Social Security from \ncoming into law. The Republicans in the House who are trying to block \nObamaCare are saying they do not want to see this happen. They say they \nare afraid of what will happen when ObamaCare becomes a reality. They \nare not afraid it will fail; they are afraid it will succeed. President \nObama observed--and I happen to agree with him--regarding the naysayers \non ObamaCare, the one thing he knows is in a few years when this \nprogram is successful, they will not call it ObamaCare.\n  I can talk about the merits or I can talk about the process. The \nmerits of the Affordable Care Act--I am proud at last the United \nStates, the wealthiest Nation in the world, is moving toward universal \ncoverage so we can at long last say health care is a right, not a \nprivilege. We are the only industrial Nation in the world that has yet \nto move in that direction.\n  I am proud we improved Medicare under the Affordable Care Act. Our \nseniors are seeing that coverage gap in Medicare prescription drugs \nclosed. They are seeing preventive health care services now available \nwithout copayments. By the way, they are also seeing a Medicare trust \nfund that is solvent. The future looks much brighter than it did before \nthe Affordable Care Act.\n  American families are happy they can keep their adult children on \ntheir insurance policies to age 26, and they are getting value for the \ndollar.\n  I hear these negative comments about ObamaCare. They are talking \nabout how our health care system used to be. Talk to American families \nwho saw every year their coverage erode and their premiums go up before \nwe passed the Affordable Care Act. Under the Affordable Care Act, we \nsee you are getting value for your dollar. The insurance company has to \nreturn 80 to 85 percent of your premium dollars in benefits. If not, \nyou get a rebate. Millions of Americans have seen rebates because the \ninsurance companies charged too much. They are getting money back. They \nare getting value for their dollar.\n  For affordability, of the people who will be able to enter the \nexchanges starting tomorrow--tomorrow they can enroll in the \nexchanges--three out of every four who are eligible to enroll in the \nexchanges will be entitled to some help. This is affordable coverage \nand it is good coverage--no lifetime caps; no preexisting conditions. \nYou are getting solid insurance coverage for an affordable rate. That \nis what the Affordable Care Act is all about.\n  Small businesses, I have heard a lot about small businesses. If you \nhave under 50 employees, there are no new mandates and at last you are \nable to get competitive products, insurance programs with a little \nvariety. You can pick the plan that is best for you rather than being \ntold by the insurance company this is all you can get, and there are \nlarger pools so you don't have to worry about one of your employees \ngetting sick and all of a sudden the premiums go up. That is the \nsituation that is changing.\n  I can talk about the merits of what we are trying to do but that is \nnot where we are. This is a process issue. There is a time and place to \ntalk about how we can improve our health care system in this country, \nbut in a few hours we are talking about whether government is going to \nstay open.\n  I can make a very strong argument that the reason we do not have a \nbudget that starts October 1 is because of the obstructionist policies \nof the Republicans, particularly in the House. We have tried to go to \nconference. We passed our budget. They said we could not. We did. We \npassed a budget in the Senate. The House passed a budget. They were \ndifferent. Would you think you go to conference? Republicans refused to \ngo to conference. They refuse to go to conference. They refuse to \nnegotiate a budget agreement. We are now up to October 1 and they will \nnot agree to keep government open. I acknowledge it is not the \nmajority, but there is an extreme element, particularly on the other \nside, that wants to see government shut down. They want to see \ngovernment closed. That is what we are confronting, which is terribly \nirresponsible. It is affecting families, it is affecting our economy.\n\n[[Page S7027]]\n\n  New York Magazine got this right. I don't normally quote from them:\n\n       The Republican party has spent 30 years careening ever more \n     deeply into ideological extremism, but one of the novel \n     developments of the Obama years is its embrace of procedural \n     extremism. The Republican fringe has evolved from being \n     politically shrewd proponents of radical policy changes to a \n     gang of saboteurs who would rather stop government from \n     functioning at all.\n\n  That is what we are up against. I think most Members of this body \nknow that I believe in pragmatism. I believe we need to work together. \nI believe Democrats and Republicans need to come together and forge \nagreements to move the process forward. That is what I think the \nFramers of our Constitution envisioned, sitting around a table working \nout our differences. We have had divided government before. It is not \nnew. We have gotten through those days. We have gotten through those \ndays by listening to each other, sitting around the table and working \nout our problems.\n  But there are three things that are happening right now that need to \nend. No. 1, we have to keep government open; No. 2, we have to pay our \nbills and not be threatened in 2 weeks with the inability to pay our \nbills; No. 3, we have to get rid of these senseless, across-the-board, \nmindless cuts known as sequestration. We have to get rid of those \nthree.\n  Yes, we do need a budget. That budget will not be what the Democrats \nwant or the Republicans want. It has to be negotiated. It will contain, \nI hope, the best of what both parties can offer in dealing with the \nfuture needs of our country. That is what we should do, put America \nfirst. If we do that, we will help the people of our country.\n  I know we are just a few hours away from the shutdown of government. \nI still hold out hope that we will put the country's business first and \nstop playing this extremism politics of trying to say it is my way or \nno way. Let's keep government open. Let's pay our bills. Let's get rid \nof sequestration. Then let's negotiate a budget that allows this \ncountry to grow and unleashes our potential so that all Americans can \nenjoy the opportunity of this great land.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise tonight--with the question of \nwhether the House will allow government to continue or shut down--to \nactually talk for a few minutes about a simple concept but that is \napparently difficult in this body, and that is compromise. I want to \ntalk for a few minutes about compromise.\n  Based on the action that was taken by the Senate earlier today, the \nHouse has an opportunity to accept a compromise that the Senate has put \nbefore them. The CR bill the House drafted contained a budget number \nthat was their number, not our number. We weren't wild about it, but we \naccepted it. And the question is: Will the House accept yes for an \nanswer?\n  Over the weekend, I was traveling in Virginia--especially yesterday \nwhen the weather was great--to different events in central Virginia \nwhere there were big festivals, so people were gathering outside. As I \ntraveled, I heard again and again: Don't shut down government and can't \nyou find a compromise?\n  People are aware in Virginia, and in Hawaii I know they feel the \nsame, that there can be severe consequences to a shutdown. I know the \nSenator from Maryland may have already offered a number of these \nthoughts. A great agency such as NASA that funds science and research \nwill see furloughs of 97 percent of its employees. The Commerce \nDepartment, which is about commerce, our business and our economy, will \nsee furloughs of 87 percent of its employees. The National Institutes \nof Health, dealing with research and other important health matters, \nwill see furloughs of 73 percent of their employees. Even an agency \nsuch as Treasury--the core Treasury function, separate from the IRS--\nwill see a reduction of their staff at 50 percent at a time when we \nneed the Nation's fiscal system to be strong.\n  The consequences of shutdown are severe, and that is why the citizens \nof Virginia are saying: Don't shut the government down. Find \ncompromise. It is not just employees either, and that is significant \nenough. It will affect tens of thousands of employees in Virginia and \nservices people rely on. To pick one as an example, the number of VA \nemployees who will be furloughed is actually fairly small as a \npercentage, but the people at the VA who will be furloughed are the \nfolks who work at the VA Benefits' Administration, which is the \norganization within the VA that processes veterans' benefits claims.\n  If you are a veteran who has come home from Iraq or Afghanistan, and \nyou have been part of a war that has now lasted for 12 or 13 years and \nyou want to file for your benefits, which is something you are entitled \nto because you fought for the Nation--and we have heard the stories of \nthe backlog in veterans' claims--you will be delayed even more because \nof the furlough. It is unfair to do this to our veterans. It is unfair \nto do this across government.\n  I said I wanted to talk about compromise because I think this is not \neven fundamentally a battle about the budget. It is not a battle about \nthe Affordable Care Act. It is a battle about whether compromise is \ngood or bad.\n  I don't know if anyone had a chance to read this, but there was a \nwonderful article in the Washington Post--an opinion article on Friday, \nSeptember 27--that was authored by a columnist of the Post, Michael \nGerson. Michael was the former speechwriter for President Bush 43, \nGeorge W. Bush. He worked in the Bush administration and wrote an \nexcellent piece that was published, and I want to read a bit of it. The \ntitle of the piece is ``A compromised reputation among the GOP.'' \nAgain, it ran in The Washington Post last Friday. I will read a couple \nof quotes:\n\n       The real target--\n\n  Not the ACA, not the budget--\n\n     is the idea of compromise itself, along with all who deal, \n     settle or blink.\n       In the middle of this unfolding Republican debate comes a \n     timely National Affairs article by Jonathan Rauch. It is \n     titled ``Rescuing Compromise,'' but it might as well have \n     been called ``James Madison for Dummies.''\n       Rauch argues that Madison--\n\n  I have to mention a Virginian in my speech--\n\n     had two purposes in mind as he designed the Constitution. The \n     first was to set faction against faction as a brake on change \n     and ambition--a role that tea-party leaders have fully \n     embraced. Madison's second purpose, however, was ``to build \n     constant adjustment into the system itself, by requiring \n     constant negotiation among shifting constellations of \n     actors.''\n       Following the Articles of Confederation, America's founders \n     wanted a more energetic government. But they made action \n     contingent upon bargaining among branches of government and \n     within them. ``Compromise, then, is not merely a necessary \n     evil,'' argues Rauch, ``it is a positive good, a balance \n     wheel that keeps government moving forward instead of \n     toppling.''\n       Compromise, of course, can have good or bad outcomes. But \n     an ideological opposition to the idea of compromise removes \n     an essential cog in the machinery of constitutional order. \n     ``At the end of the day,'' says Rauch, ``the Madisonian \n     framework asks not that participants like compromising but \n     that they do it--and, above all, that they recognize the \n     legitimacy of a system that makes them do it.''\n\n  Finally from the Gerson article:\n\n       It is a revealing irony that the harshest critics of \n     compromise should call themselves constitutional \n     conservatives. The Constitution itself resulted from an \n     extraordinary series of compromises. And it created the \n     system of government that presupposes the same spirit. \n     ``Compromise,'' says Rauch, ``is the most essential principle \n     of our constitutional system. Those who hammer out painful \n     deals perform the hardest and, often, highest work of \n     politics; they deserve, in general, respect for their \n     willingness to constructively advance their ideals, not \n     condemnation for treachery.''\n\n  That is what this debate is about: Is compromise good or is it bad? \nWe have to be willing to compromise.\n  I want to talk about what the Senate has been doing to advance the \nspirit of compromise. On the 23rd of March in this body--after a very \nlate night--at 5 a.m. in the morning, the Senate passed the first \nSenate budget that we passed in 4 years. In that same week, the House \npassed a budget as well. We have talked about this often. Once that \nhappens and the two budgets are passed,\n\n[[Page S7028]]\n\nthere is a budget conference to sit down and try to find compromise \nbetween these two different documents.\n  These budgets passed more than 6 months ago, but there has been no \nbudget conference. There has been no effort to find compromise. Why \nnot? Because the Republicans--a tiny handful in the Senate and the \nmajority in the House--do not want to compromise.\n  Senate Democrats have made a motion 18 times since March 23 to begin \na budget conference, and in every one of those instances, a handful of \nRepublican--and when I use the word handful, I am quoting the Senator \nfrom Utah who objected to a budget compromise and said ``a handful of \nus object''--Members of this body, working together with House \ncolleagues, have decided they do not want to put in motion the process \nfor dialog and compromise.\n  The Senate Democrats were, are, and will be ready to sit down at a \nbudget conference table to negotiate, listen, and compromise to find a \nbudget going forward. We have tried 18 times. We will try it a 19th \ntime. We will try it a 20th time. We will keep working to compromise.\n  We also compromised in the very matter of the bill that is pending \nbefore the body today. As the Presiding Officer knows, the continuing \nresolution bill was sent from the House over to the Senate last week. \nThat is the way these bills start; they originate in the House. The \nbill had two components. The first component was ``defund ObamaCare,'' \nand the second was ``and then we will fund government.''\n  The House bill said they would fund the government at their proposed \nbudgetary number, which is $986 billion in discretionary spending. That \nwas their number; that was not our number. We had extensive discussions \namong Senators about what we thought of their proposal. Frankly, we \nthought the $986 billion number was too low. It includes all of the \nsequester cuts we disagree with. We think the right number to the \nbudget compromise should be $1.05 trillion, not $986 billion.\n  The Senate has a different idea about the number, but guess what. The \nSenate was willing to accept the House's number. We accepted the \nHouse's budget number out of the spirit of compromise, and we stripped \naway the ``defund the Affordable Care Act'' provision and said: Let's \nput that into a budget negotiation. In a budget negotiation, we can \ntalk about that or anything else they want, but we won't tie it up with \nthe threat of a government shutdown.\n  So we sent the budget bill back to the House at their budget number \nand said to them: Can't you take yes for an answer? They have proposed \nfunding at $986 billion. We do not agree with that number, but for \npurposes of the short-term CR, we will agree, out of the spirit of \ncompromise: Can you take yes for an answer?\n  The Presiding Officer knows the answer. They would not take yes for \nan answer. They brought it back and added new provisions: the repeal of \na tax that would increase the deficit, and a delay in the Affordable \nCare Act provisions that would provide maternity service to expecting \nmothers, that would protect adults from not getting insurance on the \ngrounds of preexisting conditions, that would give a significant tax \ncredit to small businesses to help them pay for insurance. They wanted \nto delay all of those provisions.\n  We have taken action again today. We have again made this bill what \nwe call a clean spending bill. We have taken out anything other than \nwhat this bill was supposed to be: At what level should government be \nfunded? We have gone back to the House and we said: We are accepting \nyour proposal. We are accepting your number even though we have a \ndifferent number we want to argue for, and we will save the other \narguments for a budget conference if you will finally go to the table \nwith us.\n  I want to conclude and say that James Madison was right, and not \nbecause he was a Virginian. He was just right to recognize that \ncompromise is the essential element of our system. Think about it for a \nminute. If you set up a government, you have three different branches. \nThe legislative branch has two Houses. You have to find compromise \nbetween the two Houses to move forward.\n  The Supreme Court in the judiciary has nine Justices. They have to \nwork together and find a compromise, or a consensus, by a majority on \nany case.\n  Even the President's power, which is unilateral so it seems as though \nit is not a compromise branch because we put the executive powers in \nthe President's hands. How do we choose the President? We choose the \nPresident through the fundamental constitutional compromise of the \nelectoral college. So the choice of a President is based on compromise.\n  The entire constitutional system we have requires compromise. The \nSenate was willing to compromise and go to a budget resolution, and we \nhave been blocked by the House. The Senate was willing to compromise \nand accept the House's budget number and they have not been willing to \nsay yes even to their own budget number.\n  We stand here tonight at 5:27 p.m. ready to compromise, and we will \nbe ready the next hour to compromise. We will be ready to compromise \nand find a deal to keep this government open every minute, every \nsecond, from now until we get this right. But we do feel very strongly \nthat no one should threaten to shut down the government of the United \nStates.\n  If a foreign enemy threatened to shut us down, we would unify, as we \nhave so many times, to repel that threat. But we are allowing elected \nMembers of Congress to threaten to shut down this body, the government \nof the greatest Nation on Earth? It is unfathomable to me. The only way \nI understand it is in exactly the terms Michael Gerson indicated in the \nWashington Post. This is not fundamentally about the Affordable Care \nAct or a debate about the budget. It is a fundamentally an attack by \nsome upon the very notion of compromise that is at the core of our \nsystem of constitutional government.\n  I stand on behalf of Virginians--and I don't think Virginians are \ndifferent from the rest of America--by saying we have to be willing to \ncompromise to find the common good. It is my hope that the House, when \nthey act tonight, will act in the spirit of compromise and the common \ngood and allow this government to remain open.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise again to urge both the House and \nthis body to pass into law what should be the rule and the law for \neverything we do in Washington; that is, to apply the same rules to \nWashington as are applied to the rest of America, across the board, \ncertainly including ObamaCare. Of course, what I am talking about is \nending the special Washington exemption from ObamaCare.\n  That exemption is moving forward under what I consider a clearly \nillegal rule issued by the Obama administration. It is illegal because \nit is contrary to the statute, contrary to the clear language, contrary \nto the clear intent of an ObamaCare provision that says every Member of \nCongress and all congressional staff need to be treated the same as the \nmillions of other Americans who are going to the so-called exchanges \nfor their health care; 8 million, against their will, losing their \nprevious employer-provided subsidy.\n  Let me recount briefly the history of this because it is important. \nSeveral years ago during the ObamaCare debate there was a proposal made \nby many, including myself and one of the leaders was Senator Chuck \nGrassley of Iowa, and that proposal was actually adopted, amazingly, to \nmy pleasant surprise at the time, and put in the ObamaCare bill. It \nsaid just what I mentioned a few minutes ago: Every Member of Congress \nand all congressional staff need to go to the so-called exchanges for \ntheir health care. They need to leave our present Federal Employee \nHealth Benefit Plan which includes our employer-provided subsidy. The \nidea was simple, and it was a good one, so that we would actually walk \nin the shoes of other Americans who are living under the challenges and \nthe burdens of this law, including having to get our health care in the \nexchanges\n\n[[Page S7029]]\n\nwith no special deal, no special subsidy, no special exemption.\n  That law was passed as part of ObamaCare, pure and simple, exactly \nthose words.\n  I guess this is an example of what Nancy Pelosi said: We need to pass \nthe law in order to figure out what is in it. Because after the law \npassed, with that language in it, lots of folks on Capitol Hill started \nreading that and they said, Oh, you-know-what; we can't stand for this, \nwe can't live by that. We can't be subject to the same situation as \nother Americans. So there was furious scheming and gnashing of teeth \nabout how we are going to get out of this burden, even though there was \nvery little broad-based discussion about how we are going to get all of \nAmericans out of that burden they were subjected to.\n  That developed into furious lobbying of the Obama administration. \nMany folks in the Senate, led by the distinguished majority leader \nHarry Reid said: Mr. President, you need to issue a special rule that \nexempts Congress, that takes the pain out of that provision--a special, \nunique, special rule, special bailout for Congress. Sure enough, that \nis what the Obama administration did, conveniently right after we left \ntown for the August recess, right after Congress got away from the \nscene of the crime.\n  According to numerous press reports that are not rebutted, President \nObama personally got involved. He personally had discussions within his \nadministration, at the urging of Harry Reid and others, and he ensured \nthat this special rule was issued. It does two things, basically. No. \n1, it says that even though the ObamaCare statute states plainly and \nclearly that every Member of Congress and all official congressional \nstaff have to go to the exchanges, we don't know what official staff \nis, so we are going to leave that up to each individual Member of \nCongress, and we are not going to second-guess that. So any individual \nMember of Congress can say certain folks aren't covered by that \nmandate. They can stay in their current plan. They don't have to be \ndisrupted. In theory, a Member of Congress can say nobody on my staff \nis part of that official staff for purposes of this mandate. That is \nsilly and ridiculous on its face because the statute is clear.\n  The second thing this illegal rule does is it says that for Members \nand any staff who do go to the exchange--what is supposed to be the \nfallback position for Americans and for Congress--for Members and staff \nwho do go to the exchange, they get to take their very generous \ntaxpayer-funded subsidy with them, even though that is not available to \nany other person losing employer-based coverage and who is going to the \nexchange against his or her will. So that deal isn't available to \nanyone but the select ruling class.\n  That is why I think this rule is completely illegal, and that is why \nI know it flies in the face of what I consider the first most basic \nrule of democracy; that laws passed by Congress, by Washington, should \nbe applied to Washington the same as they are applied to America. That \nshould be true in ObamaCare. That should be true across the board.\n  To react to this illegal Obama administration rule, I joined with \nmany colleagues in the Senate--and I wish to thank all of my \ncosponsors, including Senator Enzi, Senator Heller, and several \nothers--I am forgetting the entire list--and Members of the House who \nhave identical legislation and identical language. They are led by \nCongressman Ron DeSantis of Florida. Ron Johnson is another colleague I \nwas trying to think of from Wisconsin who is another leading coauthor. \nI wish to thank all of them for leading this fight.\n  Our language does two simple things. First of all, it negates this \nillegal Obama administration rule that is a special exemption, a \nspecial bailout for Congress against the clear language and intent of \nObamaCare. Secondly, it broadens that rule and also applies it to the \nPresident and the Vice President and all of their political appointees.\n  That is the ``no Washington exemption'' language. That is the Vitter \namendment in the Senate, with many other cosponsors. That is the \nDeSantis amendment in the House, with many House cosponsors. I urge all \nof my colleagues to come together around that commonsense, fair \nlanguage, which again simply ensures what I think should be rule No. 1 \nof our American democracy: Whatever Congress passes for America, it \napplies equally to itself; whatever Washington imposes on America, it \napplies equally to Washington, to policymakers in Washington.\n  We are making progress because there are reports that the House may \nvery well take up this exact language tonight as part of the continuing \ndiscussion about a spending bill, and I urge the House to do that, to \nstand with the American people--not to stand with Washington but to \nstand tall with the American people--and say, yes, it should be that \neven playing field, and whatever is passed on America should be applied \nequally in the same way. No special deals or exemptions or subsidies \nshould be applied to Washington.\n  I urge all of my colleagues here, Republicans and Democrats, to \nsupport that effort, to support that simple, basic, fair language, to \nsupport it on ObamaCare, to support it across the board because it is \nessential that what Washington passes on America is applied with equal \nforce and effect on Washington. If we did that under ObamaCare, I am \nconvinced we would rush with greater determination, speed, and focus to \nfix the very real problems of ObamaCare because we would be vested in \nit. If we did that on other laws, I am convinced it would have the same \npositive effect. Let's do it, No. 1, because it is fair and right; and \nNo. 2, because our personal interests should be completely aligned, \nshould be the same as those of the American people, and that will get \nus to act. That will get us to fix things. That will get us to fight in \nthe right direction, Republicans and Democrats together.\n  Again, I urge support of this new Washington exemption language. I \nurge the House to vote positively on that tonight. I urge the Senate to \naccept that fundamental principle, that important language, which, as I \nsaid, I think is the first core rule of democracy.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/30/senate-section/article/S7029-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. WARREN.

Madam President, I come to the floor today in a state of \ndisbelief. With millions of people out of work, with an economic \nrecovery still far too fragile, with students and families being \ncrushed by student loan debt, with millions of seniors denied their \nchance at one hot meal a day, with Meals On Wheels, and millions of \nlittle children pushed out of Head Start because of a sequester, with \nthe country hours away from a government shutdown and days away from a \npotential default on the Nation's debt, the Republicans have decided \nthat the single most important issue facing our Nation is to change the \nlaw so employers can deny women access to birth control coverage.\n  In fact, letting employers decide whether women can get birth control \ncovered on their insurance plans is so important that the Republicans \nare willing to shutter the government and potentially tank the economy, \nover whether women can get access to birth control in the year 2013,--\nnot the year 1913, the year 2013.\n  I have a daughter and I have granddaughters, and I will never vote to \nlet a group of backward-looking ideologues cut women's access to birth \ncontrol. We have lived in that world and we are not going back--not \never.\n  This assault on birth control is just one more piece of an ongoing \nRepublican assault on the orderly functioning of our government and the \norderly functioning of our economy. In effect, the Republicans are \ntrying to take the government and the economy hostage, threatening \nserious damage to both unless the President agrees to gut the \nAffordable Care Act.\n\n[[Page S7030]]\n\n  This assault is utterly bizarre. Congress passed the Affordable Care \nAct to solve real, honest-to-God problems. Our health care system is \nbroken. Forty-eight million people in this country had no health \ninsurance. Women couldn't get access to cancer screenings. People with \ndiabetes were denied health insurance because of a preexisting \ncondition. People with cancer hit the caps on health insurance \nspending. Health care spending in this country was growing way too \nfast. So we worked hard. We compromised. We came up with a solution--a \nsolution that will substantially improve the lives of millions of \nAmericans--because that is the way democracy works.\n  It is time to end the debate about whether the Affordable Care Act \nshould exist and whether it should be funded. Congress voted for this \nlaw. President Obama signed this law. The Supreme Court upheld this \nlaw. The President ran for reelection on this law. In fact, his \nopponent said he would repeal it and his opponent lost by 5 million \nvotes.\n  I see things such as this and I wonder what alternate reality some of \nmy colleagues are living in. So let me be very clear about what is \nhappening in the real world. The ACA is the law of the land. Millions \nof people are counting on it--people who need health care coverage, \npeople who need insurance policies that do not disappear just when they \nare their sickest. Women will get insurance coverage for birth control. \nThe law is here to stay, and it will stay. Earlier today the Senate \nemphasized that reality by flatly rejecting the Republicans' newest \nransom note, just as we did last week.\n\n  We should be having a real debate about our budget because we have \nreal problems to solve. Earlier this year automatic across-the-board \ncuts went into effect throughout the Federal Government. That is the \nsequester. The sequester hits American families where they live. During \nmy visits to cities and towns across Massachusetts, I have heard from \nfamilies, small business owners, and community development \norganizations--from the Berkshires to the Cape. They tell me what it is \nlike trying to stay afloat with mindless, across-the-board spending \ncuts weighing them down.\n  More than a thousand employees at Westover Air Force Base and Barnes \nAir National Guard Base in western Massachusetts are facing furloughs. \nThis fall, more than 2,000 Massachusetts kids could not get into Head \nStart because of cuts, and the Head Start Program in Billerica will \nclose completely at the end of this year. Federal workers across our \nState stand to lose as much as 30 percent of their salaries. Every one \nof those losses will tighten family budgets. And when families make \nless money, they have less to spend with local merchants and less money \nto pay off bills and less money to save and less money to do all that \nkeeps our economy humming.\n  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office says ending the sequester \nwould add 900,000 jobs to the economy by the end of next year. Next \ntime you think about someone you know who is looking for a job or who \nis working part time but hoping to get full-time work, think about the \n900,000 jobs the sequester has destroyed.\n  Scientists and medical researchers in Massachusetts are also getting \npounded by the sequester. They are working hard to expand our medical \nknowledge and develop new cures for devastating diseases. They are \nworking on discoveries that will help us in ways we cannot even \nimagine. Yet here we are, bluntly hacking away at their funding, \ndelaying their research, and cutting off promising new work before it \neven starts--not because we have to, not because it is inevitable, but \nbecause Washington has its priorities all wrong, and it is making some \ntruly terrible decisions.\n  Consider the Framingham Heart Study. It is a generations-long study \nof the causes of heart disease, a study that has helped create \ngroundbreaking advancements in medical knowledge. There are people \nacross this country who are alive today in part because of the work \nthat began with this study. This study continues to yield extraordinary \nresults, but it is scheduled to lose 40 percent of its funding--40 \npercent. Next time you think of someone you love who has heart trouble, \nthink about the sequester cutting one of the world premier heart \nresearch programs.\n  Senate Democrats have put forward alternatives that would adequately \nfund the government while also addressing our budget deficits. Back in \nMarch the Senate passed a budget that would have ended the sequester. \nIt was not easy. We had to make some compromises. No one loved \neverything in the final bill, but we debated it and we passed it. This \nis what Congress is supposed to do. But after we did all of that, \nSenate Republicans decided to filibuster the budget again and blocked \nus from going to conference with the House on the final bill. That is \njust pure obstruction, plain and simple.\n  In July the Senate attempted to pass the first of several \nappropriations bills to keep the government open and to end the \nsequester. We had a bipartisan Transportation and Housing bill that \nwould have helped repair crumbling roads and bridges in our \ncommunities. It would have created more jobs, and it would have rolled \nback sequestration in these programs. But, once again, Senate \nRepublicans filibustered and blocked that bill.\n  Now we are just hours from the government running out of money. We \nhave not fixed the sequester because of all the obstruction. We have \nnot finished a budget because of all the obstruction. We have not even \npassed a single appropriations bill because of all the obstruction.\n  The least we can do--the bare minimum we can do--would be to pass a \ncontinuing resolution to keep the doors open and the lights on. We can \nensure that over a million Federal workers are not simply sent home for \nno reason. We can avoid a government shutdown. But the Republicans have \nrefused to do even that. They have continued to threaten to shutter the \ngovernment unless the President agrees to gut the Affordable Care Act. \nThe Senate rejected that position twice. Yet the Republican response \nhas been to continue to threaten to shut down the government.\n  These threats may continue, but they are not working, and they will \nnever work because this is democracy, and in a democracy hostage \ntactics are the last resort for those who cannot win their fights \nthrough elections, cannot win their fights in Congress, cannot win \ntheir fights for the Presidency, and cannot win their fights in the \ncourts. For this rightwing minority, hostage taking is all they have \nleft--a last gasp for those who cannot cope with the realities of our \ndemocracy.\n  The time has come for those legislators who cannot cope with the \nreality of our democracy to get out of the way so that those of us in \nboth parties who understand the American people sent us here to work \nfor them can get back to work solving real problems faced by the \nAmerican people. We have real work to do, and that is what we should be \ndoing.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I urge leadership in the House of \nRepresentatives to simply schedule a vote on the Senate-passed bill. I \nunderstand a number of people in the majority party are going to vote \nno. I also believe that--and the Presiding Officer used to be in the \nHouse of Representatives, as I was years ago. It is a democratic House, \nand I mean ``democratic'' with a small ``d.'' They should schedule a \nvote. I believe a majority of Members of the House of Representatives \nwould vote for the bipartisan continuing resolution that passed the \nSenate. I believe they would pass it in the House if the Speaker of the \nHouse would let it come to a vote.\n  Is the Speaker of the House going to be the Speaker of the radical \nright of the Republican Party or is he going to be the Speaker of the \nU.S. House of Representatives? Fundamentally, that is the question. Is \nhe going to be the Speaker of the radical right in the House of \nRepresentatives or is he going to be the Speaker of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives? If he chooses the latter, if he chooses before \nmidnight, there will not be a government shutdown because a majority of \nthe House\n\n[[Page S7031]]\n\nof Representatives--not necessarily a majority of the Republicans, but \na majority of those who took the oath of office on January 3, 2013, who \nwere elected in November of 2012, and then took that oath--I believe a \nmajority of them will support it.\n  I think it is always a good idea to look back in time a little to \nwhat happened in the past. We know that more than 30 times when \nPresident Reagan was President and President Bush Senior was President \nand President Bush Junior was President, the Congress raised the debt \nceiling, even with a Democratic Congress, without preconditions, \nwithout threatening to shut the government down or without threatening \ndefault; and a number of times the same situation on continuing \nresolutions, passing budgets, all those things.\n  But never really before in the House of Representatives or the Senate \nhas there been a body of Members who have tried repeatedly to have \ntheir way to, in a sense, attach their political platform from the \nelection of the year before to a continuing resolution, and if they do \nnot get that political platform attached, they are simply going to shut \nthe government down. That is really what is happening.\n  There is all this talk about that the public does not like the \nAffordable Care Act. Some call it ObamaCare. The official name is the \nAffordable Care Act. There is some talk from the House of \nRepresentatives, really ad nauseam, that they do not like the \nAffordable Care Act and they say the public does not like the \nAffordable Care Act. But let's look at that.\n  (Mr. DONNELLY assumed the Chair.)\n  In 2012, the President of the United States was reelected--a strong \nsupporter of the Affordable Care Act.\n  In 2012, supporters of the Affordable Care Act were elected, \nincluding the new Presiding Officer, who replaced the Senator from \nHawaii, who is a supporter of the Affordable Care Act. I was \nreelected--a supporter of the Affordable Care Act. A strong majority in \nthe Senate support the Affordable Care Act, many of whom stood for \nreelection and were successful. In fact, two more were elected this \ntime who held office prior to this election and who supported the \nAffordable Care Act. More people voted for House candidates who \nsupported the Affordable Care Act. More people voted for Democrats in \nthe House races than Republicans, even though redistricting made the \noutcome a little different, obviously, from that.\n  So the point is, there is no public sentiment to shut the government \ndown in order to defund or repeal or hold back or delay or emasculate \nor pull apart--or whatever--the Affordable Care Act.\n  But let's go back a bit in history.\n  In July 1965--48 years and a couple months ago--President Johnson \nsigned Medicare into law. It passed bipartisanly, although a number of \nRepublicans were strongly against it, especially the far right. In \n1965, when Medicare passed, the John Birch Society did not like it. \nThat was sort of the tea party of today. A lot of doctors did not like \nit. A lot of insurance companies did not like it in 1965. But a lot of \npeople who were suspicious of government overall said they did not like \nit and opposed it, and a lot of them continued to oppose it after the \nelection.\n  But 5 years later, the country clearly was very happy with Medicare. \nCertainly 48 years later, the country is very happy with Medicare. I do \nnot think there is much question that 5 years from now people will be \nhappy with the Affordable Care Act. They know it will have worked for \npeople in this country. Much of it already has worked, as the Presiding \nOfficer knows.\n  In my State, almost a million seniors have already received benefits. \nThey have gotten free preventive care with no copays, no deductibles. \nSeniors from Youngstown and Toledo have had screenings for osteoporosis \nand physicals and all and there is no copay or deductible for those \nliving on Medicare. People from Cleveland to Cincinnati, people in \ntheir twenties--100,000 Ohioans in their twenties--have been able to go \non their parents' health care plan up until the age of 26. Because of a \nrule in the Affordable Care Act, we have seen thousands of Ohioans get \na rebate check from the insurance companies because the insurance \ncompanies charged too much.\n  We know a lot of those benefits have been out there. Families who \nhave a child with a preexisting condition are no longer being denied \ncoverage because of the Affordable Care Act. So we know much of it has \ntaken effect and much of it has been to the public benefit. We also \nknow come tomorrow, October 1, much more of the Affordable Care Act--\nthe rest of it--will be rolled out.\n  Seniors have saved in my State--and I think in the State of Indiana--\nan average of about $700. Those who are in the prescription drug plan \nhave saved about that amount of money on their prescription drugs, \nagain, because of the Affordable Care Act. We know that. Put that \naside.\n  Let's simply ask the House of Representatives to bring this bill up. \nWe know what happens if we do not. A shutdown would hurt the financing \nof more than 1,000 small businesses per week in my State--from Hamilton \nto Chillicothe, to Mansfield, to Ashtabula. The Small Business \nAdministration in 2012 approved nearly 54,000 applications through \ntheir credit loans program, supporting over half a million jobs. A \nshutdown would stop the ability of the SBA to loan to small businesses \nthrough this program.\n  A shutdown would put 52,000 Ohio federal employees at risk of being \nout of work. Most of them would temporarily lose jobs. We know that is \na drag on the economy. We know it would mean government services are \nnot being rendered. It would mean those tens of thousands of workers \nwould not get paid. It would mean a stumbling, a faltering, a \nsputtering of our economic growth and the economic recovery, because \npeople are not making the money and putting money back into the \neconomy.\n  Senior citizens would be ineligible, if there is a shutdown, to apply \nfor new Social Security benefits. The Social Security applications \nwould not be taken as a result of Federal furloughs and service cuts. \nIn 2012, more than 2.2 million Ohioans received--obviously many had \nbeen receiving for years--Social Security benefits.\n  All we ask is that the Speaker of the House do what one should do in \na democracy. Let the elected representatives of Congress have the \nopportunity to vote. Give them the opportunity to vote yes or no on the \nSenate-passed, bipartisanly passed continuing resolution. Speaker \nBoehner needs to make a decision. Is he going to be the Speaker of the \nradical far right Republican party or is he going to be the Speaker of \nthe House of Representatives? That choice is clear. Bring that bill to \nthe floor. Let all 435 Members of the House of Representatives who were \nelected last November and sworn in in January have the opportunity to \nvote.\n  I think if they do, it will mean the President will sign the bill \nbefore midnight and keep this government operating. There is simply no \nreason for it, as we lurch from crisis to crisis, all created by a \npolitical agenda, that most of the people in this country have rejected \nat election time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, we are here tonight in the Senate, hours \naway from a deadline which, if action is not taken on the House side, \nthe other body, will lead to a government shutdown. Unfortunately, when \nI have been asked today by either constituents or reporters, and they \nask: Is it less likely or more likely that there will be a shutdown, I \nhave had to be honest and say: At least at this moment it seems more \nlikely than less likely.\n  I think we have to examine not just how to try to resolve this in a \nway that makes sense, but also to remind ourselves how we got here. \nThis is not the typical battle in Washington. We have had a lot of \nthose. We should all try to work in a bipartisan fashion. But this one \nis unique in the sense that you have, on the one side, Democrats in \nCongress and across the country who\n\n[[Page S7032]]\n\nare united in an effort to continue the operations of the government \nand not have a government shutdown, even if we want to make a point, \neven if we want to make an argument about this or that policy.\n  We see a growing number of Republicans here in the Senate and across \nthe country, and maybe even a few in the House, even in the last 24 \nhours or so, who are saying: Let's just get the government funded so we \ncan move forward. We might be able to have a debate in the middle of \nNovember or somewhere down the road. But let's not hold up the \noperations of government or default on our obligations for the first \ntime since 1789 in order to make an ideological point or a political \npoint.\n  It is clear from the national data that Independents are on that side \nof the argument as well. So you have this consensus on one side, with \nDemocrats, Independents, and Republicans, who say that we should not--\nin order to make a point about an issue, whether it is health care or \nthe economy or whatever it is--we should not act in a way that would \nshut down the government to do that.\n  On the other side, you have the far right of the Republican party \nwhich not only believes that in order to make their point they are \nwilling to allow the government to shut down, but they also have a \ndetermination to do that to the extent one wing of one party is really \ndriving the train in that party. It happens to be the Republican Party.\n  So this is unusual. It is not the typical Democrat versus Republican \ndebate. It started months ago when politicians who work in this town \nwould go home to their State or their districts and make the point \nthat, no matter what, they were going to argue that this is the moment \nwhere they should stop the health care bill. No matter what was in \ntheir way, they were going to continue to drive in that direction.\n  That is how we have gotten here. What happens if we go past the \ndeadline and there is a shutdown of a few days or longer? Here is what \nsome of the data show from some of the folks who are not in the \nCongress but who observe broader trends, especially economic trends.\n  Mark Zandi is Moody's chief economist. He is widely respected. I \nthink people in both parties respect his opinion. According to him--and \nI am not quoting, I am just summarizing what he said--a shutdown \nlasting a few days would cost the economy 0.2 percent of GDP, while a \nlonger shutdown could cost as much as 1.4 percent.\n  Sometimes it is difficult to say what 0.2 percent of GDP means. What \nit means for sure is the economy, which has been moving in the right \ndirection--we have had tremendous job growth, over 9 quarters now, and \nmany months of job growth. But we are not moving fast enough. We are \nnot creating jobs at a fast enough pace.\n  When I go home to Pennsylvania people do not say to me: Score every \npoint you can for your point of view. They say to me: Work together \nwith the other side to create jobs. Work together with the other side \nto put in place strategies that will lead to economic growth and to job \ngrowth.\n  If you are going to go in the wrong direction when it comes to \ngrowth, and you lose 0.2 percent of growth, and then, if the shutdown \ngoes longer you lose 0.4 or 0.5 or 0.6, over time you are going in the \nwrong direction. But we know when you lose even 0.2 percent of growth \nyou are killing jobs. So first and foremost, any shutdown is a big job \nkiller. A default on our obligations would be a much bigger job killer.\n  A shutdown would not just slow growth, but it would spread anxiety. \nThis is just human nature. It will spread anxiety among consumers. We \nknow that in the summer of 2011 the almost default on our obligations \ncaused consumer confidence to take a nosedive. We did not come out of \nthat hole of consumer confidence until many months later. A government \nshutdown has a similar effect.\n  How about the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, not usually on my side of a \nlot of debates or on the Democratic side? The U.S. Chamber of Commerce \nhas urged Congress to keep the government open and has said that a \nshutdown would be ``economically disruptive and create even more \nuncertainty in the U.S. economy.'' So this is the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, which is often making arguments about uncertainty in other \ncontexts. They are saying that a shutdown would create even more \nuncertainty.\n  How about the economic recovery? I mentioned those 9 quarters of \ngrowth we have had. We have had job growth as well. Just in terms of \nhow you measure it: 7.5 million private sector jobs--7.5 million added \nin the last 42 months. That will take a nosedive. So instead of growing \nat 160,000 jobs a month, roughly, which has been kind of the pace for a \nwhile now, which is not fast enough--we need to be at 200,000 or \n230,000 or 240,000 if we really want to say that the economy has taken \noff. But instead of growing at 160,000, 170,000, or even higher, we \nwill go backwards. Maybe the job growth for the next couple of months \nwill be substantially less than that. A shutdown all but ensures that \nto happen.\n  We don't know exactly how much slowing or how much damage would be \ndone to the job growth, but there is going to be a job impact for sure, \nand I think that is pretty clear from the data.\n  Both sides in a lot of debates in Washington say they stand for small \nbusinesses. We can debate which side does a better job for small \nbusiness. We know when a small business person needs some help, a \nmeasure of help from the Federal Government, they usually turn to the \nSmall Business Administration. We know the SBA, their approval of \napplications for business loans guarantees and direct loans to small \nbusiness would cease. If we take the Small Business Administration off \nthe playing field, they average about 1,000 loans or loan guarantees \nper week. That is national.\n  What does that mean for Pennsylvania?\n  From October 2012 through August of this year, 2013, the SBA \nsupported over 1,400 loans for over $600 million for small businesses \nin Pennsylvania. On average, that is about 30 loans for over $13 \nmillion to entrepreneurs each week--every week, on average, based upon \nthe recent data in Pennsylvania, 30 loans and $13 million helping small \nbusinesses in Pennsylvania. To shut that off would make our economic \ncircumstance even worse.\n  In Pennsylvania, we had many months in a row where the unemployment \nnumbers were 500,000 people unemployed or more. Thankfully, it dipped \nbelow 500,000 for a couple of months. We just received the numbers from \nAugust because the State numbers are always behind. The State data for \nAugust unfortunately shows we are just above 500,000 people out of \nwork. A shutdown will bring that 500,000-persons out-of-work number and \nsend it higher and send it in the wrong direction.\n  What about veterans? People say veterans' disability checks would go \nout, just as Social Security checks would go out, in the aftermath of a \nshutdown. That is only part of the story. If you are a veteran getting \ndisability checks or a pension benefit--in our State we have 109,000 \nveterans who receive disability or pension help. They may get their \ncheck, but it is highly likely, if not a certainty, that those checks \nwill be delayed.\n  If you are a veteran and are entitled to this because of what you did \nfor our country, because part of a political party wants to make an \nideological point, you have to wait for your check. You have to wait \nfor your disability check. That makes no sense. To say it is unfair to \na veteran or to his or her family is an understatement.\n  What about Social Security? People say: Well, the checks are going to \ngo out so people will be just fine in a shutdown.\n  That is only part of the story. Yes, current recipients will get \ntheir checks, but if you reach the age of 65 and you wish to have your \napplication processed, you will not be able to do that or, at a \nminimum, that will be slowed substantially.\n  In our State, every month more than 11,600 people are able to start \nthe process for Social Security benefits. Those people will have to \nwait and wait in the advent of a government shutdown.\n  What about national parks? We have a great blessing in our State \nwhere we have an abundance of national parks and historic sites which \nare wonderful for the country, wonderful for enrichment, learning, and \nhistory, but they also are a big economic driver in different \ncommunities.\n\n[[Page S7033]]\n\n  In southeastern Pennsylvania, when you add it all, one of the numbers \nI saw was over $200,000 of impact. Those, unlike a lot of others I \nspoke about, those parts of the government will stop completely. An \neconomic engine in one part of our State that averages about $200,000 \nof economic impact will stop. Maybe we will lose $10,000 over the \ncourse of a shutdown. Maybe Pennsylvania will lose $20,000 or $30,000. \nWe are going to lose for sure and a lot of other States will as well.\n  The Flight 93 National Memorial is one of those from 9/11 and \nGettysburg and Valley Forge/Independence Visitor Center in \nPhiladelphia, there are many examples and many job impacts when it \ncomes to all of those.\n  The basic point is some people would say: Look, you are in the Senate \nor the House, and you wish to have a debate about something as \nsignificant and consequential to people's lives or to our economy such \nas health care, you ought to be able to debate that. I would agree with \nthat. There is no question about it. We had big debates in 2009 leading \nup to a vote in the Senate. Then the debate continued in 2010. The bill \nwas enacted in 2010. There was still debate about it after that. There \nwere votes taken one after another to repeal it. Then the Supreme Court \nlitigated it. That took months until the Supreme Court made a decision.\n  The Supreme Court, which is dominated--or at least the majority are \nRepublican-appointed Justices--said the Affordable Care Act was \nconstitutional. Then there was a Presidential election, which was \nanother kind of litigation or debate. One candidate said: I am going to \nkeep the Affordable Care Act in place, and we are not going to repeal \nit. The other side said: We are going to repeal it. The side that said \nthey were going to put it into effect won the election--that of \nPresident Obama.\n  This has been debated and litigated several direct ways in several \ndifferent branches of our government. That will continue and, frankly, \nit should continue. Some of the impacts are already in place. We know \nthat.\n  We know, for example, that since 2010, when the consumer protections \nwent into effect, which had nothing to do initially with those who were \nuninsured, the tens of millions of uninsured, but we put in place the \nconsumer protections for those with insurance, those who had coverage, \nwere making payments--premium payments--yet their children were still \nnot protected because of a preexisting condition.\n  Up until 2010, it was the law--or it was the prevailing policy that \nif an insurance company wanted to say to those who were paying \npremiums, sorry, I know you are making your payments, but your child \nhas a preexisting condition, and they are not covered, that was \npermitted when insurance companies had all of the power. I would argue \nthey had all the power, an unfair advantage and bargaining advantage. \nSince 2010, we have had something on the order of 17 million children \nwho could no longer be denied coverage due to a preexisting condition, \nsolely and completely because of the Affordable Care Act.\n  We have millions of young people who can stay on their parents' \npolicies from the ages of 19 to 25. They can only stay on those \npolicies solely because of the Affordable Care Act, because it was \nenacted into law.\n  We have millions of seniors who are getting payments over time to \nhelp them fill the coverage gap of the so-called doughnut hole. They \nare getting those payments solely because of the Affordable Care Act.\n  Tomorrow, we are going to see the beginning of the exchanges going \nup, where people can go into a marketplace and shop for the best \npossible health care insurance that they can afford. Most people--\nprobably as many as 150 million Americans--already have coverage and \ntheir employer provides it, so their status will not change that much, \nif at all.\n  These changes are going into effect over time. I would hope the \npeople who wish to keep debating it and making changes to it--and I \nvoted for changes as well--would allow it to be, if not fully \nimplemented, something close to fully over the next couple of months or \nmaybe even over the next couple of years. Then at some point this \ndebate about who is right or who is wrong about the impact will have \nbeen determined.\n  We are all for debate on the budget, health care, and everything \nelse, but we shouldn't bring the country to these cliffs--the cliff \nmeaning this deadline tonight on the budget, where the House has our \nlegislation, which is only about the budget. They could pass it. It \nwill pass if the Speaker puts it on the floor tonight. It would pass, \nand we would be beyond this crisis. Then we would move to the next \ndeadline, get beyond these deadlines, have a big debate, and have very \nstrong arguments made about how we get a full year's worth of a budget \nstarting in the middle of November. That is the appropriate time and \nthe appropriate place to make arguments about the budget, the economy, \njobs, health care or whatever else it is. Now is not the time.\n  I would hope between now and midnight, the House would put up our \nbill, which is very simple--it keeps the government operating with no \nconditions and no add-ons--and pass that legislation. We would be done \nwith this, and we could move on to issues people want us to work on.\n  I will restate what I said before. People in Pennsylvania, when they \nsay to me what they want me to do, they say work together to create \njobs. If you had to put that in a sound bite, that is what it is.\n  I am hoping between now and then this consensus of Republicans, \nDemocrats, and Independents that prevailed throughout the country will \nhave the appropriate influence on those who are trying to push this to \nthe end and shut down the government. A government shutdown is bad for \neverybody, no matter what party you are in. We should keep working to \nmake sure it doesn't happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Earlier today the Senate rejected for the second time the \nHouse Republican continuing resolution. The approach they have adopted \nover in the House attempts to and would deprive millions of Americans \nof health insurance if it were passed here. It is not going to pass \nhere.\n  I would say to Speaker Boehner we have given your proposal a vote. In \nfact, we have voted on it twice. Now you owe it to the American people \nto hold a vote, a vote on the bipartisan, clean continuing resolution \nwhich would keep the government open. This is the resolution which the \nSenate sent to you just a few hours ago.\n  The only thing preventing us from keeping this government open is \nSpeaker Boehner's refusal to bring a bipartisan Senate continuing \nresolution to the House floor. I think most Republicans over there even \nacknowledge that it would pass if Speaker Boehner would allow a vote on \nit.\n  The Senate, a short time ago, approved a measure to allow for the pay \nof our men and women in uniform to continue in the event of a \ngovernment shutdown. This measure was necessary because requiring our \nmilitary to go into combat with only an IOU instead of pay would be a \ntravesty. Nobody should be fooled. It is only one travesty that was \navoided among many. Even if we restrict our view to the impact of a \ngovernment shutdown on the military, there are many other terrible \nimpacts of a government shutdown.\n  Our military Members would be paid so a shutdown would result in at \nleast avoiding that problem. However, there are other unthinkable \noutcomes to our security with a government shutdown. Family members of \nmilitary members who die in combat would not receive death benefits \nduring a shutdown. It defies belief that in the pursuit of a narrow \nideological goal House Republicans would prevent the payment of \nbenefits for those who died defending our country. That is the result \nof a government shutdown.\n  In the event of a shutdown, the Department of Defense would also \nfurther reduce already curtailed training and bring routine maintenance \nto a halt, exacerbating the corrosive effects that sequestration is \nalready having on military readiness. The Department of Defense would \nbe barred from entering most new contracts. That would harm \nmodernization programs.\n  A shutdown would severely curtail medical services for troops and \ntheir families. Commissaries would close, with hundreds of thousands of \ncivilian\n\n[[Page S7034]]\n\nemployees. Workers vital to our defense would be laid off. Outside of \nthe DOD, a shutdown would disrupt some operations in the Department of \nVeterans Affairs which is providing benefits to those who have served.\n  Then there is the extraordinary disruption of having to plan for all \nof this absurdity. As Under Secretary of Defense Hale said on Friday:\n\n       Even if a lapse never occurs, the planning itself is \n     disruptive. People are worrying right now about whether their \n     paychecks are going to be delayed, rather than focusing fully \n     on their mission. And while I can't quantify the time being \n     spent to plan, it has or will consume a lot of senior \n     management attention, probably thousands of hours in employee \n     time better spent on supporting national security.\n\n  Again, that only covers the impact on our military and on our \nveterans. While Border Patrol agents and FBI agents would continue to \nwork, they would be putting their lives on the line for an IOU instead \nfor a paycheck. Health clinics would stop taking new patients. \nLifesaving research would grind to a halt. The far-reaching effects of \na shutdown on government services across the country should give us all \npause, as should the fact that a shutdown is likely to damage the all-\ntoo-fragile economic recovery.\n  This has gone on for far too long and Speaker Boehner can end it \nnow. There is still time for him to bring to the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives a clean continuing resolution and avert a government \nshutdown. For the good of our men and women in uniform and our national \nsecurity, for the good of our economy, and for the millions of \nAmericans who rely on and who benefit from important Federal programs, \nI hope the Speaker will allow our bipartisan continuing resolution to \nbe voted on.\n\n  I hope that even this late in the game reason is going to prevail. I \nhold that hope in part because while House Republicans have put tea \nparty ideology ahead of the good of the Nation, many of our Republican \ncolleagues here in the Senate have not. These Members recognize there \nis a difference between on the one hand debating serious policy \npreferences and on the other hand threatening government shutdown if \nyou don't get your way.\n  All of us in the Senate have issues on which we feel every bit as \npassionately as the opponents of the Affordable Care Act feel about \nthat law. I happen to feel strongly, for instance, that we should have \nuniversal background checks for firearms purchases. By the tea party \nmethod of proving the strength of my belief, I should threaten a \ngovernment shutdown if I don't get what I want on that subject. If all \nof us threaten legislative anarchy in pursuit of our goals, democracy \nwill cease to function.\n  As appalled as I am that some Members would threaten such damage to \nour Nation, I am heartened that many of our Republican colleagues here \nin the Senate have spoken out in opposition to this approach.\n  When I came to the floor last week to speak on this topic, Senator \nAyotte was speaking. I commended her for saying that the American \npeople expect us to keep the government running even though I disagreed \nwith much of what she said about the Affordable Care Act.\n  I commend Senator Collins for saying a shutdown ``will only further \ndamage our struggling economy'' and that we should resolve our \ndifferences ``without resorting to constant brinkmanship and the threat \nof government shutdown.'' I commend Senator Collins, even though I \ndisagree with her on the Affordable Care Act, for taking that position \nagainst a shutdown and for seeing the distinction between fighting hard \nfor what you believe in and threatening to bring down government \noperations overall if you don't get what you want.\n  I commend Senator Portman for saying that the differences on the \nAffordable Care Act ``ought to be handled outside the context of a \ngovernment shutdown.''\n  I commend Senator Chambliss for saying that while, in his words, he \nwould love to defund ObamaCare, a government shutdown is ``going to do \ngreat harm to the American people if we pursue that course.''\n  I commend Senator Kirk for saying, ``Let's not shut down the \ngovernment just because you don't get everything you want.''\n  There are others who have made that critically important distinction \nbetween opposing a certain policy and shutting down the government if \none doesn't get his or her way.\n  I welcome spirited debate. I welcome differences of opinion. As my \nfriend Senator McCain said last week, there was plenty of both during \nthe debate on the passage of the Affordable Care Act. But it is deeply \ndistressing to hear Members of Congress argue that the litmus test of \nwhether you are fighting for your beliefs is whether you are willing to \nshut down the government if you don't achieve a particular goal. That \nis more than fighting for your position, that is wanton destruction. I \nhope at least some House Republicans will come to see the difference \nbetween fighting for your goals and sowing anarchy in pursuit of them.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, moments ago the House of \nRepresentatives adopted a rule which clearly indicates that it is set \nto adopt a resolution containing unrelated conditions that will \nforestall its approval by this Chamber. That is a tragic result which \nthreatens harm and havoc to countless people who depend on government \nprograms and to our economy. It threatens harm to veterans and children \nwho depend on Head Start, seniors who receive meals, and it threatens \njobs and economic growth with a ripple effect that will set all of us \nback in the continuing fragile and all-to-slow recovery we have seen \nfrom the greatest recession in recent memory.\n  Today's result in the House of Representatives is a tragedy for \ndemocracy. Without any overstatement, we have to recognize that this \nresult reflects a dysfunction in democracy. The threatened shutdown of \nour government is the result of an extreme ideological fringe element \nin one House and one party that has made the decision that their agenda \nis a take-it-or-leave-it condition, that it is more important than \neconomic growth, more important than our seniors, our children, our \nveterans. Key services, our economic growth, and jobs will be impacted \nvery directly by this impending shutdown.\n  This morning I was at a gathering in Glastonbury, CT, with a group of \nmanufacturers, their employees, and economic experts. One economic \nexpert in particular, Steven Lanza of the University of Connecticut, \ntold us that a shutdown of 3 to 4 weeks alone would cost the State of \nConnecticut 2,000 jobs.\n  We know from the predictions of expert economists such as Mark Zandi \nof Moody's Analytics that the result for the country as a whole could \nbe percentage points of lost growth. In fact, we can ill-afford this \nself-inflicted, manufactured wound to our Nation and to the trust and \nconfidence people deserve to have in our democracy and our economy.\n  For some businesses these problems will be more than acute; they will \nbe life-threatening injuries because their existence--not to mention \ntheir profits--depends on consumer demand that will be diminished by \nthe ripple effect and the ramifications of the 9,000 Federal employees \nin Connecticut who will be furloughed, not to mention the hundreds of \nothers whose jobs will be threatened by a shutdown of just days or a \nweek. The fact is that at this point we can't know what the full \neconomic ramifications will be. There are more questions--serious \nquestions--than there are answers.\n  I will support an amendment and a measure that will be offered I \nthink later this evening or within hours to preserve the benefits and \npayments that are due to our veterans for their service and sacrifice. \nThat is a provision we need to make. It is our responsibility to keep \nfaith with those veterans and make sure we leave no veteran behind and \nthat the processing of claims goes forward so our veterans receive the \nbenefits they have earned.\n  At the forum I had this morning, Brian Montanari, the president of \nHabco, which is in Glastonbury, told us\n\n[[Page S7035]]\n\nhe relies on contracts with the Federal Government for much of his \nbusiness, and his employees--to whose ranks he has been adding--will be \nimpacted by this potential shutdown, if only the uncertainty it \ncreates. He is not alone. Businesses all over Connecticut and the \ncountry will face a tougher economic climate because of the shutdown. \nThe Small Business Administration will stop processing applications for \nthe business loans it provides to tens of thousands of entrepreneurs, \nrisk takers, and job creators around the country. Perhaps the most \ngalling aspect of this shutdown is the direct economic hardship it will \ncause to families whose jobs will be threatened and whose livelihoods \nwill be at risk.\n  There are hours to go before the final hour, but the point is, as the \nPresident said so well earlier, keeping the government open is not a \nbargaining chip, it is our job. President Obama said: ``You don't get \nto extract a ransom for doing your job.''\n  Families need to be able to plan for their future, businesses need \ncertainty in order to make investments and hire new workers, and the \nNation needs both parties, not just one, to be fully committed to the \ndemocratic process.\n  I hope in the time remaining the House does its job, that these \nextremist demands are rejected--and certainly by this Chamber they will \nbe. My hope is that we can move forward, keep the government open, \nprovide the services people need, and support the economy, which is all \ntoo necessary at this point in our history.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, let me speak for a moment about what \nwe have happening. There is no reason for this happening, and there is \nabsolutely no reason why, first of all, we could not have worked \ntogether to put a budget in place. We, months ago, passed a budget in \nthe Senate and have been trying to go to a conference committee with \nthe House so we could work it out and have a long-term budget that \ncontinues to bring down the debt. By the way, the deficit is coming \ndown, which is very positive. But we know we need to continue to do \nmore in a balanced way. That could be happening. It is not happening \nbecause the same people now who are putting us in a position where in a \nfew hours there may very well be a government shutdown are the same \nones who do not want to negotiate to get a budget for our country, \nwhich is very difficult to understand in terms of what the strategy is \nother than to just obstruct.\n  We are now in a situation where we have agreed to a compromise that \nwould allow the continuation of funding of public services, from safety \nto health research, to what we do around education, innovation, small \nbusiness. We have a whole range of things for 6 weeks. So we are \ntalking about 6 weeks.\n  The compromise is that while we believe we ought to be reinvesting in \neducation, in innovation, we ought to be creating jobs, rebuilding our \nroads and bridges and water and sewer systems, and doing a number of \nthings that would strengthen our economy and create jobs, for this 6-\nweek period, we agree to continue the funding level at the lower level \nthe Republicans want.\n  So the continuing resolution we have sent to the House is a \ncompromise by definition because we are willing for 6 weeks--while we \nnegotiate a broader package on a full year's appropriation--to continue \nfunding at the level the Republicans have asked to be the spending \nlevel. By definition, certainly for many of us who believe we will not \nhave a middle class--that we cannot grow the economy without doing the \nright kinds of investments and that we certainly should not be cutting \nback on cancer research and cutting clinical trials for women with \nbreast cancer or cutting back on other possible cures, and that is \nhappening right now at this lower level--but for 6 weeks we have said \nwe are willing to compromise with the House Republicans in order to \ncontinue funding the government while the larger issues are worked out.\n  Instead of that happening, what we are seeing is a fight that, \nfrankly, has been fought over and over. It was fought in the last \nelection. It was very clear we had a President of the United States who \nran on and who made a signature accomplishment of his first-term health \ncare--access to affordable health insurance for all Americans--running \nagainst someone who said he would repeal that, and the President of the \nUnited States won with a substantial margin.\n  In the Senate, we had Democrats running against Republicans, with \nRepublicans saying: Elect me and I will repeal ObamaCare; Democrats \nsaying: No. We need health reform. We need to create a better, more \ncompetitive way to bring down health insurance rates--like in \nMassachusetts, the home of our distinguished Presiding Officer. Our \ncandidates--Democrats--won.\n  So I would suggest that in many places, and certainly across the \ncountry, with the President of the United States, the people of America \nspoke pretty strongly.\n  Now we are here. We all have seen the intensity of what is a minority \nopinion. I appreciate that. It is very intense. But it is a minority \nopinion in this country. So the minority of a minority is trying now to \nessentially slow down or stop the economy, hurt middle-class families, \nbring public services to a standstill because--even though they lost in \nthe election, even though theirs is not the majority view--they have \ndecided it does not matter--it does not matter--they are going to shut \nthings down if they do not get their way.\n  What we are going to see tomorrow when healthcare.gov comes online \nare more competitive, lower rates for many Americans, young Americans, \nfamilies, and so on, people who maybe could not get insurance in the \npast at all, moms-to-be who could not find maternity care--8 million \nwomen in this country who have not been able to find insurance \ncompanies that will cover them for maternity care because somehow being \na woman was a ``preexisting condition''--they are going to have a \nchance to do that, which means we will have more healthy moms, we will \nhave more healthy babies, and this is good for our country.\n  We are seeing now in health reform that has already taken effect \nhundreds of dollars a year more in the pockets of senior citizens that \nthey used to pay out for prescription drugs. But they do not have to do \nit anymore because we are closing this gap in coverage from the \nMedicare prescription drug bill.\n  As a caveat, let me say as somebody at the time 7 years ago who voted \nno on that Medicare prescription drug bill--because I believed and the \nmajority on our side believed it was written way too much in favor of \nthe drug companies as opposed to the seniors in terms of costs, not \nallowing Medicare to negotiate group rates and so on--when we lost that \nfight, we did not shut down the government, we did not try to stop \nfunding the implementation of Medicare prescription drugs, we did not \ndo all of the antics that have been done. We said: OK, we lost that \nfight, so let's make it work the best we can make it work, and we will \nfix it later.\n  We did not stop the funding for the educational efforts for seniors. \nWe did not spend hundreds of millions or--I do not know, maybe it is \nbillions now--trying to scare people, confuse people. We said: Let's \ntry to make it work. Even though in the May before the prescription \ndrug bill took effect 21 percent of the public said they wanted it, \nthey supported it, 7 years later, 90 percent of the public says they \nsupport it.\n  In health reform we were able to fix one of the things that many of \nus were concerned about then. Rather than\n\n[[Page S7036]]\n\nstopping the ability of seniors to get some help--even though it was \nnot structured the way I would like to see it structured--rather than \nstopping that, we said: Let's make it work the best we can and look for \nopportunities to make it better.\n  Under the Affordable Care Act, we have made it better. We have made \nit better by closing the gap in coverage, which has been dubbed the \ndoughnut hole, so that gradually under health reform this goes away, \nwhich will mean literally thousands of dollars in the pockets of many \nseniors.\n  I would suggest to our colleagues in the House and the minority of \nthe minority here in the Senate who want to shut things down because \nthey have not gotten their way on health reform that it would be so \nmuch better for the American people if they chose the path we did on \nMedicare prescription drugs, to try to make it work the best we can, \nand then to look for ways to make it better.\n  So instead of doing that, what we have is a situation where we are \nbeing held hostage--public services are being held hostage to eliminate \nsomething that, frankly, a majority of people already voted to say they \nwanted to put into place. Fix it, yes. If there are problems, yes, fix \nit. But they certainly do not want to go back to hundreds of dollars a \nmonth for a family for a policy that covers almost nothing, which is \nwhat has happened all across Michigan and all across the country.\n  This was a situation where women get discriminated against on the \nbasis of gender, just because we are women or because we cannot find \npreventive care or we cannot find maternity care as women. We certainly \ndo not want to go back to a situation where a family has a child who \ngets a serious illness and then suddenly finds, after spending hundreds \nof dollars a month on a policy that does not cover anything much, that \nthere is a cap on how much care they can get for their child.\n  So they end up with thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket expenses, \nmaybe going bankrupt, maybe losing their house, because even though \nthey were paying for insurance, it did not cover what they needed. Then \nthere is a limit on the number of treatments they can get. Oh, by the \nway, now that their child has a serious chronic illness, they cannot \nget insurance any more because the child has a preexisting condition.\n  This is the world in which tens of millions of families have been \noperating for way too long. We do not want to go back to that. I am \ncertainly not going to be a party to going back to that. So we have \nsaid no. Negotiate on the budget. Be responsible. Focus on jobs. Move \nforward, yes. Take us back to a time of bankruptcy for families when \nthere is an illness in the family? No. Take us back to a time when \nwomen were charged more than men just because we are women? No. Take us \nback to a time when seniors are paying more out of pocket for \nprescription drugs because of this gap in coverage? No.\n  We could go on and on. When we look at this whole approach, I do have \nto say given the fact that--we as women gain so much under health \nreform in terms of protection about unfair rates, getting preventive \ncare without out-of-pocket expenses, access to maternity care, many \nwomen for the first time, so many other things.\n  A majority of those on Medicare are women. There are so many ways in \nwhich we benefit. We now see the House over and over sending us \nsomething that would delay or end health reform. Then today, on top of \neverything else, they have decided not only do what they want to stop \nthe next stage of health reform, but they want to repeal what already \nis the law of the land now on preventive care for women, on family \nplanning services, on mammograms, and all of the other preventive \nservices that we know save lives.\n  The amendment that all of the Democratic women Senators offered under \nour leader, Senator Barbara Mikulski, which made sure that going \nforward, preventive care would be available and affordable, no out-of-\npocket costs, that was repealed in what was sent to us today. It is \nalso interesting that preventive services for men were not repealed. \nOnly preventive services for women, without out-of-pocket expenses.\n  We find ourselves now in a situation where we are waiting for the \nHouse to send back something else again that will chip away at health \ncare and put in jeopardy the ability for the Federal Government in the \ngreatest country in the world to be able to provide services tomorrow, \nwhether it is safety, whether it is health, whether it is education, \nwhether it is the basics, like traveling with your family and needing a \npassport or visiting one of our national parks or any number of other \nthings that affect us, protecting the air and the water, and what we do \nto support our farmers and so on.\n  So that is where we are. We will once again indicate that we are \nwilling to compromise on the budget issues. This is a budget issue. We \nwill support the level of funding that the House says they want, not \nwhat we want, because it underfunds critical investments in services \nand hurts the middle class. But for 6 weeks, as a compromise, we are \nwilling to operate the government at the level that they want. But we \nwill not take the next step which is to take away the ability of \nmillions of Americans to have access to basic health care.\n  Tomorrow is an important day for so many reasons. But one of them is \nthat for the first time, citizens across the country are going to be \nable to begin to get the information they need from healthcare.gov \nabout what is available for them and for their families in terms of new \nhealth care options.\n  From what we have seen so far, the rates are not only competitive but \nlower than was estimated they would be. In fact, for most families and \nmost individuals, they are going to be able to get much more care. They \nare actually going to get something they are paying for. They are going \nto be able to receive that at much less cost than they currently can. \nSo tomorrow is an important day, where as they say in Michigan ``the \nrubber meets the road.''\n  People will begin to find out for themselves, despite all of the \nstuff that has gone on for the last 3 years, all of the misinformation, \nthe scare tactics, the millions of dollars in horrible ads that have \nbeen run, tomorrow, people will be able to judge for themselves.\n  We certainly expect it will take a while, just as it did for Medicare \nprescription drugs, for it to fully take effect. People will have 6 \nmonths the first time around to figure out what they want to do to be \nable to sign up for next year. If we find that there are things that \nneed to be improved on, then we need to come together and do that. We \nare more than willing to do it. But we are not willing to go back to \nthe day where families could not find any care for themselves or their \nfamilies or could not afford it.\n  We, in fact, are the greatest country in the world, and health care \nis pretty basic for each and every one of us. We need to have a system, \nwhich begins tomorrow through private sector insurance and competition, \nto have a way to be able to lower costs for families while making sure \nthey are actually getting the care that they are paying for. That is \nstarting tomorrow.\n  I hope tomorrow, in addition to that starting, we are going to see a \ncontinuation of critical public services in our country and that we \nwill send a message around the world that America really can get its \nact together, that this Congress can really work together and be \nresponsible and not see the kind of incredible partisan games that have \ngone on, not by everyone but by a minority of the minority who are \nright now holding things hostage in this Congress. We can do better \nthan that. I am looking forward to having the opportunity to work with \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, in fact, to do that.\n  I am hopeful that the Speaker will just very simply put a continuing \nresolution on funding the government before the full body of the House \nof Representatives and let them vote. We have heard from many House \ncolleagues today, Republican colleagues, saying that if they have an \nopportunity to vote on continuing the operations of government, they \nwill do that, a clean CR, a continuing resolution that would allow the \ncontinuing functioning of services that the public depends on, and \nthose who are providing as well are depending on.\n  The Speaker just simply needs to allow an up-or-down vote. Just allow \na vote this evening. I believe if he does\n\n[[Page S7037]]\n\nthat, he will see a bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives \nthat will be responsible and do the right thing.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/30/senate-section/article/S7037-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE FARM BILL\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, while I have a moment--I thought that \nthere were others wishing to speak--since there are not, I wanted to \ntake one more moment to speak about something else that is running out \ntoday that I am deeply involved in and deeply concerned about.\n  That is the 5-year agriculture, nutrition, and conservation policy of \nthis country, the farm bill. We have seen the end today of the \nextension that was put in place last year because of House inaction. \nStarting tomorrow, we essentially begin to operate on fumes. We will \nsee a time period in a few weeks when we will see the full impact of \nhaving no farm bill.\n  It is incredibly important that we use this time immediately to \nnegotiate a final farm bill that will not only reduce the deficit, as \nour bill does by $24 billion, but one that can get a straight \nbipartisan vote as we did here in the Senate with over two-thirds of \nthe Senate twice voting for a comprehensive reform bill that addresses \nsupporting our farmers and ranchers from a risk management standpoint, \nwhile eliminating subsidies that do not make sense from a taxpayer \nstandpoint, strengthening crop insurance, strengthening conservation to \nprotect our land, and air, and water, focusing on regional and local \nfoods, farmers markets, small farmers, to support them as well, new \njobs and bioenergy, as well as investing in rural communities all \nacross America through our rural development efforts.\n  What we call the farm bill really is the rural economic development \nbill for the country. Some 16 million people work in this country \nbecause of agriculture. This is the biggest jobs bill we will pass. Our \nfarmers and all of those impacted have been waiting and waiting and \nwaiting and, frankly, have had enough. They want this to get done.\n  So I call on our House colleagues again to join with us to be able to \nfinally get this passed into law. This is incredibly important for the \neconomy, for small towns such as the one where I grew up in Clare, MI, \nall across Michigan, all across the country.\n  It is incredibly important for our efforts to continue to protect our \nsoil and our forests and our air and our water and to be able to \nmaintain the beautiful outdoors that we do and support for hunters and \nfishermen and others that we do through efforts in the farm bill. It is \nincredibly important that this get done. It is long overdue.\n  So I couldn't let this evening go by without indicating that on the \nlong list of things that have not been done, the September 30 date is \nincredibly important for rural America, for our farmers and ranchers \nwho need help when they have a loss, for our families who need help \nwhen they have a loss, and for our ability to continue to grow jobs.\n  Our largest area of exports is in agriculture. It is a vibrant, \nimportant part of the economy. There is no excuse for this not having \nalready been done. Again, too many games have been played attacking \nfamilies who need help and choosing not to proceed in a reasonable, \nbalanced way as we did in the Senate.\n  I am recommitting myself again, as I have day after day--and \ntomorrow--to making sure I do everything I possibly can. I call on \nHouse colleagues and on the Speaker to do everything they can in order \nto finally get a 5-year comprehensive food, farm, and jobs bill done so \nthat we may continue to grow a very important part of the economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/30/senate-section/article/S7037-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7037-S7041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I know many of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nare deeply frustrated this evening. Once again, with only a few hours \nleft on the clock, House Republican brinkmanship has us struggling to \navoid burdening our families and our economy with more dysfunction and \nuncertainty. This pattern is simply unacceptable, and some of us, \nDemocrats and Republicans, have been trying for months to break it.\n  When the Senate budget passed, I was hopeful that we could move to a \nbipartisan budget conference where Democrats and Republicans from the \nHouse and Senate could all come together, sit down, and try to work out \nour differences. Democrats tried to begin a budget conference 18 times. \nMany Senate Republicans agreed with us that we should continue \nnegotiations and begin working toward that deal. Each time tea party \nRepublicans and Republican leadership stood and said no. They made it \nvery clear why: They believed they would have more leverage in a \ncrisis--such as the one we are hours away from--than they had a few \nmonths ago when we were asking for orderly negotiations.\n  Instead of working on a bipartisan budget that would strengthen our \neconomy, tea party Republicans began manufacturing this crisis to \ndefund the Affordable Care Act.\n  This is a law, by the way, that is helping millions of Americans and \nbeginning tomorrow, shutdown or no shutdown, is going to begin helping \nmany more.\n  Due to Republican refusal to come to the table, we are now scrambling \nto avoid a shutdown.\n  I am confident the American people, including many in my home State, \nare looking at House Republicans and asking the same questions many of \nus are. They are asking: What are they thinking, and why would they \nhurt their own constituents simply to make a point?\n  Even if tea party Republicans don't want to admit it, a government \nshutdown wouldn't just impact people in Washington, DC, it would be \nfelt across the country. In my home State of Washington, the impacts \ncould be severe. First, Washington State is home to tens of thousands \nof Federal employees who will be furloughed or stop getting paid. It is \nalso home to one of our Nation's largest veterans communities. The VA \nhas confirmed this week that if the shutdown goes long enough, \ndisability and GI benefits will stop for veterans in places such as \nTacoma, Everett, and Spokane due to some tea party Republicans in \nWashington, DC, who can't have their way.\n  That is not all. If the tea party forces this government to shut \ndown, our State's gorgeous national parks, such as Olympic National \nPark and Mount Rainier, will be closed to the public. Students at the \nUniversity of Washington and Washington State University may not be \nable to access student loans to pay their tuition bills. Funds for \nimportant public health programs, such as WIC, would be cut for women \nand children who rely on them. Federal support for dozens of Head Start \nfacilities in Seattle and across our State would be at risk.\n  The good news is that none of this has to happen. We still have time, \nand the Senate has passed a shutdown-prevention bill that would avoid \nall of this harm. The Senate's short-term funding bill would keep the \ngovernment open at current spending levels with no changes in policies \nwhile we continue to work on that important long-term budget bill.\n  The Senate bill by no means is a long-term solution. It is not even \nclose. But as we work to bridge the gap between the parties on budget \nissues, the absolute bare minimum Congress should be able to do, the \nvery least we owe to our constituents is to not actively hurt them and \nsabotage the economy.\n  Playing partisan games with a temporary stopgap continuing resolution \nis like trying to take away health care from millions of Americans. Tea \nparty Republicans are doing exactly that. Many of their fellow \nRepublicans believe this is an irresponsible and unworkable attitude. \nMany Republicans have spoken to discourage their own colleagues from \nwaging this pointless, harmful fight over defunding the Affordable Care \nAct. They have agreed with Democrats that while we might not see eye to \neye on everything, we don't have to abandon our basic \nresponsibilities--like keeping the government open--in order to \nnegotiate.\n\n[[Page S7038]]\n\n  We desperately need this type of commonsense bipartisanship because \nwe have seen repeatedly that families across the political spectrum are \nsick of governing by crisis and the uncertainty that it creates in \ntheir lives. They are sick of gridlock in Washington, DC, that impacts \neverything from their childcare to their paycheck.\n  Unfortunately, it seems as if the House Republicans haven't had quite \nenough yet. They seem to think this is some kind of game, that whoever \nis left holding the hot potato will be held responsible. Let me be very \nclear. The American people are a lot smarter than that. They know tea \nparty Republicans have been pushing us toward this crisis for months. \nThey are going to know why a shutdown happened should the tea party \nrefuse to pass the Senate's clean continuing resolution to keep the \ngovernment open.\n  Allowing our government to shut down isn't in anyone's best \ninterest--not Republicans, not Democrats, and above all, not the \nAmerican people. So I would like to call on Speaker Boehner to take one \nsimple step. I ask simply that he allow a vote on the Senate's clean \ncontinuing resolution. I truly believe that given the chance, enough \nRepublicans in the House would join with the Democrats in voting for a \nclean continuing resolution to keep the government open so we can deal \nwith the bigger issues in front of us.\n  If Speaker Boehner takes that step, we could avoid all the disruption \nand all of the harm a government shutdown will cause to the families \nand communities we serve. Then we could move forward and continue our \nwork, which is incredibly important, on a longer term budget deal that \nends this crisis and puts our families and our economy first. This is \nwhat families across the country expect, and it is what my fellow \nconstituents in the State of Washington expect. That is what I am \nfighting for, and that is what we should deliver.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I rise to once again speak about where we are, where we \nought to be, and where I hope we will be.\n  It is now 8:30 in the evening. We are 3\\1/2\\ hours, essentially, \nuntil the government begins to shut down. Can we believe this? We are \nthe United States of America. We are a superpower. We are supposed to \nbe a nation governed by rule of law, and we are about to shut down--not \nshut us down because of a catastrophic event that hit us. It is not as \nif a meteor has streaked across the sky and hit the United States of \nAmerica, taking out our power grid and rendering us powerless.\n  It is not as if we have been hit by a global pandemic that would \nbring us to our knees. We are in a self-induced act, about to shut down \nthe functioning of the government of the United States of America. I \nfind this shocking.\n  I have been through this in the mid-1990s. It is deeply disturbing to \nthe people who work for the Federal Government, who get up every day \nand go to their job trying to perform a service or a function they \nconsider important to the United States, whether it is in \ntransportation, protecting the environment, Federal law enforcement, \nimportant financial regulatory agencies, such as our consumer \nprotection agency or our financial services or the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission in my own State, which protects us and particularly \nour children against harmful products.\n  So there are those functions that are going to be shut down. You know \nwhat is going to be said to those people--to the men and women who work \nfor the United States of America. Most of you are considered \nnonessential.\n  That might be a witty throwaway line for a cable TV show, but I \nhappen to think they are very essential and so does the rest of \nAmerica.\n  These people are performing very important functions to protect \nAmerica.\n  The House feels it protected America by passing a military pay bill. \nThe Senate passed it by unanimous consent. But guess what. It still \nmeans almost 50 percent of the men and women who work at the Department \nof Defense will be furloughed tomorrow. They are going to be told they \nare nonessential. Who is essential to defense and who isn't? We \ncertainly know our men and women who wear the uniform and who are in \nharm's way need to get their pay. They need to get their supplies. They \nneed to get what they need to defend America, but they also need a \nfully functioning Department of Defense.\n  I think there are other agencies that protect the United States, one \nof which is Federal law enforcement--whether it is the FBI, the Marshal \nService, the Drug Enforcement Agency, and, yes, the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, Firearms and Explosives. They put themselves in the line of \nfire too, along with our Customs and our Border Patrol agents, some of \nwhom have already died. What about our prison guards who are there \nfacing people who are ready to either kill them or break out or break \nthem up at the first chance they can get.\n  We don't have to pursue this route. Remember, this is self-induced. \nIt is, as our President said, being induced by one faction in one party \nin one House of our government over one issue--not funding, but should \nwe fund the President's Affordable Care Act. That is the law of the \nland. It is already in existence, and a good part of it will go into \neffect on October 1.\n  When I talk about this, I am speaking from the standpoint of being \nthe chair of the committee called the Appropriations Committee. That is \nthe committee that puts money into the Federal checkbook. That Federal \ncheckbook keeps the entire discretionary funding for the U.S. \nGovernment operating--and it is $1 trillion. Wow. What a number. Gasp. \nYou know what. It is a big number, but it is a big country with big \nresponsibilities.\n  That is not the total funding of the Federal Government because there \nis mandatory spending. Mandatory spending is our Social Security \nbenefits, our veterans' benefits, earned benefits--earned benefits. All \nof that is over several other trillion dollars. There is a dispute \nabout how much the spending should be. That is an honest dispute. That \nis what funding disputes and resolutions should be about. I should be \nin a room right this very minute with my House counterpart, Congressman \nHal Rogers, the Republican chairman, a fine, honorable man from \nKentucky, and my Democratic counterpart Congresswoman Nita Lowey from \nNew York, along with my vice chairman, Senator Richard Shelby, another \nfine Southern gentleman, a fiscal conservative, and we should be \ndiscussing that.\n  But that is not what we are talking about. We are not talking about \nwhat is the House's number, what is the Senate's number, what is the \nbest number to fund our government and do it in a way that is smart, \neffective, and frugal. Oh no. The big fight is over ObamaCare. That is \nnot what it should be about. We have had something called continuing \nresolutions before. A continuing resolution should have another word in \nit--``funding.'' It is the continued funding resolution, and it is to \nkeep government funded while we resolve our disputes.\n  These resolutions were always, No. 1, short term, and No. 2, they \nfocused on fiscal differences--where did we disagree on fiscal matters. \nAnd there is disagreement. The House marked up their bills primarily to \n$988 billion. That acknowledged that sequester is the new normal. We in \nthe Senate marked up our bill, and the number we used was $1.058 \ntrillion. The number I used came from the Senate-passed budget bill \nunder the chairmanship of Senator Patty Murray. So there is a $70 \nbillion difference between the House and the Senate, and that is an \nhonest dispute.\n  I am ready to negotiate with Congressman Rogers, but I am not ready \nto capitulate. What does capitulate mean? It means we don't even get to \na number because we are fighting about ObamaCare. We should be \ndiscussing what is the way to do this. I am willing to see a compromise \nbecause my goal is that in December we will pass all of the funding \nbills, that we would have canceled sequester for 2 years, and we would \nhave formed a compromise on a number that does reduce public debt--we \nacknowledge that--but that also\n\n[[Page S7039]]\n\nmakes public investments that create jobs and growth in our country. We \nwould do that through transportation, research and development, and \nthings we can also make and sell overseas. These are the kinds of \nthings we want to invest in--the physical infrastructure and human \ninfrastructure, such as education, research and development. We want to \nhave the kind of approach that is progrowth and a pro-American future. \nI want to get to that debate. I want to get to that discussion. I want \nto get to that conference. But I cannot get to it because we are \nfighting over ObamaCare.\n\n  Somehow or another that term is supposed to be kind of a sarcastic \nthing, to call it ``ObamaCare.'' I think we need to respect the \nPresident of the United States. I like calling it the Affordable Care \nAct. But if people want to call it ObamaCare, let them do it. The \nPresident does care. He does care that 42 million people don't have \nhealth insurance and that we needed to reform our health care system to \nget more value for our dollar and get rid of the punitive practices of \ninsurance companies denying people health care on the basis of a \npreexisting condition and, by the way, as a consumer advocate the Chair \nknows this, charging women much more for insurance than men are charged \nof comparable age and health status.\n  So I come to the floor tonight and I ask my House colleagues--I \nserved in the House--please, let's stop the ideological amendments and \nget on to what appropriations are supposed to be, what a continuing \nresolution is supposed to be--a short-term approach. That is why I am \nrecommending November 15, to get us to the point where we have \ncompromise on fiscal matters--how can we end the sequester for 2 years, \nhow can we pass all of our funding bills, and how can we come to a \nsensible compromise on the $70 billion difference between us.\n  We have tried everything we know. Senator Murray worked very hard to \npass the budget bill. We passed it in a marathon session, and I was \nproud of us. We worked hard. We had great debate. It was heartfelt and \nhard fought. But in the end, we had over 70 votes. Then Senator Murray \ndid what the law requires. She said she wanted to go to conference, \nalong with her vice chairman and ranking member Senator Sessions. But \nsix Republican Senators objected. So we have yet to be able to even \nhave a conference to get to the overall budget, which is about what our \ntax policy should be, our approach to mandatory spending, and a target \nnumber for me to reach with my appropriations members on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  We never got to that. So we marked up our bills in appropriations. We \nfollowed the guidelines given to us by the Senate bill at $1.058 \ntrillion. We have been in frequent conversation--frequent \nconversation--with Congressman Rogers and Congresswoman Lowey. That is \nthe way Senator Shelby and I work. We also have had frequent \nconversations. But we are talking to ourselves.\n  So now I am talking to the American people. I think they want an \norderly process. The Founders of our country said we would not be a \ngovernment of personalities and plebiscites and wins and whims. We \nwould be a government of institutions and laws and a process within our \nparliamentary form of government for resolving disputes.\n  Let us get back to regular order. Let us pass a simple \nstraightforward continuing resolution to keep the government open until \nNovember 15, with the direction that we end sequester, come up with a \ncompromise on the funding, and, at the same time, be able to pass all \nof our bills. I think we can do it. I think there is the will. I think \nthere is the wallet. We just need to find the way. The way for the \nHouse is to give us a plain straightforward bill. Let us pass it over \nhere. Let us keep America open and let us keep America running.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, when defining insanity, Albert Einstein \nsaid: It is doing the same thing over and over and thinking you are \ngoing to get a different result.\n  Einstein was a genius, but it doesn't take a genius to figure out the \nproof is watching the House Republicans because they have lost their \nminds. They keep trying to do the same thing over and over. They have \nvoted to repeal ObamaCare 45 or 46 times. That is kind of a lot of \nrepetition. Now they are trying to do it again.\n  They just passed over there another piece of legislation to try and \ndiffuse, defeat, and get rid of ObamaCare. But ObamaCare is the law. We \nhad a couple of Republicans today come and talk about the Obama health \ncare bill. That has long since passed. It is the law. Do I need to \nremind everyone again that the U.S. Supreme Court has said it is \nconstitutional?\n  The Speaker, instead of allowing all 435 Members of the House of \nRepresentatives to vote to keep the government open for business, is \nonce again pushing for a government shutdown. I think this is what they \nwant. Remember, they don't believe in government. So what is a real \ngood way to hurt government? Shut it down.\n  The House once again has attached ridiculous policy riders that are \ndead on arrival over here.\n  I heard this story before--in fact, just 6 hours ago. Republicans are \nonce again threatening to shut down the government unless Democrats \nrepeal ObamaCare for 1 year. But, once again, we will not relitigate \nthe health care debate or negotiate at the point of a gun. This time \nthe House has attached a poisoned pill that would punish 16,000 \ncongressional staff. The amendment originally offered by the junior \nSenator from Louisiana would force congressional staff to cover the \nfull cost of their health care.\n  Think about this for a minute. Others have thought about it. The \nnewspaper Politico said yesterday, perfectly explaining the hypocrisy \nof this approach:\n\n       Some health care opponents claim the Obama administration \n     is giving members of Congress and their staffs special \n     treatment under the Affordable Care Act. The claim, which . . \n     . is simply false: Although they will be required to enroll \n     in health plans offered within the new health-insurance \n     exchanges under the law, members of Congress and their staffs \n     will not receive extra financial help to pay for their \n     medical care.\n       In reality, it's the critics--as part of their ongoing \n     assault on the health care law--who are seeking special \n     treatment for Congress, by proposing to make members and \n     their staffs the only workers in the United States whose \n     employer is barred by law from helping to cover their \n     premiums.\n\n  I repeat, in reality it is the critics--Politico said--as part of \ntheir ongoing assault on the health care law--who are seeking special \ntreatment from Congress, by proposing to make members and their staffs \nthe only workers in the United States whose employer is barred by law \nfrom helping to cover their premiums.\n  Like other Americans who get their health care through their jobs, a \nportion of the cost of congressional staff health care premiums is \ncurrently covered by their employer. Their employer is the Federal \nGovernment. There are about 6 million of us. In other words, Members of \nCongress and congressional staff live by the same rules as other \nAmericans and other Federal employees. As a matter of fact, all Members \nof Congress will be getting their health care on marketplace exchanges \njust like tens of millions of other Americans. Six hundred thousand \nNevadans are now eligible. They will start signing up tomorrow. But \nHouse Republicans want to force our staff, who work so hard, to live by \na different set of rules.\n  Although many of these Republicans have gladly allowed the Federal \nGovernment to pay for a portion of their own health insurance, for \nyears--decades, some of them--they now want to force 16,000 \ncongressional employees to cover the full cost of their health \ninsurance.\n  If Republican Senators believe they should bear the full cost of \ntheir own health insurance, they should decline the employer \ncontribution and pay their own way. They should stop being \nhypocritical. They should practice what they preach. But punishing \n16,000 innocent congressional workers is simply mean-spirited.\n  Speaker Boehner knows this new amendment won't last any longer than \nthe last one, once it gets to the Senate; and it should be quick. The \nSenate will vote it down, and the House Republicans will be in the same \npickle they are in right now--but with even less time left before the \ngovernment shuts down.\n\n[[Page S7040]]\n\n  But there is still a way for the Speaker to get out of this quagmire, \nto get out of this ditch, this hole that they have dug for themselves. \nBut I am not sure they want out of this hole, because common sense \ndictates, if you want to get out of the hole, stop digging deeper. But \nthey do that. They are over there now figuring how glad they are the \nhole is deeper than it ever was. I believe there is a significant \nnumber--if not the majority--of the House Republicans who want the \ngovernment to close.\n  So here is what the Speaker should do to get out of this hole that he \nhas dug: Let the House vote, all 435 Members, on the continuing \nresolution that we passed. We did it on Friday. We affirmed that this \nafternoon. Stop standing in the way, I say to the Speaker John Boehner. \nLet the House work its will.\n  If Speaker Boehner prevents the Senate bill from coming to the floor \nbefore midnight, the responsibility for this government shutdown is \nclearly a Republican government shutdown and will rest squarely on his \nshoulders, as all America knows.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank the majority leader for the \nstatement he just made.\n  It is hard to believe that we are a little over 3 hours away from \nshutting down the government of the United States of America. When you \nhear about this happening in foreign countries, you think: It is a \nshame they just aren't as stable and strong as our great democracy. Yet \nhere we are, facing that possibility just a few hours from now, and it \nis through our own fault. It is the failure of leadership.\n  I will tell you what we have done in the Senate. I think it is the \nright thing. We passed a clean CR, a clean budget bill. No political \nstrings attached. None. We could have attached the immigration bill, \nthe farm bill, a lot of possibilities there. None. A clean budget bill \nfor America's government for the next 6 weeks, we sent it over to the \nHouse and said, just vote for this, and we don't have to shut down the \ngovernment. They have said ``no'' repeatedly. And they are about to \nsend us the third effort of the House, and it too will be defeated \nbecause they are obsessed with ObamaCare--obsessed with the Health Care \nReform Act. More than obsessed. They are living in mortal fear of what \nis going to happen starting tomorrow.\n  As we will see, across America they are going to announce the \ninsurance exchanges in every State. People who have never had health \ninsurance in their entire lives will have a chance to buy it. Some of \nit will be affordable for a lot of families. Some of it will be the \nfirst chance a family has had to buy health insurance.\n  There was an article I read over the weekend in one of the Chicago \npapers about a family raising a child with mental illness. As a \nconsequence, they have been disqualified every time they tried to buy \nhealth insurance. Nobody will insure them because their child suffers \nfrom mental illness. Guess what. As of tomorrow they will get a list of \nhealth insurance plans in their State they can buy. And it is in \ncompetition--in a marketplace--and they can choose from many different \noptions. In my State of Illinois, there are 54 different options that \nwe can choose from for our health insurance. It means for that family \nwhich has lived without health insurance because of the mental illness \nof their son, for the first time in their lives they will be able to \nbuy health insurance.\n  If one has ever lived as a parent with a sick child without health \ninsurance, you will never forget it as long as you live. I know of what \nI speak. I was there and I remember it, and I will never forget it. \nWhen you finally get health insurance, you can breathe again knowing \nthat, if something happens, you will get help in paying those medical \nbills. For some of these families, for a lifetime they have never had a \nchance.\n  That is why the Republicans want to stop ObamaCare. They don't want \nthese exchanges to be announced. They don't want people to see these \noptions. They know what is going to happen: 40 million uninsured \nAmericans are going to take to this because it gives them the first \nlifeline they have ever seen when it comes to health insurance. That is \nwhat it is all about, and that is why they fear it and hate it so much. \nIt is going to work. It is going to give peace of mind to families. And \nwe are never going back.\n  We will change some of these provisions in this health care reform. \nOf course, we will. Anything this big is going to be changed, as it \nshould be. Wisdom and experience is going to give us some ideas of how \nto make it better and stronger and work more fairly. That is why the \nRepublicans are so determined to stop it tonight, before it can go into \nits first phase of advertising marketplaces tomorrow.\n  They are going to fail, again. For the third time they are going to \nfail in just a few days with this House approach with strings attached.\n  And there is one other element here. I am glad the majority leader \nraised it. People think that Members of Congress have these gilded \nhealth insurance plans, and the honest answer is we do have a pretty \ngood health insurance plan. We go through what is known as the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program. Eight million Federal employees and \ntheir families, including Members of Congress and their staff, buy into \nit. It has been around for decades. It works well. My wife and I can \nchoose from nine different health insurance plans in Illinois as \nFederal employees. We choose the big Blue Cross plan, and we pay the \nhighest premium for it. But our employer pays a share of the premium. \nThis is not a radical idea. One hundred fifty million Americans have \nexactly the same arrangement. They get their health insurance through \ntheir work, and their employer pays a portion of the health insurance \npremium.\n  Now come the House Republicans and they have come up with a new idea.\n  First, the requirement that Members of Congress and their staff buy \ninsurance through the marketplace. It is OK with me. I have taken a \nlook at the marketplace plans. They will cover my family just fine, \nthank you.\n  Now they add the kicker. But, the Federal Government cannot pay for \nany of the premiums. Why? Because we know, under the health insurance \nmarketplace small businesses with fewer than 50 employees can provide \nan employer contribution to their employee buying through that \nmarketplace. It is in the law.\n  So Members of Congress aren't being treated any differently when our \nemployer--the Federal Government--pays part of our premium in the \nmarketplace. That is all that the law says. They want to stop that. It \nisn't because of the injustice, because others are getting the same \nbenefit and we are not getting special treatment. It is because they \nwant to find a way to create some pain in the process.\n  Senator Reid talked about 16,000 congressional workers and their \nfamily members. I am sure that number included their family members. \nThey want to single them out and say that they get no employer \ncontribution for their health insurance. Shame on them for coming up \nwith this idea.\n  To deny hard-working people--whether Members of Congress or our \nstaff--the basic protection of health insurance without digging deeper \ninto their pockets, is that their idea of making this a fairer, more \njust society? I don't think so.\n  We are going to reject what the House is about to send over, and the \nclock is ticking. It will be a few hours left before midnight. There is \nan answer to this, though, an easy one.\n  Right now, Speaker Boehner has in his power the ability to call a \nbill on the floor that will avoid the government shutdown. It is a bill \npassed in the Senate, a bill with no political strings attached, a \nsimple extension of the government's budget for 6 weeks. He can do it. \nHe can stop what otherwise will happen tomorrow morning, when agencies \nall across our Nation give notice to their Federal employees: Go home. \nWe are shut down. It means hundreds of thousands of Federal employees \ntomorrow will be sent home and not paid for their day's work, and the \nthings they do to make this a stronger country and to keep our \ngovernment working will just come to a stop.\n  The greatest Nation on earth shutting down its government on October \n1, 2013. It is totally unnecessary. It is a manufactured political \ncrisis by tea party Republicans. We are hoping that\n\n[[Page S7041]]\n\nsome of our friends on the Republican side of the aisle--conservatives, \nmoderate conservatives from all over the Nation--will join us.\n  Let's spare this embarrassment for America. Let's allow those Federal \nworkers to go to work tomorrow as they should and provide our country \nthe services it needs. Let's get ready for health care reform and the \nmarketplace, and let's let the American people be the judge as to \nwhether it is right or not. I think it will be. But trying to stop it \nin its tracks is just a fool's errand, as one of the Members of \nCongress on the Republican side described it.\n  If the Speaker would call the spending bill that passed the Senate \nfor a vote tonight in the House of Representatives, we can be spared \nthis government shutdown.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, will my friend withhold for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I was just speaking with my friend from \nArizona, and I direct this question to my friend from Illinois.\n  Nevada is not a heavily populated State as is Illinois, but we have a \nnumber of really beautiful systems that are part of our national park \ntreasures.\n  We have one, Lake Mead, which we all know about. We have about 15,000 \npeople visit there every day. That will close at 12:01 tonight. That is \nabout 550,000 or 600,000 people a year. And Red Rock is a beautiful \nplace. Tourists love it, just like we love Lake Mead. We have 1 million \npeople a year come in.\n  This is going to happen all over America. I mentioned just a couple \nof things in Nevada. I will bet my friend knows of national treasures \nin Illinois that will close. Is that true?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator from Nevada that we have \n50,000 Federal employees in Illinois, and we expect the majority of \nthem to be sent home tomorrow. They are working in places such as the \nRock Island Arsenal. Some of those employees will have to go home \ntomorrow morning. These are men and women who make the armaments \nAmerica needs to be safe. The same will happen at Scott Air Force Base \nand at Great Lakes Naval Training Station. That is the reality.\n  I might also add to the Senator, because of my responsibilities on \nthe Appropriations Committee I was briefed this afternoon about the \nimpact of a government shutdown on the intelligence agencies of the \nUnited States. I am not at liberty to give a number, but it is an \namazingly large percentage of those working in intelligence agencies \ntomorrow who will be told to go home. These men and women are watching \nout for our safety and security, to guard against terrorism every \nsingle day. Because the government shuts down, they will be sent home. \nNot all of them; the military personnel involved will continue. But the \nnonmilitary personnel, many of them, thousands of them, will be sent \nhome from work tomorrow. For what purpose? To make a political point \nabout the power of Congress to shut down the government?\n\n  It doesn't make us any safer as a nation. It certainly doesn't \nenhance our reputation. And it is not helping to build our economy. As \nthe Senator from Nevada knows, we are making a recovery. It is slow. We \nhave been told by the Business Roundtable, not necessarily an ally of \nthe Democratic Party, that this tea party Republican strategy will be \ndisastrous in terms of economic growth. I don't know if the word was \ncalamitous or catastrophic or cataclysmic--whatever, it was one of \nthose. They told us to do this will be damaging to this economy. Yet \nthe House Republican leadership is hell-bent on getting this done, \nshutting down this government tonight.\n  All they have to do is take what has passed the Senate, our budget \nproposal that has passed the Senate, and call it for a vote. If they \ncall it for a vote, it will pass and they know it, and Speaker Boehner \nand the tea party Republicans live in fear of that possibility.\n  I hope they come to their senses. This is about more than a political \nbragging point, more than tomorrow's headline. We can avoid shutting \ndown this government.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, as you know, we are only 2 hours now \nfrom a shutdown. I am sure those who are mesmerized by our behavior saw \na group of Senators on the floor who looked like they were smiling and \nenjoying themselves. Let me tell the Presiding Officer what was going \non.\n  Senators were actually having a conversation. We were talking about \nis there a possibility of a compromise. What you saw there is what I \nhope eventually would become a committee of 100, people actually \nthinking what could get us to a situation where we could begin to focus \non the fiscal problems of the United States. There is a difference \nbetween the House appropriations bill and the Senate bill. I chair that \ncommittee. So there is a difference with us. But what I want people to \nsee is that there are good people on both sides of the aisle who would \nlike to get something done.\n  The first thing we would like to get done tonight is not to have a \ngovernment shutdown and to lay the groundwork for a continuing funding \nresolution that would be short term, that would enable us to come up \nwith a compromise on discretionary spending, where we could reduce our \npublic debt, fund our government at a smart, frugal level, and also do \nit in the way that promotes growth. This is what I think the mood of \nmany in the Senate is. I think it is the mood on the majority of both \nsides of the aisle.\n  So what do we need from our friends in the House? We do not need one \nmore politically provocative, veto-bait rider on the funding \nresolution. The Senate passed a bill that essentially laid out a \nframework exactly for what I said, a continuing resolution to November \n15, and a fiscal level that is their level now. We want to negotiate \nup. I certainly do.\n  If they would just take up the Senate bill which is neat, clean, \nclear, and gets us moving forward, we could be able to do this. So we \nwere not just ha-ha-ha'ing over there. There is nothing here tonight to \nha-ha-ha about. But there is a mood on both sides of the aisle to stop \nthe shutdown, stop the shutdown and stop the slamdown. Let's be able to \npass something tonight that gets us to a way that we can keep the \ngovernment open, keep our processors functioning for compromise and \nnegotiation and be able to get the job done.\n  I think it would be an outstanding achievement. I believe the mood is \nhere. I said it earlier. I think there is the will. I even think there \nis the wallet. Please, if the House cooperates, we would even have a \nway forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I wish to follow the comments from \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Committee. This has been a tough \nweek. It has been a tough weekend. It has been a tough day. I think as \nMembers of the Senate, as we approach the showdown of a potential \nshutdown, it is important for us to recognize what is at stake. This is \nnot just me staying here holding the floor late on a Monday evening. I \nhave neighbors here in Washington, DC, who work for the Federal \nGovernment. One works for Homeland Security. One works for the \nDepartment of Defense. They asked me over the weekend: Am I working on \nTuesday? What is happening on Tuesday? Are we shutting the government \ndown?\n  When we talk about those who are uncertain about what happens this \nnext week with their jobs, I think it is important to recognize it is \nnot just jobs we are talking about; it is the reality that if I am not \nat work is the childcare facility my kids go to going to be open? What \ndoes that mean to me?\n  If I am the local sandwich shop owner around the corner from where \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service building is and most of the folks who \nwork for Fish and Wildlife are not working next week, what does that \nmean to me? How many loaves of bread do I make over this next week? I \nthink we need to appreciate and understand, when we are talking about a \ngovernment shutdown, it does not just mean those who receive a check \nfrom the Federal Government. The ripple effect from what we do has \nconsequences.\n  As we debate, as we ping-pong back and forth between this body and \nour colleagues on the House side, I think we need to recognize that \nthere are real lives, real families who are lying awake tonight \nwondering what the rest of the week is going to mean to them. This is a \ndifficult time for us. There are stakes that are very high.\n  I have not hidden the fact that I am not a supporter of the \nAffordable Care Act. I have voted against it every time we have had the \nopportunity to do so. But do I believe we should shut down the Federal \nGovernment at this point because we have not been able to shut down the \nAffordable Care Act? I think we have a responsibility here. We have a \nresponsibility to govern. We are not doing that right now.\n  Folks back home are talking about a lot of things, talking about the \nfact that they had a tough fish season in certain parts of the State, \ntalking about the fact that winter is coming on, and our energy costs \nare still as high as they ever have been. They are worried about what \nis coming forward for them and their families. What they do not need is \nto see that their government cannot operate.\n  So as we deal with these very weighty decisions at this very late \nhour, we need to remember whom we represent, what we are doing here. It \nis not just about the next election; it is about making sure those \npeople whom we work for are not stressing and are not anxious about \nwhat tomorrow is going to bring for them.\n  So I am hopeful in the less than 2 hours we have, we will be able to \nfigure out how we keep the government running, how we keep the wheels \non the bus, and how we get back together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I wish to thank my colleague from Alaska Ms. Murkowski \nand also the chair of the Appropriations Committee Senator Mikulski for \ntheir comments because I think, as Senator Mikulski said, the majority \nof the Members in this body believe it is important for us to keep the \ngovernment open.\n  We may disagree about the Affordable Care Act, but one aspect we \nought to be able to agree on is that it is in the best interests of \nthis country to keep government open. I believe the same is true in the \nHouse; that if the Speaker would bring up the Senate-passed CR, that is \nclean, that does not have any amendments on it, that extends funding \nfor government through November 15, that accepts the top line numbers \nfor the amount of money we would spend during that period, accept the \nHouse numbers, if the Speaker would let that be voted on, on the floor, \nI think it would pass the House.\n  It is unfortunate that he has been unwilling to do that. But the \nreality is, as both Senators Mikulski and Murkowski said, a shutdown of \nthe government is not just about what we are doing on the floor tonight \nor what the House is doing, it will have ramifications way beyond that.\n  We had a meeting last week with some economists that included former \nTreasury Secretary Bob Rubin. One of the things he said to us was that \nunlike the last government shutdown in 1995, when there was not a real \nlong-term impact from that shutdown, we are looking at a real long-term \nimpact from a potential shutdown. We have already heard Mark Zandi, an \neconomist, say that if it continues longer than a few days, if it \ncontinues for weeks, as it did in 1995, it could affect our growth in \nthe fourth quarter over 1 percent.\n  At a time when the economy is struggling, we cannot afford to have \nthat kind of a hit to our economy. Families who are seeing their \n401(k)s just beginning to recover, pension plans that are beginning to \nsee recovery, cannot afford to have that kind of a hit. We have already \nseen the stock market reacting. So we know there is going to be an \nimpact.\n\n[[Page S7043]]\n\n  In New Hampshire we have 4,000 Federal employees who are going to get \nfurloughed starting tomorrow if we are not able to keep the government \nopen. That affects not just them and their family, that is bad enough, \nbut it affects the grocery stores they frequent. It affects the gas \nstation. It affects every business they are shopping in.\n  We know 1,000 small businesses are not going to be able to go to the \nSBA and look for loans if the government shuts down. We know people are \nnot going to be able to get their mortgages through the Federal Home \nLoan Agency because it is not going to be operating.\n  We know in New Hampshire, as in Alaska, that tourism is going to be \nhit because visas are not going to get processed. We know that at the \nDepartment of Defense, half of their civilian workers are going to be \nfurloughed; in New Hampshire, our Portsmouth Naval Shipyard--in New \nHampshire and Maine. I see my colleague from Maine. The shipyard \nworkers are going to get furloughed.\n  So this is going to have a huge impact on families, on businesses, on \nthe economy. We cannot afford this kind of political gamesmanship. We \nhave to work together. We have to solve these problems, not just for \nthe future of this country here in America but also for our standing in \nthe world, where the rest of the world is looking at us, asking: What \nis the matter with the Congress that they cannot solve an issue that \nthey ought to be able to come together to address?\n  I certainly hope in the next couple of hours we can see some progress \nin the House. I hope the Speaker will bring a clean CR to the floor, \nwill let the Members of the House vote on that so we can keep the \ngovernment operating for the good of the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, we have a number of serious \ndifficulties in our country. The most serious is a lack of jobs and a \nlack of economic growth. The Affordable Care Act is devastating to that \nsituation, making it much worse.\n  Our colleagues need to understand, as we talk about the difficulties \nthat would happen if there would be a shutdown--and there will be \ndifficulties, for sure. But the idea that this is not an important \nmatter that needs to be addressed when we confront the Affordable Care \nAct, ObamaCare, is wrong. We have to address this question.\n  One thing I would say to all of us, the numbers are in and it is \nquite clear: 77 percent of the jobs that have been created since \nJanuary of this year are part time. Every economist has said that is in \nlarge part driven by the Affordable Care Act. They have no doubt that \nthis is a major factor and is an exceedingly unusual and dangerous \ntrend that businesses are hiring people part time, not full time--77 \npercent of those hired this year are for part time work.\n  When we look at the job numbers that will come in tomorrow and at how \nmany people found jobs, maybe it will be 180,000, maybe it will be \n210,000. They will brag about that I'm sure. But has anybody thought \nabout the fact that to an unprecedented degree those jobs will be part \ntime, without health care, without retirement benefits, and less job \nsecurity? Somebody needs to be thinking about this. The health care law \nis absolutely a driving factor. Businesses told me that as I traveled \nmy State in August. They say they are trying to keep small businesses \nbelow 50 employees too. They are not hiring people only to stay below \n50 employees so they don't have to comply with some of these rules.\n  What have we heard all year? We are not going to talk about fixing \nthe Affordable Care Act. We are not going to bring it up. We are not \ngoing to get a single amendment in the Senate.\n  The House has repeatedly legislated on the Affordable Care Act. The \nSenate refuses to take up their bills, refuses to allow votes, refuses \nto have a full debate. We are at the end of the year, and nothing has \nbeen done about it. We could expect some tension to build up here.\n  What I hear the House saying is: Delay this bill for 1 year. It is \nnot working. Delay the individual mandate and give ordinary Americans \nsome relief from this law. The President has already delayed parts of \nObamaCare--probably without lawful authority--and delayed it for a year \nfor Big business. But the President and Senator Reid have, in effect, \nsaid: We will shut down the government before we delay the law for \nordinary Americans.\n  The House has passed a bill to fund the government, but the bill that \nwas just voted down would simply have delayed the individual mandate in \nthe Affordable Care Act for 1 year. Maybe this time we could actually \nfix some of the problems or change some of the provisions in ObamaCare \nthat are so damaging to America.\n  One thing I wish everyone to know--and I am the ranking Republican on \nthe Budget Committee and we deal with the numbers--I wrote to the \nGovernment Accountability Office. They are an independent group, and I \nasked them what the long-term costs of the Affordable Care Act would \nbe. The President said, unequivocally, this bill will not add one dime \nto the debt of the United States. Do you remember him saying that? He \nsaid it many times. His aides and Senators said the same thing many \ntimes. The President went on to say, however, you may have forgotten: \nNot now, not ever, period.\n  Well, is that true? Will the Obama administration health care law not \nadd one dime to the United States debt now or ever?\n  What did the Government Accountability Office say? This is a chart \nthat reflects what they told the Budget Committee in response to my \nquestion.\n  They said over the 75-year period, it adds $6.2 trillion to the debt \nof the United States. That number is huge, as $1 trillion is a lot of \nmoney.\n  How huge is it? How do we compare it? All of us know that Social \nSecurity is in great difficulty and under serious threat. We have to \nreform it and put it on a sound basis. It is not going to be easy to do \nthat. Why? Well, it has unfunded liabilities. We don't have enough \nmoney coming in to pay for the commitments we made to pay out in the \nfuture.\n  Remember, Social Security has a dedicated source of revenue as well. \nIt is on your paycheck every month. It is the FICA we pay. It goes to \nSocial Security and there is a Medicare withholding too. Those funds \nare dedicated for Social Security or Medicare. But people are living \nlonger, and the benefits are such that we are going to have a shortfall \nin the future.\n  How much is that Social Security shortfall we have been wrestling \nover how to fix? It is $7.7 trillion. In the ObamaCare bill that passed \non Christmas Eve, that they rammed through the Senate on Christmas Eve \non a party-line vote before Scott Brown could take office and provide \nthe vote for Massachusetts that would have killed the bill. They rammed \nit through the Senate without any amendments, and it added at least \nanother $6.2 trillion to the long-term debt of the United States of \nAmerica. It is worse than that, and I can explain why it is even worse. \nThat number does not consider interest on the $6.2 trillion over 75 \nyears. I suspect the interest is going to be many trillions of dollars \nmore and it adds to the debt.\n  As we borrow the money, we pay interest on the money we borrow. It is \nnot free. We borrow the money on the market or from trust funds. This \nis a big deal. The American people need to know that the promise this \nlaw will not add to the debt is absolutely false.\n  This is based on, the GAO said, accepted accounting principles and a \nrealistic scenario of what is likely to happen over time should the \nplan be implemented. One of the things they say is the cuts they made \nto Medicare providers, hospitals and doctors, that provide health care \nto seniors are so large they will not be sustainable. If they continue \nto cut in that fashion over a period of years, hospitals would close \nand doctors would quit practicing. You cannot do it. We are already \ndealing with a doc fix now on a bill that cut doctors more than they \ncould reasonably be cut. Every year we have to find up to $20 billion \nto get the money to fund the doctors because we can't cut below a \ncertain amount. So I would say this GAO number is low.\n  As we wrestle with the great responsibilities we have been given as \nSenators, yes, we need to think about what would happen in the next few \ndays if the government does not function. I hope we avoid that. We \nabsolutely should avoid that because it is not good.\n\n[[Page S7044]]\n\n  We need to be asking ourselves what are we doing to our children, \ngrandchildren, and the financial stability of the United States of \nAmerica with a new entitlment program that is going to commence now, by \nJanuary 1, that will add more than $6.2 trillion to the debt of the \nUnited States. This is a huge amount. I ask our colleagues to consider \nit.\n  One more matter that shows how we get in trouble financially is when \nthe numbers get so large nobody can quite follow. The larger the \nnumbers get, the harder it is to follow.\n  Under the legislation of the Affordable Care Act, the plan was to cut \nup to $500 billion over the next 10 years from Medicare by cutting \nproviders while promising patients would receive just as good health \ncare as they always did. We are not cutting your benefits, we are only \ngoing to cut providers. We have done this before. At some point you \ncan't sustain that.\n  On December 23, the night before this bill passed, I spoke with the \nDirector of the Congressional Budget Office, our own accountant, and \ntold him in a conference call words to this effect: It is absolutely \nunbelievable to me, Mr. CBO Director, Mr. Elmendorf, that we are about \nto vote tomorrow morning, we are told, on the largest health care bill \nsince Medicare and we don't know how to count the money. I think they \nare double-counting the money. This is unbelievable, how many hundred \nbillion dollars we are talking about, it seems to me. I could hear \nsomebody on his end of the conference call say: It is double-counting. \nI heard someone say it in the background.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent of the Chair for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. Elmendorf, by the next morning, gave us a letter. It laid out and \ncontained this language. He said:\n\n       The key point is that savings to the HI trust fund--\n\n  That is the Medicare trust fund.\n\n     --of $500 billion over 10 years, the savings from the HI \n     trust fund by cutting providers and increase Medicare taxes \n     under PPACA--\n\n     That is the Affordable Care Act.\n\n     --would be received by the government only once, so they \n     cannot be set aside to pay for future Medicare spending and, \n     at the same time, pay for current spending on other parts of \n     the legislation or on other programs.\n\n  You can't simultaneously say you are using this money to support \nMedicare by making Medicare more sustainable and then spend the money \non a new program because then it is not going to be available to \nstrengthen Medicare. That double-counting is not even taken into \naccount in the $6.2 trillion figure derived from the GAO study.\n  I would conclude by saying the unfunded liabilities in this law are \nhuge. They are a direct threat to the future of the United States \nfinancially. At this point in history, we need to be saving Medicare, \nwe need to be saving Social Security, and we need to be saving \nMedicaid. We don't need to be starting another program without \nsufficient funds to pay for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I am happy to have an opportunity to speak for a \nminute, particularly following my good friend, the Senator from \nAlabama. He and I have worked on so many issues. It shows one day you \ncan work together and agree on something and the next day you can have \ndifferent points of view.\n  He and I worked successfully on the RESTORE Act. We worked on the \nFAIR Act where we can get a portion of our revenues to bring back to \nAlabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, from offshore oil and gas production. \nI have to say I have enjoyed working with him many times over the years \nwe have been in the Senate.\n  Tonight I take issue with some of the things he said. To \nrecapitulate, with much due respect, if everything the Senator said \nabout the Affordable Care Act was actually factual--and it is not--if \neverything he said about the act was true, this time and method of \nshutting down the government to prove his point is still wrong.\n  You should not hold Federal employees, the economy of the United \nStates, the governments of the United States--Federal, State, or local \nwhich will be affected by this--hostage because you agree or think that \nthe Affordable Care Act is a bad act. It is the wrong method and it is \nthe wrong time for that debate. That is the issue.\n  They are on the floor debating whether the Affordable Care Act is \ngood or bad. This is not the debate we are having tonight. The debate \nwe should be having tonight, whether it is good or bad, is, is it worth \nshutting down the government of the United States tonight? The answer \nis clearly no.\n  Secondly, the Senator from Alabama said this bill was passed in the \nmiddle of the night. It was passed late one night several years ago. It \nhas been passed by the House and the Senate, signed into law as every \nbill by the President of the United States. In the case of this law, it \nwas upheld by the Supreme Court and is being implemented by a majority \nof States in the United States. This bill, law, concept, and approach \nwas debated for 40 years in 20 Congresses. This wasn't debated in 1 \nnight, in 1 week, morning, noon, or midnight, but 40 years across many \nPresidents, both Republican and Democratic. The question was, How does \nthe richest Nation in the world, the most developed democracy on Earth, \na Nation with 1 million-plus workers, provide affordable health care \nwithout bankrupting the country and putting too much burden on either \nindividuals or businesses?\n\n  There were ideas thrown out for the 40 years this was debated--not 1 \nnight, not just on Christmas Eve. There were hundreds of hearings, \nthousands of documents, millions of pieces of paper and studies done on \nthe subject, and there were about four options:\n  One, Medicare for all--lots of opposition to that. It is expensive--\npopular but expensive.\n  The second option was a single-payer system similar to Canada's. It \nwas very popular with some, deemed too socialistic by others.\n  The third option was Medicaid savings accounts, health care savings \naccounts. Republicans love it. Democrats don't like it, don't think it \nis fair to the middle class. It would only really help those at the top \n2 percent. We said No.\n  So we compromised on an idea that came not out of the Democratic \ncaucus but out of the Republican caucus, not out of a Democratic think \ntank but a Republican think tank--the Heritage Foundation--and we \npassed a private sector, market-based insurance choice for all \nAmericans.\n  But that debate is over. At least the bill has passed; the debate \nwill go on for a while--but not about shutting the government down. The \ndebate as far as the bill passing, it is done. It is signed into law. \nAnd contrary to arguments made on the other side that nobody is \ninterested in amending anything, I don't know if they have read their \nCongressional Record. It is right in the Congressional Record. We have \nalready amended the law twice on a vote in the House and the Senate. \nRemember a year and a half ago we passed the 1099? We repealed that. It \nwas a part of the way we paid for the bill. We reviewed it after we did \nit and thought that wasn't a very good idea, and we changed it. There \nhas been another change to the law. It is not as if this law will never \nbe changed. But for Republicans--particularly the extremists--every \ntime we come up to a budget debate or the full faith and credit of the \nUnited States, to reengage in this debate, it is not fair to the \nAmerican people, it is not fair to the workers of the United States, \nand it is not fair to the businesses in the United States. It is just \nsimply not the right way to legislate.\n  So I would like the chairman from Alabama, as the ranking member of \nthe Budget Committee, I wish he would get on the floor and urge his \ncolleagues to go to conference on the budget he was talking about \nbecause I do agree with him. We do have a deficit problem. We do have a \ndebt problem. We do have some entitlements that need to be looked at. \nWe have to get our budget in balance. But the way to do it is not to \nhold the American people hostage, to take their jobs away from them and \nshut the government down. That is not\n\n[[Page S7045]]\n\nthe way to operate. It is to go to conference.\n  We have tried 18 times to go to conference, and we have been blocked \nby the Senator from Texas. The Senator from Texas Mr. Cruz has objected \nto going to conference to debate the budget.\n  Let's debate the budget. Let's debate the appropriations bills. I am \nan appropriator. I am the chair of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee.\n  Tomorrow thousands of people are going to be laid off. People who \nprotect our borders, who help navigate international trade, help keep \nour hospital industry going, passports, et cetera, are going to be \nimpacted. But instead of the Senator arguing and urging us--as the \nranking member of the Budget Committee--to go to the Budget Committee \nto negotiate, they have objected. We can't go to a conference.\n  Senator Murray passed her budget months ago. We passed a budget. The \nHouse has passed a budget. They aren't the same budget, but it is their \nversion and our version. Let's go to conference and work it out. But, \nno, we have to now threaten the shutdown of the entire government of \nthe United States because the Republicans after 40 years of debate feel \nthat was not enough. Forty years of debate was not enough. Two \nPresidential elections, which they lost, was not convincing enough. The \nmajority of the Senate fell to the Democrats. That was not convincing \nenough.\n  The people who voted that way, their votes, their actions as a \ndemocratic nation are being disrespected by our colleagues on the other \nside. It is not as though this is a dictatorship. We were elected. I \nwas even elected in a State where this is a difficult issue. It is not \nclear-cut. I have people for it and against it. But after studying and \nafter soul-searching and after looking at all the options and \nunderstanding that I have 800,000 people in my State who are uninsured, \nthat I have hundreds of thousands of small businesses that had been \ndropping their insurance because they couldn't afford it, and that 85 \npercent of our market is taken up by one company with virtually no \ncompetition, I said there has to be a better way. This may not be \nperfect, but the status quo is worse.\n  We had that debate, and their side lost. So instead of just trying to \nfix what they can or suggesting changes or finding a time where we can \ndebate--and we have already changed two things; the President, \nadministratively, has already pushed back one--they want to shut the \ngovernment down. It is on their shoulders.\n  So I came to the floor--and I will ask for 5 more minutes--to talk \nabout two things because I have hesitated to speak on this big issue \nbecause I have been focused for the last year on a real problem--not \nthat this isn't a problem; it is a problem, but this is a real issue \nthat with a little bit of attention from everyone and a lot less \nrhetoric, we could fix this, and that is helping to amend a bill that \ndid pass and does need to be amended, and that is the Biggert-Waters \nbill.\n  I am not threatening to shut the government down over this; I am \nsimply asking and raising attention to the fact that at some point we \nwould like to have a debate on this floor and in the House on Biggert-\nWaters. This was a bill that was passed through here--it wasn't debated \nfor 40 years, it was debated for a very short time. At the time the \nbill passed--Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The bill passed out of the committee on the Senate \nside. It never did come to the floor at all for debate. It went to the \nHouse, was changed pretty dramatically, and then was put in a \nconference committee. This happens sometimes. It is not usual, but it \ndoes happen. I am not complaining about that except that as a result of \nthat, hundreds of thousands of people in Louisiana, Texas, Florida, \nNorth Dakota, New York, and New Jersey, tomorrow morning--as I guess if \nthe government is shutting down, they may not be able to go to work, if \nthey have a government job--they will have a big fat bill coming on \ntheir flood insurance because Biggert-Waters, the bill in the House, \nhad several very pernicious provisions.\n  There are about 5 million flood insurance policies in the country. \nThere should be about 17 million, but there are only 5. There will be \n17 million, or some such universe as that, but there are 5 million now, \nand we have many in Louisiana.\n  When a person goes to put their house on the market and they sell it, \nthe act of selling, according to Biggert-Waters, removes their \ngrandfathered status. They then go from that grandfathered status, \nwhich was below market rate--and that was done purposely to help people \nwho live in coastal areas--not necessarily in secondary homes, not in \ncondos, not in million-dollar mansions, but people who work on the \nrivers, who fish, who live in coastal communities, hard-working \nindividuals and small businesses. This allowed them to live where they \nhave lived, in our case, for 300 years. They didn't just move there in \nthe 1980s. They didn't move down there for sunbathing. They have been \nthere for 300 years, and this was to give them an opportunity to live \nin their homes with reasonable insurance.\n  In the Biggert-Waters bill, that trigger--the act of putting up a \n``for sale'' sign or selling your house--eliminated the subsidy, \nvirtually rendering a person's house valueless. And it is not just \npaying 25 percent more, 100 percent more, or 400 percent more. That \nwould be hard enough, but in some cases it literally will render a \nhouse valueless because let's say, for instance, you paid $1,200 a year \nfor insurance, but let's say the real rate is actually $15,000. The \ntrigger mechanism means their flood insurance will go from $1,200 to \n$15,000 overnight. No one will buy a home that has a $15,000 annual \npremium for insurance. So if they have $400,000 in equity in their home \nor $500,000 or $150,000 in equity or perhaps they have $1 million in \nequity, it is gone because their house will not be able to be sold for \nvirtually any price close to what it is worth. And that is not right. \nThat comes close to a taking.\n  When this bill passed, I put an objection in the record. I said then \nthat we would be back talking about it. There are ways we can fix \nbills. We need to get Biggert-Waters fixed and changed, and I want to \nsubmit that if we don't shut the government down, we can do it. We can \nnegotiate, we can meet in conference and bring amendments to \ncommittees, and we can work together.\n  I want to read for the Record for a few minutes. I don't see anyone \nelse on the floor.\n\n       Many in Congress were led to believe that the flood \n     insurance program was unsustainable, that it consistently \n     paid out more in losses than it collected in premiums, and \n     that the only way to balance the ledger was to eliminate \n     subsidies and raise rates. That simply isn't the case.\n       During 3 of the past 5 years, the program has actually \n     collected more in premium revenue than it paid out in losses. \n     In fact, the program has tabulated an annual surplus 18 times \n     during the 42-year period for which we have data.\n\n  Now, there were times, after Florida had that terrible year--2004, I \nthink--when four hurricanes hit and of course after Katrina, where the \nprogram took a very strong hit, like when our levees broke and caused \nso much to drain from the fund. But if we look over time, it was about \na $19 million average loss per year--not great but not horrible; not \nenough to generate the kind of bill that was passed here that is so \ndraconian.\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       I also think that most Members of Congress would be \n     surprised to learn that 40 percent of all properties which \n     are required to maintain flood insurance do not have an \n     active policy. This violation of the law costs the program \n     hundreds of millions in lost revenue. Stricter penalties \n     under Biggert-Waters for lenders who fail to enforce \n     mandatory purchase requirements will help to address this, \n     but it is difficult to justify these exorbitant rate \n     increases for people who are participating in the program and \n     playing by the rules when millions of property owners are \n     bucking their legal obligation to pay into the program.\n       I also think most Members of the Congress and the general \n     public would be shocked to learn that only 44 percent of the \n     money collected by the program is used to cover flood losses \n     in a given year. In fact, the program spends more money \n     paying the insurance companies and agents who administer the \n     program but don't incur any risk and servicing the debt \n     created by the Corps of Engineers than it spends on annual \n     flood losses.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the complete \ndocument from which I just quoted.\n\n[[Page S7046]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 The Truth About Program Sustainability\n\n       Many in Congress were led to believe that the flood \n     insurance program was unsustainable, that it consistently \n     paid out more in losses than it collected in premiums, and \n     that the only way to balance the ledger was to eliminate \n     subsidies and raise rates. That simply isn't the case.\n       During 3 of the past 5 years, the program has actually \n     collected more in premium revenue than it paid out in losses. \n     In fact, the program has tabulated an annual surplus 18 times \n     during the 42-year period for which we have data. Over the \n     26-year period between the time that the federal government \n     took over the program in 1978 and the catastrophic losses in \n     2004 when Florida was struck by four major hurricanes, the \n     program collected $10.2 billion in premiums and paid out \n     $10.7 billion in claims, resulting in a modest deficit of \n     just $500 million or $19 million per year on average.\n       I also think that most members of Congress would be \n     surprised to learn that 40% of all properties which are \n     required to maintain flood insurance do not have an active \n     policy. This violation of the law costs the program hundreds \n     of millions in lost revenue. Stricter penalties under \n     Biggert-Waters for lenders who fail to enforce mandatory \n     purchase requirements will help to address this, but it is \n     difficult to justify exorbitant rate increases for people who \n     are participating in the program and playing by the rules \n     when millions of property owners are bucking their legal \n     obligation to pay into the program.\n       I also think most members of Congress and the general \n     public would be shocked to learn that only 44% of the money \n     collected by the program is used to cover expected flood \n     losses in a given year. In fact, the program spends more \n     money paying the insurance companies and agents who \n     administer the program but don't incur any risk and to \n     servicing the debt created by the Corps of Engineers than it \n     spends on annual flood losses.\n       The fiscal structure of the flood insurance program is \n     definitely broken, but it isn't because of subsidies. Taken \n     in combination, these facts paint a very different picture of \n     the National Flood Insurance Program than the one that \n     prevailed during the debate last Congress when Biggert-Waters \n     was presented to us.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, these are several reasons why this \nbill needs to be amended. Again, I am not threatening to shut the \ngovernment down. That is not appropriate to get amendments to this \nbill. There are ways to amend a bill, and we can work on that.\n  Madam President, I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a quote from Michael Hecht. Michael Hecht is the executive \ndirector of GNO, Inc. He is leading a great delegation or a group of \npeople--realtors, bankers, gulf coast residents and many others.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Michael Hecht Quote\n\n       I would like to read a statement that was made last week by \n     the President of Greater New Orleans Inc., a regional \n     business organization in Louisiana, which I believe conveys \n     the sentiment of thousands of people who I represent that are \n     facing steep rate increases in the midst of so many \n     unanswered questions and misconceptions about this program's \n     underlying problems.\n       ``It is irresponsible to introduce drastic reforms that \n     will potentially devastate hundreds of thousands of American \n     home- and business-owners, before basic questions about \n     forgone revenues and high costs are answered. To proceed \n     otherwise, destroying the wealth of innocent Americans--who \n     have done exactly as the government has told them, maintained \n     insurance and often never flooded--is both economically \n     unwise and morally unjust.''\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, let me read this quote from Michael \nHecht. He said:\n\n       It is irresponsible to introduce drastic reforms that will \n     potentially devastate hundreds of thousands of American homes \n     and business owners before basic questions about forgone \n     revenues and high costs are answered. To proceed otherwise, \n     destroying the wealth of innocent Americans--who have done \n     exactly as the government has told them, maintained insurance \n     and often never flooded--is both economically unwise and \n     morally unjust.\n  I know my time is almost to the end. There is no one else on the \nfloor, so I would like to speak until someone else gets here. But this \nis what we should be working on. We should be working on fixing the \nflood insurance. Tomorrow morning, October 1, these rates go up. These \ntrigger mechanisms go into effect. It is devastating for people in our \nStates. But the Texas Senators seem to be more concerned about the \nAffordable Care Act. I understand in their mind it is a problem and in \ntheir heart they are sincere. I understand their constituents are \ncomplaining. But it is the law, and we should not shut down the \ngovernment over this.\n  I wish they would turn their attention to the Biggert-Waters bill, \nwhich the House and Senate passed. It needs to be amended. It needs to \nbe fixed, and we need to negotiate a way forward.\n  No. 2, if people do want to fight about changes to the budget--I am \nan appropriator. We have been negotiating for years with Republicans \nabout how much to spend, how little to spend, what programs to fund, \nwhat not. We do that in a budget conference. We do that in the \nappropriations bills. In fact, on this measure we are debating tonight \nthe Democrats accepted the House number. Talk about negotiate. We just \naccepted the number they gave us for the continuing resolution. It was \nbelow our number. We want to fund the government in this month a little \nbit higher, but we even accepted their number. We said, fine, we will \ntake your number.\n  We usually don't do that. We usually cut it in half or split the \ndifference or say, you want this, we want this. We just took it. We \njust said yes. They can't even take yes for an answer because they are \nso committed to using the Federal Government as a hostage, or the full \nfaith and credit of the United States as a hostage to change a bill \nthey had every opportunity to change and didn't change or couldn't \nchange, didn't have the votes to change. Maybe one day they will. But \nthey don't have those votes in this Chamber tonight and they don't have \nthose votes in the House. If they would let the whole House vote, they \nmost certainly would not. They are just allowing the Republicans to \nvote. But if they would allow the House to vote in its entirety, \nrepresenting the country, they would support the position of the Senate \nand they know that.\n  I end my remarks by saying let us focus on what we can do to fix some \nbills, the Biggert-Waters flood insurance bill being one of them. Let's \nnot hold the American public and government hostage over a bill that \npassed, that was signed into law, and upheld by the Supreme Court and \nis being implemented by a majority of States in America. We can debate \nit and not shut down the government over it.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I wish to put something else on the Record as well that \nis important for us to think about tonight, besides the underlying \ndebate which I have spoken about and the Biggert-Waters reform which \nunfortunately is going to go into effect tomorrow. We are going to do a \npress conference tomorrow on it and try to get as much support as we \ncan for Republicans and Democrats to fix it. But there is another issue \nI wish to bring up to the body tonight while we are waiting for the \nleader.\n  I think with the consent of both Republicans and the Democrats, we \ncould allow the District of Columbia--which is one city that is going \nto be more impacted than others should the budget of the United States \nnot be able to be negotiated in the next hour or hour and a half. So \nwhat I am hoping by raising this issue is that Members will consider \nthat every city in the United States is going to operate tomorrow \nmorning, every State is going to operate tomorrow morning, even if the \nFederal Government shuts down. They will be impacted, but they will \ncontinue to operate with their own money, on their own steam, under \ntheir own laws. I would like the same thing for the District of \nColumbia.\n  The District of Columbia's budget is 75 percent local and 23 percent \nFederal. So most of their money is local money raised by local taxes, \nnot the taxpayers of the United States. More impressive than that, they \nhave balanced their budget--unlike us--for 18 years. People may be \nsurprised to know this, but the District of Columbia, which is about \n650,000 people, does not have a Senator to speak for them. They have a \nHouse Member, but the House Member has no vote. So I wish to speak on \ntheir behalf for just a few minutes. They have balanced their budget \nfor 18 years and they have well over $1 billion cash in the bank.\n  So I am raising this to my colleagues to ask for us to consider a \nunanimous\n\n[[Page S7047]]\n\nconsent resolution that several of us are putting together now. I would \nlove for my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to simply allow the \nDistrict of Columbia to use their own money--even if the Federal money \ndoesn't come forward, to use their own money raised by their own \ntaxpayers to keep their own government operating, because they are \nunder a special provision to us and have been for many years. People \nargue whether that is right. That is not the point of this. Whether it \nis right is of no consequence. It is the law. If we can give them some \nrelief, it would be very helpful to the thousands of people who need a \nsignal from us that just because we can't get our budget straight, just \nbecause our budget is in deficit doesn't mean we can't honor the fact \nthat the DC budget is in surplus, $1 billion in the bank. It has been \nbalanced for 18 years, and 75 percent of their budget comes from their \nown taxpayers. We should allow them to use their money to stay open.\n  I hope we avoid a shutdown. It doesn't look we are going to. It could \nbe 1 day, it could be 2 days, it could be 3 weeks, it could be 4 \nmonths. Who knows how long it is going to be. I hope it doesn't happen, \nand I hope it is a very short period of time. But whatever it is, there \nis no reason in the world for the District of Columbia--as Mayor Gray \nsaid: We have balanced our budget for 18 consecutive years. We have \nwell over $1 billion in the bank. Yet we cannot spend our own money to \nprovide our residents with services they have paid for unless we get \npermission from a Congress that can't even agree to pay its own bills.\n  If we can't agree how to pay our bills, I think it is unfortunate. We \nshould. But this is a big city. It is an important city. It is the \nCapital of the Nation. They should be able to operate tomorrow morning.\n  I am hoping in the next hours we can find a way. All it takes is a \nunanimous consent. I know tensions are running high. We can be angry at \neach other or frustrated, but we should not be angry with the District. \nThey have done nothing wrong. They have balanced their budget. They \nneed to be able to operate. Many people all over the Nation depend on \nthe District government. So let's not shut them down while we are \nshutting ourselves down.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this is a very serious time in the history \nof the country. It is hard to comprehend, with millions of people being \naffected tomorrow--in 65 minutes, actually--Republicans are still \nplaying games.\n  As I indicated, speaking through the Chair to the senior Senator from \nIllinois a couple of hours ago, just take a couple of examples. We have \n15,000 people a day who come to Lake Mead, spending huge amounts of \nmoney to help the economy. They come there to boat, to fish, to \nrecreate. Tomorrow morning they can't go.\n  We have a beautiful recreational area just a short distance out of \nLas Vegas. When you fly into Las Vegas, you can see the beautiful red \nhills. It is called Red Rock. Over 1 million people a year come and \nvisit. Not tomorrow. No. The Republicans are shutting down places like \nthat all over America because they don't agree with government. \nTomorrow will be a bad day for government and a day of celebration for \nthe Republican-dominated House led by the tea party over there. We hear \nthe next gambit of the House is to request a conference on the CR.\n  We like to resolve issues. In the Senate Chamber tonight is Patty \nMurray, chairman of the Budget Committee. She worked so hard to pass a \nbudget in this body. We worked until 5 in the morning to get it passed. \nWe voted on over 100 amendments. We passed a budget. We passed a budget \nbecause it was the right thing to do and the Republicans said we should \npass a budget--and we did. Senator Murray has for more than 6 months \nrequested a conference on the budget 18 times.\n  So we like to resolve issues. But we will not go to conference with a \ngun to our head. The first thing the House has to do is pass a clean 6-\nweek CR. They have that before them. They can do it right now. If they \ndo that, then we will agree to work with Republicans on funding for the \ngovernment for the remainder of the fiscal year.\n  I propose that the House pass our clean CR, and we will sit down and \ndiscuss funding for the balance of the year. That is it. This deal they \nare pulling out--they have a rule over there that says they want to go \nto conference on the CR. That closes the government. They want to close \nthe government. This is all a subterfuge to satisfy the tea party-\ndriven Republicans. This very strange agenda is so hurtful to the \nAmerican people.\n  So I want everyone to hear what we just said. We will not go to \nconference until we get a clean CR. If the government closes, what \nbenefit do we have from that? In 2 weeks the government is not only \ngoing to close down--we are going to lose the credit rating because \nthey are talking now about not raising the debt ceiling.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I sort of feel sorry for Speaker \nBoehner. He has this hard-right tea party group that is adamant about \nshutting the government down. Many of them talked about shutting the \ngovernment down in their 2010 campaigns. There are clips where they go \nto the audience: We will shut the government down if we win back the \nHouse. And the audience of tea party faithful cheers.\n  Here we are. Speaker Boehner, who has not been able, not been strong \nenough, frankly, to stand up to the tea party, realizes he is in a real \ndilemma. They want to shut the government down and he knows that the \nAmerican people do not want that. CNN came out with a poll today. What \nshould we do, end ObamaCare or keep the government going? Sixty percent \nsaid, keep the government going. Only 30 percent--or 34 percent, I \nbelieve it was--said end ObamaCare. The closer we get to this fateful \nhour--and we are only an hour away from a government shutdown--the more \npeople will understand what the Republicans have done.\n  There is only one answer, and that is for the House to pass the clean \nCR bill that we have sent them, that they have. They keep coming up \nwith new diversions. They send us a message that says this. They send \nus a message that says that. Some of it is related to ObamaCare. Some \nof it is related to contraception. Now they say we want to go to \nconference. As the leader said, we want to resolve issues. We would \nlike to get a nice omnibus for a whole year, for the remainder of the \nfiscal year. We realize we have to do that with both Houses. But not \nwith a gun to everybody's head. Let's go to conference? While they shut \ndown the government and hurt millions of innocent people? Speaker \nBoehner is not going to get away with this subterfuge, as he has not \ngotten away with the previous ones. People will see through it.\n  It is a way to take the focus off what they really are doing, \nshutting the government down and trying to get people to follow the \ndiversion. This time it is let's go to conference. Again, there is \nnothing wrong with a conference, but not, absolutely not when they are \nshutting the government down in an hour. All the talking in conference \nwill not help the Federal worker who is not getting a paycheck, the \nhighway construction worker whose job uses Federal\n\n[[Page S7048]]\n\nfunds to build that highway, the veteran who is waiting for a \ndisability claim. A conference is not going to solve that. There is one \nway to solve it: Pass the clean CR and then have a conference that \ntalks about the issues for the whole year. Resolving funding makes \nsense but only after they pass our clean CR bill.\n  Speaker Boehner, no more games. We are in the final hours. Pass the \nclean CR. Don't send us another one of these little gizmos that is \nsimply meant to take attention off the fact that you do not have the \ncourage to keep the government funded. Pass the clean CR and then we \ncan talk about conference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The statement made earlier by the majority leader is \nworthy of note. In less than an hour the government will close. That \nmeans agencies all across the United States will start notifying \ngovernment employees: Go back home. Don't go to work. You may not be \npaid today. People who are reaching out to those agencies for \nservices--SBA loans, student loans, advice on Social Security, \nveterans' benefits--they are going to find recordings instead of \ngovernment workers there to help them. That is not good. It does not \nspeak well for this great Nation that we have reached this point.\n  What we hear now from the House of Representatives is they want to \ntalk some more. Now they want to sit down with the Senate to talk this \nover. But only after the government shuts down. That is the difference. \nThey will only talk after the government shuts down. What the majority \nleader has said is a reasonable compromise. What he said is this: Pass \nthe 6-week budget that we sent over to you, the CR, with no strings \nattached, no political gimmicks, so that the government continues \nfunctioning, so that America is open for business. Do that and during \nthat time we will sit down and talk with you about future funding for \nthe rest of the year.\n  Party to that conversation should be the chairman of the Senate \nBudget Committee, Senator Murray. She worked hard to pass a budget \nresolution. She tried 18 times on the floor to get to a conference \ncommittee with the House. Every time a tea party Senator got up and \nobjected.\n  We are prepared to sit down again. Chairman Murray is prepared to sit \ndown, as is the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, the \nSenator from Maryland. I have worked with her and for her in our effort \nto get the appropriations bills ready. The two of them, Senators Murray \nand Mikulski, can work together in the conference committee and really \ncharter a way to finish this year in an orderly, thoughtful way.\n  But shutting down the government should not be the starting point. \nThat is an admission of defeat. Those of us who were sent here to \nWashington to lead should be ashamed if it reaches that point. What the \nmajority leader has proposed I hope the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives will take note of. Don't send us the idea of a \nconference committee after the government shuts down. What the majority \nleader has said is after we have agreed to keep the government \nfunctioning for 6 weeks, then we can sit down and work out the \ndifficult issues that face us.\n  We have now entertained three different proposals from the House when \nit comes to funding this government, two today, and we are about to get \na third this day. Each one of them has a fatal flaw. It either involves \ndefunding, delaying ObamaCare--to which the President and the Democrats \nin the Senate would never agree--or in this circumstance they are \nsending up the idea of a conference committee after the shutdown.\n  I think what Senator Reid has offered now is reasonable, it is \nconstructive, it gives us a chance to do our work. There are \ndifferences of opinion, for sure. But it is an orderly process that \nbrings some respect back to Congress as an institution instead of the \nembarrassment of a shutdown of our important government. I hope the \nSpeaker and staff are listening carefully. I hope they will accept this \noffer by the majority leader to move forward in a positive and \nconstructive way, to keep the government open, to solve our problems in \na bipartisan and constructive fashion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I find it extremely ironic that we are \nhere right now hearing that the House of Representatives is going to \nshut down the government and then send us a bill saying they want to \ntalk in a conference committee. Let's remember why we are here \nright now with the threat of a shutdown where thousands of families and \ncommunities are going to be hurt. We passed a budget in the Senate 6 \nmonths ago. The House of Representatives passed a budget in the House 6 \nmonths ago. The goal was to go together in conference, work out our \ndisagreements, define the funding levels for the coming fiscal year so \nwe would not be sitting tonight, minutes away from a shutdown.\n\n  The right thing to have done would have been to go to conference \nanytime in that last 6 months, as we asked for 18 times, but were told \nno by the same people who are now sitting on the other side of the \naisle and saying: No, they want to shut government down.\n  Why do they want to do that? They want to create a crisis because \nthey think they are going to get something. We know going to a \nconference means that we have to compromise. That is what a conference \nis. But we are not going to do it with a gun to our head that says we \nare shutting government down. We are going to conference over a short \nlittle 6-week CR? We have to deal with the longer term budget. We have \nasked many times to go to conference on that. We stand ready to go to \nwork on making compromises for our long-term fiscal crisis. But tonight \nthe only question that should be before the House of Representatives \nand the Senate is keeping our government open without a gun to anyone's \nhead.\n  The Speaker should pass a clean CR, send it to the President, and \ntell Americans that we are not going to disrupt their lives in this \ncountry for the next 6 weeks while we work out the bigger agreement. \nThat is what we need to be doing.\n  I urge the Speaker to step away from the precipice and have the \ngovernment stay open. Don't put everybody's lives and communities in \nthis country at risk and allow us to get to work to solve our next \nyear's fiscal crisis before it is on us again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I chair the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee. It is a great honor. I am the one that would go to \nconference. Hey, I'm ready. However, a motion to tell us to meet in \nconference without a continuing funding resolution to keep the \ngovernment open is a hollow gesture and a cynical gesture and a \nmanipulative gesture. To say ``have a conference,'' that means, myself, \nmy Republican vice chairman, other conferees that would be appointed, \nwe would sit down with the House conferees. By the way, we talk all the \ntime. We started something new under my leadership, with the \nconcurrence of Senator Shelby, talking with the House. Do we want to \nmeet in a conference? You bet. But to meet in a conference without the \ncontinuing funding resolution included in it means that the government \nshuts down at midnight without a continuing funding resolution to a \ndate certain.\n  You can tell us to meet all you want, but the government will shut \ndown. My whole point is to agree with my colleagues here that the House \nshould take up what the Senate sent them. The Senate sent, in a gesture \nof comity and so on, a simple continuing resolution. Keep the \ngovernment funded until November 15. This would give us opportunities \nto have that conference. We accepted their funding level, planning to \nnegotiate a higher level. We had been waiting and waiting for Senator \nMurray to be able to go to conference on the budget so that we could \narrive at this.\n  People might say: Senator Mikulski, I'm confused. Murray is the \nbudget. You are appropriations. Are they not the same thing?\n  No. Senator Murray is the Budget Committee. That is the full revenue. \nThat is the full Federal budget. It includes discretionary spending. I \nam one part of that. It includes mandatory\n\n[[Page S7049]]\n\nspending. That is Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits, other \nmandatory spending. It also includes revenue which means that your \nbooks ultimately balance and you have a balance in your economy.\n  The Budget Committee's job is to arrive at that, working with the \nHouse. They then give us, the appropriators, something called a 302(a). \nIt is a section in the Budget Act. That Budget Committee tells us, the \nappropriators, the cap that we can spend. The appropriators are neither \nfree spenders nor freeloaders. We get a cap, a 302(a).\n  I have 12 subcommittees. Those 12 subcommittees, we divide them up in \nterms of what we think are the important investments that the country \nshould make; that is into the 12 committees. Then they work with their \nRepublican members to arrive at the subcommittees, and we bring them to \nthe floor.\n  I have not had a top line. I have not had my cap, because she cannot \ngo to conference. Remember those conferences everybody likes to have? \nSo, had Senator Murray gone to a conference we would have had that \nnumber. But in the absence of that, I did something really bold. I took \nthe Senate for its word.\n\n  This spring when the Budget Committee passed their 302(a) allocation, \nit would have been $1.058 trillion. That is how we Senate \nappropriators, we Democrats, marked up our 12 bills. Some might say \nthat is a lot of money. It sure is a lot of money, and we did a good \njob with it. We had smart public investments and every one of my \nsubcommittees had the inspector general at their hearings so we could \nidentify duplicative, dated or dysfunctional programs.\n  We are ready to cut. We know how to cut. We are ready to go, and \nevery one of my subcommittees is ready to go. Am I ready to go to \nconference? You bet. But to go to conference without that continuing \nfunding resolution is, again, a hollow action that once again wastes \ntime and wastes opportunity.\n  It is not just those in our country who watch C-SPAN. The world \nwatches C-SPAN. The world is watching us. This is the United States of \nAmerica. They are watching our parliamentary system, which was once the \ngreatest in the world. We have gone from being the greatest \ndeliberative body to the greatest delaying body, and we delay through \nhollow gestures back and forth.\n  I want to do everything I can--working on a bipartisan basis--to \nmaintain the greatness of America, but in order to do that, the \ngreatness of America needs to work tonight. We need to come to our \nsenses, come to an agreement, come to closure, and keep the government \nopen. I am happy to go to the conference, but I would like a date \ncertain. My preference is November 16. Keep the government open. Keep \nus in not only our job but keep America working.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to discuss a small, but \ncritical program that represents a test for this body and for this \ncountry: The Iraq Special Immigrant Visa program. It is a test of \nwhether we stand behind our commitments abroad. It is a test of whether \nwe help those who help us. And for others out there who might consider \nassisting the U.S., it is a test to see if we follow through on our \npromises. If we don't act now, the Iraqi Special Immigrant Visa program \nwill expire along with our obligation to thousands of Iraqis who risked \ntheir lives to help U.S. troops at war.\n  The latest version of the Iraq Special Immigrant Visa program was \ninitiated by Congress in the fiscal year 2008 National Defense \nAuthorization Act. It was originally designed to allow for certain \nforeign nationals in Iraq who served alongside U.S. forces to receive \nspecial visas to come live and work in the United States. The visa \nprogram was created to help secure a path out of harm's way for those \nIraqis and their families that provided important skills to Americans, \nlike translation services, and are now targeted because of their \naffiliation with us.\n  The Iraq visa program is currently set to expire today on September \n30, 2013. Without action by the Congress to extend this program, \nthousands of Iraqi applicants, already under threat due to their \nfaithful assistance and valuable service to the U.S. Government, will \nsee consular work on their cases stopped and their dream of escaping \nthe daily threat of violence will be suspended.\n  Even if we eventually decide to reauthorize the program at a later \ndate, the stoppage will result in delays of months or even years for \nthese applicants as they completely restart an already long and overly \narduous process. Many of these interpreters and assistants who risked \ntheir lives for Americans are now in hiding running from place to place \nto escape retribution attacks against them and their families, any \ndelays could mean their lives.\n  Now, since I started working on this special immigrant visa issue, I \nhave come across countless stories of bravery demonstrated by Iraqi \ninterpreters who stand shoulder to shoulder fighting with our military \nmen and women. My office has also heard directly from retired military \nofficers who served alongside these Iraqis and are now fighting to get \nthem out of Iraq to the safety of the United States. I would like to \njust briefly read a few excerpts from these tremendously inspiring \nstories:\n  From one retired Marine Corps captain:\n\n       I am a retired member of the U.S. Marine Corps, who served \n     proudly in Iraq between 2004-2005. Among our tasks was \n     conducting nightly kill and capture raids in Anbar Province . \n     . . Our interpreter was our lifeline to the local population \n     . . . He became an invaluable member of our team, and our \n     close friend . . . Because of his nearly four years of \n     service to U.S. forces in Iraq, he was left imperiled and at \n     risk of death at the hands of Iraqi militia . . . We came to \n     trust him and treat him as one of our own.\n\n  From a Marine Corps infantry officer who did two tours in Iraq:\n\n       I owe my life and the lives of my Marines to [my \n     translator] . . . During high intensity combat operations \n     throughout the second Battle of Fallujah, [he] constantly put \n     his life in danger to protect Marines and civilians . . . \n     Over the course of that deployment, [he] not only served \n     heroically alongside Marines, but he also became a second \n     father and a close friend.\n\n  From that same marine:\n\n       I have had the opportunity to meet many other Iraqi \n     refugees. They represent the best of our Nation. They chose \n     to put themselves in harm's way because they have always \n     believed in what our country is supposed to stand for . . . \n     They are eager to share in the American dream and to \n     contribute in meaningful ways on the home front as they did \n     overseas. They've earned that opportunity.\n\n  I could not agree more. But, unfortunately, thousands of Iraqis who \nhave earned the chance to come to the United States might not make it, \nand simply because we failed to act. That is unacceptable.\n  Now, a number of Members on both sides of the aisle, including \nmyself, have been working hard for the last 6 months to find a way to \nextend this critical program. Senators McCain, Leahy, Graham, Levin, \nDurbin, and others have been champions of this effort. We have \nextensions of this program in the comprehensive immigration bill, the \ncurrent version of the National Defense Authorization Act, and in the \nannual State Department appropriations bill. Unfortunately, none of \nthese will be signed into law by the deadline.\n\n[[Page S7050]]\n\n  I was hoping that the House of Representatives would include an \nextension in their original continuing resolution legislation, but, \nunfortunately, they did not, leaving the Senate with few procedural \nopportunities to include it. However, we may have a second chance here \nin the hours ahead, and I would urge my colleagues in the House and \nSenate to find a way to extend this program.\n  Now, there is no doubt that the administration needs to do more to \nactually process the visa applications. The stories we are hearing \nabout the backlog are entirely inexcusable. Applicants ought to be able \nto cut through the redtape and bureaucratic nightmare to get their \nvisas processed quickly and more efficiently, while still ensuring \nproper vetting and background checks. However, we have no hopes of \nimproving the program if we don't extend it.\n  We have a responsibility to fulfill our obligation to the thousands \nof civilians who risked their lives to help our country during a time \nof war. The contributions that Iraqi and Afghan civilians made to our \nmilitary efforts have been tremendous. Those who served as translators \nwere an invaluable resource and ally to our men and women in uniform. \nWe can't turn our back on them now, particularly as terrorist \norganizations target these civilians for retribution. We made a promise \nto Iraqi civilians and now we must honor it.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be read \nthree times and passed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1566) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1566\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Madam President, this is so important. People who worked \nwith our military in Iraq as interpreters and doing other things that \nwere essential are now targets in the civil war that is going on in \nIraq. Some of them have been wanting to leave for 2 years, and this \nwill allow them to do that. I am so glad we are able to extend this.\n  Every day these people who helped us are subject to arrest, being \nkilled, as are their families. It is so important we did this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/30/senate-section/article/S7050-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7050-S7053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I wish to say a few words to try to \nreflect what I think tens of millions of Americans are feeling at 11:25 \ntonight with the threat of a government shutdown in 35 minutes.\n  What I want to say is that this discussion is not about ObamaCare at \nall. What this discussion, debate, and conflict is about is that our \nRepublican friends in the House are trying to annul the elections that \ntook place last November. Some of them were shocked that Obama won and \nthat he won by 5 million votes. They haven't gotten over it. They were \nshocked they lost two seats in the Senate. They haven't gotten over \nthat. They were shocked they lost some seats in the House.\n  What they are saying to the American people tonight is: Maybe we lost \nthe Presidential election. Maybe we lost seats in the Senate and in the \nHouse. It doesn't matter. We can now bring the government to a \nshutdown, throw some 800,000 hard-working Americans out on the street, \nand we are going to get our way no matter what.\n  I think that is a horrendous precedent to be established for this \nbody. Let's be clear. If we surrendered to that hostage-taking tonight, \nwithout a shadow of a doubt these guys would be back 2 weeks from \ntoday. At that point they would say to us: Here is our laundry list of \ndemands. If you don't give us what we want, we are going to bring down \nthe financial system of the United States of America, bring down the \nworld financial system, and if it leads to a worldwide recession, well, \nthat is the way it goes. But what is most important is we get our way \nand we don't care about the repercussions.\n  Next year I can see these same guys coming to the floor of the House \nand saying: You know what. We want to abolish Social Security. We think \nSocial Security is a bad idea, and if you don't allow us to do that, we \nare going to stop the government again. And on and on it goes.\n  Ultimately, what we are dealing with tonight is an extraordinarily \nantidemocratic act. Every Member of the Senate has strong feelings. \nSometimes we win, sometimes we lose. But when they are in the \nminority--they do not control the White House, they do not control the \nSenate--they cannot force the American people to give them what they \nwant.\n  The irony is that because we have folks in the Republican Party in \nthe House who believe we should abolish Social Security, end Medicare \nas we know it, privatize the VA, eliminate the Environmental Protection \nAgency--they do not believe that the function of government is to \nprotect the interests of the vast majority of the people. So these guys \nare sitting and saying: My God. The government may shut down. What a \ngreat idea.\n  If you don't believe the EPA should protect us from pollution, then \nisn't it a good idea that we not have an EPA starting tomorrow? If you \ndon't believe in veterans health care, isn't it a good idea that we \nshould slow down the processing of veterans' claims?\n  So for these guys who do not believe that in a democratic, civilized \nsociety we should have a government which represents the people, then \nfrom their point of view what is happening is, in fact, quite good.\n  What particularly angers me, and why the American people have such \ncontempt for what we are doing in Washington is as we speak--everybody \nknows this--the middle class in this country is disappearing. The \nCensus Bureau study came out last week--if you can believe this--median \nfamily income, that family right in the middle of American society, is \nearning less money today than it earned 24 years ago. All of the \nincreases in technology and productivity doesn't mean anything.\n  Poverty is at 46.5 million, and that is highest on record. Youth \nunemployment is 20 percent. Real unemployment is 14 percent. What do \nthe American people want us to be doing? Everybody knows what they want \nus to do. Every poll gives us the answer.\n  They want us to start creating the millions of jobs this economy \ndesperately needs. They want us to raise the minimum wage because they \nknow millions of people in this country cannot make it on $8 or $9 an \nhour. They\n\n[[Page S7051]]\n\nwant us to improve our crumbling infrastructure, our roads, our \nbridges, and our wastewater plants. They want us to bring about real \ntax reform. One out of four major corporations today is not paying a \nnickel in taxes, and they want us to change that as well.\n\n  In my view, for the future of this country, we cannot allow a handful \nof rightwing extremists to hold this Nation hostage. The American \npeople have to stand tall and tell them that, yes, in a democratic \nsociety, people have differences of opinion. Yes, we can make \nimprovements in ObamaCare. But we don't go forward by trying to destroy \nor bring the U.S. Government to a halt.\n  I think it is important for the American people now to stand and \ndemand democracy here in Washington, and tell a handful of rightwing \nextremists they cannot get their way by holding this government in a \nhijacked manner.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, do I need to request a specific amount \nof time in which to speak? Are we under any rules?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators are permitted to speak for up to 10 \nminutes each.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to express \nmy feelings this evening.\n  Quite frankly, I was one of the optimists in this body. Many of my \ncolleagues have been saying the determination to run our economy over a \ncliff is so powerful, we are going to end up with a government \nshutdown. I kept saying, I don't think so. I think in this Senate and \nacross the Capitol in the House there are reasonable folks who know \nthat this type of brinkmanship is doing intense damage to our Nation, \nand I don't believe we will end up there. So here is my faith in the \ncommon sense of a collection of 435 Members of the House and 100 \nMembers of the Senate--my faith in their reasonableness. Apparently, \nthat faith has been misplaced, because we are now just 27 minutes away \nfrom a government shutdown. And to what point?\n  We have just heard from the House leadership they want to have a \nconference discussion over the budget. Well, certainly, so do we. Six \nmonths ago, we passed a budget. The Senate passed a budget. We sought \nto have a conference committee to resolve those two budgets as a common \nfoundation for a set of spending bills--our appropriations bills--and \nour Republican colleagues blocked that budget conference committee. \nThey have come to this floor 18 times and blocked the dialogue \nnecessary to take the conversation forward over our budget and spending \nplan. That is what led us here tonight. The obstruction didn't start a \nweek ago or 2 weeks ago; it started 6 months ago, in not allowing a \ncommon conversation.\n  I am deeply disturbed about the profound dysfunction that now grips \nthis body. I first came to the Senate when I was 19 years old as an \nintern for Senator Hatfield. When legislation was brought up, it would \nbe debated, there would be a simple majority vote; sometimes we won, \nsometimes we lost. We then send a bill over to the House. Then we have \na conference committee and we get on with things. We make decisions. We \ntest ideas. Sometimes those ideas work well and we keep them and \nsometimes they don't work so well, and we either amend them or throw \nthem out or the public says, the bums who brought us those ideas that \ndidn't work, we will throw them out. We had a completion of the \ndemocratic circle.\n  We don't have that completion now because we can't have a simple \nmajority vote. Our colleagues have so abused the filibuster process; \nthe courtesy of letting everyone have their say is to never let us get \nto a final up-or-down vote. So instead of 12 appropriations bills being \npassed year after year after year, we have zero this year. We only had \none in 2011-2012, only one.\n  Citizens across the country are seeing this and saying, what is wrong \nwith the Senate and what is wrong with the House? The House has its own \nform of supermajority: the Hastert rule. They are saying, We are not \ngoing to put on the floor things we know will pass unless they belong \nto the ideology of the far right, because we know that right now, if \nthe Speaker of the House wants to put on the floor of the House the \nbill passed by the Senate--a clean, simple extension of a continuing \nresolution--it would be adopted. The leadership does not believe in \nallowing a vote in that Chamber, just as a minority of colleagues here \nin this Chamber have blocked us from having a simple majority vote time \nand time and time again.\n  We need to have a more substantial conversation about how to make \nboth Chambers work better. But in the near term we have to find a path \nin which we stop careening from crisis to crisis.\n  Let's say, in the final 23 minutes now before midnight, that we were \nable to find an answer to pass a continuing resolution. Let's say we \nwere able to do that. Is there no harm done? Well, I wish that were the \ncase, because there has been a lot of harm done; because what \nbusinesses know across America is that this process of brinkmanship, of \nhostage-taking, of threatening to throw the economy over the cliff is \nhappening time and time and time again. Already, Members on the House \nside are saying, Well, let's not only make these arguments tonight, \nlet's make them in a couple of weeks over the debt ceiling. The debt \nceiling--the decision on whether to pay the bills we have already \nincurred; the decision on whether to honor the good faith and credit of \nthe United States of America.\n  President Reagan spoke on this multiple times, telling folks, We \ndon't mess with the good faith and credit of the United States. His \nteam undoubtedly recognized that when we do so, we raise the interest \nrates, we endanger the dollar as a reserve currency, we weaken our \npurchasing power around the world, and we do deep damage. But that \nreasonableness, that common sense that we don't take hostages and we \ndon't threaten to destroy the economy that is going to hurt the middle \nclass is gone.\n  I live in a working class community. Folks don't have a lot of \nsavings. They have been hit hard. They lost a lot of their savings in \nthe 2008 meltdown, a meltdown that came from deregulatory actions, that \nallowed predatory mortgages and securities based on predatory \nmortgages. They know that governance matters. They know we could create \na lot of jobs if we could pass those bills for low-interest loans, for \nenergy saving renovations that would put a huge amount of the \nconstruction industry back to work. That bill passed here in the \nSenate, but the House hasn't taken it up. They haven't passed it.\n  They know we would have a lot more jobs if we invested in \ninfrastructure. China is spending 10 percent of their GDP on \ninfrastructure. Europe is spending 5 percent of their GDP on \ninfrastructure. And what are we spending here in America? We are \nspending 2 percent--not enough to repair the infrastructure that is \nwearing out across America, that needs replacing, let alone \nestablishing infrastructure for the next generation. In a 10-year \nperiod, 2 trips to China, I saw Beijing go from bicycles to a bullet \ntrain. That is what happens when a society spends 10 percent of GDP on \ninfrastructure. We build the economy of tomorrow for the generation of \ntomorrow that is going to thrive in that city.\n\n  When we underinvest, we imperil the future. When we underinvest in \neducation, we imperil the future of our kids, and we are certainly \nunderinvesting in education. But for each of these policy issues we \nhave to be taking on, we can't succeed if a small number in the Senate \nand in the House can paralyze this process, can go to extraordinary \nlengths to basically hold hostage and damage the United States of \nAmerica.\n  This process must end. The Senator from Vermont who spoke a few \nmoments ago said, If we yield to this hostage-taking now, we will see \nit time and time and time again in the future. We will see the threat \nto end Social Security, et cetera. Well, we are not going to go in that \ndirection.\n  The House has said they want a conference. Great. Let's not do so at \nthe same time we are taking down the economy. So put the Senate \nresolution on the floor of the House right now, with 20 minutes left, \ngive it an up-or-down vote, pass that bill so that we have just these \nfew short weeks, from now until November 15, to hold that conference \nand to work out a deal without taking the American economy down with \nObamaCare.\n  We wait for common sense and reasonableness to return to a dialogue \nso\n\n[[Page S7052]]\n\nthat we can have a legislative process the American people can believe \nin, because we are tackling the big problems facing America. But as of \ntonight, with now 18 minutes to go, we do not have that process, and \nthat must change.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Yes, absolutely.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator just made a reference to the fact that the \nSpeaker of the House has refused to put the Senate resolution up for a \nvote in the House of Representatives. It seems to me this has not been \nadequately illuminated to the public. It is not just that we insist \nthat there be a clean CR--which we do, because we don't want every \nother issue that people feel passionate about to be insisted upon as \nthe price of keeping the government going. Each one of us has issues we \nfeel very passionately about. But I don't know any of us--at least on \nthis side--who have said that unless we pass, for instance, an \ninfrastructure bill--unless we pass a bill that includes background \nchecks for people before they can buy an assault weapon--I feel very \npassionately about that. But the idea that we or any of us on this side \nof the aisle would say the government is going to close unless we get \nour way on a particular issue that we feel passionate about is \nabsolutely anathema to us. Nonetheless, there are a few folks who are \nwilling to do that.\n  But when we say we insist we have a clean CR--in other words, that it \nnot be linked to some issue that some faction is insisting upon--what \nwe are really saying is something even deeper than that, more basic. We \nsimply want them to vote on a clean CR. We are very confident it will \npass if there is a vote, because it will have bipartisan support.\n  For some reason over in the House, bipartisan support for a bill is \nnow anathema. Apparently, it is called the Hastert rule. The Republican \nleaders over there say they are not going to pass any bill that relies \nupon any Democratic votes, which is the exact opposite of what \nbipartisanship should be. Over here, we rely on votes from both sides \nof the aisle for just about everything we pass. But over there they \nhave this policy now, which is the most partisan kind of policy one \ncould imagine. If someone could design a partisan policy, it would be, \nWe will not have any reliance on the other party for votes; only our \nparty can be relied upon for votes. We are not going to pass anything \nwhich depends upon the other party. That, to me, reeks of partisanship. \nWhenever I hear the Speaker or any of the Republicans in the House talk \nabout bipartisanship, the first thing they ought to do is get rid of \nthe Hastert rule, because the Hastert rule guarantees partisanship. It \nbakes partisanship into the process over there.\n  But back to the narrow point I wish to ask the Senator about: \nTonight, as in previous nights, all we are saying is not just we insist \nupon a clean CR, which is not linked to some faction's passion, which \nin this case is getting rid of ObamaCare; what we are saying is vote on \nthe Senate CR. Just put it up for a vote. We are confident it will \npass. But does the Senator agree it is even something less than saying \nit must be a clean CR that we are insisting upon? What we are saying \nis, vote on a clean CR. We are very confident it will pass, but put it \nup for a vote. Does the Senator agree with that?\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Absolutely. I appreciate the point the Senator is \naccentuating. When the Senator says this has not gotten enough \nattention, he is absolutely right. The House has refused to have a \nbudget resolution pursued--a continuing resolution that does not have \nextraneous policy attached to it. They have absolutely said they will \nnot take the Senate version, which did not put on the things the \nSenator and I might wish to attach, and did not put on the things my \ncolleagues from across the aisle might wish to attach. It said: Let's \nkeep the government open. Let's keep it operating, using, by the way, \nthe budget number proposed by our colleagues in the House.\n  So if our colleagues in the House say, wouldn't it be great if the \nSenate would compromise with us, well, we went farther than a \ncompromise. We did not say: Let's split the difference between the \nSenate number and the House number. We will take their number. And \nlet's get rid of these extraneous policy issues and then put it up for \na vote. I think it is a simple request to make.\n  Doesn't it make sense to give a bipartisan group the opportunity now, \nwith just 14 minutes left, to actually end this process of driving our \neconomy over a cliff?\n  Mr. LEVIN. At least vote as to whether to do it.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. At least have that vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it also not true that we have voted twice on the House \ncontinuing resolution? We have rejected it, but we voted on it.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. My colleague is exactly right. They sent it to us and we \nvoted on it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. All right. They have not voted once on what we have sent \nto them.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. The Senator is right.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is not something you have to go to conference about. \nThat is something which is sort of kind of fundamental. We have voted \ntwice on your proposal. We have rejected it. You refused to vote on a \nSenate proposal. Why? Because you are afraid it will pass with some \nDemocratic votes. That is anathema to the House of Representatives \nRepublican leadership now to pass legislation that depends upon \nDemocratic votes. And at the same time they talk about bipartisanship, \nthey have that fixed, rigid rule that they will not depend on \nDemocratic votes to get something passed in the House of \nRepresentatives. The first step toward bipartisanship in the House \nwould be to end that approach.\n  But I thank my friend from Oregon. It is amazing to me that the \nrefusal of the House of Representatives to even vote on the Senate \nproposal which we sent to them has had such little play in the media \nbecause I think if the public understood that, they would then--without \nany doubt--instead of it being 60 to 30 that it is the Republicans who \nare bringing this government to the brink of closing down, it would be \n80 to 10, when the public understands that it is the refusal of the \nRepublican leadership in the House of Representatives to allow a vote \non the Senate proposal.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, we are at the verge of the midnight \nhour here, and what is playing out is a challenge to the very essence \nof our government, and it is a challenge both at home and abroad. I \nwill speak to that in a moment.\n  I was in the other body, in the House of Representatives, 17 years \nago when we had the last government shutdown, led at that time by the \nRepublican majority in the House of Representatives. I had thought they \nlearned the consequences to the Nation and to their party as a result \nof such a shutdown. But it seems those memories have faded.\n  Now we are on the verge of a consequence that is consequential to the \nlives of American families, consequential to the economy of the \ncountry, consequential to the message we send across the globe.\n  What I cannot understand is the fixation that our Republican \ncolleagues have on the question of the Affordable Care Act, which they \nderisively call ObamaCare. It is something that was passed by the \nCongress, signed by the President, reaffirmed by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, which is the final voice of what is the law of the land, and \nthen reaffirmed by the American people in their reelection of the \nPresident with a significant majority.\n  There were two candidates in that election. One was President Obama, \nwho said: I intend to fully implement the Affordable Care Act and \ncreate millions of opportunities for those who have no insurance--to \ncontrol costs; to end preexisting conditions as a limitation; to \nultimately ensure that children could stay on their parents' insurance \nto the age of 26; to be able to provide millions of dollars of relief \nacross the landscape of the country; to help senior citizens who often \nchose between putting food on the table, keeping their home, or having \naccess to\n\n[[Page S7053]]\n\nlifesaving, life-enhancing drugs, by getting a doughnut hole--that gap \nin coverage for seniors--to be ultimately eliminated. It has provided \ntremendous relief for the seniors in our country not to have to make \nthose dynamic choices.\n  So what they could not achieve at the ballot box they are trying to \nachieve by shutting down the Federal Government.\n  And then, at this late hour, after having tried a series of times to \nundermine the Affordable Care Act--and believe me, when they talk about \na 1-year delay, which they seem to try to show that it is benign, it is \nnot benign. There is a purpose to their strategy. The reason that a 1-\nyear delay--in addition to the fact that the law should be able to move \nforward for millions who have no insurance to be able to finally have \ninsurance--is because if you delay the mandate, that means 11 million \npeople will go uninsured who otherwise would get coverage. It means, as \nthe Congressional Budget Office estimated--the nonpartisan entity of \nthe Congress that scores everything we do: Is this going to cost money; \nis this going to save money--they estimated that repealing that \nindividual mandate will increase premiums anywhere between 15 to 20 \npercent because fewer healthy people will enroll to balance out those \nwith higher medical needs. Insurance is about spreading the risk across \nthe spectrum.\n  In my home State of New Jersey, we tried to have insurance reform \nthat limited preexisting condition exclusions and different premium \nband ratings without an individual requirement for coverage. The result \nwas skyrocketing premiums. So, in essence, delaying the mandate for a \nyear--which is the essence of what the House Republicans have sent here \nvarious times as a condition of keeping the government open--is a \nTrojan horse because Republicans know that, in doing such a delay, the \nmandate will create higher premiums. And in creating those higher \npremiums, they, in essence, create rate shock and they fulfill that \nwhich they would like to see, which is the failure of the Affordable \nCare Act.\n  They have a very particular strategy. It is not benign by any stretch \nof the imagination. They are not concerned that the Affordable Care Act \nwill fail. They are concerned it will actually succeed. So what they \nseek to do is to introduce poison pills to make it fail.\n  It is amazing to me that I keep hearing: Well, we will replace it. \nWith what? We have not heard with what. When we challenge our \ncolleagues, they say: Oh, yes, preexisting conditions, we are for that, \nmaking sure that does not exist anymore. We are for the seniors getting \nthe rebates on prescription drugs. We are for making sure there are no \nmore lifetime caps on anybody's insurance, so if they have a \ncatastrophic illness, they will not come up against that cap. We are \nfor all of those things. The only problem is, to have all of those \nbenefits which Americans overwhelmingly want, it costs money. And the \nonly way to do that is, of course, to have everybody ultimately insured \nin the country.\n  This is not a fight between Democrats and Republicans. This is a \nbattle for the very soul of the Republican Party. Unfortunately, they \nare playing it out in a way that affects the Nation. This is a designed \nstrategy.\n  Jonathan Chait of New York magazine wrote a tremendous piece. I \nrecommend it to all of my colleagues. He basically described a meeting \nthat took place in January of this year. I am going to read from his \narticle for a moment: ``In January, demoralized House Republicans \nretreated to Williamsburg, Virginia, to plot out their legislative \nstrategy for President Obama's second term. Conservatives were angry \nthat their leaders had been unable to stop a whole series of things, \nincluding the Bush tax cuts on high incomes, and they wanted to make \nsure their leaders would no longer have any further compromises. Not \nonly did they decide they would not have any further compromises, but, \nin fact, they developed a legislative strategy.\n  Before I go into that, I am happy to yield to the majority leader who \nI understand has an announcement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, through you to my dear friend from New \nJersey, who does such a wonderful job in everything he does, especially \nrunning the Foreign Relations Committee, I thank him for yielding to \nme.\n  This is a very sad day for our country. The President has told the \nhead of the Office of Management and Budget, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, to \nissue a shutdown statement, and she has done that. Here it is: \n``MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES.''\n\n       This memorandum follows the September 17 memo and provides \n     an update on the potential lapse of appropriations.\n\n  No more potential. It is after midnight.\n\n       Appropriations provided under the Consolidated and Further \n     Continuing Appropriations Act expire at 11:59 pm tonight. \n     Unfortunately, we do not have a clear indication that \n     Congress will act in time for the President to sign the \n     continuing resolution before the end of the day tomorrow, \n     October, 2013. Therefore, agencies should now execute plans \n     for shutdown due to the absence of appropriations.\n\n  That is what she said. So the agencies of government are in the \nprocess of closing down. It now appears that the House is not going to \ndo anything to keep the government from shutting down. They have some \njerry-rigged thing about going to conference. It is embarrassing that \nthese people who are elected to represent the country are representing \nthe tea party, the anarchists of the country, and a majority of the \nRepublicans in the House are following every step of the way.\n  This is an unnecessary blow to America, to the economy, the middle \nclass, everyone. The House has within their power the ability to avoid \na shutdown. They should simply pass the 6-week CR we sent them.\n  We are going to come in in the morning and see what they have done \nsometime tonight. But I would hope they would understand that, within \ntheir power, at any time, all they have to do is accept what we already \npassed. All this stuff they keep sending over here--they are so fixated \non embarrassing our President, the President of the United States. They \nthink an election is coming this November. It happened last November. \nHe was elected by 5 million votes over what Romney got--5 million \nvotes. It was not close. So it is really too bad.\n  I am going to ask this unanimous consent. We are going to go out \ntonight and come back at 9:30 in the morning. So the unanimous consent \nis that we are going to recess until 9:30 tomorrow morning. I want the \nSenators who are here on the floor to be able to talk for 5 minutes \neach.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/30/senate-section/article/S7053-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 2013\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I had hoped we would not get to this \npoint. I believe that where I was headed is to embody why we have come \nto this moment today. It just did not happen. I was referring to this \narticle by Jonathan Chait of New York Magazine that in January the \nHouse Republicans met, retreated to Williamsburg, VA, and came up with \na strategy.\n  What is that strategy? He goes on to say:\n\n       The first element of that strategy is a kind of legislative \n     strike. House Republicans initially decided to boycott all \n     direct negotiations with President Obama, and then \n     subsequently extended that boycott to negotiations with the \n     Democratic Senate--\n\n  Which only goes to prove why, despite having passed a budget 6 months \nago or over 6 months ago, each of the 18 times that Senator Murray, the \nbudget chair, has asked to go to a conference--which is a meeting of \nthe House of Representatives and the Senate to work out their \ndifferences in their budget--there have been objections.\n\n  So when I read this article and see that House Republicans decided to \nboycott all direct negotiations with President Obama and then \nsubsequently extended that boycott to negotiations with the Democratic \nSenate--we are seeing the consequences of that strategy here today.\n  This kind of refusal--he says in his article that ``to even enter \nnegotiations is highly unusual.'' The way to make sense of it is that \nRepublicans have planned since January to force Obama to accede to \nlarge chunks of the Republican agenda without Republicans having to \noffer any policy concessions of their own.\n  It is pretty interesting. You know, for those who said: Well, both \nsides, the reality is that there is no moral equivalency to shutting \ndown the government. If you are willing to use the tools of shutting \ndown the government in order to elicit what you could not achieve by \nwinning at the ballot box--i.e. getting a Republican President elected, \nboth Houses of the Congress--then you could ultimately repeal a law \nwith which you disagreed. But since you could not do it that way, to \nhave a policy that ultimately says: No, we are willing to shut down the \ngovernment in order to achieve what we could not do at the ballot box \nwith the will of the American people, there is no moral equivalency. So \nit cannot be accepted that both sides are to blame when clearly only \none side is willing to pursue their political goals by closing down the \ngovernment and the consequences that flow from that.\n  It is an interesting article. I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record so that all of my colleagues might be able to \nread it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   (Jonathan writes for NY Magazine.)\n\n       In January, demoralized House Republicans retreated to \n     Williamsburg, Virginia, to plot out their legislative \n     strategy for President Obama's second term. Conservatives \n     were angry that their leaders had been unable to stop the \n     expiration of the Bush tax cuts on high incomes, and sought \n     assurances from their leaders that no further compromises \n     would be forthcoming. The agreement that followed, which \n     Republicans called ``The Williamsburg Accord,'' received \n     obsessive coverage in the conservative media but scant \n     attention in the mainstream press. (The phrase ``Williamsburg \n     Accord'' has appeared once in the Washington Post and not at \n     all in the New York Times.)\n       But the decision House Republicans made in January has set \n     the party on the course it has followed since. If you want to \n     grasp why Republicans are careening toward a potential \n     federal government shutdown, and possibly toward provoking a \n     sovereign debt crisis after that, you need to understand that \n     this is the inevitable product of a conscious party strategy. \n     Just as Republicans responded to their 2008 defeat by moving \n     farther right, they responded to the 2012 defeat by moving \n     right yet again. Since they had begun from a position of \n     total opposition to the entire Obama agenda, the newer \n     rightward lurch took the form of trying to wrest concessions \n     from Obama by provoking a series of crises.\n       The first element of the strategy is a kind of legislative \n     strike. Initially, House Republicans decided to boycott all \n     direct negotiations with President Obama, and then \n     subsequently extended that boycott to negotiations with the \n     Democratic Senate. (Senate Democrats have spent months \n     pleading with House Republicans to negotiate with them, to no \n     avail.) This kind of refusal to even enter negotiations is \n     highly unusual. The way to make sense of it is that \n     Republicans have planned since January to force Obama to \n     accede to large chunks of the Republican agenda, without \n     Republicans having to offer any policy concessions of their \n     own.\n       Republicans have thrashed this way and that throughout the \n     year. Republicans have fallen out, often sharply, over which \n     hostages to ransom, with the most conservative ones favoring \n     a government shutdown threat and the more pragmatic wing, \n     oddly, endorsing a debt default threat. They have also \n     struggled to define the terms of their ransom. The \n     Williamsburg Accord initially envisioned forcing Obama to \n     sign spending cuts, or some form of the Paul Ryan budget. \n     During the summer, Republicans flirted with making Obama lock \n     in lower marginal tax rates. Recently, Republicans settled on \n     pressuring him to kill his health-care law. But the general \n     contours of the legislative strike, and the plan of obtaining \n     policy victories without offering any policy concessions, has \n     enjoyed general agreement within the party.\n       The history is important because much of the news coverage \n     and centrist commentary has leaned heavily on the idea that \n     the crises in Washington have come about because of some \n     nebulous failure of bipartisanship. The Washington Post \n     editorial page implores both sides to compromise, without \n     explaining why only one party should have to offer policy \n     concessions to keep the government running. Mark Halperin \n     neatly implies that the two sides share the blame in equal \n     measure.\n       The analytic error here is the assumption by professional \n     pox-on-both-housers that they can take an advocacy position \n     on the government shutdown without siding with one of the \n     parties. If you want to land on the conclusion that both \n     sides are to blame, you need to equivocate on the underlying \n     moral question of whether a shutdown is really a bad thing. \n     If, on the other hand, you want to take a stance against \n     crisis governance, you need to be honest about the fact that \n     one party is pursuing this as a conscious strategy.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. This is a battle within the Republican party itself \nabout where they are headed. It is a battle that is totally unnecessary \nbecause I think there is a simple message to the Speaker: Allow the \nHouse of Representatives to have an up-or-down vote on what the Senate \nhas sent it, which is basically a clean continuation of the government \nwithout any gimmicks, without any poison pills.\n  If that vote were allowed by the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives on the floor of the House of Representatives, I believe \nit would pass and the government would stay open. Instead, a few within \nthe Republican Party who hatched this concoction in January of this \nyear when they lost the elections and retreated to figure out what was \ngoing to be their legislative strategy are bringing the Nation to its \nknees.\n  That is simply unacceptable.\n  I said at the beginning of these comments that it is not only \nconsequential here at home--and it will be consequential--to many \nfamilies, to those who are Federal employees, and their families, to \nthose who seek the assistance of the Federal Government, whether that \nis a small business loan, whether it is somebody for the first time \nenrolling for Social Security payments or a veteran's disability or a \nwhole host of other things; they will not be able to do it if the \ngovernment is going to be shut down tomorrow--it is also a consequence \nin the world. I say that as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. What message do we send to the world when, in fact, we \ncannot get our own budget done and one party is willing to hold the \nNation hostage in order to get their political views pursued?\n  We are trying to convince Iran not to pursue nuclear weapons. We tell \nIran if you disarm totally and stop your nuclear weapons program, then \nsanctions to you can be lifted. I believe the Iranians are looking and \nsaying is it possible that such an agreement could\n\n[[Page S7055]]\n\never be delivered by the Congress of the United States, if we do \nactually disarm, if we end all of our nuclear weapons program, if we do \neverything that the Security Council has asked of us. Would the United \nStates lift the series of sanctions that they have ultimately passed \nupon us?\n  This Congress cannot agree with the President. When I say this \nCongress, I speak of the Republican Congress and the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  It is a dangerous message in the world. We tell other nations that we \nbelieve they have to abide by certain disciplines, and yet we cannot \nultimately keep our own budget open and the Nation and this government \nfunctioning.\n  I think this is the ultimate extortion. I believe that since this is \nby design, not by chance, it is going to have real consequences for our \nNation. There is no doubt that if there is a prolonged shutdown, it \nwill be consequential to our economy. It will be consequential to the \ngross domestic product.\n  We saw that 17 years ago. It will be consequential to not only Wall \nStreet but to Main Street in terms of their confidence as to how to \nmove forward. This economy is in recovery. The last thing it needs is a \nbody blow by its own government as it tries to continue to grow an \neconomy in which more people can be employed.\n  The consequence of Republicans doing this is more than a government \nshutdown, it is increasingly an economic shutdown. This is simply \nsomething that we should not accept.\n  Finally, to send us a resolution after 6 months of trying to go to a \nconference, 18 different petitions and motions on this floor to go to a \nconference, to go to that simple meeting that might have reconciled \nthese differences that were objected to by certain Republicans within \nthis chairman--and now to say you are going to send us a motion to go \nto conference when you have shut down the government and, therefore, \nhave a gun at our head in order to be able to try to negotiate the \ncritical issues that might be negotiated--is simply unacceptable. They \nalready have a legislative victory.\n  We have accepted an amount in the temporary budget that is less than \nwhat we devised in the Senate budget, $80 billion less. Yet that is not \nsatisfactory to them.\n  This is not about the economics. This is about their drive to kill \nthe Affordable Care Act in a way that undermines the health and quality \nof opportunity for millions of Americans who finally don't have to \nworry about preexisting conditions. They don't have to worry about \nlifetime caps, can keep their children on their insurance until the age \nof 26, and can get millions of dollars across the landscape of the \ncountry for seniors to reduce prescription drug costs, that finally \ncontrols costs in this Nation. Their fear is not that it won't work. \nTheir fear is that it will succeed and in doing so will undermine the \nvery essence of what they have been against all along.\n  That is a hard way to pursue a political tactic as a consequence of \nthe Nation's laws. This is what is going on here today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. We are in, as has been said by Leader Reid and my good \nfriend from New Jersey, an unfortunate moment. There are millions of \npeople who are innocent. They wake up in the morning, work hard, and \nhope to get a paycheck to help feed and clothe their families. They \nwill not be getting a paycheck tomorrow morning.\n  They might be Federal Government workers. I have heard some of my \ncolleagues on the other side demonize the Federal Government. When I \nthink of the Federal Government, I think of individual people who are \nworking hard, who show up at work in the rain and the snow, who work \nhard, as do people in the private sector, people who work for State \ngovernments or such as the people who work for us. Why should they be \npunished?\n  Then there are so many others, such as the veteran who needs a change \nin his or her disability formula and can't get it; the construction \nworker who is working on a federally funded highway, or somebody who \nworks in a defense plant, as a civilian, all of these people now have \nbeen put at real risk.\n  There is an answer, as I mentioned in my colloquy with the leader. \nThe answer is for the House to pass the bill that passed here--the key \nvote had a majority of Democrats and Republicans, 25 Republicans--and \nkeep the government running.\n  They are busy working late at night on another little subterfuge, a \nlittle scheme. Have a conference.\n  As the leader said, conferences are fine with us. We tried to do a \nbudget conference 18 times. Don't do a conference as a charade while \nyou are shutting the government down. That is what the other side is \nasking us to do.\n  Let's modify what they are doing. Let them pass the bill that is now \nin the House that will keep the government running until November 15, \nand then we will have a conference on how to fund the government for \nanother year.\n  Make no mistake about it. Tomorrow morning their next gambit will be \ndefeated in the Senate and then we will be back where we were, where we \nare now.\n  There is a bill, a ready bill, in the House of Representatives that \ncan keep the government funded and prevent these millions of innocent \npeople and our national economy from being hurt and hurt significantly.\n  This is a final plea, at 12:15 a.m., 15 minutes after the government \nhas been officially closed. House Members, Speaker Boehner, let the \nbill come up for a vote. It will pass. It will save such trouble, and, \neven worse. For millions of innocent Americans it will save our economy \nfrom great risk. Then we can go back to debating the many issues that \nyou and we wish to debate.\n  With that, with a bit of a heavy heart because it didn't have to \nhappen, that we have a small group of people who are so sure that they \nare right that they can hurt millions to pursue that righteousness, \nthat self-righteousness, is a bad thing. I hope it doesn't happen \nagain.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/30/senate-section/article/S7055-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nMORNING BUSINESS\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/30/senate-section/article/S7055-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7055-S7056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 SYRIA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, last Friday I was reading the press \nreports about the remarkable progress that has taken place at the \nUnited Nations in obtaining a legally binding resolution, with the \nsupport of Russia and the other members of the Security Council, to \neliminate Syria's chemical weapons. I could not help but compare it to \nwhat has been happening here in the Congress over the past week and a \nhalf.\n  While Secretary of State Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov \nhave worked diligently to reach a historic agreement to destroy one of \nthe world's largest arsenals of poison gas, the Congress has been \nconsumed by political theater, debating an utterly pointless, \npolitically motivated, doomed attempt to defund the Affordable Care \nAct. In doing so we are now perilously close to a shutdown of the \nFederal government that will cause untold damage to innumerable \nprograms on which States, municipalities, and every community and \nfamily in this country depend and cost the taxpayers far more than if \nthe government stays open.\n  Ironically, while just 2 weeks ago Congress was on the verge of \nauthorizing a military attack against Syria, some of the most vocal \nadvocates of an attack are the same Members who are toying with a \ngovernment shutdown that could make it harder for the United States to \nhelp implement the U.N. resolution to destroy Syria's chemical weapons. \nIf the government stops functioning, it will no longer be able to pay \nthe salaries of our diplomats, nor to provide the funds to help pay for \nthe weapons inspectors and the removal and destruction of the weapons.\n  I commend President Obama, Secretary Kerry, and our new U.N. \nAmbassador Samantha Power for their extraordinary efforts. We should \nalso recognize the indispensable cooperation of Minister Lavrov and his \ngovernment. While it will be many months before we know if this \nagreement will be faithfully implemented and achieve its goals in \nSyria, it is a dramatic step forward.\n  I also commend President Obama and Secretary Kerry for their efforts \nto\n\n[[Page S7056]]\n\nseize on the positive overtures by the new President of Iran. Again, it \nis too soon to say where this may lead, but if there is a chance of \nresolving diplomatically and verifiably the issue of Iran's nuclear \nprogram, it would be a monumental achievement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Ambassador Power's remarks at the U.N. \nlast Thursday be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nRemarks by Ambassador Samantha Power, U.S. Permanent Representative to \n    the United Nations, at the Security Council Stakeout Following \n               Consultations on Syria, September 26, 2013\n\n       ``Just two weeks ago, tonight's outcome seemed utterly \n     unimaginable. Two weeks ago the Syrian regime had not even \n     acknowledged the existence of its chemical weapons \n     stockpiles. But tonight we have a shared draft resolution \n     that is the outcome of intense diplomacy and negotiations \n     over the past two weeks.\n       Our overarching goal was and remains the rapid and total \n     elimination of Syria's chemical weapons program. This is a \n     class of weapons that the world has already judged must be \n     banned because their use is simply too horrific. This is a \n     fundamental belief shared by the United States, all members \n     of the Security Council and 98% of the world.\n       Tonight, the Council discussed a draft resolution that will \n     uphold this international norm by imposing legally binding \n     obligations on Syria--on the government--to eliminate this \n     chemical weapons program.\n       This resolution will require the destruction of a category \n     of weapons that the Syrian government has used ruthlessly and \n     repeatedly against its own people. And this resolution will \n     make clear that there are going to be consequences for \n     noncompliance.\n       This is very significant. This is the first time since the \n     Syria conflict began 2\\1/2\\ years ago that the Security \n     Council has imposed binding obligations on Syria--binding \n     obligations of any kind. The first time. The resolution also \n     establishes what President Obama has been emphasizing for \n     many months: that the use of chemical weapons anywhere \n     constitutes a threat to international peace and security. By \n     establishing this, the Security Council is establishing a new \n     international norm.\n       As you know, we went into these negotiations with a \n     fundamental red line, which is that we would get in this \n     resolution a reference to Chapter VII in the event of non-\n     compliance, that we would get the Council committing to \n     impose measures under Chapter VII if the Syrians did not \n     comply with their binding, legal obligations.\n       If implemented fully, this resolution will eliminate one of \n     the largest previously undeclared chemical weapons programs \n     in the world, and this is a chemical weapons program--I don't \n     have to tell you--that has sat precariously in one of the \n     most volatile countries and in one of the most horrific civil \n     wars the world has seen in a very long time.\n       In the span of a few weeks, the curtain that hid this \n     secret chemical weapons program has been lifted and the world \n     is on the verge of requiring that these terrible weapons to \n     be destroyed.\n       This resolution breaks new ground in another critical \n     respect. For the first time, the Security Council is on the \n     verge of coming together to endorse the Geneva Communique, \n     calling for the establishment of a transitional governing \n     body with full executive powers. If adopted, we will have \n     achieved what we were unable to do before--unable to do for \n     the last 2\\1/2\\ years--which is to fully endorse the \n     Communiqu and call for the convening, as soon as possible, of \n     an international conference on its implementation.\n       As Ambassador Churkin, with whom we've worked very \n     productively, has just stated, we are hoping for a vote \n     tomorrow in the OPCW Executive Council on the OPCW Executive \n     Council decision. And then in the wake of that vote--and we \n     hope in the immediate wake of that vote--we would have \n     Security Council adoption of this text, which we are \n     optimistic is going to be received very warmly. We're \n     optimistic for an overwhelming vote.\n       Before closing, just let me--bear in mind, or note that we \n     should bear in mind, even as we express appreciation for the \n     cooperation that brought us to this moment but let us bear in \n     mind the sobering catalyst for all of this: the use on August \n     21st of chemical weapons against people who were just \n     sleeping in their beds, against children who will never get \n     to share their dreams.\n       The precipitant for this effort was as ghastly as anything \n     we have ever seen. And I think the Council members are well \n     aware of that. A number of the Council members referred to \n     the events of August 21 and the importance of keeping the \n     victims of that attack and other chemical weapons attacks in \n     their minds as we seek to move forward.\n       The second sobering note, of course, goes beyond chemical \n     weapons, which is that every day Syrians are dying by \n     artillery, by air power, by Scuds. This monstrous conflict \n     has to come to an end. And we are hopeful that the spirit of \n     cooperation that we carried from Secretary Kerry and Foreign \n     Minister Lavrov's negotiations in Geneva back to New York, \n     that that spirit of cooperation will carry over now on \n     humanitarian issues and, fundamentally, on the political \n     solution we all know is needed to this horrific conflict.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/30/senate-section/article/S7056-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DARREL THOMPSON\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, the recent tragic shooting at the Navy \nYard has by now moved off the front pages, but for the victims and \ntheir loved ones and for the Washington, DC community, the effects of \nthat horrific day will linger much longer. We may never fully \nunderstand what demons compelled the perpetrator to commit this heinous \nact, but at least one thing is clear: We should not consider this \nincident in a vacuum, not after 6 dead in Tuscon, not after 12 dead in \nAurora, not after 6 dead in Oak Creek and 2 dead in Clackamas and 27 \ndead in Newtown, 20 of them children, not while mass shootings are \noccurring all around our Nation, every day, in places like Albuquerque, \nMinneapolis, Newton Falls, Seattle, Chicago, and many more. In the \nwords of MedStar Washington Hospital Center chief medical officer Dr. \nJanis Orlowski, ``There's something wrong here when we have these \nmultiple shootings, these multiple injuries, there's something wrong.''\n  Dr. Orlowski is right. Our Nation is torn by gun violence. Facts are \nfacts: The American Journal of Medicine recently released clinical \nresearch showing that the United States has a rate of 10.2 gun-related \ndeaths per 100,000 people. This rate is far higher than almost all of \nthe 27 other countries the study examined--higher than the rates of the \nUnited Kingdom, the Netherlands, Japan, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Turkey, \nGermany, and Canada combined. The Washington Post has put similar \nfindings in sobering perspective by noting that an American is ``20 \ntimes as likely to be killed by a gun than is someone from another \ndeveloped country.''\n  Congress can take important steps to stop this violence. There is \nlegislation in the Senate right now that, if enacted, would take \nimportant steps toward reducing gun violence in this\n\n[[Page S7057]]\n\ncountry. Among other things, these bills would close the `gun show \nloophole' that allows 40 percent of gun purchases in this Nation to go \nforward without any sort of background check on the buyer. This \nloophole allows criminals, the mentally ill, domestic abusers, and \nterrorists to obtain deadly weapons to turn on our communities.\n  The American people agree that taking this step would just be common \nsense. Study after study has shown that around 90 percent of Americans \nsupport comprehensive background checks for all gun sales. Another \nstudy conducted by the UC Davis Violence Prevention Research Program \nfound that 55.4 percent of gun dealers and pawnbrokers in the United \nStates support comprehensive background checks.\n  Public safety is not a partisan issue. Dr. Orlowski said it well: \n``Mass murders people--walking through schools, people walking through \nmovie theaters, people walking through work places--unfortunately is \ncommon, or more common than what it should be . . . we've got to work \ntogether to stop this.'' The American people overwhelmingly support \ncommonsense gun safety measures. Our law enforcement communities, our \nmedical communities, even our licensed gun sellers overwhelmingly \nsupport commonsense gun safety measures. We should listen to them, and \nact.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/30/senate-section/article/S7057-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        WHITEMAN LUMBER COMPANY\n\n Mr. RISCH. Madam President, sustaining the longevity of \nAmerican small businesses should be a primary focus of today's \nlawmakers. When we find a company that has managed to endure through \ndifficult economic times, we should honor their commitments to the \nAmerican dream and learn from them so that others can follow in their \nfootsteps. The Whiteman Lumber Company, from the Silver Valley in \nnorthern Idaho, is a prime example of this. It is a small family \nbusiness that has survived recessions and fires but continues to thrive \nand enhance the lumber industry.\n  In 1928, Harry H. Whiteman started what has now become the oldest \ncontinuously operating sawmill in all of Idaho. When the neighboring \nSunshine Mining Company needed a constant supply of mining timbers to \noperate, Mr. Whiteman saw an opportunity and financed his lumber \ncompany by becoming the mine's primary and reliable lumber source. \nWhiteman Lumber then expanded distribution to other surrounding mines \nuntil arduous environmental regulations caused the decline of the \nmineral markets in the area.\n  Brad and Mary Corkill bought Whiteman Lumber in 1988 and maintained \nthe strong relationship with the Sunshine Mining Company until its \nclosure in 2001. Since then, Mr. Corkill has grown the business by \nfocusing on both the national and local markets, selling materials to \nindividuals, timber framers, contractors, and wholesalers, in addition \nto the remaining regional silver mines. Whiteman Lumber also supports \nthe Silver Valley community by sustaining a supply of almost \nexclusively large logs from local mills, which are no longer capable of \nmilling bigger trees. Moreover, they add a distinctive rustic look to \ntheir product by using circular saw technology and offer customized \nkiln drying to achieve specific levels of lumber moisture content for \ntheir clients.\n  Whiteman Lumber Company continues to be an essential part of the \nSilver Valley thanks to fortitude and their longstanding relationships \nwith buyers. In 2009, the middle of the recession, a fire burned down \nthe lumber mill, but Mr. Corkill quickly rebuilt into a more efficient \nlayout and had their employees back to work within the year, several of \nwhom are still related to Harry Whiteman.\n  The family-run business of the Whiteman Lumber Company is perfect \nrepresentation of resiliency. They survived a devastating fire and the \ncollapse of the mining industry by giving their clients desirable \nproducts while also giving back to their community. Mr. Corkill's \nbusiness model is a vital tool that can be used by small businesses \nacross the country striving to support the local and national economy \nwhile maintaining their own permanency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/30/senate-section/article/S7057-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING THE STODDARD FAMILY\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nStoddard family of Sandown, NH. In May of 2010, Cole Stoddard was \ndiagnosed with neuroblastoma, a form of childhood cancer. Cole was 4 \nyears old at the time of his diagnosis, and he passed away nearly a \nyear and a half later on January 20, 2012, at the age of 5. Since \nCole's passing, his parents, Tony and Michelle Stoddard, and their \nchildren, Tara and Troy, have made it their mission to raise awareness \nabout childhood cancer and encourage people throughout the country to \nlearn more about the disease that annually takes the lives of nearly \n1,500 children in the United States.\n  The Stoddard family has worked tirelessly over the past year in their \nefforts to designate the month of September 2013 as ``Childhood Cancer \nAwareness Month,'' and 41 States have already signed on and made this \ndesignation. Tony has also encouraged people to wear the color gold in \nSeptember to further raise awareness about this devastating disease. \nTony's advocacy has brought the Stoddard family to the famed Fenway \nPark in Boston, MA to raise awareness about childhood cancer, and \nBoston's Prudential Center was lit gold to acknowledge the cause. \nLandmarks in places as far as Australia, Ireland, and Switzerland have \nbeen colored gold to recognize Childhood Cancer Awareness Month.\n  In the United States, approximately 11,500 children under the age of \n15 will be or have been diagnosed with childhood cancer this year. It \nis the leading cause of death by disease in children in our country, \nand its causes are largely unknown. While medical research has led to \nbetter treatment and a significant increase in 5-year survival rates \nover the last 30 years, more needs to be done.\n  I would like to thank and recognize the Stoddard family for their \ntireless work toward raising awareness about childhood cancer. Their \nnoble efforts have already made a positive impact on thousands of young \nlives, and I know that I join all of New Hampshire this September in \nwishing them the best of luck as they continue their mission in Cole's \nhonor and memory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/30/senate-section/article/S7057-3", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7057-S7058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONNECTICUT LAKES HEADWATER PROJECT\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \n10th anniversary of the Connecticut Lakes Headwaters Project.\n  In 2001, as Governor of New Hampshire, I partnered with my friend and \nour former colleague, Senator Judd Gregg, to form the Connecticut Lakes \nHeadwaters Partnership Task Force. This broad coalition joined forces \nto protect the largest remaining undeveloped block of New Hampshire \nland from future commercial and industrial development. We developed a \nbipartisan plan for conserving the land for traditional recreational \nuse and forestry.\n  Ten years ago marked the completion of the final phase of the \nConnecticut Lakes Headwaters Project, which in total protects 171,000 \nacres in Pittsburg, Clarksville, and Stewartstown. This wonderful \nproject enjoyed the support of the thousands of community members who \nlive and work in New Hampshire's North Country. This land includes \npristine undeveloped lakes, crystal-clear streams, and healthy forests \nof balsam fir, maples, and birches.\n  These treasured lands are integral to our State's economy and \nenvironmental heritage. It is a working forest where value for man is \nmanaged in concert with value for wildlife. They are home to some of \nNew Hampshire's most scenic areas and notable, rare species, such as \nthe loon and bald eagle. Each year, tourists and Granite Staters alike \ntravel to the Connecticut Lakes Headwaters to enjoy the spectacular \nscenery and diverse recreational activities the area has to offer, \nincluding hunting, fishing, canoeing, and snowmobiling. Between its \ntourism and timber-related jobs, this land contributes vitality to the \nNorth Country's economy.\n  Today, the Connecticut Lakes Headwaters are a cherished part of New\n\n[[Page S7058]]\n\nHampshire's identity, and the people of New Hampshire are committed to \npreserving this inspiring landscape for future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/30/senate-section/article/S7058-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/30/senate-section/article/S7058-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The message received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/30/senate-section/article/S7058-3", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2013, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on September 29, 2013, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing that the House agreed to the amendment of \nthe Senate to the joint resolution (H.J.
