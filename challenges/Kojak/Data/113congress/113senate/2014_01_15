Mr. President, on this issue we have a bipartisan coalition \nthat badly wants to get this done. So we are going to do everything we \ncan to move forward. At this stage the Republicans have not cleared the \nproposed consent agreement. I have indicated to the Republican leader \nthat later today I would ask that. But also, to stopgap, we have \nstarted a rule XIV procedure which in just a minute I will move to, and \nwe will have a second reading so that, if we can't work anything out on \nthe consent agreement, we will tee this up so this will be the first \nvote we have when we get back after our recess.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Certainly.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The majority leader is correct. There is substantial \nbipartisan support for the flood insurance bill. We are not in a \nposition to clear it yet, but Senator Isakson, who has taken the lead \non this issue on our side, is working with our Members. Hopefully, we \nwill be able to figure out a way forward here in the not too distant \nfuture.\n  Mr. REID. On our side, Senator Landrieu has been persistent for \nmonths now. So she and Senator Isakson, I hope, can work something out \nso we can maybe work on this before we leave.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. President, following my remarks, and those of the Republican \nleader, the time until noon will be equally divided and controlled \nbetween the two of us or our designees. At noon the Senate will begin \nconsideration of H.J. Res. 106, which is the short-term continuing \nresolution. At 12:15 there will be a rollcall vote on the joint \nresolution. Just before coming here I was told the vote in the House \nwill be between 3 and 5 o'clock this afternoon. So we should get that \nat a reasonable hour today.\n  We expect to begin consideration of the omnibus bill when it is \nreceived from the House, as I have indicated, later today.\n\n\n          measures placed on the calendar--s. 1917 and s. 1926\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there are two bills at the desk due for a \nsecond reading.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bills by \ntitle for the second time.\n  The clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S336]]\n\n\n       A bill (S. 1917) to provide for additional enhancements of \n     the sexual assault prevention and response activities of the \n     Armed Forces.\n       A bill (S. 1926) to delay the implementation of certain \n     provisions of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act \n     of 2012 and to reform the National Association of Registered \n     Agents and Brokers, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object to further proceedings on either \none of these measures at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection having been heard, the \nbills will be placed on the calendar under rule XIV.\n\n\n                    Unemployment Insurance Benefits\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last night's vote to block emergency \nunemployment insurance was, I am sorry to say, what goes on and has \nbeen going on for a number of years here. It was blocked by the \nRepublicans. It is really a tragedy for millions of Americans who are \nrelying on Congress to help them get through these hard times. Today's \nlong-term unemployment is double what it was at any other time Congress \nhas allowed emergency benefits to lapse. Yet Republicans refuse even to \nallow an up-or-down vote on our plan to restore benefits to 1.5 million \nAmericans, and there are 2.3 million children.\n  I thought we had satisfied every complaint and demand my Republican \ncolleagues made throughout the week. They said they wouldn't vote on an \nextension which would provide an average of $300 a week to families \nstruggling to get by unless the bill was paid for. So we proposed an \noffset. That wasn't unique for us. It was originally proposed by \nCongressman Paul Ryan, chairman of the Budget Committee in the House \nand the Republican candidate for Vice President in the last election.\n  Then Republicans said they couldn't vote for an extension of \nunemployment insurance without reforms to the program. We also did \nthat. What we did will prevent double dipping and reduce the number of \nweeks recipients could receive unemployment benefits. Then Republicans \nsaid they couldn't vote to extend unemployment benefits unless they \nwere allowed to offer amendments. So Democrats agreed to vote on up to \n20 amendments, 10 on each side. They again refused.\n  So, Mr. President, unless Democrats agree to vote on an unlimited \nnumber of unrelated, irrelevant minority amendments, the minority will \nfilibuster the bill that will help people who have been looking for \nwork for a long time. This callous vote yesterday proves Republicans \nwant it to seem like they support an extension of unemployment \ninsurance even though they didn't vote and wouldn't vote for an \nextension. The minority has hidden behind one process argument after \nanother as they voted to end a program that has been successful for \nmillions of Americans, including, as I indicated, more than a half \nmillion children, which has kept them out of poverty in recent years.\n  Middle-class Americans can see right through these flimsy Republican \nexcuses. They see last night's vote for what it was--a slap in the face \nto almost 1.5 million Americans, including tens of thousands of \nveterans; a slap in the face for 18,000 Nevadans who are still looking \nfor work, and 2.3 million children whose parents don't have jobs; and a \nslap in the face for 70,000 more people who will lose their \nunemployment benefits each week until Congress acts.\n  But the fight is not over. We are not going to give up on Americans \nstruggling to get back on their feet. We are working on other \nproposals. We can move forward at any time on a 3-month extension, \nunpaid for, and that is really what we should have done 2 weeks ago, so \nthat during this 3-month period we could continue working on a long-\nterm solution.\n  We must take up this short-term continuing resolution, which, by the \nway, is bipartisan. Senator Heller from Nevada joined with Senator Reed \nof Rhode Island--the two States who lead the Nation in unemployment. \nThe economy can't afford another manufactured crisis over whether the \nU.S. Government will stay open for business or pay its bills. But soon \nRepublicans will be faced with the same choice: Put their middle-class \nconstituents first or keep playing political games.\n  I received a letter this week from a Nevadan who, by the way, is a \nlifelong Republican. Here is what happened to him. After 13 years at a \njob he loved, this 54-year-old man was laid off, through no fault of \nhis own. He hasn't been able to find work for 10 months, despite having \napplied for dozens and dozens of jobs. He is appalled at the way his \nown party has treated him and other unemployed Americans. This is what \nhe wrote: ``I am shocked and dismayed and outraged at how Republicans \nhave dealt with this matter.''\n  Let me read this again:\n\n       I am shocked and dismayed and outraged at how Republicans \n     have dealt with this matter. The Republican leadership has \n     talked about people like me as if we're thieves, not worthy \n     of help. That will cost Republicans their jobs and should \n     cost them their jobs.\n\n  This Nevadan is not alone. People all over America feel the same way. \nRepublicans around the country support the extension of unemployment \nbenefits.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Sure.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the majority leader through the Chair \nfor clarity: Is the Senate Republican filibuster holding up \nunemployment benefits for 1.3 million Americans?\n  Mr. REID. It is actually now up to about 1.5 million.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Again, addressing the majority leader through the Chair, \nso the refusal of the Senate Republicans to allow us to vote on the \nextension of unemployment benefits is denying, on average, about $300 a \nweek to 1.4 million or 1.5 million Americans; is that a fact?\n  Mr. REID. That is true, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the majority leader this question: Is \nit not true that the initial complaint of the Senate Republicans was \nthat this payment of unemployment benefits was not paid for?\n  Mr. REID. That is true.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is it also true that Democrats came up with a pay-for \nthat would have paid for the unemployment benefits, as the Republicans \nrequested?\n  Mr. REID. And the pay-for was originally discovered by Paul Ryan.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the majority leader: After the \nDemocrats came up with the pay-for, the first demand of the Senate \nRepublicans to stop their filibuster, did the Senate Republicans then \njoin us in calling this measure for passage?\n  Mr. REID. Would my friend repeat the question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. After we came up with a pay-for, which the Senate \nRepublicans insisted on, did they stop their Senate Republican \nfilibuster on unemployment benefits and allow us to move forward?\n  Mr. REID. No.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the majority leader if this followed: \nIt was my understanding the Senate Republicans then came up with a new \ndemand, and the demand was they be allowed to offer amendments to the \nunemployment insurance benefit package before they would drop their \nSenate Republican filibuster that was stopping unemployment benefits \nfor 1.4 million Americans.\n  Mr. REID. That is true. And the biggest advocate we had for that on \nthis side of the aisle was the whip, the senior Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the majority leader this question: Is \nit not true that yesterday, in response to this Republican demand, the \nmajority leader offered a unanimous consent that would have given up to \n10 amendments on each side of the aisle--Democrats and Republicans--to \nthis measure and that the Democrats did not specify what the amendments \nwould be; that it would really be the decision of the Republicans to \noffer those amendments? Did the Senate majority leader offer that to \nthe Senate Republicans so they would stop their filibuster of \nunemployment benefits?\n  Mr. REID. The answer is yes. And in addition to that, there would be \navailable on each side, if they wanted, five side-by-sides, as we call \nthem here. So that could be a total of 10 amendments on each side, so \n20.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So the Senate Republicans insisted on a pay-for, and the \nSenate Democrats provided it. The Senate Republicans still refused to \nstop their filibuster. Then the Senate Republicans insisted on \namendments. We offered up to 10 amendments on each side.\n\n[[Page S337]]\n\n  Can the Senate majority leader say, after offering that unanimous \nconsent, whether the Republicans agreed to it and stopped their \nfilibuster of unemployment benefits?\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry to say they did not.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the majority, at this point in time what are we \nwaiting for? What are the Senate Republicans now demanding to stop \ntheir filibuster of providing unemployment benefits to 1.4 million \npeople across America?\n  Mr. REID. I have no idea.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senate majority leader that it strikes \nme as unfair, if not cruel, that we are holding 1.4 million unemployed \nAmericans hostage to this continued political negotiation where each \nday the Republicans come up with a new demand before they will stop \ntheir Senate Republican filibuster.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada, our majority leader, does he believe \nthat a majority of the Members of the Senate would vote for the \nextension of unemployment benefits to these 1.4 million Americans if \nthe Senate Republicans would drop their filibuster?\n  Mr. REID. No question about that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Finally, let me say that the man from Nevada is not alone. \nThere are 1.4 million people just like him in this country. Sadly, that \nnumber will grow every week Congress fails to act. And my Republican \ncolleagues denigrate or ignore these hard-working Americans at their \nown political peril.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n                            Senate Procedure\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say in response to the colloquy \nwe just heard that it used to be the assistant majority leader's view \nthat, as he put it, if you don't want to fight fires, don't become a \nfirefighter, and if you don't want to cast tough votes, don't come to \nthe Senate. Obviously, those days have changed.\n  What really happened over the last week is the refusal to have an \nopen amendment process, the refusal to treat both sides the same. The \nfinal proposal we objected to yesterday requiring all the amendments to \nget 60 votes but final passage only 51 still does not restore the \nSenate to the way it has formerly functioned. Any Member of the Senate \nought to be able to have a fair chance to get his or her amendment \nadopted. That is the way it used to be around here before the majority \nleader decided to dictate everything everyone does.\n  So what we are seeking is fundamental fairness and, on this \nparticular bill, an open amendment process and an opportunity to pay \nfor it. I think the real concern was that the majority leader was \nafraid that some of the Republican amendments might actually pass, \nmight actually enjoy bipartisan support.\n  So we will get back to that bill. It is a very important bill. But if \nanybody had any doubts that Washington Democrats wanted to see the \nunemployment insurance bill fail, well, I think we had those doubts \nerased yesterday and by the comments just made. It is just the latest \nexample of Senate Democrats putting politics over policy. And in this \ncase it is doubly tragic because this time they are putting politics \nover struggling families who deserve some certainty from Congress.\n  Look. It is no secret that our Democratic friends plan to spend the \nyear exploiting folks who are still struggling in this economy for \npolitical gain. They have been telling reporters that for weeks. That \nis no secret, but that doesn't make it any less disturbing. It is still \nwrong.\n  I would probably want to be talking about something other than \nObamaCare too, if I had voted for it. They want to talk about anything \nother than ObamaCare. But to create a conflict where the possibility of \nagreement was so close while more than 1 million people are stuck in \nthe middle is just simply outrageous--making pawns out of these people \nstuck in the middle of this political game.\n  Here is the larger issue. Here we are in the sixth year of this \nadministration, and we are still talking about emergency unemployment \nbenefits--6 years into the Obama administration. After all the stimulus \nbills and all the other big-government solutions we were told would \nhelp the little guy, we are still looking at record long-term \nunemployment. We are still looking at hundreds of thousands of able-\nbodied men and women basically giving up on finding work in this \neconomy in the last month alone, in just 1 month. One report I saw even \nsuggested that about half of our Nation's counties have yet to return \nto their prerecession economic output--half the counties in America.\n  The bottom line: The Obama economy isn't working for middle-class \nAmericans.\n  Democrats tell us again and again that their policies will help \npeople who are struggling. Yet we always seem to end up in the very \nsame situation--debating whether to provide more emergency help instead \nof talking about how to provide a long-term solution and a stable \neconomy that doesn't require permanent life support from Washington.\n  What is needed is a fundamental course correction. What is needed is \nfor our colleagues to finally acknowledge what has failed and then \nactually work with us on the underlying problem. That is what \nRepublicans are saying in this debate. What we are saying is, how about \nactually trying to create jobs for a change?\n  That will be the President's challenge today when he speaks in North \nCarolina. We hear he might lay out some ideas to get the private sector \nmoving again. If that is the case, then maybe he will be taking a step \nin the right direction--a step away from big-government policies that \nhave failed so many Americans for so many years--because if he is truly \nserious about getting the economy back on track and creating jobs, he \nwill do more than just talk about job creation or bipartisanship today; \nhe will actually work with us on real bipartisan solutions to get \nthere, and there are some simple ways he can show he means it.\n  The Republican-controlled House has sent over a number of bills that \nwould give a boost to jobs and to our economy. A good start would be \nfor the President to lean on Democrats who run the Senate to take up \nthose for immediate consideration.\n  He could acknowledge the real pain ObamaCare is inflicting on middle-\nclass families and then work with us to start over with real bipartisan \nreforms that actually lower costs and won't hurt the economy the way \nObamaCare does.\n  He could call for true bipartisan tax reforms.\n  He could announce construction of the Keystone Pipeline. I see the \nSenator from Pennsylvania on the floor, who will remember that the \nPresident came to a lunch with Senate Republicans last year, and the \nPresident said he would make a decision on the Keystone Pipeline last \nyear, sometime during 2013. Apparently, that was in the same category: \nIf you have your policy and you like it, you can keep it. If you have \nyour doctor and you like them, you can keep them. I will make a \ndecision on Keystone Pipeline by the end of 2013. Well, we are still \nwaiting.\n  He could actually deliver on one of the brightest spots of his \neconomic agenda: trade. That means that instead of allowing the United \nStates to lag behind our trading partners, the President could find a \nway to bring his party on board with a bipartisan bill introduced last \nweek that would get the administration back in the game of helping \nAmerican workers with increased exports.\n  These are just a few of the many areas where we could work together \nto get some good things done for the American people.\n  I hope he will be serious in his speech today. I hope he will focus \non actually getting the job done instead of just providing another \ndistraction from the pain of ObamaCare and the Obama economy because if \nthis devolves into just another political exercise that is focused more \non making a point than making a real difference in the lives of\n\n[[Page S338]]\n\npeople who are struggling, that is not going to help middle-class \nfamilies get back on their feet. That won't help college graduates find \nfull-time work. All it will do is continue a cycle of economic pain \nthat the President needs to work with Republicans to stop.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 12 noon will be equally \ndivided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees, with \nSenators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                         Unemployment Benefits\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to address this situation we find \nourselves in on the unemployment bill.\n  I have to say that this most recent episode in which the majority \nleader refuses to permit an open process, refuses to allow debate, \nrefuses to allow the kinds of amendments Republicans would like to \noffer to improve this bill is very disturbing and is now part of a very \nwell-established trend.\n  It is actually shocking to me that over the last 6 months, since July \nof last year, through today, this body has voted on a grand total of \nfour Republican amendments--four recorded votes on Republican \namendments in 6 months.\n  Under every previous majority leader, under every previous majority \nthe Senate didn't work this way. It would be routine to have four votes \nin a morning before we broke for lunch. We have had four votes on our \nideas that have been permitted in 6 months. So we are systemically \nbeing shut out of the process.\n  What is particularly maddening about this is that my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle know full well that the votes are there to \npass an extension of unemployment insurance. They know it. If they \nwould allow an open amendment process, we would have a few amendments, \nwe would have a debate, and we would have some votes. In the course of \nan afternoon, maybe two, we would have finished up last week and we \nwould have passed an extension of unemployment benefits.\n  Evidently that is not the goal of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle. They insisted on making sure we could not engage in this \ndebate, offer the amendments, and do this in a way consistent with what \nthe American people want us to do, which is move forward in the most \nsensible way possible.\n  I have an example this morning of the kind of very modest reform we \nwould like. As for myself, I think that we should extend unemployment \nbenefits for certain Americans who are in the really tough \ncircumstances in which they find themselves provided that the cost of \ndoing so is properly offset with a legitimate offset so we don't simply \nadd still more to our excessive deficit and debt; that we have some \nmodest reforms; that we begin the process of fixing a program that \ndoesn't work. If this is working, then why are there so many Americans \nwho are unemployed for such long periods of time? Clearly, this program \nis not working.\n  Let me give one example of an amendment I think most Pennsylvanians \nthink is common sense. It is an amendment Senator Coburn offered, and \nit would simply end Federal unemployment benefits for people who have \nan income of over $1 million a year.\n  My guess is that most Pennsylvanians are shocked to discover that we \nextend unemployment benefits to millionaires. And I am not talking \nabout a net worth of $1 million, someone who maybe has a farm that is \nworth $1 million on paper but they might have no income. No. I am \ntalking about people who actually have earned income of over $1 million \nand then they stop working and start collecting unemployment benefits. \nI think most people think that is ridiculous.\n  It is not as isolated as we may think. In 2011 there were over 3,200 \nhouseholds that reported income of over $1 million, and yet they were \npaid $30 million in unemployment benefits. In fact, there were over 100 \nhouseholds that had income of over $5 million. And taxpayers are paying \nthem unemployment benefits? This doesn't make sense, and it doesn't \nmake sense to Members of this body.\n  In April of 2011 the Senate had a vote on the substance of this very \namendment--ending unemployment benefits for millionaires and \nmultimillionaires--and the vote was 100 to 0 in favor of making this \nmodest reform to this program. Now, if we did actually enact this \nreform, it would save about $300 million over 10 years, which could go \nto paying for benefits for the people who actually need extended \nunemployment insurance.\n  Of all of the Members of the Senate who are here today and were here \nat the time of this vote in 2011--that is the vast majority--everyone \nagreed. There is no dissent on this. There are bipartisan cosponsors of \nthis amendment, Democratic and Republican alike, who recognize this is \njust common sense. So despite the fact this is not controversial, that \nit is germane and relevant, that it is a modest reform that makes sense \nand would save money and would free resources to pay unemployment \nbenefits for the people who truly need it, despite all of those facts, \nwe are blocked. We are not allowed to offer this amendment on the \nSenate floor.\n  We attempted it yesterday. The minority leader, the senior Senator \nfrom Kentucky, asked unanimous consent to offer this amendment. That \nconsent was denied. So then he moved to table or to eliminate, if you \nwill, the amendments the majority leader uses to block our \nopportunities to offer our own, his blocking amendments, and the \nmajority party defeated that attempt to do away with those blocking \namendments. As we sit here this morning, the majority leader continues \nto block our opportunity to offer any amendments, even a modest, \ncommonsense amendment with bipartisan support that passed this body 100 \nto 0.\n  I am going to make one more attempt to offer this amendment because I \ncannot for the life of me understand why we cannot have a vote on this \nlittle bit of common sense.\n  I rise to offer the Coburn amendment, No. 2606, to S. 1845.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The amendment is not in order \nas the motion to proceed to S. 1846 is the pending question.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. I move to appeal the ruling of the Chair that the Coburn \namendment is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The appeal is debatable.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I come to the floor this morning to \ntalk about another very important bill. There was an hour exchange \nabout unemployment, which is extremely important for the Nation. I \nthink people got to hear arguments on both sides. They can continue to \ntry to process that.\n  I came to the floor this morning to talk about another very important \npiece of legislation that we do have very deep and very genuine \nbipartisan support for; that is, the flood insurance provision, the \nHomeowner Affordability Act, which will correct some of the more \negregious provisions of a bill that passed a year-and-a-half ago called \nBiggert-Waters.\n  The bill, Biggert-Waters, that was passed, named for the two Members \nof the House who led that effort, was well intentioned. In fact, I have \nhad many wonderful conversations with Maxine Waters, the absolutely \ndistinguished Congresswoman from California whose name is carried on \nthat bill.\n  She had wonderful intentions because California, like Louisiana, \ndepends on a program to work that is sustainable and affordable, but \nshe even recognized and has been so gracious with her time to come to \nLouisiana to say we intended for this to fix the problem, but I admit \nwe made it worse; the way FEMA has interpreted some of the things we \nhave done has made it worse and the fact that the Federal Government \ncontinues, despite our efforts, to recognize levees people have built. \nSo she has agreed to help lead our effort to reform a bill she and \nCongresswoman Judy Biggert passed a year-and-a-half ago.\n\n[[Page S339]]\n\n  I wish to start by commending the leadership. In the House, the \neffort is being led by Congresswoman Waters and Congressman Grimm. \nThere are chairs of standing committees, working with them as we speak, \nto figure out how to move forward in the House.\n  But in the Senate we have been working so well together. Despite all \nof the commotion and adversarial positions on other issues, we put \ntogether a very excellent coalition of about 200 organizations. I am \ngoing to read those names in just a minute--200 organizations that have \nbeen working with us to fashion a reform bill that meets these \nobjectives.\n  The Presiding Officer has spoken on the floor of the Senate now at \nleast a half dozen times that I have listened to her speak on the \nfloor, so she knows all this that I am going to say because she said it \neven better than I can. But the provisions that are in our reform bill \nfor flood insurance meet important goals. First of all, it is \naffordable to the middle-class people who are required to have it. That \nis the most important thing about flood insurance, that it be \naffordable to the people required to have it.\n  Yes, there are some very wealthy families who live in mansions on \nbeaches that are required to have it. They will have no problem paying \na substantial premium. But there are millions of middle-class \nfamilies--many of them in Louisiana--who do not live anywhere near the \nwater and they most certainly do not live in mansions on the beach. \nThey live in middle-class, blue-collar, working neighborhoods far from \nlakes, a distance from rivers, and nowhere near the ocean. They have \nfound themselves caught up in paying premiums they cannot afford.\n  If we do not fix this, the premiums coming into the program will be \nless and less. People will be defaulting on homes. Banks, communities \nwill take a downward economic spiral and the program itself will \ncollapse.\n  We cannot have this program collapse. So even though our critics--and \nthis has been in the newspapers--are saying we are trying to saddle \ntaxpayers with a huge debt, nothing could be further from the truth. We \nare trying to save taxpayers from a big bailout by reforming a program \nthat needs to be reformed and fixed so middle-class people can afford \nit, banks can operate well with it, homebuilders can build homes with \nit, realtors can sell the homes with the program, which they are not \nable to do now. Everyone can get back to work, anxiety can be reduced \nand give us some time to figure out how to reach those two important \ngoals: so the taxpayers do not have to bail us out and homeowners and \nbusinesses can afford it. Is that too much to ask? I don't think so.\n  Happily, Senator Menendez and Senator Isakson, two veteran leaders of \nthe Senate, have put a very good bill together. We are ready to vote. \nWe are ready to vote. We could vote, actually, right now if we could \njust get a few matters worked out.\n  I would like to talk about what those few matters are publicly so \npeople can start working them out because I think the more things that \nare transparent around here the better off we all are and things that \nare done in secret are usually problematic.\n  Let me say to the many people following this that the base bill is \nstill basically in the order that everyone understands it to be. It is \nprinted. It has been visible, public, for weeks now. That bill that is \nthe basic essence of the compromises worked out by Senator Menendez and \nSenator Isakson and, I might say, with Senator Merkley's extraordinary \nleadership as a subcommittee chair, that is the base bill. There are \namendments that Senators want to offer. Happily they are all related to \nflood.\n  To my knowledge--and Senator Isakson has worked through this, as I \nhave, and Senator Menendez--there is a Hagan provision about escrow \nrequirements that we think we should vote on. We are not sure how that \nvote will turn out, but we are happy to vote on it. There is a Blunt \namendment the National Association of Home Builders has suggested we \nhave an amendment on. We could vote on that as well. There is a Crapo \namendment that is in the works. Some of these amendments have been \nfiled and have language. Some of them are just in theory form. There is \na Crapo amendment that would adjust the rate increases in the \nunderlying bill. We could vote on that. There is a Reed amendment, \nSenator Reed of Rhode Island. This would require FEMA to conduct a \nstudy on the viability of offering community-based flood insurance \npolicies. My notes say there is broad support for that.\n  There is a Coburn amendment, which is an alternative to the NARAB. \nThat amendment will probably not receive the votes required, but we are \nhappy to talk about his amendment and have him offer it. There is a \nMerkley amendment that will subject NFIB policyholders to force-placed \ninsurance policies if they let their policies lapse--it is a technical \namendment--and also a Rubio-Nelson amendment that is being discussed.\n  Those are the only amendments we know about. If there is anybody else \nwho has an amendment on flood who would like to offer it or have it \nconsidered, the next couple of hours would be the last opportunity to \nget those amendments in. I know everybody is busy. I cleared my \ncalendar. I had meeting. I cleared my calendar to do this today because \nit is very important that we not just get so busy with other things \nthat we leave this place and not get this done. We are working \ntransparently, openly, so there are no games to be played by either \nside.\n  Again, I wish to repeat, there is a Hagan amendment pending--not \npending but that we know of--a Rubio-Nelson, a Reed of Rhode Island, a \nCoburn, a Merkley, a Blunt, and then Toomey, who was just on the floor, \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania, has indicated he wants to offer a \nsubstitute to what we are proposing.\n  I am not the manager of this bill so it is not my authority to make \nthese definitive statements. Senator Menendez and Senator Isakson will \nultimately decide the strategy. But as far as I understand, because we \nhave all been working very hard together to move this bill to final \npassage--as far as I understand, these are the only amendments people \nwould like to offer and there does not seem to be any objection to \noffering them.\n  In addition, if people want 51 votes or if they want 60 votes, we are \nvery open to that as well. We could pass the bill with 51 votes, we \ncould pass the bill with 60 votes, so we are open. That is the game \nthat is played here. You say we want 60, no, we want 51 or 51 and 60--\nwe can take it in any arithmetic anyone wants to give us. You want 51 \nvotes, we can deliver them. You want 60 votes, we can deliver 60 votes \nbecause we have done the homework on this bill, working with \ncoalitions, working with homeowners and businesses from South Dakota \nand North Dakota to New Jersey and New York, Mississippi, Louisiana, \nCalifornia, and Oregon. There is no disagreement.\n  Well, there is some disagreement, but there is not enough \ndisagreement to overcome the great coalition which was put together, \nwhich was evidenced by an extraordinary press conference a couple of \ndays ago, where almost 20 Senators showed up, or they were represented \nby their staffs, saying we are ready to go. My message on the floor--I \ndon't know how many more minutes I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 12 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would like another 5; I ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. What was evidenced earlier--and the coalition knows \nthis--there is broad consensus. There are a few Senators who want to \nvote against this bill. There are a few Senators who want to offer \namendments. Fine. Let the record show these amendments could be \noffered--these amendments, germane to this bill and any that would come \nto us in the next hour or so that are germane to this bill, we can take \nthese amendments and have a 51-vote, a 60-vote requirement, and final \npassage on 51 or 60. Let's just get this done.\n  There should be no confusion at all. I am glad no one on the opposite \nside is here debating me on this. That is a good sign for us that there \ntruly is only one side to this story and this is the side.\n  I am trying to be as fair as I can. I have named the people who have \namendments, to our knowledge. We, the Democrats, have said we have no\n\n[[Page S340]]\n\nobjection to them offering those amendments. If they want 51 or 60 \nvotes, just let us know. I feel confident that our coalition can hold \nagainst any amendments that would try to gut this bill.\n  We will let people know what those amendments are and who has offered \nthem because we think this is absolutely right for the country, for the \nStates we represent, and for the taxpayer. Give us a little time to \nwork together to figure out how to strengthen the National Flood \nInsurance Program without bankrupting 5 million families. If we don't \nstop this train that has already left the station--we have to stop it, \nreverse it, and put it back in the train barn because it is going down \nthe track pretty fast. This is not a good place to be.\n  As I said, we probably should have never passed this bill, but it was \nput in a conference committee report that was unamendable and some \nprovisions of it were indecipherable at the time. That is a little \nstrong of a word, but they were not well understood. It wasn't that it \nwas indecipherable; it was not well understood. After the bill was read \nand implemented, people thought, oh, my gosh, what have we done? This \nis not going to work. And they were right.\n  I am going to stay on the floor this morning. If anyone on the \nRepublican side wants to come down and disagree and challenge what I \nhave presented, please do so because I want this to be a very open \nprocess. There is nothing for us to hide from, and that is what a \ndemocracy is about.\n  There are some people who want to vote against our bill. Fine. Go \nahead and vote against it. We have the votes to pass it. As I said, we \nhave 60 votes. We may even have more than 60 votes. If we don't have \nthe votes, all I can say is we tried our level best and we don't have \nthe votes to correct it. I don't think that is the case.\n  I am not going to allow the smoke and confusion and all the hot air \naround here to confuse the coalition that has worked too hard, and they \nneed to hear my voice very clearly, which is why I am here. There is \nclarity. There is no opposition on the Democratic side to this bill. We \nare waiting for a few clarifications from the Republican side. We hope \nto get those clarifications. The only Democrats who have amendments \nthat I know of are Senator Hagan, Senator Reed from Rhode Island, and \nSenator Merkley. We have no objection on the Democratic side for this \nbill and there are only three Members who have amendments, and we are \nhappy to have a vote on those amendments. They are not controversial. \nSomebody might have a problem with them and might vote no. Fine, but \nthey don't gut the bill. There is no problem with the bill.\n  We are waiting on the Republican side for clarity. Again, I know how \nbusy everyone is. I know the Senator from Pennsylvania is working very \nhard. He was just here speaking about unemployment insurance, and I \nknow that is a very important issue to the people he represents, and to \nLouisiana. If he could get a little time to work on the amendment that \nwe think he wants to offer on flood whenever he can, we are happy to \nhave his amendment, and we will vote on it.\n  Senators Isakson and Menendez will decide when and how and what the \nnumber is--51 or 60. As far as I am concerned, it doesn't matter. If \nhis intention is to gut the bill, the bill will not be gutted. If his \nintention is to strengthen the bill, then that is a definite \npossibility. People are desperate to get an answer from Congress now. \nWe should have done this 4 months ago before these rate increases. \nEscrow accounts are being collected. Some people were paying $500 a \nyear and now they are paying $5,000. According to the Biggert-Waters \nlaw, the banks have to get that $5,000 and put it in the bank now to \npay that insurance. That is a real hardship on people. We need to stop \nthat and figure this out.\n  Madam President, I ask for 1 additional minute. I think I have \nextended my time already.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. We have delayed this fix too long, and we need to go \nahead and take care of it. I am going to stay on the floor this \nmorning. I will periodically bring everyone up to date.\n  I will close by reminding people what we are talking about. These are \nthe new flood maps in the United States. The purple shows where it is \nin effect, green shows the proposed areas, and yellow shows the new \nflood map. There is not a State that is exempt from what I am speaking \nabout. The amazing thing is to see this cluster in Pennsylvania, New \nYork, and in Ohio. Everyone thinks about this as a Texas, Florida, or \nLouisiana issue. But when we see the inland States being affected by \nflood maps--States that have never been issued before are being issued \nwithout good data because FEMA doesn't have the science, technology, or \nresources to do this correctly yet. The affordability study has not \neven been done, and they didn't do it even though the last bill asked \nthem to do it.\n  We need to put this train back in the station. It is not ready for \nprime time. We need to bring it out in a way that, yes, rates may have \nto rise. No one is opposed to that. But rates have to rise in a way \nthat people can afford them and can be notified.\n  From our standpoint, Louisiana would like levees to be recognized. \nSince we spent billions of dollars of the taxpayers' money building \nthem, we would like them to be recognized. If you are behind a levee, \nyou don't have to pay $15,000 a year because you already paid for the \nlevee. You don't pay twice. Taxpayers should not have to pay three \ntimes. They are happy to pay their fair share. Most everybody I know is \nhappy to pay their fair share. But under Biggert-Waters, it is not \nfair, it is not shared. It has to be not completely pushed back but it \nhas to be delayed, which is what our bill does.\n  I will stay on the floor, and if someone comes to the floor, that is \nfine. I will talk about this. It is important to get this done. I am an \nappropriator. I am chair of Homeland Security. This is a big, important \nbill for our country. This bill is almost as important--don't get me \nwrong, it is not as important as the whole Appropriations bill, but \nthere are 5 million people who are getting ready to lose their home or \nbusiness, and it is really important to them. It is important for us \nsince there doesn't seem to be any real objection to work hard to get \nit done.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring the quorum call be equally divided between the Republicans and \nthe Democrats.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I just had a conversation with the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana with regard to the flood control \nbill. I am the Republican sponsor of that bill and am very adamantly in \nsupport of that bill passing.\n  Senator Menendez is the principal sponsor from the Democratic Party. \nSenator Landrieu, myself, and Senators all over this country who have \ncoastlines and rivers and flood issues are all very concerned. I want, \nas much as anybody in the world, to expedite that bill going from where \nit is now to the floor, so we can expedite its processing.\n  I have been working with some who have objections to the bill or \nobjections with part of the bill to get an agreement on amendments with \nthe leadership on the Democratic side, so when we do that debate, we \nhave a fair number of amendments that are equally divided in terms of \nthe time and the vote threshold is at 51 votes.\n  I am close to getting there, but I am not there yet. So if a \nunanimous consent were propounded right now, there would be an \nobjection, maybe even from me to let everyone know I am for this bill. \nI want this bill to pass. But I\n\n[[Page S341]]\n\nwant to make sure that those I have been working with to lift their \nholds are accommodated in terms of their opportunity to debate a \ngermane amendment to the flood bill that is relevant to flood control.\n  So I come to the floor for only the purpose of education, to let \neverybody know that I am the Republican sponsor and am deeply involved \nand engaged in the passage of this bill. I also have respect in regard \nto those who have differences of opinion or have some technical \ncorrections they want to make. I want to work to get those incorporated \ninto an agreement before we get a UC, so when we have the UC, we know \nwhat the amendments are, we know what we are going through, and we can \nexpedite the handling of this legislation and deal with the problem \nthat is affecting many homeowners all over the United States of America \nin flood map areas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, may I say, before the Senator from \nGeorgia leaves, how appreciative this coalition is of his leadership. \nHe has been literally--I am not making this up--extraordinary in his \ntime and effort to work through the final amendment process because \nthis process has been going on for over a year.\n  We just did not start talking about this last week. He has given over \na year of his time, and as the chief cosponsor he has been phenomenal. \nI think he would agree with me--if he doesn't, then we could \nrespectfully disagree--that it is time now for the Members that have \nbeen hearing about this and have been told about this for weeks, weeks \nand months, to get their amendments to Senator Isakson so that we can \nmake some decisions about how many amendments we can have. We could \nhave four. We could have six. We could have ten. We can have a 51-vote \nthreshold. We are ready. The Democratic side has, for the most part, \ncleared the amendments we know about.\n  So the Senator is terrific. I thank him for coming. I do not intend \nto ask unanimous consent at this point. The leaders are still working \ntogether, Senator McConnell and Senator Reid.\n  I know the Senator from Georgia is trying to work through this. Would \nthat be a generally good description of where we are?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. The Senator is correct. In fact, to be precise, there \nwere seven concerns about the legislation when the first UC was \npropounded on our side, five of which involve potential amendments that \nneed to be made to the bill or in their opinion need to be made. In the \ncase of two of those, in working with the leadership on the Democratic \nside, they are acceptable and would be included in the base bill.\n  There are three that would be allowed to be debated with the time \nequally divided on the floor. They have asked for a 51-vote threshold. \nThere is the potential, as we all know, for a point of order. But \namendments and points of order would be the only issues that I am aware \nof in all of those conversations. I continue to work at this very \nmoment to get a final agreement so we can get a UC.\n  But we are just not there quite yet. I am going to continue to try to \nwork toward that goal.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I am aware that we are not quite there yet. But I am \nalso aware that the clock is ticking, that it is Wednesday, that we may \nbe out of here on Saturday, and we need to pass an appropriations bill. \nThis is something that also deserves a tremendous amount of attention.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that \nthe time in quorum calls be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Unemployment Insurance Benefits\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, first, the state of play in the Senate \nis that we want to pass an unemployment insurance benefit bill for 1.4 \nmillion Americans who, on January 1, had their unemployment checks cut \noff. Unemployment checks are sent to those Americans who have lost \ntheir job through no fault of their own and who have to prove to us \nthey are trying to find another one. So while they are looking for a \njob, they receive unemployment benefits.\n  These benefits come from a fund which employers and, in some way \nindirectly, employees, pay into while they are working. This insurance \npolicy is there so that if you lose a job there will be, on average, \n$300 a week to keep you and your family together while you look for \nyour next job. It turns out that on January 1, 1.4 million Americans \nsaw those checks cut off. In my State of Illinois, that affected 83,000 \npeople.\n  These are people who have been unemployed for a while and are still \nlooking for work. They have to because that is what the law requires. \nBut here is the problem: The average period when someone is out of work \nwhen they lose a job in America is 38 weeks. That is the average. We \ncut off benefits at 27 weeks. That means that for 11 weeks a lot of \npeople out of work get no unemployment benefits. What do they do? They \nturn to their friends, to their savings, and then they are out of luck. \nThey may find themselves unable to make rent payments or mortgage \npayments, put food on the table, gas in the car to go look for work or \npay for that cell phone they absolutely positively need if they are \ngoing to find a job.\n  So we came here and said: That isn't right. We are getting better. \nThe economy is getting stronger. But the unemployment rate is too high. \nThe national average is about 6.7 percent. It is over 8 percent in my \nState of Illinois, and in some States even higher, unlike the State of \nNorth Dakota, incidentally, which the Presiding Officer lives in and so \ndoesn't worry about this at the present time. We came in and said: \nLet's extend unemployment benefits to these 1.4 million unemployed \npeople in America so they can get by while they are looking for work.\n  This isn't a new idea. This is an old idea. It has happened over and \nover. In fact, under President Bush we did it five times, and the \nunemployment rate was even better than the one we have today. So it \nused to be bipartisan. Democrats and Republicans would say: Come on, \ngive these folks a helping hand. These are workers facing tough times. \nWe hear from them. They tell us their stories.\n  I ended up getting an email from a lady. For 34 years she had worked \nfor the same company. She must be a pretty good employee, right? But \nnow the company has laid her off and she can't find work. Another \nperson had 9 years with the same company and lost his job. When he \napplies for a job, they look at his resume and say: Wait. You are way \noverqualified for this job. If we gave you this job, you would leave \nthe first chance you get to get a better job. So there he sits, unable \nto find a job. He is trying, but he can't.\n  So these people are asking us: Can you help us keep our families \ntogether while we go through this tough period? And I think we should. \nSo we want to call this bill to the floor of the Senate and pass it and \nextend unemployment benefits for 3 months. I would like to see it for 1 \nyear, but even for 3 months we should extend these unemployment \nbenefits so folks in this circumstance can get a helping hand.\n  The Republicans come in and say: No. We object to that. You cannot \nextend unemployment benefits unless you pay for them.\n  Well, that is new. Five times under President Bush they voted for \ntheir President's extension of unemployment benefits and didn't pay for \nit. Now they insist we pay for it. I don't like that. I think this is \nan emergency expenditure. But we live in a divided Congress, Democrats \nand Republicans. We have to find some common ground. So we came up with \na pay-for. We came up with a way to pay for the benefits for this \nunemployment.\n  Then they said: No. We are still going to filibuster. We are still \ngoing to stop it unless you allow us to offer amendments. We have some \nideas we want to bring to the floor and get them to a vote. Yesterday, \nthe majority leader came to the floor and said: OK. We will give you \namendments, up to 10 amendments on each side, to this unemployment \nissue. You pick the amendments. We are not going to pick them. They \nsaid: No. We still object.\n\n[[Page S342]]\n\n  So today we sit in the middle of a Republican filibuster stopping \nunemployment benefits for 1.4 million Americans. What used to be a \nbipartisan effort has now turned into an extremely partisan effort. \nThat happens too much in this town. It happens too much on Capitol \nHill. But it shouldn't happen at the expense of 1.4 million unemployed \nAmericans.\n  That is why this floor is empty today. That is why we are giving \nspeeches on a lot of different subjects. We are stuck in another \nRepublican filibuster stopping unemployment benefits. I don't think \nthat is right or fair. A lot of us believe we ought to extend these \nbenefits and move on to deal with our economy and putting people to \nwork, trying to find ways to make sure those who are working get a \ndecent wage.\n  These are some of the things we ought to be taking up. But again, we \nare stuck in this filibuster, and so that is why I come to the floor to \ngive a speech on two unrelated issues.\n\n\n                                Tobacco\n\n  Madam President, there is an issue that is very important to me \npersonally, but it turns out it is important to a lot of people: \nTobacco. I lost my father to lung cancer. He died when I was 14 years \nold. He smoked two packs of Camels a day and developed lung cancer at \nthe age of 53 and died. I have to tell you it is one of the most \nprofound events of my life, to be a high school student and to live \nthrough a parent dying slowly of lung cancer. My attitude toward \ntobacco and smoking, I am sure, is a product of that.\n  When I came to Congress, I decided that in some small way I was going \nto try to do something about it. I didn't believe I could solve the \nproblem, but I thought I could help. So over 25 years ago I introduced \na bill in the House of Representatives to ban smoking on airplanes. It \nis hard to believe--young people still don't believe it today--there \nwas a time when half the airplane was smoking and half wasn't smoking. \nIn fact, everybody was breathing secondhand smoke. We were successful. \nWe passed the bill in the House of Representatives on a bipartisan \nvote. It came over to the Senate, before I was here, and Frank \nLautenberg, the late Senator from New Jersey, took it up and did a \ngreat job, and the two of us together made it the law of the land.\n  We didn't know what we had done, other than to make airplane flight a \nlittle more convenient, safe, and comfortable. But it turns out it was \na tipping point. It turns out that when we banned smoking on airplanes, \npeople started asking questions 25 years ago: If it is not a good idea \nto smoke on airplanes, why is it a good idea to smoke on trains and \nbuses and offices and hospitals and schools and restaurants and taverns \nand everyplace we go? So today, if you walked into a room and did what \npeople did normally 25 years ago--pulled out a pack of cigarettes and \nlit one up--people would say: Stop. What are you doing? You didn't say \na word to me. You are going to smoke in front of me?\n  That used to be normal. Thank goodness it isn't any longer. What \nhappens is Americans have a different attitude toward tobacco. The \nactual debate on this issue began 50 years ago--serious debate--because \nit was 50 years ago the Surgeon General of the United States of America \nissued a landmark report that for the first time conclusively linked \ntobacco to lung cancer and heart disease. Remember this: Tobacco is the \nNo. 1 preventable cause of death in America today, and it has been for \nmore than half a century.\n  When this report came out, it was at a time when people smoked in \noffices, airplanes, elevators, even in congressional hearings. In 1964, \n42 percent of American adults smoked. It is hard to imagine, but until \na few months before the report was released the Surgeon General himself \nwas a smoker. We have certainly come a long way since that time, and \nthe Surgeon General's report played a big role in changing America.\n  Today we expect measures such as warning labels on cigarettes, \nkeeping cigarette commercials off television, taxes on cigarettes, and \nnow ``no smoking'' signs almost everywhere. Thanks to these commonsense \ntobacco control measures, smoking among U.S. adults in 50 years has \nbeen cut in half. The report released by Surgeon General Luther Terry \nin 1964 was a turning point.\n  We still have a long way to go. Approximately 44 million Americans, \nnearly one out of every five, still smokes, and more than 440,000 \nAmericans die each year from tobacco-related causes. Last week the \nJournal of the American Medical Association published a study that \nshowed over the last 50 years about 8 million premature smoking-induced \ndeaths were avoided thanks to tobacco control measures. However, the \nstudy also noted that despite this progress, more than 17 million \nAmericans died prematurely from tobacco over the last 50 years.\n  According to the Surgeon General's report, released in March 2012, \ntobacco use among kids is a pediatric epidemic and is the No. 1 cause \nof preventable and premature death in America. The report also found \nthat every day 700 young people become new regular smokers, and of \nthese new smokers one-third will eventually die from it.\n  We have young people who come and visit us in our offices, in the \nSenate galleries, and other places. These young people are the targets \nof tobacco companies. If they can get a kid to start smoking at an \nearly age, before they have the maturity to understand the seriousness \nof that decision, they become addicted. Nicotine is an addictive drug \nand it is in tobacco and so they are picking up new customers by \nrecruiting kids.\n  I have yet to meet the first parent anywhere, any time, anyplace who \nhas said to me: I have great news for you, Senator. My daughter came \nhome from school and she started smoking. I have never heard that. I \ndon't think I ever will because we know intuitively it is a terrible \nthing and it could affect that young person's great young life.\n  The tobacco industry gets it. Our Nation pays the financial burden of \ntobacco use through $96 billion in annual medical costs, $97 billion in \nlost productivity of workers and, at the same time, these tobacco \ncompanies invent new ways to lure in these young customers and to \nentice people to buy their products.\n  Ninety percent of adult smokers began smoking before they graduated \nfrom high school--they were just teenage kids--which is why the tobacco \ncompanies continue to prey on children. They push products such as e-\ncigarettes. They just had the Golden Globe Awards, and some of these \nred-hot actors and actresses, whom we all love to watch in movies--\nLeonardo DiCaprio and others--were sitting there puffing away on their \ne-cigarettes. I looked at that and thought: You are killing the next \ngeneration of fans of your movies.\n  We have to bring an end to this. E-cigarettes--available in shopping \nmalls--that release appealing fruit- and candy-flavored vapors so it is \nmore of a candy experience than a tobacco experience is one of the new \ntactics. Unfortunately, it is working. Earlier this year, the Centers \nfor Disease Control released new data showing the use of e-cigarettes \namong the Nation's kids is rising.\n  The report raises concerns that for young people, e-cigarettes could \nbe a gateway to traditional cigarettes. More than 3.6 million kids \nunder the age of 18 currently are smokers, and each day more than 3,500 \nkids try smoking a cigar or cigarette for the first time.\n  This graph I have shows how far we have come in reducing the use of \ncigarettes but also how much we have left to do. Between 2000 and 2011, \nthe consumption of cigarettes in the United States decreased 33 \npercent--by one-third. During the same time, the use of loose tobacco \nand cigars increased 123 percent. Cigar smokers--why in the heck would \na kid want to smoke a cigar? Because it is similar to smoking a candy \nbar. They flavor these cigars with cherry flavoring, sweet chocolate or \ngrapes, and they are trying to get kids to start smoking.\n  Over the past 50 years we have seen the growing popularity of these \ncandy-flavored tobacco products such as smokeless tobacco, e-\ncigarettes, and nicotine candies that look like breath mints. All these \nproducts are geared to luring the young into this addiction.\n  I have called on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to expand and \nassert its authority over tobacco products, including e-cigarettes and \nflavored cigars. Unlike traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes are not \nsubject to Federal age verification laws. Kids can legally buy them in \nmost places across\n\n[[Page S343]]\n\nAmerica. Although we do know that most e-cigarettes contain nicotine, \nwe don't know what else is in them. Without FDA regulation, we will \nnot.\n  This Congress Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut joined me in \nintroducing the Tobacco Tax Parity Act, a bill that closes the \nloopholes in how tobacco products are defined and taxed. It will end \nthe exploitation of these loopholes by tobacco companies. It means \ntaxing the roll-your-own loose tobacco we talked about and pipe tobacco \nat the same level. It means raising the tax on a container of smokeless \ntobacco from today's 11 cents to $1, the same as a pack of cigarettes.\n  I would like to show this as well. This is a story about Sharon, a \n52-year-old woman from my home State of Illinois. Sharon started \nsmoking at the age of 13. She said it seemed as though everybody was \ndoing it. After her first puff, she quickly went from being a casual \nuser to a full-blown addict with an expensive tobacco habit. When \nSharon reached the age of 37--37--she was diagnosed with stage IV \nthroat cancer. Thankfully, radiation and surgery saved her life, but \nshe had to have her voice box removed and now speaks through an \nelectrolarynx.\n  Last year Sharon was courageous enough to allow her story to be used \nas part of the Centers for Disease Control's 12-week antismoking \ncampaign, a federally funded national antitobacco campaign with hard-\nhitting ads. It sounds like a pretty good effort by the government. But \ncompared to the $10 billion a year the tobacco industry spends on \nmarketing, the CDC campaign spent only $50 million; the tobacco \nindustry, $10 billion.\n  CDC expects the campaign to help 50,000 people quit. One of those who \ncalled in to the quit line at CDC was a woman named Kim in Rockford, \nIL. She was watching an ad which showed the devastating effect on \nsmoking on a North Carolina woman named Terrie. Kim said the commercial \nscared her, and that her son turned to her and said: Mom, you have just \ngot to quit smoking. Kim called the Illinois tobacco quit line run by \nthe American Lung Association and was connected to the nicotine \nreplacement-patch program.\n  CDC's anti-smoking campaign is one of the many tobacco control and \nprevention measures that saves lives and shows we must continue \ninvesting in effective tobacco control measures.\n  This is a tough habit to break. One of my best friends in politics \nhappens to be the President of the United States, who used to be a \nsmoker. He is not now, thank goodness. His family is thankful and we \nare all thankful. But he still takes a little nicotine gum to chew from \ntime to time to deal with the craving that is there. It is tough. But \nif people work hard, they can get it done.\n  This week we commemorate the importance of the first Surgeon \nGeneral's Report on Smoking and Health and many other legal and \ncultural changes in this country. But as we look around at the \nproliferation of new and dangerous products luring kids to tobacco, we \nstill have a lot of work to do. With the right commitment, we can spare \nfuture generations from this deadly epidemic of tobacco use.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/15/senate-section/article/S343-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S343-S344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MAKING FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2014\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to the consideration of H.J. Res. 106, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 106) making further \n     continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2014, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 15 \nminutes of debate equally divided.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I wish to speak on another matter \npending in front of the Senate, the flood insurance bill.\n  I wish to say that Senator Landrieu has been a real champion here. We \nare still insisting that we be able to bring up the bipartisan bill to \ndelay for several years the flood insurance hikes. In my State, where \n40 percent of the policies are, we have seen spikes by tenfold of the \nrate on the flood insurance policies.\n  Thank goodness there was in this omnibus appropriations a provision \nwhich would provide some partial relief for some homeowners facing huge \nrate hikes. The estimate is it would only cover less than a quarter of \nall the flood insurance policies being affected by the huge rate hikes. \nThat is why we need to move forward with passing the broad bipartisan \nbill which will delay these hikes for several years while FEMA does an \naffordability study. I told Senator Landrieu earlier that I wanted to \ncome in and support her in comments she made earlier today.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, what is the pending business before \nthe Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. H.J. Res. 106 is the business pending before \nthe Senate.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Which is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The short-term CR.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise in support. This is a simple \nshort-term extension of the continuing funding resolution we passed \nsome weeks ago. This is Washington-speak and budget-speak for saying, \nas of today, the money that keeps the Federal Government in operation \nexpires. However, being debated in the House this afternoon we have a \nconsolidated appropriations bill which will fund the government through \nfiscal year 2014 and will come to the Senate either late this evening \nor will be on the floor tomorrow morning.\n  I ask the Senate to pass the short-term extension because it is a \ntechnical situation. This isn't the usual delay, drama, and fiscal \ncliff situation. When the Budget Committee acted, and we passed the \nbill on a bipartisan, bicameral basis, we, the Appropriations \nCommittee, were given a very stringent deadline of January 15 to \nproduce an appropriations bill for fiscal year 2014. We have worked all \nthe way through the holidays and all the way up to Sunday evening, and \nwe have completed our work. It is now before the Senate and the House \nto be reviewed. It is on our Web site and so on. We just need a couple \nof hours to complete the job now.\n  I can assure my colleagues this very short extension is status quo. \nIt makes no changes in funding levels. It makes no changes in \nconditions for the operation of the government. The Appropriations \nCommittee worked over the holidays. The agreement was made public on \nMonday. The House will vote on the agreement this afternoon. As soon as \nthe House completes its work, it will come to the Senate.\n  This is a short-term CR. It is for 72 hours. It will provide the time \nneeded for the Senate to consider the agreement, for the paperwork to \nbe prepared, and for the President to sign it. This is a very short-\nterm extension which will enable us to complete our work and not even \nhave a temporary shutdown. I urge my colleagues to allow the short \nextension to pass the Senate expeditiously so we can move on to the \ndiligence we need to provide in debating the appropriations bill.\n  We will have a vote at 12:15. The vote at 12:15 is on the short-term \nextension of the current continuing funding resolution. It will be for \n72 hours. It takes us through Saturday. I hope we are done before \nSaturday.\n  This is not a vote on the appropriations bill itself, nor should it \nbe viewed as a proxy vote. It is just simply a technical time bridge to \nenable us to have adequate debate in the House and adequate debate and \nreview in the Senate to do this.\n  I really hope my colleagues support this 72-hour extension so we do \nnot have the usual drama we have of fiscal cliffs and shutdowns and so \non. My colleague, the Senator from Alabama Mr. Shelby, who is my vice \nchairman, is involved in other duties in the Senate, but he too \nsupports this 72-hour extension. We have been working so diligently on \nour bill through the holidays so we could have a bill before the \nSenate, and I must say it has been characterized by diligence, \ndetermination, and courtesy. But it takes time. It takes time to \nreview, and it takes time to scrutinize. Quite frankly, it took time to \ndiscuss the issues involved in the appropriations.\n\n[[Page S344]]\n\n  All 12 subcommittees are represented. But I will say more about it \nwhen we bring the actual bill to the floor.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, when I was growing up, my now 93-year-old \ngranddaddy would hold the newspaper and read it while he drank his \ncoffee. Every morning it seemed he was always focused on reading the \npaper. He looked like an executive, a doctor or an attorney, always \nmaking sure his grandsons saw him reading.\n  I learned several years later that my granddaddy couldn't read, but \nhe was wise enough to model the behavior that he wanted his grandsons \nto follow. The circumstances of his life forced him out of the \nclassroom at a very young age and into the cotton fields to help \nsupport his family. But granddaddy has now lived long enough to see a \ngrandson elected to Congress and another grandson earn the rank of \ncommand sergeant major in the U.S. Army. Only 1 percent of NCOs reach \nthat rank.\n  In a single lifetime, families can go from not having a fair chance \nto learn to read to seeing their kids graduate from college, as my \ngrandfather has seen two of his grandsons graduate. That is the power \nof America. That is the power of opportunity.\n  Over the last several months, I have spent many hours talking and \nworking with people from every walk of life, beginning when I was \nbagging groceries at the local Piggly Wiggly or waiting tables at the \nCalifornia Dreaming or 2 weeks ago when I took a ride on the public bus \njust to have an opportunity to sit back and talk with everyday \nAmericans about their hopes, their dreams, and their fears or, last \nweekend, as I swept floors at the local Moe's restaurant. What I have \nheard is that people in America and throughout South Carolina are \nhungry for opportunity. They are working hard, but still they are \nstruggling.\n  People want to work. They want to get ahead, and they still want a \nbetter life for their children and their grandchildren. So the \nquestions for those of us in government are simple: Are we a part of \nthe problem or are we a part of the solution? Do we make things more \ndifficult or are we an ally in this struggle to get ahead? Are we \ntrying the same tactics and getting the same results?\n  It has been said several times that insanity is doing the same things \nthe same ways and hoping for different results. After a nearly 50-year \ngovernment-led war on poverty, the poverty rates are increasing. Were \nthis a military conflict, we would have changed our strategy decades \nago, but somehow we fail to learn and continue to believe that next \nyear it will be different. It has not been different in nearly half a \ncentury.\n  I propose a new way forward--a new way forward so a little girl can \nrise from the depths of poverty and become the CEO of a Fortune 500 \ncompany, a new way forward that will create a place where young men \nraised in a single-parent household and living in the inner city \nhousing projects can become a world-renowned surgeon, a new way forward \nso an intelligent young lady living in rural South Carolina who ages \nout of the foster care program can still afford a college education. I \npropose a new way forward, and our opportunity agenda does just that.\n  We will help to turn neglected neighborhoods ravished by poverty into \ncenters of excellence. We will see that these amazing centers of \nexcellence will become economic engines because of the creativity of \nthe people living in the neighborhoods. We will see economic activity \nin a place that we once thought not possible.\n  Today, too many Americans are trapped in low-paying jobs because they \nlack the skills to improve their incomes. These folks are not asking \nfor a handout; they are asking for a hand up. Every day Americans are \nstruggling, working hard, looking for a way to change their destiny.\n  That is why we have introduced the SKILLS Act. With nearly 4 million \njobs vacant in America today, we believe the skills gap can be covered \nbecause of the SKILLS Act.\n  Our second bill we have filed is called the CHOICE Act, Creating Hope \nand Opportunity for Individuals and Communities through Education. One \nof the opportunities we see within the CHOICE Act is for those kids who \nhave special needs to have the opportunity to make their education \ndollars portable. I believe every single American deserves the \nopportunity to realize their full potential, but too many of these \nyoung kids--bright kids with special needs--do not receive the \neducation that is best for them. So the CHOICE Act provides their \nparents with portability so they can choose the school that best fits \nthe needs of their kids.\n  The American Opportunity Agenda encourages each of us to reach our \nfull potential. In the coming months we will introduce legislation that \nencourages reform of our welfare programs. We will fight to change our \nTax Code so small businesses can hire more people and not simply pay \nhigher taxes. Finally, we will work with anyone, anywhere, at any time \nto reduce the regulatory burdens that stand in the way and close the \ndoors of opportunity.\n  Last week we submitted an amendment that restores a 40-hour workweek \nthat was destroyed in ObamaCare. The effort to restore the 40-hour \nworkweek has been led by my colleague, the Senator from Maine Susan \nCollins, who understands the devastation caused by ObamaCare, where \nmore than 20 million Americans face the loss of up to 25 percent of \ntheir income when they move from 40 hours a week to less than 30 hours \na week. I applaud my colleague and others for standing strong\n\n[[Page S345]]\n\nand standing tall to make sure we have a serious debate about the \nincome inequality that is caused by ObamaCare. The effort to restore \nthe 40-hour workweek should be something we all champion, realizing its \nmassive impact on our economy.\n  I have lived a family's journey from cotton to Congress. I know the \nsense of empowerment and optimism it provides. Once the standard is set \nin a family, as my grandfather set it in our family, and once the \nstandard is set in a community or a State, the generations to come will \nset even higher expectations for themselves because success is created \nalmost anywhere in America today. It happens in studio apartments, at \nkitchen tables; it happens in garages and classrooms throughout \nAmerica, but it doesn't often happen in government conference rooms in \nWashington. I believe, and I have experienced, that with a good \neducation, strong work skills, and the help of our Heavenly Father, all \nthings are truly possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Appropriations\n\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, today, this week, we have come together \nto consider an omnibus appropriations bill. That is a big mouthful--an \nomnibus appropriations bill--but I hope to lay out in plain language \nfor our folks back home and for those in this Chamber why that matters, \nwhy I am excited about it, and why I support it.\n  This is first time since I joined this body 3 years ago that we have \nconsidered one, and it is a real step forward. The agreement we came to \non the budget and the agreement I hope we will pass on this \nappropriations bill means no more shutdowns, no more crises, no more \nautopilot, at least not for this fiscal year. This bill helps us return \nto regular order and to the process that, once election day is over, it \nis our job as the representatives of the people, elected to come \ntogether to find common ground, to solve bigger problems together, and \nto move the Nation forward.\n  This appropriations bill is the result of a lot of hard work by \nMembers and staff. I must begin first and foremost by thanking the \nSenate Appropriations Committee chair, Senator Mikulski, and the vice \nchair, Senator Shelby, as well as the House chairman Rogers, and the \nranking member, Congresswoman Lowey, who showed great leadership and \nworked together on a very tight deadline to craft such a vast and \ncomprehensive bill. Their work follows on the leadership of Senator \nMurray, chair of the Senate Budget Committee, and Congressman Ryan, of \nthe House Budget Committee, after they came together on a bipartisan \nbudget that paved the way for the Appropriations Committee to reach \nthis deal this week.\n  I applaud their leadership and thank them for the example they have \nset. As a member of both the Budget Committee and the Appropriations \nCommittee, it has been a privilege to work with them to craft these \nbills and ensure we meet our Nation's needs.\n  The bill before us is, of course, a compromise. It is the essence of \na compromise that it is not perfect by any means. There are many who \ncan find fault within it or disappointments aplenty among choices made \nor not made. It doesn't include--for example, to pick one thing of \ngreat importance to my State--enough funding to make real headway on \nAmtrak's critical infrastructure improvements that I think are \nessential--just in dealing with the $6 billion backlog of investments \nneeded in aging tunnels, bridges, and tracks.\n  So while this bill does provide adequate funding for Amtrak today, \nwhich I am very pleased about, it puts off those critically needed \ninvestments in repairing these essential elements of its \ninfrastructure, which we will inevitably need to make. That is only one \nexample, and in a bill this big there are hundreds, maybe even \nthousands, of the tough tradeoffs that had to be made between House and \nSenate, between the appropriators, and between the majority and the \nminority.\n  But as we consider our vote on this bill and how it does or doesn't \nmeet our own priorities or our State's priorities, we can't let the \nperfect be the enemy of the good. We need to remember that at least in \nthis case the alternative to this bill isn't our own individual or \nperfect vision of government--whatever view we might hold. The \nalternative is crisis after crisis, government that doesn't move \nforward with the country but treads water as the world passes us by in \nan increasingly competitive global environment.\n  What this bill does in a very real way is bring back some stability \nto our government, to our economy, and it allows us to make important \ninvestments in our country's growth. For instance, it takes a number of \nvaluable steps for my home State of Delaware.\n  It funds meat and poultry inspectors, critical to Delaware's chicken \nindustry and its 13,000 jobs. It funds the next stage of an Army Corps \nof Engineers project to deepen the Delaware River from 40 to 45 feet so \nthat we are ready and can be competitive when the expansion of the \nPanama Canal nears completion.\n  It dedicates funding through the Victims of Child Abuse Act--and I am \nan original cosponsor of a bill reauthorizing the Victims of Child \nAbuse Act--for the three children's advocacy centers throughout my \nState. These centers are critical to delivering justice for the victims \nof child abuse without harming their healing process.\n  The bill maintains funding for the Bulletproof Vest Partnership, an \ninitiative that has supplied Delaware police officers with nearly 1,000 \nbulletproof vests in the past 2 years. Two of those vests, I should \nadd, saved the lives of two officers during a shooting at the New \nCastle County Courthouse only last spring.\n  These are only a few of the things for which I am grateful in this \nbroad omnibus bill. Nationally, it also allows us to meet our key \npriorities of training our workforce for this century, making our \ncommunities safer, building a circle of protection around the most \nvulnerable in our society, and, in combination, making us safer, \nstronger, and more just.\n  The investments it makes in America's workforce by funding education \nprograms can last a lifetime. Head Start Programs ensure kids don't \nfall behind before they have even had a chance. This bill increases \nthat funding by $1 billion to serve 90,000 more kids this year.\n  There is a competitive grant program to help States and communities \nfind innovative ways to provide high quality preschool options for low- \nand middle-income families that I am particularly excited about.\n  In Delaware, we saw the power of this program when we competed for--\nand won--Federal funding on a competitive basis for high-quality early \neducation only last year.\n  The Department of Education's first in the world initiative will help \ncolleges to measure--and thus improve--outcomes, and it brings down \ncosts for students and families. This bill increased our investment in \njob training programs such as Job Corps and the Veterans' Employment \nand Training Service, which help everyone from low-income Americans who \nfailed to get on their feet in the job market to veterans who stood for \nus around the world and have earned our support upon their return.\n  Next, this bill includes crucial funding that makes our communities \nsafer. We are upping our investment in the COPS program--first \nchampioned on this floor by my predecessor Senator Joe Biden. It will \nput 1,500 more officers on our streets and in our neighborhoods, \nkeeping us safe.\n  The Violence Against Women Act, which we came together in a \nbipartisan manner to pass last year, is fully funded. We are taking \nimportant steps to stop the scourge of gun violence that affects each \nand every community: a new comprehensive school safety program I am \nexcited about, new investments to improve background checks, and new \ntraining to help local law enforcement react and protect the public \nfrom active shooters.\n  Of course, the second part of making our communities safer is \nensuring that justice is delivered in our courts when\n\n[[Page S346]]\n\ncrime does happen. Unfortunately, the sequester's cuts to our Federal \ncourts cut the judiciary to the bone, imposing furloughs, and hurting \nour Nation's justice system by leading to layoffs of hundreds of \nexperienced, seasoned, senior court staff. Yet, thankfully, the bill \nbefore us reverses these and many other cuts and will minimize the \ndelays of justice that resulted and that are unacceptable to our \nNation.\n\n  Finally, this bill allows us to build and sustain what I like to call \na circle of protection around the most vulnerable in our society that \nreflects our shared commitment to each other. Our most basic values: \nInvestments in the WIC Program, for women, infants, and children, will \nmake sure 87,000 more mothers and children will have the food they need \nat a vital early stage of development. LIHEAP--or the Low-Income \nHeating and Energy Assistance Program--ensures that low-income families \ndon't freeze during the coldest months of the year, and this bill's \nfunding increases will ensure 400,000 more houses have this critical \nassistance. And lastly, when we pass this bill, which I pray we will by \nweek's end, we will reverse the sequester's devastating cuts to housing \nprograms and, as a result, prevent more than 100,000 American families \nfrom becoming homeless.\n  Each of these investments in our workforce, in our public safety, and \nin protection for our most vulnerable, together make up the foundation \nof a safer, a more just, and a more inclusive society. But when we also \ncombine them with investments in research and innovation and \ninfrastructure, we lay the groundwork for growth and shared prosperity \ntoday and tomorrow.\n  After the last 3 years, which in my experience have been mostly \ndefined by bipartisan gridlock--stopgap budgets, crisis governance--\nthis bipartisan Appropriations bill allows us to create some stability \nfor our Nation and our economy. I think it reminds us we are a nation \nthat is at its best when we are determined to be open to each other's \nideas, to hear each other's concerns and criticisms, and to find ways \nto work together.\n  Although there are plenty of areas where I disagree with my \nRepublican colleagues, as I have gotten to know them over the past 3 \nyears we have found many more areas of common good and common work. Let \nme briefly mention a few of them as I celebrate what I think is the \nmost important aspect of this bill, which is that it is truly \nbipartisan.\n  Senator Marco Rubio and I were both elected in 2010 and came to this \nChamber at roughly the same time, and we found ways to work together to \ninvest in STEM education and to open pathways to college for young \nAmericans. Senator Hatch and I wrote a bill together called I-Squared--\nand we are joined by Senators Klobuchar and Rubio--and this is a bill \nthat helps bring high-skilled workers to our shores and helps invest in \nSTEM education for American citizens. Senator Kirk and I have worked \ntogether to create a national manufacturing strategy that focuses our \nenergy and resources on creating manufacturing jobs in America. And \njust this Monday Senator Roberts of Kansas and I announced our \npartnership on a new bill to make the research and development tax \ncredit and its funding available to startups and to young innovative \ncompanies.\n  There are so many issues where we can work together to invest in our \nworkforce, to protect the public, to sustain this storied circle of \nprotection around the most vulnerable, to invest in long-term economic \ngrowth, and to lift up every community and every American.\n  I am incredibly thankful for the leadership of Senators Mikulski and \nShelby and the way they displayed that leadership with action through \nthis process, by putting aside their differences and finding common \nground. I wish to also close with a note of personal thanks to the \ncountless committee staff on both sides who worked tirelessly \nthroughout the holidays to make this bill a reality. With this Omnibus \nappropriations bill it is my sincere hope we are putting an end to a \ncycle of manufactured crises and we are sending to the American people \nand to our markets and to our communities the message that we can and \nwill work together to confront the many challenges that remain here and \nin the future.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I came to the floor to spend some time \non the unemployment insurance, but I have to comment, after hearing my \ncolleague mention his esteemed favor of the bill that will be in front \nof us, I have to say my perspective is totally different.\n  We have a 1,500-page bill that nobody has read, other than my staff, \nand we have read it completely and outlined it completely. We have a \nbill that is dishonest, because you still have changes in mandatory \nfunding and programs and you create $17.9 billion out of nothing, which \neverybody on the Appropriations Committee knows allows you to spend \n$17.9 billion but not pay for, and you transfer that sleight of hand to \nour children.\n  But it doesn't seem to bother anybody on the Appropriations Committee \nthat we actually lie to the American public about how much we are \nactually going to spend. The bill actually spends about $63 billion, \nthe way you have written it, more than we did last year--about 6\\1/2\\ \nor 7 percent. The bill is loaded with parochial benefits, which is the \npleasure of the appropriators, I understand, but it doesn't pass muster \nin terms of no earmarks.\n  But there is one point that I agree with. This has been an agreement \nbetween Republicans and Democrats to bring the bill to the floor. And \nit will pass because it is an agreement, because people did work \ntogether. Whether I like it or not, they worked together and came to a \nconclusion. The only problem is there are going to be no amendments, so \nno way to be honest with the American people on this $17.9 billion that \nis supposedly paid but isn't. It is truly an untruth. It is dishonest. \nIt has no integrity with it whatsoever. It undermines every Senator up \nhere who is going to vote for this bill because you say one thing and \nyou are going to do exactly the opposite.\n  I was just given a poll as of today. The No. 1 problem Americans see \nin our country is us--the U.S. Government. Twenty-one percent of the \npeople in this country identify us as the problem. Is it any wonder, \nwhen we tell them we are going to do X and then we don't do X? For \nexample: We had a budget agreement, and then we changed the budget \nagreement because we couldn't live within our means and we wouldn't \nraise the revenue to be able to do that. Then we come to a new budget \nagreement that is much higher--don't honor the previous budget \nagreement. Then we put an appropriations bill on the floor that is \ngoing to fund all the Federal Government until September 30 and nobody \nhas totally read it. They pick out the things they like in it and then \ntalk about it. Is it any wonder why 21 percent of the people think the \nCongress, politicians, poor leadership, corruption, and abuse of power \nin Washington are the No. 1 problem with our country?\n\n  You know what. They are right. It is an abuse of power to vote for a \nbill that you know spends $18 billion--$17.9 billion--more than what \nyou are telling the American people it is going to spend. You do it \nthrough sleight of hand, and you pass muster with the powers that be, \nbut it is not honest with the American public. So we are going to do it \nagain. We are not going to have a government shutdown, everybody is \ngoing to get to go home on break and spend a week away from here and \nsay: Oh, look at us, we are not at loggerheads anymore.\n  The only reason we are at loggerheads is because we have abandoned \nthe process of the Senate through the majority leader who does not \nallow the Senate to force consensus. For the life of me, I don't \nunderstand why my colleagues on the other side of the aisle accept it. \nThey get no amendments either. So we have 1 person out of 100 who \ndecides what amendments will be acceptable and what will not.\n  Jefferson has to be spinning in his grave because he wrote the \noriginal rules for the Senate. It had nothing to do with one person \ndeciding. As a matter of fact, until 1917, one person stopped \neverything in the Senate if they didn't have consensus. So the whole \ngoal was to trade what you would like to do to give somebody else\n\n[[Page S347]]\n\nthe ability to do that. When we have a czar running the Senate, we no \nlonger have that ability. The whole purpose for having a bicameral \nlegislature, with a minority rights provision protecting it, was so we \nwould generate consensus so that their views could then be sold to the \nAmerican public.\n  This isn't about me being able to offer an amendment. This is about \nthe 4 million people in Oklahoma not having a say in the Senate. I \nmean, there are some bright people in Oklahoma who have some good \nideas. But those ideas cannot be heard in this body anymore. They are \nnot my ideas. It is not my vote. It is their vote. And yet 54 of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle acquiesced their right for \ntheir States to offer their State's ideas as we debate issues in this \nbody. They give that away and say one person gets to decide. It has \nnever been that way in the Senate--never before.\n  The prime example of that is the unemployment bill. If this were \nreally a priority for the majority leader, why are we doing it now \ninstead of before it expired? All the weeks of time in quorum calls in \nthe Senate we could have been doing this. It wasn't a priority. It is a \npolitical priority.\n  I actually think we ought to extend the unemployment insurance, but I \nthink we ought to do it in a smarter way, and I certainly think we \nought to pay for it. I can sit and show $9 trillion of waste and \nspending reductions that 80 percent of average Americans would agree \nwith. Yet we can't find $20-some billion out of all this mess of a \nFederal Government to help people who are not employed.\n  My colleague from Delaware mentioned job training. The only thing \nthat has happened based on the GAO reports of this government on \nduplication is that the House took it to heart and they took the job \ntraining programs and they converted the 47 job training programs, \nspending almost $30 billion a year, and they passed the SKILLS Act, \nwhich consolidated those into 6 programs that actually have metrics.\n  When you study our job training programs, regardless of whether we \nfund them, here is what you find. All but three of them duplicate one \nanother--all but three--and not one of them has a metric on whether \nthey are actually training people to do a job, giving them a life \nskill. So the House passes that bill and we won't even take it up. You \nsave money and you actually improve what the Federal Government is \ntrying to do in terms of that. So if we were to expand unemployment \ninsurance or continue the emergency in the sixth year, might we not \nwant to do something about the quality of the jobs programs that are \navailable for the people who are on unemployment? Might we also not \nwant to give people back their dignity by having them do something in \ntheir community for the earning of that?\n  There have been no tax dollars paid by any worker for this program. \nThey didn't contribute anything to it through their past unemployment \nor FICA fees. Would we not do better if we did what Norway has done, \nwhere they show that people will start hunting for a job earlier if you \nplus up the benefits early and taper the benefits later so that they \nstart looking for a job long before they run out of benefits? What the \nstudies actually show, especially the three States that have now been \ndisqualified from this, is their employment numbers went up, their \nunemployment went down, and the number of people needing assistance \nactually went down as well.\n  So it is one thing to say we want to help people; it is totally \ndifferent when it is all in a political contest about the next \nelection.\n  That brings me to my final point. I believe children need to have a \ngood start toward school. But as the Senator from Delaware just \nmentioned, we are going to add $1 billion to Head Start, and that is \ngoing to give us 90,000 new kids in Head Start. If anybody does the \nmath on that, $11,000 per year for a Head Start Program? Think about \nthat. Give the money to the States and let them run it themselves \noutside of the Federal Government and they will do it for $4,000 or \n$5,000. Because it is a Federal program, it costs twice what it should. \nOr if you did it through the States, you could do $180,000 versus what \nwe are doing.\n  So we are going to have a debate. Hopefully we will get back to the \nunemployment insurance. But if we want to have that debate, it has to \nbe paid for. We owe that to the very people we say we want to help. \nAnd, No. 2, you have to have the input of everybody, not just one \nperson in the Senate.\n  I will finish up by saying this: When you see this poll, where 21 \npercent of the country thinks the biggest problem in the country is us, \nthe government--the corruption, the abuse of power, and the poor \nleadership are the specific things that were mentioned in this poll--\nwhat we ought to do is look inside and ask ourselves: Why is that?\n  That is because we concentrate on the political and not on the \npeople. We use them as pawns to advantage our own political careers, \nour own elections, and the long-term best interests of the country get \nsacrificed. What this poll shows is the American people are pretty \ndarned smart, because they see the problem, they know what it is, and \nthey know what is going to happen.\n  So we are going to pass a bill that is going to spend over $1 \ntrillion, with all sorts of favors in there--not truly earmarks, but as \nclose to them as you can come--with new programs by the appropriators \ninstead of the authorizing committee. That is the other thing in this \nbill, programs written by the Appropriations Committee instead of the \nauthorizing committee. We are going to pass this bill, and this number \nis going to jump from 21 percent to 25 percent.\n  The jig is up. We can no longer come down here and say with honesty: \nHere is what we are doing. Because what we are doing is not honest. And \nwhat the American people are saying with this is: Integrity matters, \nstraightforwardness matters, truth in budgeting and spending matters.\n  At least if we are going to do this, let's own up to what we are \ndoing. Let's not be dishonest with the American public about the \nnumbers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to start by thanking my friend, \nthe distinguished Senator from Maryland, as well as her counterpart in \nthe House, Chairman Rogers. They have shown great leadership in working \nacross the aisle to accomplish this mammoth task we had given them on a \nvery tight timeline, and I appreciate their efforts.\n  I am here today to talk about why it is important we pass this \nOmnibus appropriations bill and continue to build on the bipartisan \nsteps we have taken so far.\n  Last week I spoke at a press conference on youth unemployment with a \nyoung man who was present. His name was James. Listening to James, it \nwas pretty clear he was hard-working and ambitious. But he explained to \nme, as old as he is, in his twenties, he is still living at home with \nhis parents because despite a lot of searching he has not been able to \nfind a job.\n  What was clear to me from James' story and from a lot of others \nacross the country is that even though the economy has made progress, \nfar too many Americans still aren't feeling the benefits. Too many of \nthem are working more hours and earning less or wondering whether they \ncan afford to send their kids to college or worrying that they won't be \nable to save enough to retire. Those are the kinds of problems we need \nto be thinking about here and solving.\n  I hope our work this session, this year, will be entirely focused on \ndoing everything we can to create more jobs and more opportunities for \nall Americans, especially those who are struggling in what is still a \nvery tough economy. There is a lot we need to get done. If one lesson \ncame out of the constant crises last year, it is that in a divided \ngovernment the only way to get things done is through compromise and \nbipartisanship.\n  The budget deal Chairman Ryan and I worked together on and reached is \na good example. It wasn't the bill I would have written on my own. It \nwasn't the bill Chairman Ryan would have written on his own either. But \nafter hearing from families and communities in my home State of \nWashington, I knew we needed to do more to restore the critical \ninvestments that were being lost as a result of sequestration, and we \nneeded to break out of the constant crises which have caused so much \ngridlock and dysfunction over the last several years. So I worked with \nChairman Ryan to reach a compromise. I am\n\n[[Page S348]]\n\npleased that our agreement rolled back some of those automatic across-\nthe-board cuts to priorities important to all of us, such as education, \ninfrastructure, and research. We did that in a balanced way, without \nrelying on spending cuts alone.\n  Importantly, in reaching that deal we were able to lay some \ngroundwork so Chairman Mikulski and Chairman Rogers could move forward \non the important work of funding the government. Families and \ncommunities across the country will be better off as the result of \ntheir leadership. Their legislation invests in starting our children \noff strongly by expanding access to early Head Start for infants and \nfamilies. It expands access to Pell grants to help more of our young \nadults today afford higher education. It supports other important \npriorities such as medical research, which help create jobs and spur \ninnovation.\n  In my home State of Washington, I know all of these investments, as \nwell as others, such as funding for the Columbia River Crossing \nProject, for repairs and improvements at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, are \ngoing to make a huge difference.\n  I wish to spend a few moments as chair of the Subcommittee on \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development to talk about some of the \nimportant parts of that bill within this Omnibus.\n  That bill addresses critical challenges on everything from \nhomelessness, affordable housing, to traffic congestion, and \ntransportation safety. This bill represents a very firm commitment to \nproviding housing and supporting services to families in need. It \nactually increases funding for the section 8 program which provides \nhousing for our low-income families in this country. If funding had \nremained at the sequester level, more than 100,000 families today would \nbe at risk of losing that assistance and becoming homeless. Under our \nbill, that will not happen.\n  I am also very proud that the bill includes $75 million for vouchers \nfor the joint HUD-Veterans Affairs supportive housing program. As a \nresult of that funding, an additional 10,000 homeless veterans and \ntheir families will have access to housing and supportive services.\n  Our housing and transportation bill prioritizes job creation and \neconomic growth by investing in transportation. It includes $600 \nmillion in TIGER funding, which supports projects that improve \ntransportation safety and reduce traffic congestion. That, by the way, \nis in addition to the $41 billion in much-needed funding to repair our \nNation's roads and bridges.\n  But our bill isn't just about roads and bridges. Americans are \nincreasingly relying on public transit, so I am especially pleased our \nbill provides more than $10.7 billion to support our public transit \nsystem.\n  Also, last year across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration \nforced the Federal Aviation Administration to enact a hiring freeze, \nwhich meant when employees such as our air traffic controllers left the \nagency, no one was hired to replace them. So our bipartisan bill \nensures the FAA has the resources it needs to end that hiring freeze \nand hire and train new employees who can help our air travel be safe. \nThis bill fully funds the Essential Air Service and contract tower \nprograms on which so many of our communities depend.\n  We also include reforms to improve the programs we fund--for example, \nimportant section 8 reforms to reduce costs and create efficiencies.\n  In short, I am very pleased with what my colleagues and I in the \nSenate and House have been able to accomplish together on housing and \ntransportation investments in this bill. I wish to take a moment and \nespecially thank my colleague on the Senate transportation and housing \nappropriations bill, Senator Collins, for all of her great work and \nsupport during this entire process.\n  I am very proud to be part of the tireless effort of Chairwoman \nMikulski. She has worked very hard to make sure we have a full \nappropriations bill and act considered, and not just another continuing \nresolution.\n  Just like Chairman Ryan and I said when we finished our deal, I am \npretty sure Chairwoman Mikulski and Chairman Rogers would each agree \nthis package is not perfect. Each of them probably would have done \ncertainly different things on their own. But because they were willing \nto compromise, they are delivering far more for the American people \nthan either could have done if they had refused to work together.\n  If this legislation is passed into law--which I strongly believe it \nwill be--we will have a choice to make: We can build on the bipartisan \nwork which has been done so far and continue reaching agreements \nthrough compromises, as people across this country do every day, or we \ncan see more of the all-or-nothing approach which caused so much damage \nlast year.\n  I was in fact really disappointed that yesterday my colleagues \nrejected a good-faith offer to provide relief to workers and families \nwho are still struggling in this country to get back on their feet, \neven after Democrats time and time again offered compromises to try to \nget a deal. We tried hard to reach a fair agreement that both sides \ncould support, and we are going to keep trying. I hope today our \nRepublican colleagues will think of the many families out there who \nneed this lifeline and look at the great bipartisan work done on the \nappropriations bill, and I hope they will reconsider their return to \nall-or-nothing political tactics.\n  I know there are fundamental differences here between the two \nparties. I know compromise is never easy. But we can't afford to let \nthose challenges get in the way of delivering for the families and \ncommunities we serve. And we don't have to. The legislation Chairwoman \nMikulski and Chairman Rogers just completed is proof that there is a \nmuch better way to get things done. If both sides are willing to \ncontinue to make some tough choices, there is much more we can do \ntogether to create jobs, strengthen the recovery, and build the \nfoundation for stronger, broader growth in the future.\n  I thank Chairwoman Mikulski and Chairman Rogers again for their \nleadership. I hope we can all build on their bipartisan step forward by \nchoosing to work together, and find opportunities for compromise and \ncontinue to deliver for the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today I wish to stress the problems and \nimpact the President's legacy program, the Affordable Care Act--known \nas ObamaCare--is having on Kansans and, for that matter, patients and \npeople all over the country.\n  I know some of this has been repeated over and over. The problem is, \nit seems the administration continues to turn a blind eye, \nunfortunately, to some very egregious problems which plague the \nPresident's legacy program. Perhaps the title of my remarks should be \n``Promises Made and Promises Not Kept.''\n  When I travel home to Kansas and talk to people involved in the rural \nand urban health care delivery system, folks who came to the townhall \nmeetings because they were worried and concerned about ObamaCare to \nbegin with, that concern turned to frustration, then it turned to fear, \nand now it switched back into anger. They have said: What on Earth can \nwe do to solve some of these problems and these challenges which are \ndirectly affecting people in such an egregious way?\n  I think everybody now understands the rollout of the health care \nexchanges was a debacle. I think that is the favorite word of the \npeople writing and providing news about this. But the point is the \nadministration has failed to hold anyone at the Department of Health \nand Human Services accountable for the complete failure of the \nexchange, the waste of taxpayer dollars, and the confusion and \nheadaches this has caused. I know the only one who has been held \naccountable--or terminated, if you will, fired--was the current \ncontractor and they have hired a new contractor. There is news--which \nwe would have to confirm--that the new contractor was recently fired by \nthe National Health Service in Great Britain for being $2 billion over \non the contract. That doesn't bode well if we are going to actually fix \nthis Web site.\n  At the time of the rollout, the refrain was that ObamaCare is \ncertainly more than a Web site. Similar to Nancy Pelosi's words prior \nto passage, we were all told: Just wait and see. That is still what the \nrefrain is, with the presumption that things are going to work\n\n[[Page S349]]\n\nout, it will just take time, for the American people.\n  Unfortunately, what I and many of my colleagues have said is coming \ntrue and a lot of people back in Kansas have told me is coming true in \nwhat they are going through, and it is the polar opposite of what was \npromised by this President. Again, promises made, promises not kept.\n  Estimates are that over 5 million people have received cancellation \nof their health care policies and that is just in the 35 States for \nwhich we have estimates. So much for the promise, ``if you like your \nplan, you can keep it,'' which has been highly publicized.\n  The President proposed a so-called fix to this problem, which caused \ninsurance companies to scramble to delay things until after the midterm \nelection, and the only person in America for whom this was convenient \nwas the President. It is still not working.\n  What about the promise of less cost? A specific promise made by the \nPresident, of those people forced into the exchanges we continue to get \nreports--firsthand reports, I know, to everybody in the Senate and the \nHouse as well--reports that have received a lot of coverage with regard \nto the news media that the premiums are going up, not down, as promised \nby the President. There are reports of ObamaCare more than doubling \npeople's costs and increasing deductibles by sevenfold. I am not sure \nthat is the average, but that at least is a high one with regard to \nsome of the reports that are still coming in, obviously becoming then \nmore than people can afford.\n  It is no surprise that only 2.2 million have signed up, and 2 to 1 on \nthat goes to Medicaid as opposed to the new program, so one can see \nwhere we are headed with regard to Medicaid and some of the challenges \nthere. That is according to the recent estimates of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. That is far below what was expected.\n  Of those enrollees, only one-quarter of them are young and healthy \nindividuals, and that is a problem. Without younger and healthier \npeople in the exchanges to offset costs, we can only expect premiums to \nrise even higher. Once people are enrolled that is not the end of their \nproblems, however. Some folks in Kansas are reporting that when they go \nto the doctor, they only then discover they do not have the insurance \nthey thought they purchased. Some have had to cancel planned \nappointments with their doctors because their exchange coverage was not \nin order or could not be confirmed. In some of the worst cases, \npatients in the emergency room were forced between getting care they \ndesperately needed or leaving to avoid high costs when their coverage \ncould not be verified. That is exactly opposite of what the President \npromised--again, promises made and promises not kept.\n  Emergency rooms will face more problems in the future. Recent studies \nhave shown that instead of reducing emergency room utilization as the \nPresident promised, which has been identified as a crowning \nachievement, people with coverage are actually accessing the emergency \nroom more than their uninsured counterparts.\n  Some weeks ago I spoke about one of my favorite topics, in that as a \nmember of the HELP Committee and the Finance Committee, the amendments \nthat I had dealt with rationing and the worry of rationing with regard \nto the Affordable Health Care Act or at that time what was called \nPPACA, now referred to as ObamaCare or the Affordable Care Act, \ndepending on which side you are on.\n  These rationing boards represent some of the more frightening aspects \nof the law. I have always referred to them as the four rationers. I \nthink a colleague of mine, who is an expert on health care, actually \nsaid they are the ``Four Horsemen of the ObamaCare Apocalypse.''\n  Let me go down these four rationers. It gets involved, but patients \nand people worried about their health care coverage have every reason \nto worry about them.\n  First is the CMS Innovation Center. We know what that stands for, the \nCMS Innovation Center. That allows CMS to use taxpayer dollars to \ninvest in ways to reduce patient access to care that they may want. \nWhat this means for patients is the CMS has a new and expanded power \nover and above what they are already doing to cut payments to Medicare \nbeneficiaries, with the goal to reduce program expenditures but the \nreality being they will reduce patient access to health care, to their \ndoctor.\n  Second, rationing. The new authorities granted to the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force--that is a mouthful, USPSTF--I don't know how on \nEarth one would pronounce that acronym, but it is the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force. These folks are to determine what should and \nshould not be covered by health insurance. It is some unelected group \nof bureaucrats deciding what should and should not be covered by health \ninsurance. What this means for patients is that if the USPSTF, the \nmouthful acronym doesn't recommend it, then it will not be covered by \nyour health care plan and you will bear the cost of the procedure.\n  Here is the third rationing. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research \nInstitute, that is the PCORI, if you are discussing health care policy \nwith CMS or the Department of Health and Human Services, does \ncomparative effective research--comparative, effective research, CER.\n  To me, that is a slippery slope--that I tried to amend back during \nconsideration within the HELP Committee and the Finance Committee, \nunsuccessfully on a party-line vote--that will lead to the government \ndeciding whether the care or a treatment a patient wants is worth \npaying for. What this means for patients is that research could be \nabused to arbitrarily deny patients access to treatments or--and \ntreatments by age or by gender or by race--services to save the \ngovernment money.\n  If that was not enough, finally, the fourth horseman, there is \neveryone's nemesis, IPAB, the Independent Payment Advisory Board. We \ndon't want to saddle up on this horse. This is a board made up of 15 \nunelected bureaucrats who will decide what gets to stay, what gets to \ngo into Medicare coverage. We used to do that in this body and over in \nthe House. It was alleged during debate that we could not make those \ndecisions because we were too close to the people involved.\n  What is that all about? Isn't that what we are supposed to be doing \nin terms of representing the folks we represent? No, it has to go to \nthis 15-member unelected board that will decide what gets to stay and \nwhat gets to go in Medicare coverage.\n  They will decide what treatments and services will be covered and \nwhich will not. The primary reason is to save money. Goodness knows we \nare all for saving money in the health care system--or saving money \nperiod, given our national debt and all that involves. This Board has \nno accountability. There is no confirmation process; they are \nappointed. There is no real transparency and we cannot do anything \nabout it. I think the provision of the bill is we can say, wait a \nminute, they made the wrong decision on Medicare payments to hospitals \nor to any part of our health care delivery system, that we could by a \nsupermajority, 67 votes, maybe change it, maybe not.\n\n  I have been talking about the four rationers for a long time and what \nit means to patients. I will continue to talk about that. I will come \nto the floor after next week and see if we can't put this together in a \nlittle bit better way so people are alert to what is going on and \npeople are alert to what dangers lurk for them in regard to the \navailability of their doctor and their current way of treating \nthemselves and their family.\n  What is scary about this, as I watched all the other warnings and \nbroken promises come true, is what is going to happen to Kansas \nconstituents and those across the country when these new warnings about \nObamaCare continue to come true. The bottom line? We need to protect, \nwe truly need to protect the all-important relationship between the \ndoctor and the patient, which now is at risk.\n  In order to do that, it seems to me that small fixes are not going to \ndo this. We need to repeal and, most importantly, replace ObamaCare \nwith real reforms that work, not only for Kansans but everybody across \nthe country. The whole program needs to be repealed, replaced, \ndefunded, delayed, not just the parts that are politically convenient \nfor the President or the parts that have yet to be decided\n\n[[Page S350]]\n\nby the President as the Lizzy Borden ax falls in regard to those \ndecisions. I know Kansans and the American people certainly deserve \nbetter.\n  I am going to talk and talk about the four rationers again in more \ndetail. This only serves as a warning and an alert about promises made, \npromises not kept, but people have to understand who these four \nrationers are, what they intended to do, and what the dangers are and \nwhy amendments to prevent rationing were not successful in the \nbeginning when this bill was passed.\n  I yield the floor and it appears to me we do not have a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today the Gallup organization released a \nnew poll that asked the American people a simple question: What do you \nthink is the most important problem facing the country today? The \nresults should not shock anyone. Twenty-one percent of the American \npeople think the Federal Government is the problem. This is a quote \nfrom the poll: ``Dissatisfaction with government/Congress/politicians; \npoor leadership/corruption/abuse of power.''\n  Eighteen percent of the American people say the economy is the \nbiggest problem facing the country. So 21 percent say it is Washington \nand the Federal Government, and 18 percent say it is the economy.\n  I would point out that, not coincidentally, Politico has a story this \nmorning that highlights one of the sources of this dissatisfaction. It \ncites senior White House officials describing the Senate Democrats \nmeeting with the President at the White House this afternoon to talk \nabout their 2014 playbook, and some of it is going to be to cover the \nthemes the President is going to talk about at his State of the Union \nspeech. According to Politico, the aim is to highlight the differences \nwith the GOP and to provide fodder for the Democrats along the campaign \ntrail even though these measures stand little chance of passing in \nCongress.\n  There is nothing wrong with our Democratic friends having a \nphilosophical difference with the Republicans, or political \ndifferences, for that matter, and it is logical that there would be \ndifferent approaches to solving our Nation's problems. But this \ncalculated effort--starting at the White House with the President of \nthe United States having a team meeting with our Democratic friends to \nlook at how they can contrast their agenda with that of the \nRepublicans--strikes me as a shallow and cynical effort to distract \npeople from the fundamental problems which are facing our country.\n  We know the President has been in office 5 years now. The economic \nrecovery, after 2008, has been anemic. After the Federal Government has \npaid out almost $\\1/4\\ billion in deficit spending for unemployment \nbenefits on an extended basis, you would think the kind of meeting the \nPresident would want to have--not with just Democrats but with \nRepublicans--is to figure out what we can do together to deal with this \nanemic economic growth and get America back to work.\n  The President's promises about ObamaCare, one after another, have \nproven to be untrue. The statements he made about his health care \nplan--such as if you like what you have, you can keep it; the price of \nyour health care will go down an average of $2,500 a family; if you \nlike your doctor, you can keep your doctor--have not proven to be true. \nNone of it has proven to be true.\n  So why in the world can't we work together to try to address the \nproblems? The problem about lack of access to health care isn't going \nto go away, but it looks as though all of this has been put on the \nshelf in an effort to try to drive a wedge between Americans for no \nother reason than to shore up his political base leading up to the 2014 \nmidterm election. Why else would the President use his bully pulpit to \nstump for legislation that has no chance of passing in Congress?\n  This last exercise--actually a very sad exercise--started about a \nweek ago when the majority leader brought a bill to the floor that \nwould extend long-term unemployment benefits. It wasn't paid for. In \nother words, it would add $6 billion to the national debt, and it would \nbe for 3 months.\n  Well, on Monday of last week when we had a vote--the Presiding \nOfficer will remember we had a lot of bad weather--17 Senators were not \nable to be here for that vote. It was as if the majority leader \nintended to go forward knowing 17 Members of the Senate were not going \nto be here, because he really wanted the bill to fail, not to succeed. \nWell, I and others encouraged him to reconsider, and thankfully he did. \nSo we had that vote on Tuesday a week ago, and we got on the bill.\n  The President ought to be bringing Americans together, not pitting \nthem against one another. Of course, the President isn't the only one \nto blame for the people's dissatisfaction with government. I am sure \nthere is plenty of blame to go around, but Majority Leader Reid has to \naccept a major part of the responsibility for the dysfunction of the \nSenate and for the failure of the unemployment insurance extension \nbill.\n  Republicans, in an act of good faith, filed 36 amendments that we \nbelieve would have made that bill a better bill. The majority leader \nsaid, no, there will be no amendments, no votes. Take it or leave it. \nHe then came back later on and said: We will make these other changes, \nbut these are the only changes we are going to make, and we are not \ngoing to have an open amendment process and vote. So instead of \nallowing the Senate to function, the majority leader filled the \namendment tree and blocked every single Member of the Senate--Democrats \nand Republicans alike--from offering even the most reasonable \namendments.\n  Senator Coburn, for example--Senator Toomey was down here talking \nabout this today--had an amendment which would have ended unemployment \ncompensation for millionaires and billionaires. What could be more \ncommon sense than that? Why can't the Senate--Republicans and Democrats \nalike--come together to vote on such amendments? Well, you will have to \nask the majority leader about that because the Senate voted on a \nsimilar amendment in 2011 and voted 100 to 0, but the majority leader \nstill decided to block this amendment on this bill even though it would \nhave improved the integrity of the Unemployment Insurance Program.\n  Many other colleagues worked in good faith with the majority leader \nthrough the weekend to try to come up with another option. Senators \nCollins, Hatch, Inhofe, Paul, Scott, Thune, and Portman all filed \namendments which would have created jobs in a variety of ways and help \ngrow the economy. What better way to deal with the problem of \nunemployment than to help grow the economy and create jobs? The \nalternative seems to be: Let's just give them unemployment compensation \nand they will be happy. I daresay there are very few people who are \nunemployed who are happy accepting unemployment compensation. They \nwould much prefer the dignity and self-respect that comes along with \nworking if they could simply find a job to do.\n  Irrespective of this demonstration of good faith by Republicans to \ntry to improve the bill and help grow the economy and get people back \nto work, the majority leader's response was to block every single vote. \nHe instead chose politics over commonsense proposals that would help \nget Americans back to work.\n  I must say this is in stark contrast with what we have seen happening \nin the House of Representatives. This is a shocking figure, but the \nHouse of Representatives has passed 170 pieces of legislation--many of \nwhich deal with the poor growth of the economy and the need to create \njobs--that the majority leader has ignored. One hundred seventy pieces \nof legislation have passed the House. Basically all of them passed on a \nbipartisan basis, but the majority leader of the Senate has ignored \nthem.\n  These include the Northern Route Approval Act, which approves the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. By the way, the President said he would announce \nhis decision on whether to approve the connection of this pipeline \nwhich would connect the pipeline from Canada all the way down to Port \nArthur, TX,\n\n[[Page S351]]\n\nwhere refineries exist that would make this into gasoline and jet fuel \nand other byproducts.\n  The House passed a piece of legislation called the Keep the IRS Off \nYour Health Care Act, which prohibits the IRS from implementing \nObamaCare. I understand that is controversial. The majority leader \nwants to try to protect ObamaCare, with all of its flaws, which are \nbecoming apparent on a bipartisan basis.\n  Here is another one that should have enjoyed bipartisan support in \nthe Senate. It is something called the SKILLS Act, which eliminates and \nconsolidates Federal job training programs. There are over 40 different \njob training programs in the Federal Government. Can you imagine what \nmight happen if those programs were consolidated so the money that is \nnow used for overhead and administration could be used to actually \ntrain people and provide them the skills they need in order to qualify \nfor many high-paying jobs that go without trained workers? If Senator \nReid were serious about that, he would have taken up that bill and \nallowed Democrats and Republicans to improve it with their amendments. \nYet he refused to allow it to even be considered.\n  Then there is the REINS Act, which allows Congress to vote on major \nregulations that cost the economy over $100 million a year.\n  One big frustration back where I come from in Texas, when I go home \nevery weekend, is people ask: How come nobody seems to be held \naccountable? When things don't work, how come nobody gets fired? How \ncome Congress and the President kick the can down the road?\n  Well, of course, one of the biggest challenges we have when it comes \nto accountability is the regulatory state--the bureaucracy, the people \nwho are appointed by the President who have the authority to issue \nregulations. As the Presiding Officer knows, this isn't legislation \nthat people vote on. These are regulations that are promulgated by \nadministrative agencies. But when they have an impact of over $100 \nmillion on the economy a year, doesn't it make sense that Congress--the \nonly people the American people can hold accountable--would get a \nchance to actually vote on whether they should be approved and have a \ndiscussion on the cost-benefit analysis rather than have the regulatory \nagencies run amok and have litigation as our only recourse? Well, you \nget my point.\n  The majority leader has shut down every effort by the House of \nRepresentatives to pass legislation and have it come over here to the \nSenate to try to improve our anemic economic recovery since the great \nrecession of 2008. That is the reason economists say this is an \natypical, an unusual recovery from a recession, because usually it is \nkind of V-shaped. Once you hit bottom, you bounce back pretty quickly. \nWhat we have is a U-shaped recovery that is almost flat-lined with an \neconomic growth that is not fast enough to keep up with the population \nincrease. So not only do we have 7 percent or higher unemployment, we \nhave--at least for the last 30 years--a historically lower percentage \nof Americans actually participating in the workforce.\n  One of the reasons the unemployment figures are coming down is not \nnecessarily because the economy is getting that much better, but \nbecause people are giving up. They quit looking for work. That is an \nAmerican tragedy.\n  The House is acting not only to try to earn the American people's \ntrust and confidence but to get the government out of the way and to \nlet the private sector create more jobs.\n  Conversely, the Senate, under the iron rule--and some might say the \ndictatorship--of the majority leader, is neither afforded the \nopportunity to actually consider this legislation that has passed in \nthe House nor to offer amendments and improve legislation that is on \nthe floor of the Senate, such as the long-term unemployment insurance \nbill that was on the floor this last week. That is one reason why I \nthink Gallup says that 21 percent of the American people cite that as \nthe biggest problem facing the American people today: dissatisfaction \nwith government, poor leadership, and abuse of power. It doesn't have \nto be that way, and it won't be if the American people give our side of \nthe aisle the majority in November. It will be different.\n  I thought the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, gave a really \nimportant speech last week, saying if the voters give us the \nresponsibility for leading in the Senate, we will return the Senate to \nits prior reputation as the world's greatest deliberative body. Whether \na person is a Democrat or a Republican, whether I like an amendment or \nnot, we will all have an opportunity to offer our ideas, and we will \nhave a chance to vote them up or down. That is the way the Senate used \nto work. That is the way I think most Americans think it should work, \nand that is the way it will work if we are given that opportunity.\n  On the topic of the health care exchanges that opened on October 1 \nunder ObamaCare, we learned that the first reports about the \ncomposition of the pool of people who signed up for ObamaCare has \ncaused reasons for grave concern. The vast majority of people who \nsigned up under the exchanges are older and sicker. That, of course, is \ntheir right. But many young people--necessary to provide the actuarial \nstability and success of these exchanges--have chosen to take a pass. \nWe have asked for those numbers to be released on a weekly basis. As a \nmatter of fact, the House is going to take up a bill that will increase \ntransparency in these insurance exchanges so Congress and the American \npeople can be better informed about what is exactly happening with the \nimplementation of ObamaCare.\n  I remember 5 years ago I was out on the Capitol steps when the \nPresident, in his inaugural speech, told the American people--he said \nthese words: ``Transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones \nof this Presidency.'' Those are stirring words. As an advocate of open \ngovernment, transparent government, and freedom of information, I \nthought that was a very positive statement by the President. But, \ntoday, in light of what has happened since that time, they seem to be a \nbad joke.\n  ObamaCare is the most recent example. It has been 3\\1/2\\ months since \nthese Federal exchanges officially came online, and the administration \nstill won't provide the American people with reliable, detailed \ninformation on exchange enrollment numbers and the problems with the \nWeb site. I don't have any doubt that the Web site problems are going \nto be and have been substantially repaired. One problem the House has \npointed out is there is still no guarantee that if a person puts their \npersonal information into the Web site, that it will be protected \nagainst cyber attacks and identity theft--something that ought to \nconcern everybody. One would think that the majority leader was \nconcerned about that too, that he would give us a chance to vote on the \nlegislation that passed the House earlier this week.\n  In order to help Americans get better information about ObamaCare, \nSenator Alexander, the senior Senator from Tennessee, has introduced \nlegislation that would require the administration to provide weekly \nupdates on exchange enrollment and Medicaid enrollment, as well as Web \nsite problems and other issues. The cost of this legislation, according \nto the Congressional Budget Office, which is the gold standard when it \ncomes to scoring the cost of legislation, is zero. It is a big goose \negg. I am proud to be a cosponsor of that legislation. Unfortunately, \nthe White House has already issued a statement saying it would veto the \nlegislation if it passed because it would be ``too costly.'' The \nmajority leader and the President have been pursuing legislation this \nlast week that would have increased the deficit and the debt by $6 \nbillion, but they are unwilling to consider this transparency \nlegislation that would cost zero because they say it is too costly.\n  It is true the problems with ObamaCare go well beyond just a lack of \ntransparency, as we all know. For starters, the President continues to \ntreat ObamaCare as a law that means whatever he wants it to mean, \nwhenever it is convenient for him, because he continues to change the \nlaw by executive waiver. This is another common question I get back \nhome. People say: How can the President delay the employer mandate \nwhile the penalty against me as an individual--the individual mandate--\nremains the law of the land? How can he carve out or exempt certain \nparts of the population\n\n[[Page S352]]\n\nfrom the application of the law? How can he claim executive privilege \nwhen it comes to cooperating with oversight investigations by the \nCongress? How can he do all of these things in a country that is \nfounded on the rule of law and where no man and no woman is above the \nlaw, and no man and no woman is below the law? We are all entitled to \nequal protection of laws. How can the President choose which laws to \nenforce and which laws to ignore?\n  Sadly, I don't have a good answer for that. Congress has the \nauthority to pass the law, but the executive branch, under our \nConstitution, is the one that is supposed to enforce the law. But when \nthe executive branch refuses to enforce the law or ignores the law or \npurports to waive the law, there isn't a lot of recourse, other than \nprivate litigation which takes months and years to conclude. From my \nperspective, these waivers reflect an utter disregard for the \nconstitutional duties of the executive branch of government. If the \nPresident feels as though certain aspects of ObamaCare have become \nunworkable, it is his duty to come to Congress and say: Work with me to \nchange it. But he refuses to do that. I think some of the most popular \nwords out of his mouth are: I will go it alone. I will issue an \nExecutive order. I will ignore Congress and the constitutional coequal \nbranches of government, and I will do it alone.\n  The President knows just how unpopular his signature legislative \nachievement, ObamaCare, has become, even among many Democrats. I talked \nabout accountability a little earlier. Many Democrats who walked the \nplank with him on ObamaCare and actually believed and, indeed, repeated \nthe promises he himself made about how the law would work are going to \nbe up for election in 2014. He won't be on the ballot. He has been \nthrough his last election. There is no way to hold President Obama \naccountable for his broken promises on ObamaCare. But there is a way to \nhold the people who supported the President accountable and who \nrepeated statements which have proven to be false about how ObamaCare \nwould work. But if the President feels as though the law isn't working \nthe way it should or if our Democratic colleagues feel as though--\nnotwithstanding their hopes and their aspirations for how it might \nwork--it didn't turn out that way, then what we ought to be doing is \nworking together in order to fix the problem, not perpetuate it.\n\n  We know the President is acting as if he is above the law. He is \nacting as if he can selectively enforce the law based on political \nexpediency. I don't think it is an exaggeration to say that this \nbehavior is undermining our democracy and making the American people \neven more cynical about Washington, DC. Again, I don't think it is any \ncoincidence that the Gallup poll cites the government as the single \nbiggest problem in America today, according to the people polled in \nthis Gallup poll published January 15, 2014.\n  This administration was supposed to be defined by transparency and \nthe rule of law. That is not what I said; those aren't my words. Those \nare the President's words. In reality, it has become an administration \ndefined by obstruction, deception, and partisan power grabs, and that \nis a sad development. One of these power grabs, of course, is ObamaCare \nitself, which passed on a party-line vote in 2010. But, amazingly, it \nwasn't really implemented until 2013, starting in October, and people \nare just now beginning to see what ObamaCare is really like.\n  We know, as a historical fact, that it was muscled through on a \nparty-line vote, despite major public opposition. Thus far, it has been \na complete disaster on just about every level. First, the \nadministration wanted us to believe it was all about the Web site: Yes, \nwe have a bad Web site contractor, but we are going to fix it. These \nare glitches that can be repaired, and everything will turn out just \nfine.\n  But the reality is far different. Much of the regulatory confusion \nsurrounding the President's health care law is a result of conscious \ndecisions and politically motivated delays.\n  People don't have to take my word for it. The Washington Post \nreported last month that the White House ``systematically delayed''--\nthose are their words--``key provisions of ObamaCare''--and this again \nis another quote from the Washington Post--``to prevent them from \nbecoming points of contention before the 2012 election.''\n  There was a conscious decision to delay the implementation of \nObamaCare until after the President ran for reelection, and now we have \nseen many aspects of ObamaCare unilaterally delayed until after the \n2014 midterm elections.\n  What about accountability? While the White House is trumpeting a \nrecent increase in signups for ObamaCare--as I said, they are unwilling \nto release on a real-time basis what the facts are--the number of \nsignups is still dwarfed by the number of people who have had their \nhealth coverage canceled because of ObamaCare. If we look back to 2010, \nit was the very regulation that would result in the estimate by the \nCongressional Budget Office that tens of millions of Americans would \nlose their existing coverage under ObamaCare, primarily because of the \nmandate in terms of the coverage.\n  For example, a person has grandparents who are required to buy health \ninsurance that includes maternity coverage they don't need and they \ndon't want, so why should they have to pay for it? Well, because \nObamaCare says they have to. Why should young people have to pay more \nfor their health insurance when it doesn't really cost that much for \nthem to get the medical care they need? Because they have to subsidize \nthe older generation.\n  Perhaps no one other than the President has maneuvered more to cover \nup ObamaCare's shortfalls than the person at the head of the Department \nof Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius. My colleagues will \nrecall that back in 2010, Secretary Sebelius threatened to ban certain \ninsurance providers from ObamaCare if they communicated with their own \ncustomers. They wanted to tell their customers what would happen to \ntheir existing insurance coverage if this law passed, and they were \nthreatened by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who said: If \nyou communicate with your own customers, you are going to be punished.\n  Last year, it came out that Secretary Sebelius later on was shaking \ndown private insurance companies to help fund ObamaCare's \nimplementation. For that matter, when Americans began to lose their \nexisting coverage because of ObamaCare regulations, the President \ninitially blamed it on what he called ``bad apple insurers,'' even \nthough this administration knew years ago that the law would force \nmillions of people to forfeit their existing coverage. Yet the \nPresident--I think it was almost 30 times; certainly more than 20 \ntimes--said: ``If you like what you have, you can keep it.'' But he \nsaid that knowing that tens of millions of Americans would lose their \nexisting coverage, and many of them would lose the ability to continue \nto be treated by a doctor of their own choosing because they would no \nlonger be part of their plan.\n\n  I submit that what I have just recited has contributed a lot to this \npoll which has said people think government is the biggest problem \nfacing the country today. I have just a few final thoughts--I see the \nSenator from Missouri here--before I yield the floor.\n  I conclude by saying that the core conceit of ObamaCare, indeed, the \nmost offensive part of it, is that the folks who supported it--from the \nPresident to those who voted it into law--understand that the health \ninsurance needs of individuals are better decided by those individuals \nand their families and the doctor they trust. But as a result of this \narrogance, millions of health plans have been canceled, and millions \nmore will be in the future. The premiums and the cost of health care \ncoverage have skyrocketed, together with huge deductibles, which \nessentially would leave people self-insured. Many people have been \nforced into ObamaCare plans that have $5,000 deductibles. So for all \npractical purposes, people are self-insured.\n  We know that health care providers have also been forced to deal with \nenormous uncertainty. I hear it every day from the physicians and \nhospitals and health care providers in Texas.\n  We also know that America's already weak recovery has been made even \nweaker. As I said earlier, historically, a rebound after a recession is \nsort of V-shaped. After you hit the bottom, you bounce back, and you \nget a spurt of economic growth. But not this time, not with the \nObamaCare recovery or lack thereof.\n\n[[Page S353]]\n\n  The National Bureau of Economic Research has said that ObamaCare may \neventually ``cause substantial declines in . . . employment,'' and that \nseems very intuitive in what we are seeing happening today.\n  It did not have to turn out this way. How was ObamaCare sold to the \nAmerican people? Well, under false pretenses. We know that because 90 \npercent of people polled said they liked their current coverage. That \nis why the President said: If you like what you have, you can keep it--\nwhich has proven to be false. But the premise of ObamaCare was \neverybody gets covered. But even under the Congressional Budget Office \nestimate, ObamaCare will leave 31 million people uninsured by 2023. So \nnot even the underlying premise of universal coverage under ObamaCare \nis true.\n  Republicans believe that expanding health care choice and health care \nportability are important ways to reduce costs across the board, and \nreally the reason why people are uninsured is because they cannot \nafford it. We need to bring down the cost, not to raise the cost, which \nhas happened under ObamaCare.\n  I believe, and I believe my colleagues believe, that by adopting \nsensible, targeted reforms--not to undermine the coverage for 90 \npercent of the people who like what they have but to deal with the 10 \npercent who do not like what they have or do not have coverage they can \nafford--we need those kinds of targeted reforms to help the uninsured \nand help those with preexisting conditions, without disrupting everyone \nelse's existing coverage, without throwing out the baby with the bath \nwater.\n  We believe families understand better than the bureaucracy what the \nhealth care needs are in each family. If given the opportunity, we will \nstart over, once ObamaCare collapses of its own weight or when finally \nthere is a universal recognition in the halls of Congress that we have \nto start over and do better, but do it better by replacing ObamaCare \nwith patient-centered reforms that I know the American people want and \nthey deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to follow right along with what my \ngood friend, the Senator from Texas, was talking about.\n  First, I would like to say, I think one of the philosophies of \ngovernment was so well stated in such a succinct way by Abraham Lincoln \nat Cooper Union in New York in 1860 when he said: Government should do \nfor people only those things that people cannot better do for \nthemselves.\n  There are some things in health care that government actually could \ndo to then let people do things better for themselves. That is why our \nside, beginning in 2009--and before that--advocated things like buying \nacross State lines, a bigger marketplace. Organize a marketplace. Do \nnot try to operate a system. Do not try to create an environment where \npeople cannot make decisions about what they want and somehow that we \nthink the government can make those decisions better.\n  As the Senator from Texas said, we all talk to people every day who \nhad coverage they were happy with that met their needs, and now they \nare told by the government: Your new coverage is better. It does not \nmatter if you do not have any children, you have pediatric dental care. \nIt does not matter if you are retired and plan not to have children, \nyou now have maternity coverage. It does not matter if you have always \nhad insurance, this covers people with preexisting conditions.\n  The American people have figured this out, and they do not like it. \nThe system we had at the workplace-based insurance was largely a system \nthat developed by accident after World War II, but, interestingly, 85 \npercent of the people who had insurance, got it at work, and 90 percent \nof them were happy with it. I think that is going to be the next thing \nwe find out as we walk down the road: how many people are no longer \ngoing to get their insurance at work.\n  But now we know the impact on people who generally did not have \ninsurance at work or have insurance for the first time. I have some \nstories I want to share from people who have contacted our office in \nthe last few days, and that is since I was here a week ago to talk \nabout some stories I had then from people who were telling me.\n  Just earlier today--additional anecdotal evidence--I heard from \nsomebody who, at age 27, left their family policy to get their own, \nfirst insurance policy ever, with the biggest insurance company in the \ncountry. They went to the doctor they had always gone to, and the \nreceptionist, the people dealing with her, said: We don't take that \ninsurance here anymore. Then her request was: Well, I want to see the \ndoctor I have always seen. Can I just pay cash? The answer was: No, you \ncan't pay cash because we now know you have insurance. Under the new \nFederal requirements, you cannot pay cash to see the doctor you want to \nsee; you have to go somewhere that will take your insurance.\n  Surely that is not what we all really intended to do. Those people \nhere who voted against the bill, even those who voted for the bill, \neven those who, like me, spoke against it, would not have anticipated \nthat one of the prohibitions would be that you could not pay cash to \nsee the doctor you want to see because you find out that your insurance \ndoes not cover your doctor. This is actually a step beyond: If you like \nyour doctor, you can keep your doctor. This goes to: If you like your \ndoctor, you cannot even pay your doctor to see your doctor, if the \npolicies available to you did not let you see your doctor.\n  But here are some letters I got just this week and some email \nmessages and some text messages, but all from Missourians. Even though \nI am not going to give anybody's last name, these happen to be all \nMissourians whom I think my staff has called and asked: Do you mind if \nwe tell your story, just in case your neighbor figures out this must be \nyou if you are, for example, Christina from Lee's Summit, MO.\n  Christina says she is a single mother of two. She is working her way \nthrough school as a waitress, working 25 hours a week. She previously \nreceived insurance through her employer, but she was not allowed to \nrenew that plan, and now the cost of her daughter's deductible will go \nup from $100 a year to $2,500 a year--a 2,500 percent increase.\n  As the Senator from Texas said earlier, some of these deductibles for \nmost families are like you do not have insurance at all. I do not know \nwhat Christina's situation is, but I know somewhere there is a 25-hour-\na-week waitress with two kids where if they are told their deductible \nis $2,500, that means they really do not have any coverage because they \ndo not have $2,500, and they are not going to figure out how to get \n$2,500, and they cannot get insurance that makes that difference.\n  Jeanna from Kansas City has a birth defect that eventually resulted \nin her having to have a hip replacement and hip revision. She has had \nhealth insurance every year of her life until this year. Her previous \nBlue Cross Blue Shield policy is no longer available, and policies on \nthe exchange are just too expensive.\n  She says:\n\n       At this rate, we won't be able to afford health insurance \n     in our current situation. I want to go back to the old \n     system! At least I know I have insurance and that I have my \n     doctors too. My primary doctor retired due to Obamacare.\n\n  She says:\n\n       I've always had health insurance for me and my family. \n     After 2014 I won't.\n\n  I wish that was an unusual letter, but it is not. Surely, there have \nto be people benefiting from this system. Just the law of averages \nwould catch up with you. Somebody has to be having coverage they did \nnot have before. Maybe they could not get in the State high-risk pool. \nBy the way, we could have expanded those. That was one of the proposals \nI made for people who had a preexisting condition.\n  The biggest challenge to reality, I think, of this whole debate has \nbeen that nobody else had any other ideas, that this was the only set \nof ideas out there. I brought a list to the floor the other day of the \n10 or 12 bills I introduced as a House Member. The biggest one was 75 \npages long. One that, according to Senator Harry Reid, the majority \nleader, has accounted for a third of the people who went on insurance \nbecause they were able to join their family's policy--I introduced that \nbill in the House. It was 4\\1/2\\ pages. I guess if I had been really \ngood at this--and that was a third of the people on\n\n[[Page S354]]\n\ninsurance--I could have come up with a bill that was about 12 or 13 \npages, and we would have gotten everybody. We did not need 2,700 pages \nof legislation, if 4\\1/2\\ pages get a third of the people who are now \ncovered.\n  Mitchell in Weston, MO, said he still has insurance. His premiums \nwill go up over $40 a month. Frankly, that is one of the better stories \nI have had--somebody who still has insurance, and it is $40 a month \nhigher. But he says:\n\n       This ObamaCare is not the answer for Americans with [or \n     without] health care insurance. This is a national problem \n     now.\n\n  He says:\n\n       My health insurance is going up only $40.00 a month \n     starting [in] January. But that is still $120.00 a week for \n     my wife and me.\n\n  He says:\n\n       Most of my friends' insurance rates are going up $100.00 \n     and more a week.\n\n  I do not know if that is a scientific survey, but that is Mitchell's \nview of what is happening with most of his friends.\n  Toney is a former owner of a hardware store. When he closed his \nstore, he was not able to find insurance. Toney is from West Plains, \nMO.\n  He enrolled in the Missouri State Health Insurance Pool, the high-\nrisk pool. But when it was terminated, he was told to enroll in the \nFederal health exchange. I think he has finally gotten that done. He \njust says it happens to cost him more than it cost him before. \nRemember, the high-risk pool--here is what Toney says in his letter:\n\n       When national health care became available the \n     legislature--\n\n  This would be the Missouri legislature; I think this is what happened \nin most States--\n\n     voted to end the [Missouri High-Risk Pool] effective Dec. 31, \n     2013 and sent me a letter saying I should enroll in the \n     Federal program. I began on the web site the first week in \n     October and made some attempt to enroll every day thru \n     October and November. I was finally successful in accessing \n     the policy plans available just before December 1st.\n\n  Here is another point I want to make too. The rollout itself has had \nnegative consequences on the makeup of people who have insurance. I \nthink there are many reasons why young, healthy people will decide not \nto buy insurance. One is that it costs them relatively more than it \never has before under the law.\n  In December, in fact, if you were in your early twenties, you were \npaying about one-fifth of what someone was paying for health insurance \nin their early sixties. But in January, you had to pay at least one-\nthird of what somebody was paying in their early sixties. People's \ninsurance in their early sixties did not go down, but people's \ninsurance in their early twenties went up. I just had a dad today tell \nme--and besides that, you tell young people--and you can get insurance \nif you have a serious health care problem because there is no \nprohibition if you have preexisting conditions.\n  So if you are a young person, your insurance--this is the most \nuninsured group: young healthy people who think they are young and \nhealthy and probably do not need insurance because they are young and \nhealthy, who should worry about an accident. I mean, I am a dad. I \nunderstand how you have these discussions: Now, wait a minute. That \ndoes not cover all of your potential problems.\n  But still, this is the biggest uninsured group. They are not signing \nup, and part of why they are not signing up--one of the smaller \nreasons, there are fundamental problems with the plan itself. But \nbelieve me, if you are wondering if you should get insurance every day, \nyou are not going to do what Toney did. You are not going to be on the \nWeb site every single day from October 1 until December 1 until you get \ninsurance. At some point you are going to say: Well, I did not really \nthink I needed this anyway. I am not going to keep beating my head \nagainst the wall to sign up for something that all of my friends tell \nme is a bad deal, and for sure is a worse deal than I would have gotten \nin December of last year because the law insisted it be a worse deal \nfor young, healthy people.\n  The White House said last week that the number of people signing up--\nwhen they were challenged about the number of people signing up was not \nnearly enough, they said--well, I think the White House spokesman said: \nIt is not the number of people; it is the mix of people that matters. I \nthink the number they had out there is about 40 percent of the people \nwho sign up need to be under 35 and hopefully healthy. That number is \nabout 25 percent. So the mix is not working. The number is not working. \nThe cost is not working.\n  According to Shawn from Independence, his premiums for his private \npolicy went up 40 percent. If he elected to drop his private policy and \nsign up on the exchange, according to him his premiums and deductibles \nwould more than double, and he would not qualify for any subsidies. So \nfor Shawn the best deal was the 40-percent increase. He had a more than \n100-percent increase if he went to the exchange and higher deductibles.\n  Lynn from Farmington, MO, says that at Mineral Area Regional Medical \nCenter premiums increased even more than usual due to the Affordable \nCare Act requirements. We have increased the employee's portion of the \nhealth insurance premium in order to increase deductibles and copays \ndue to the ACA-required new coverage that every plan has to include.\n  Barbara at Fulton, MO--Winston Churchill gave the famous ``Iron \nCurtain'' speech at Westminster College in Fulton--says: Her husband's \nBlue Cross Blue Shield plan was canceled because it was deemed \n``illegal'' per the Affordable Care Act.\n  Her family--her husband and two daughters--is now paying more money \nfor health insurance.\n\n       My husband had insurance that he liked, and then we \n     received a letter from Blue Cross Blue Shield that his plan \n     was going to be discontinued due to requirements of the \n     Affordable Care Act.\n\n  They were disappointed.\n\n       I was also told that my 4-year-old child should apply for \n     state Medicaid and my 9-year-old child earned too much to \n     qualify for insurance through healthcare.gov.\n\n  They qualify for neither of those programs, she says.\n\n       Because of ObamaCare, we, as a family, are paying much more \n     for health insurance for our children and my husband is not \n     currently fully insured.\n\n  My last letter is from Scott in Independence, MO, who says his \nemployer dropped his retiree health plan for 2014 due to increased \ncosts associated with the ACA.\n  I do not see here who his employer was. But we have seen big \nemployers--IBM dropped their retiree health plan. UPS dropped their \nhealth care insurance for all of the spouses and dependents of their \nemployees, in both cases saying: Well, now you have somewhere to go. \nYou need to go to the exchange rather than the plan you had as part of \nbeing a retiree or part of being a spouse of someone who worked here.\n  Scott looked at plans on the exchange. For a plan that is worse than \nwhat he had under his employer, he will pay 280 percent more in \npremiums, and his out-of-pocket expenses--guess that means \ndeductibles--will quadruple; four times the deductibles, 280 percent \nfor the premiums.\n  He says--let me read one other thing here. He talks about being a \ndisabled veteran.\n\n       Since I am also a disabled veteran and exempt from the ACA, \n     I went to see what my cost would be for a policy for just my \n     9-year-old daughter. Unfortunately, I cannot enroll her \n     unless I enroll. So my costs will go from $159 dollars for a \n     Cadillac policy, to $459 per month for--\n\n  His description.\n\n     a horrible ACA policy this year. Essentially I was forced to \n     buy a policy I neither want or need. It will cost me far more \n     and provide far less than my cancelled employer plan.\n\n  Bigger marketplace with more choices, more ways to ensure you can \ntake your insurance from one place of work to another, more ways to \nensure that expanded high-risk pools would let people join those high-\nrisk pools. By the way, if you are an insurance company, you have to \nparticipate in that in some way, at least you know that all of the \nother insurance companies are, too, and everybody in that group is \nsomebody who had a preexisting condition as opposed to having to assume \nyou are going to get less healthy people than hopefully you get.\n  I would just say that everybody in this country and everybody in the \nCongress knows more about health care than most people did 5 years ago. \nI think it would be a good time for us to take all of that new \nknowledge about health care and see if we can look at this again and do \na better job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n[[Page S355]]\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for about 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am back now for the 55th time that \nthe Senate has been in session, each week, to urge my colleagues to \nwake up to the toll that carbon pollution is taking on our atmosphere, \non our oceans, and on our people.\n  While climate change deniers continue to gin up phony doubt to \nmislead the public, top American businesses and corporations recognize \nthe risks posed by climate change. They are preparing for the economic \nfallout. Members of Congress bury their heads in the sand like the \nproverbial ostrich, hoping the issue will go away, wondering in some \ncases recently whether the recent cold front disproved decades of \nresearch and an overwhelming scientific consensus.\n  Business leaders in the real world, not the political world, not the \npolluter-paid, phony-doubt world, business leaders in the real world \nare doing what they do best; that is, taking steps to protect their \nbottom line and maintain their relationships with their customers.\n  Major corporations, even those with large carbon footprints, are \ntaking voluntary action to lower their own carbon output. Some are \njoining broader efforts to support policies that reduce carbon \nemissions. Some of our largest and most sophisticated companies are \neven factoring the economic burden of climate change in their own \naccounting and their own long-term planning by--guess what--assigning \nan internal price to carbon.\n  The Bicameral Task Force on Climate Change, which I lead with \nCongressman Waxman, wrote to over 300 businesses and organizations \nseeking their views on actions the Federal Government could take to \nreduce carbon pollution and to strengthen our resiliency to climate \nchange. The response from the business community was very encouraging. \nSome examples: Coca-Cola, headquartered in Georgia, wrote this:\n\n       We recognize climate change is a critical challenge facing \n     our planet with potential impacts on biodiversity, water \n     resources, public health and agriculture. Beyond the effects \n     on the communities we serve, we view climate change as a \n     potential business risk, understanding that it could likely \n     have direct and indirect effects on our business.\n\n  That is Coca-Cola. Texas- and Maryland-based Lockheed Martin told the \ntask force of the major headway it has made in reducing its greenhouse \ngas emissions. I will quote from Lockheed Martin:\n\n       From 2007 through 2011, Lockheed Martin reduced its \n     absolute carbon emissions by 30 percent, and continues to \n     focus on carbon emission reductions by championing energy \n     conservation and efficiency measures in our facilities.\n\n  Lockheed Martin. Let's look at Walmart, founded and headquartered in \nArkansas. Walmart wrote:\n\n       We are committed to reducing our carbon footprint and we \n     are working with our suppliers to do the same.\n\n  Indeed, I met yesterday with the general counsel from Apple, doing \nexactly the same thing, working to reduce their carbon footprint, \nworking with their suppliers to push for reductions on the part of \ntheir suppliers.\n  Walmart's 2009 sustainability report shows its longstanding \ncommitment to fighting climate change. Here is what Walmart said:\n\n       Climate change may not cause hurricanes, but warmer ocean \n     water can make them more powerful. Climate change may not \n     cause rainfall, but it can increase the frequency and \n     severity of heavy flooding. Climate change may not cause \n     droughts, but it can make droughts longer. Every company has \n     a responsibility to reduce greenhouse gases as quickly as it \n     can.\n\n  That is Walmart.\n\n       That is why we are working in a number of areas to reduce \n     our company's carbon footprint, and also working with our \n     suppliers and customers to help them do the same. Currently \n     we are investing in renewable energy, increasing energy \n     efficiency in our buildings and trucks, working with \n     suppliers to take carbon out of products, and supporting \n     legislation in the U.S. to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n  That is Walmart. I also wish to commend the Walmart family foundation \nfor the work they are doing on oceans as well as on the atmospheric \naspects of carbon. Let's look at Mars, the Virginia-based candy \ncompany. Mars states:\n\n       We are committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions \n     in absolute terms because this is the right thing to do. As \n     climate change has implications for the production of \n     agricultural ingredients, addressing it requires changes to \n     the way we source materials and manufacture our products.\n\n  Mars, maker of the famous Mars bars and M North Carolina's VF \nCorporation, which makes major apparel brands such as Lee and Wrangler, \nNautica, and North Face says this:\n\n       We seek to conduct our business with the highest levels of \n     honesty, integrity and respect. These values are embedded in \n     our approach to sustainability, which reflects our commitment \n     to operating our business so future generations can live with \n     cleaner water and air, healthier forests and oceans and a \n     stable climate.\n\n  Toy maker Hasbro, from my home State of Rhode Island, has issued its \nenergy pledge:\n\n       Climate change mitigation is a pressing global issue and we \n     aim to reduce our corporate carbon footprint by improving \n     energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions at \n     our sites.\n\n  Hasbro was awarded a Climate Leadership Award by the EPA in 2012 for \nexcellence in greenhouse gas management.\n  These companies and their products are household names in this \ncountry. They are major players in the American economy.\n  Lockheed Martin had annual revenue in 2012 of over $47 billion. We \ntrust them with some of our most important defense contracts. Coke \ntopped $48 billion and may be the most recognizable corporate franchise \nin the world. Walmart is the world's second largest company, with 2012 \nrevenue of more than $443 billion.\n  These are serious companies, they are serious about their products, \nand they are serious about their returns. In part, they earn their \nimpressive returns by being serious about science, and they understand \nthe harm carbon-driven climate change causes. They see the unfair \nadvantage big polluters get when those big polluters don't have to \nfactor the costs of their carbon pollution into the price of the coal \nor oil.\n  That is why more and more leading businesses are calling on Congress \nto wake up and set new ground rules to even the energy playing field. \nMars and VF Corporation, along with eBay, Gap, Levi's, Nike, Starbucks, \nand other name-brand American corporations, are members of the Business \nfor Innovative Climate & Energy Policy coalition--BICEP--which is \npushing for energy policies that will draw down carbon emissions and \nboost economic growth. BICEP is only one of the impressive initiatives \norganized by Ceres, a nonprofit organization that helps to mobilize \ninvestors and business leaders to build a sustainable global economy. \nIf we in Congress are willing to take on the special interests, the \npolluting special interests that keep Congress barricaded, BICEP member \ncompanies and others will have our back.\n  What we need to do is to price carbon properly, to get a right price \nfor carbon. That means making the big carbon polluters pay a fee to the \nAmerican people to cover the cost of dumping their waste into our \natmosphere and oceans. That is a cost they now happily push off onto \nthe rest of us.\n  Because of the political control of the polluters over Congress, \nconditions do not presently allow us to price carbon. So Senator Boxer \nand those in our new Senate Climate Action Task Force are pushing to \nchange those political conditions. While we are doing that--and we will \ndo that because we have the public, the facts, the science, and the \nimperative, both moral and practical, on our side--while we are doing \nthat, these big, name-brand American companies have begun to assess \ntheir own internal prices on carbon.\n  A recent report by the Climate Disclosure Project, which gauges \ncarbon emissions and energy usage of major corporations, has identified \n29 large companies that use internal carbon prices in their operations \nor their long-term planning. Some of those companies price carbon to \ndrive energy efficiency. Others see it as a smart way to prepare their \nbusiness practices for the likelihood of a national American carbon \nfee. Among those companies are some of the world's largest oil and gas \ncompanies, as well as major energy consumers. For example, ExxonMobil\n\n[[Page S356]]\n\nestimates that a price of $60 per metric ton of carbon dioxide will be \nassessed on carbon by 2030. BP's figure is $40, and Devon Energy's is \n$15. Some of the biggest carbon emitters in history are preparing for a \nprice on carbon. Let that sink in for a second. The emitters have \nalready baked into their planning a price on carbon--among other \nreasons, because they know it is the right outcome.\n  Who else is using internal carbon pricing? Well, Google assesses an \ninternal carbon fee of $14 per metric ton that it uses to invest in \ngreen initiatives.\n  Likewise, Microsoft charges each of its organizational divisions a \nquarterly carbon neutral fee of $6 to $7 per metric ton. The revenue \nfrom those divisions from that carbon fee goes--very similar to \nGoogle--to a central fund to support carbon offset projects. Microsoft \neven published a carbon fee playbook as a guide for businesses looking \nto establish their own internal carbon fees.\n  The Walt Disney Company--talk about a nameplate company--charges its \nsubsidiary businesses a carbon fee based on their share of the \ncompany's overall footprint.\n  According to a company statement:\n\n       The higher the carbon footprint, the more they pay. We have \n     built this into our capital planning process as well, so \n     businesses have to take the price of carbon into account \n     while planning new projects. The additional operational cost \n     has started to incentivize businesses to seek methods to \n     reduce their impact.\n\n  Walmart ran the numbers assuming an economy-wide carbon fee of $18 \nper ton. The company finds that ``Walmart's early action on emission \nreductions represents a competitive advantage over other retailers that \nhave not performed such projects.''\n  Investors, who are behind a lot of these companies, are also voicing \nconcerns about the exposure of their portfolios to the effects of \nclimate change, and they are pushing for climate action. The Carbon \nAsset Risk Initiative--also coordinated by Ceres--is a coalition of 70 \ninvestors worth nearly $3 trillion. They have pressured 45 of the \nworld's top fossil fuel companies to disclose the climate risks facing \ntheir investments in those companies. Should the oil and gas interests \nprove, shall we say, evasive in answering, well, investors may soon \nhave other resources at hand to evaluate the climate risk to their \nportfolios. Bloomberg News, for example, has developed for its readers \nthe Bloomberg Carbon Risk Valuation Tool--a model which can describe \nthe potential effect of carbon regulations on fossil fuel company \nearnings and share price.\n  Investors and corporate executives take climate change seriously \nbecause of how they see it will hurt the bottom line and because of how \nit will affect their relationship with their customers. They get it. \nBig nameplate American corporations get it--unlike this building, this \ninstitution and the one down the hall, the Senate of the United States \nand the House of Representatives, which remain under the control and \nthrall of the polluting interests and won't take action like these big \nnameplate American corporations already have.\n  We can work with these big corporations. We have to work with them to \nbreak the campaign of polluter-paid denial that has Congress \nbarricaded. That campaign of denial is as poisonous to our democracy as \nthe underlying carbon pollution is to our atmosphere and oceans. We \nneed to clean up both of them. We need a democracy that is clean of \npolluter-paid denial, and we need an atmosphere and oceans that are \nclean of polluter-emitted carbon.\n  It is time to push back on the misleading propaganda of the \npolluters. It is time to recognize that our allies are out there to \nwork with us. It is time for us to wake up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                          U.S. Energy Exports\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I had an opportunity early last week to \ngive a speech at the Brookings Institution about the significant \nopportunity of the United States when it comes to energy production and \nour opportunity as a nation to expand our energy trade.\n  I was able to present this speech based on a white paper I have \nrecently released. It is entitled ``A Signal to the World: Renovating \nthe Architecture of U.S. Energy Exports.'' This builds on a document \nthat I presented to this body, to my colleagues, to folks who care \nabout any aspect of what is going on within the energy industry within \nour country and our energy opportunities. It is a document that I \nentitled ``Energy 20/20.'' It is 115 pages of not legislation but \nreally concepts, discussion points, areas where I think we as a nation \nhave an opportunity to lead when it comes to our energy potential.\n  When we talk about energy in our country, it is very easy to talk \nabout kind of ``all of the above.'' I did make a very concerted effort \nto address all forms of energy we in this country are blessed to have, \nwhether it is our traditional fossil fuels, our oil, our natural gas, \nour coal resources, whether it is the enormous potential we have with \nour renewable fuel sources such as wind, solar, geothermal, ocean \nenergy, marine hydrokinetic, our hydropower, the opportunities that \npresent themselves with our biofuels, and the importance, the great \nsignificance of nuclear within our energy portfolio.\n  I didn't want that document to only be yet another document that \nsomebody produces and other good ideas that are thrown out there to \njust founder. I have been working to present a series of these white \npapers. I had an opportunity to present one several months back on \nnatural gas. This week it is a paper on the architecture of U.S. energy \nexports. In several weeks I plan on introducing yet another.\n  I come to the floor this afternoon to share my thoughts on energy \nexports with the Senate--all energy exports--and to enter my \nrecommendations on this important subject into the Congressional \nRecord. My point, again, is not to trot out legislation in one area or \nanother but as a nation to have us focus on our energy potential--all \nof our energy potential--and our opportunity to utilize this energy \npotential to share this amazing wealth we have, whether it is within \nour traditional fuels or whether it is within our renewables or our \nnontraditional, to really focus on what it means as a nation to be a \nnation that enjoys energy abundance rather than a nation that faces \nenergy scarcity.\n  I think it is fair to say that for far too long the conversation has \nbeen based from a position of energy scarcity. It is time to change \nthat focus, it is time to shift that dialogue, that debate, to how do \nwe perform, how do we operate, how do we take advantage of our relative \nabundance.\n  Before I start my comments and kind of summarize my white paper and \nthe speech I gave, I want to pause for a quick note. This is the cover \nof my white paper, which will form the basis for my remarks today. I \nchose a U.S. Navy photograph that was taken aboard the USS Carl Vinson. \nIt was taken by Mass Communications Specialist 2nd Class James R. \nEvans. I want to make sure he gets the proper credit for the \nphotograph, because as I look at it, it gives me the sense of optimism \nthat I think we should all have about the future of our energy trade. I \nthink that future is bright. I think it is promising.\n  Let us start the discussion by looking exactly at the opportunity \nthat we do have before us. Simply put, the United States is both \nproducing and exporting more energy now than ever before. We are \nproducing and we are exporting more than we ever have before. Net \nenergy imports are at a 20-year low and projected to fall below 5 \npercent of total consumption by the year 2025.\n  To put this into perspective, when I came to the Senate, we were \nimporting about 60 percent of our oil at that time. Net energy imports, \nnow at a 20-year low, are projected to fall below 5 percent of total \nconsumption by 2025. So this is all energy imports.\n  Energy exports are reducing our trade deficit, and they are boosting \nAmerican commerce around the world. We have been talking all this week \nand last about unemployment insurance--how we can work to improve the \neconomy for those who lack jobs or are underemployed. Let me tell you, \nthis is an area of opportunity when it comes to our energy production.\n  So energy exports are helping us with our trade deficit and they are \nboosting commerce and jobs, but the regulatory architecture--the \nframework we are operating under--that governs energy exports is \nantiquated. It goes back to acts that were passed in the 1930s, in\n\n[[Page S357]]\n\nthe 1950s, and in the 1970s. Furthermore, they are applied unevenly \nacross the sector. So my white paper proposes a series of \nrecommendations to renovate our Nation's approach to energy trade and \nto strengthen America's global posture.\n  I know around here when you put an idea out on the floor, you also \nput a target on your back. But I think this is an important discussion \nfor us to have. Again, I am not proffering legislation, but what I am \npushing, what I am going to edge my colleagues toward is a greater \ndiscussion about energy and energy exports.\n  The first resource I wrote about in my white paper was coal. I think \nwe have to acknowledge these are some pretty uncertain times for what \nhas truly been the backbone of the U.S. energy supply. Coal is \nprojected to remain the top source of electricity for the next two \ndecades, but we know it faces competition from other energy sources.\n  There is clearly a regulatory effort that will make the construction \nof new plants an extremely difficult endeavor, but I think we can see \nhere that net exports of coal are at their highest level on record, and \nas a share of their production, they are at their highest level in 30 \nyears. Exports of coal are presently free of burdensome regulations. I \nthink they should remain so. I think other Federal regulatory agencies \nshould not require climate change studies in the course of their \npermitting process for any proposed facilities. I say this because coal \nis going to be consumed around the world regardless of U.S. trade \npolicy. We know that. We see that. We can point to the countries where \nthey are seeing increased coal imports. The only question here--the \nreal question here--is whether the coal is produced here in North \nAmerica. If it is produced here in North America, the environmental \nstandards are going to be high--higher than they will elsewhere. So the \nreal question is: Do you produce it where you have stronger \nenvironmental standards or are you going to get it from countries where \ntheir environmental standards are held to a lower level?\n  The next resource we are talking about is natural gas. There has been \na great deal of discussion of late about natural gas. North America is \nquickly emerging as one of the world's most important hubs for the \nnatural gas trade. Record levels are flowing to Mexico and Canada via \npipeline. The buildout of seaborne export capacity, which requires the \nliquefaction of gas for loading onto cargo ships, is proceeding too \nslow under the watch of the Department of Energy. Other nations are \napproving capacity, they are securing financing, they are building \nprojects, and they are contracting with customers. They are making \nthese long-term contracts ahead of the United States. So a little more \nin-depth on this particular resource area, building on the white paper. \nI think DOE should expedite its review process for applications to \nexport LNG to non-FTA countries. The last time an application was \napproved was back in mid-November, over 2 months ago now. I don't see \nthe reason for continued delay here.\n  I do think we have to monitor the role of the other agencies that are \ninvolved. We have the FERC, we have the Maritime Administration, and we \nhave the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. I \nthink it is important to understand whether this process is as \nstreamlined and as functional as it should be.\n  There are some who are suggesting there needs to be a pause button \npushed here, whether it is at DOE, the FERC, or at any other agency. No \nnew study should be commissioned as the NERA study from 2012 is more \nthan adequate and DOE has access to all the latest EIA and the other \nmarket data when it issues its orders. Our allies overseas and American \nworkers here at home have waited long enough. We can do more and we can \ndo it in an expedited manner.\n  The third area is natural gas liquids. A variety of fuels is produced \nalongside oil and gas as part of the energy renaissance underway here \nin this country. There is butane, propane, and pentanes plus. These are \nknown as natural gas liquids, and they have various uses. They have not \ntypically represented a major source of either revenue or volume to \nAmerican exporters. Since the energy renaissance has begun, we have \nseen exports of more of these products on the uptake. We have seen them \nsurge.\n  The regulatory structures that surround NGL exports are working \npretty well. They are working smoothly. I don't think they require \nmodification. Trade in these products plays a valuable role in reducing \nvolatility and creating additional demand to stimulate production.\n  Next is the issue of crude oil and condensates. Obviously, this \ngenerates a little more interest and discussion, and that is OK, \nbecause again, I want to have this discussion.\n  We are producing more oil in this country today than at any point in \nthe past 20 years. What has happened is this increase has resulted in a \nplethora of what is known as light tight oil, and this is coming from \nthe Bakken, from Eagle Ford, and from other places around the country. \nThis crude is lighter and sweeter than the U.S. refinery system was \nbuilt to accommodate. Existing capacity upgrades to existing refineries \nand logistical feats to transport that light crude to appropriate \nrefiners on the east coast--instead of over on the gulf coast, where \nyou have the heavy refining capacity that dominates--have allowed for \nnew volumes of light crude to be refined and brought to global markets \nas product.\n  So you have a situation where under existing regulations the \nDepartment of Commerce may license the export of crude oil under \ncertain conditions, most notably if that oil is destined for Canada. \nBut in addition, you have large amounts of condensates, another \nhydrocarbon, that cannot be exported, and these are also being produced \nalong with the record levels of crude and natural gas.\n  Many producers fear that rising light crude production will soon \nexceed not only our light refining capacity but also the ability of our \nrefiners to adapt to the new production slate. When this point is \nreached, when this mismatch occurs, the U.S. oil resurgence will \ncollide with the de facto ban that we have on crude oil exports.\n  You are going to hear people say--the opponents will argue--that \nlifting the ban is somehow or other going to increase the price of \ngasoline. Well, coming from a State where we have probably some of the \nhighest gas prices at the pump anywhere, that is not my interest. That \nis clearly not my interest. But I think there are a number of sound \neconomic reasons why this is not going to be the case.\n  First, gasoline is a petroleum product and petroleum products are \nsubject to global pricing, just as crude oil is. So to the extent that \ngreater U.S. production of crude oil puts downward pressure on the \ninternational oil prices, then production increases have benefited U.S. \nconsumers by marginally lowering the gasoline and the crude oil prices. \nAmerican consumers are already generally paying a global price for \npetroleum products, including gasoline, and would also benefit to the \nextent that lifting the ban on crude oil exports would send a positive \nsignal to oil producers to then increase production.\n  The second point here is the cost of inaction. Prohibition on the \nfree trade of any product, with all things being equal, increases \nprices, it creates market distortions, it leads to misallocation of \ncapital, and it has a deleterious impact on job creation. So to the \nextent the crude oil export ban contributes to supply disruptions and \ndecelerating oil production, which affects unemployment, then the \nAmerican consumer suffers these consequences. I have taken the position \nthe status quo does not benefit the American consumer. In fact, not \nacting could actually negatively impact the Nation.\n  All sectors of the U.S. oil industry are global leaders. Upstream, \nAmerican technology and expertise enables the growth in production. \nMidstream, a complex network of pipelines transports that oil across \nthe country safely every day. And then, of course, downstream we have \nAmerican refiners who are among the most advanced in the world. So \nlifting the de facto ban will strengthen this system by protecting \njobs, boosting production, and enhancing efficiency and specialization.\n  I mentioned the Commerce Department earlier. They may retain \nsufficient statutory authority to lift the\n\n[[Page S358]]\n\nban on its own as part of a larger swap. Some have suggested trading \nU.S. light crude for Mexican heavy, which sounds interesting, but it is \na little more complicated than that. The President may also make a \nnational interest determination that the present regulatory structure, \nwhich generally prohibits crude oil exports, is unnecessary and \ncounterproductive. White House action on this matter is of course the \nshortest way from point A to point B, and if the President is so \ninclined, he can call me. He can count on my full support on this.\n  If the White House disagrees with this interpretation of its \nauthority or it chooses to maintain the prohibition on exports, then I \nthink it would be appropriate for the Senate to update the laws to \nreflect 21st century conditions.\n  After crude oil and condensates is the growing success story of our \npetroleum products and their exports. An enormous expansion of the \nAmerican export profile in global petroleum product markets has \naccompanied the crude oil resurgence. Exports of petroleum products \nmust continue without burdensome regulations. The U.S. refining \nindustry is the global leader and delivers gasoline, diesel, and other \nfuel to American friends and allies around the world. These fuels will \nbe consumed whether or not they are imported from the United States, \nwhich, again, uses the strictest environmental standards.\n  Of course, when we are talking about energy production and our \nopportunities for exports, there is our renewable energy resource. \nThere is renewable technology. Producers of wind turbines, solar \npanels, and other renewable technologies also help reduce the U.S. \ntrade deficit through our exports. Again, it is very important to make \nsure, when we are talking about energy exports, to truly talk about all \nof them, including our renewable technologies. I think the general lack \nof trade restrictions on renewable energy technology products doesn't \nneed to be modified. If renewable technology is the future, then it \nneeds to be competitive.\n  Finally, the last area is nuclear technology. The United States has \nbeen the undisputed leader of nuclear technology throughout the world. \nWe have produced more nuclear power than any other nation. As the \nglobal nuclear trade has developed, what we have seen is that the U.S. \nmarket share has declined. I think the Federal Government must continue \nits efforts to help develop small modular reactors, and I think we can \ndo this without putting international security at risk or violating \nnonproliferation controls.\n  The energy resurgence has fueled a beneficial expansion of U.S. \nenergy trade. The evidence is clear that exports can help facilitate \nenhanced production by opening U.S. supply to global markets. Trade is \ncreating jobs, increasing supply, and enhancing our Nation's security, \nwithout doubt. Competition and efficiency are the strengths of the \nAmerican economic system. They are not defects. Trade and consumption \nwill occur with or without us.\n  So the question is whether we can enhance or whether we will demote \nour global position. To the extent that American-made energy can \ndisplace other less clean sources, then the global environment will \nbenefit from enhanced U.S. trade.\n  People come first, though. We recognize that. The Nation's \nopportunity to help us alleviate energy policy is one we should not \nmiss.\n  I believe we need to send a powerful signal to the world that the \nUnited States is ready to reassert its role as a leader on energy, the \nenvironment, and trade. To me, that is a signal worth sending.\n  As I have said, this is a debate worth having in the Senate, in this \nnew year, and I look forward to joining my colleagues. I know there are \nmany on the other side who have differing views when it comes to our \nfossil fuels, but I think we would find alignment in other areas when \nwe are talking about our energy exports and our great potential.\n  So as we are trying to build our Nation's economy, as we are trying \nto strengthen jobs across the country, let us not forget the enormous \ngrowth potential we hold when it comes to our energy production and \npotential for energy export.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                                Tobacco\n\n  Mr. BROWN. I always appreciate the comments of Senator Murkowski, who \nis always thoughtful and works across the aisle. I appreciate the work \nshe does.\n  Mr. President, I rise briefly, joining with Senator Blumenthal of \nConnecticut and Senator Merkley, who is now in the Presiding Officer's \nchair but who will be joining us, to mark the 50th anniversary of \nSurgeon General Dr. Terry's groundbreaking report on the dangers of \nsmoking.\n  The 387-page report released five decades ago concluded something \nthat was almost revolutionary in its time, and was revolutionary in its \nimpact, that said: ``Cigarette smoking is a health hazard of sufficient \nimportance in the United States to warrant appropriate remedial \naction.''\n  We know how our views in this country have changed about smoking. But \nwe also know that 400,000 people every year die from smoking-related \nillnesses. That says the tobacco companies have to find 400,000 new \ncustomers every year, and the people they have tried to seduce into \nsmoking are not people my age. They are the pages' age or even younger. \nThose are the people they aim at to teach them to start smoking.\n  It is not just young people that tobacco companies are trying to get \naddicted to smoking; it is also what they are doing in the developing \nworld.\n  I was in Poland in 1991 working for Ohio State University right after \nthe Communist government in Poland fell. The first billboards all over \nWarsaw, Krakow, Lublin, and eastern Poland were tobacco--mostly \nAmerican tobacco companies but also British tobacco companies. Those \nwere the first billboards up.\n  So as the tobacco companies try to seduce young people in our country \nto smoke, they have, in some sense, attacked the developing Third World \nto get people to smoke there. One of the ways they have done this is by \nusing our trade agenda to weaken public health laws in other countries. \nSome poor, developing countries have enacted public health antismoking \nlaws, and U.S. tobacco companies and tobacco companies from other \ncountries have tried to weaken--sometimes successfully--those laws.\n  It is important we close loopholes in our trade agenda which allow \nbig tobacco corporations to undermine these global health standards. \nThis administration's decision not to exclude any one product, \nincluding tobacco, from the TransPacific partnership--the proposed \ntrade agreement among the United States and 11 other countries--is a \ndisappointment: It opens years of anti-tobacco public health policies \nto attacks by Big Tobacco, because under the TPP's investor state \nprovisions, tobacco companies can challenge public health laws in the \nUnited States and abroad, all under the guise of and in the name of \nfree trade. A record number of investor state cases were filed last \nyear, according to the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development.\n  So the public health campaign against tobacco continues in our \ncountry and Senator Blumenthal has been a leader in this for well over \na decade. It extends to our international politics, our international \ntrade regimen.\n  We have a lot of work to do. That is why I am pleased to join Senator \nBlumenthal and Senator Merkley in their discussion today honoring the \n50th anniversary of Dr. Terry's report.\n  I yield to Senator Blumenthal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am proud to be with public health \nadvocates such as the Presiding Officer, my very distinguished and \neloquent colleague Senator Brown, and Senator Durbin, who was on the \nfloor earlier today on this very subject which remains one of urgency \nand profound importance to the public health of this Nation.\n  Indeed, if there is a public health threat, enemy No. 1 in the United \nStates of America, it continues to be tobacco use and nicotine \naddiction.\n  We talk a lot in this body, throughout the Congress and throughout \nthe Nation, about reducing the costs of health care. If we were to cut \ntobacco use and nicotine addiction, it would drastically reduce \ndiseases such as cancer and heart disease and lung problems which \nreduce the longevity of life\n\n[[Page S359]]\n\nin this country but also create enormous costs in treating those \nmedical diseases. Indeed, the cost of tobacco in health care for this \ncountry is about $193 billion a year, not only in direct medical costs \nbut lost productivity.\n  I am proud to have fought--and fought successfully--through many of \nmy years as attorney general of the State of Connecticut, working in \nalliance with other attorneys general, with private health advocates \nsuch as the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, the Heart and Lung \nAssociation, the American Cancer Society, and private advocates \nthroughout the country who have achieved so much.\n  When we doubt our achievements on this 50th anniversary of the annual \nSurgeon General's Report on Tobacco and Health, we should remember the \ndays when 43 percent of adults smoked cigarettes and were addicted to \nnicotine. We should look at ``Mad Men,'' the very popular TV series, \nwhere tobacco use and smoking is ubiquitous. There is barely a scene \nwithout it. Those were days when doctors in their medical offices \nsmoked cigarettes, the days when Big Tobacco fervently and vehemently \ndenied that tobacco caused cancer or any of those other diseases.\n  In alliance with attorneys general and eventually the Department of \nJustice, we fought successfully to bring out the truth and to help not \nonly change the ads and pitches and promotions of Big Tobacco but also \neventually to pass the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control \nAct of 2009.\n  Yet for all the progress we have made--and, indeed, the rate of \nsmoking has gone from 42 percent in 1965 to 18 percent in 2002 among \nadults--we are still lagging. We are way behind where we should be in \npreventing all those diseases that come from tobacco and protecting the \npublic. The state of regulation and protection in this country is \nanemic compared to the danger and the threat.\n  Between 2000 and 2012, cigarette use declined nearly 35 percent. But \nin that same period of time, cigar use rose by 124 percent, and \nespecially among young people cigar use is increasing. There are new \nfronts and new frontiers in the fight against tobacco addiction, and \nthe public health consequences--the disasters and catastrophic health \nconsequences that come from lifetimes of nicotine addiction and tobacco \nuse.\n  Big Tobacco continues many of the tactics which caused so many people \nto become addicted and die. It is the only industry which makes the \nonly product that kills its customer, and so it must replenish its \ncustomer base by luring new people, new users, and its target continues \nto be young people--young people who are lured into cigar use and then \ncigarettes by the use of flavors and all kinds of pitches and \npromotions which make these products seem more like candy and fruit \nthan they do like the killers they are.\n  We must accept that a major part of the responsibility belongs to the \nFDA and to the Federal Government because there are no deeming \nregulations, which are necessary to regulate cigars in this country. \nWith 3,000 new people under the age of 18 trying cigar smoking each and \nevery day, the fact that we do not have deeming regulations and strong \nregulations of tobacco products is simply unacceptable.\n  Deeming regulations forthcoming from the FDA would allow it to \nregulate these other forms of tobacco, whether it is cigars or spit \ntobacco--also known as chewing tobacco--all forms of tobacco and \ntobacco-like products that threaten the health of young people. I have \nbeen consistent, along with many of my colleagues, in calling on the \nFDA to issue these regulations and hope they will do so quickly.\n  Let me mention another growing new frontier and threat in this \ncountry involving e-cigarettes. These new products offer, in the \nrhetoric and pitches and promotion of the industry, a way to enable \npeople to quit smoking. Yet they are often pitched to young people with \nflavors and other gimmicks. For those young people, they are a gateway \nto smoking and nicotine addiction.\n  Companies that make e-cigarettes, not coincidentally, are being \npurchased by Big Tobacco, the makers of tobacco cigarettes. The \ninfluence of these companies can be seen in the advertising, marketing \npushes, and campaigns of these products which feature celebrities, are \ncandy flavored, and purport to offer a safer alternative to \nsmoking. The ability of big tobacco to market these products, just as \nthey were able to market cigarettes to children, gives them the ability \nto create a new generation of people who are addicted to nicotine and \nsusceptible to going to other forms of tobacco products.\n\n  I call on the FDA to act and to reach a determination that will \nenable it to regulate e-cigarettes and protect young people and all of \nus against the dangers and the costs of these new products. They are \nunknown in their ingredients. Many of them may contain the same or \nsimilar carcinogens. Somebody using e-tobacco products has simply no \nway of reliably knowing because they are unlabeled. The amounts of \nnicotine are also unknown and unlabeled. Studies of e-cigarettes have \nfound that products claiming not to contain nicotine actually do \ncontain it and the amounts of nicotine may vary widely across products.\n  What is known beyond any doubt is nicotine is highly addictive. In \nfact, it is probably one of the most addictive legal or illegal drug \nthere is today. We cannot sit idly and allow this new product to addict \na new generation of American children. I hope this year's Surgeon \nGeneral's report will remind us of the accomplishments that have been \nmade but the dangers and challenges ahead that we must confront.\n  I am proud to yield to one of the great public health advocates in \nthis body, my colleague and friend Senator Merkley.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Merkley and I be permitted to \nspeak for up to 5 minutes, and that following our remarks the Senate \nstand in recess subject to the call of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to utilize a \nvisual aid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be here with my \ncolleagues, from Ohio, the Senator in the Chair, and the Senator from \nConnecticut who just spoke, to draw attention to this incredibly \nimportant health issue here in America: addiction to tobacco and the \ndiseases that come from that addiction to tobacco. We are here to \ncommemorate a report put out 50 years ago by Dr. Terry, the Surgeon \nGeneral. His report was called ``Smoking and Health.'' The contents of \nthat report shocked the world because it was issued in defiance of a \npowerful and profitable industry that had repeatedly denied there was \nany link between smoking and disease. This report made national news by \ntelling the American public things that we now take for granted: that \nsmoking is bad for the heart and lungs; that smoking causes cancer; and \nthat the lives of Americans are routinely cut short due to the use of \ntobacco products.\n  This single report created a powerful ripple throughout society, a \nripple that has continued in the decades since, growing into a wave \nthat has transformed public health in America and saved an astonishing \nnumber of lives. Thomas Friedan, the current Director of the Center for \nDisease Control, says no other single report has had as large an effect \non public health. The Journal of the American Medical Association \nestimates that 8 million have been saved by the antismoking measures \nthat were launched, directly or indirectly, because of this report. \nThat is a reminder of how far we have come in identifying a significant \nrisk, understanding it, educating the public, and reducing the \nconsequences.\n  There would have been millions of lives lost had a brave Surgeon \nGeneral not acted 50 years ago, in 1964. If that Surgeon General had \nsaid, as others before him, that is too sensitive, that is too \nprovocative, it will be too much of an irritant to a powerful industry, \nhow many lives would we have lost?\n  If we do not act now to address tobacco addiction from new forms of \nthe product, how many more American lives will be lost? We must take \nthe courage from 50 years ago and channel it into the courage of today \nto address a significant health risk and to educate the American public \nand to change the consequences.\n  The best way to save lives and improve the quality of life 20 or 30 \nyears from now is to prevent young Americans from taking up tobacco \nproducts\n\n[[Page S360]]\n\ntoday. But big tobacco knows this is true. They know the best way to \ncreate lifelong reliable customers for their deadly products is to get \nkids hooked as young as possible, because in general people do not take \nup tobacco products after the age of 21. These children are what the \nindustry calls ``replacement smokers.'' It is what I call children \ntoday who will suffer from tobacco addiction, disease, and death \ntomorrow.\n  The tobacco industry is working night and day to come up with new \nstrategies to create more children as replacement smokers, to keep \ntheir industry alive. They have come up with quite a variety of \nstrategies. I thought I would share some of them with you today.\n  This poster is of a product that is essentially presented as a mint. \nHere you have an Orb or a mint with a clever little dispenser, shaped \nlike cell phones were shaped 6 years ago when they went in your pocket. \nThe understanding is if kids have this in their pocket the teachers \nwould think they have a cell phone and therefore they would not get \nbusted at school.\n  It seems kind of incredible that dissolvable tobacco has developed \ninto mints to addict our children; that you eat them. I have one of \nthese right here. These were marketed in Oregon as basically an \nexperiment to see could you get young people to consume them and become \naddicts to tobacco.\n  How about toothpicks made out of tobacco, called ``Sticks''? This is \nunbelievable. How about breath strips that you put under your tongue? \nHw about flavors of all kinds?\n  I note that our time is running out. I ask the Chair for unanimous \nconsent to speak for 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, this is an example of the cigarillos my \ncolleagues were talking about. This one is flavored apple. This one is \nflavored sweet cherry. How about this one. That is strawberry. These \nproducts are all about addicting our children.\n  Here is the long and short of it. In 2009, this Chamber and the House \nsigned a bill that gave the FDA the power to regulate these products. \nThe President signed that bill and, since then, the FDA, the Food and \nDrug Administration, has done nothing to utilize that power to regulate \nthese addictive products that are going to destroy the health of our \nchildren in the years to come.\n  Finally, from June 2009 until October of last year--so more than 4 \nyears--they finally sent a draft deeming regulation to GAO, the General \nAccounting Office, and there it sits.\n  To summarize, let us not accept inaction by the FDA. Let us not \naccept inaction by the GAO. Let's have the courage the Surgeon General \nhad 50 years ago to take on dangerous products damaging the health of \nAmericans so our children will live better lives.\n  I yield.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/15/senate-section/article/S360-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which \nCongress passed last month, provides relief to families and the economy \nfrom the harmful effects of sequestration, more than offsetting the \ncosts of providing that relief with savings elsewhere in the Federal \nbudget. In addition to those changes, the Bipartisan Budget Act also \nestablishes a congressional budget for 2014 and, if necessary, for \n2015, authorizing the Chairmen of the Senate and House Budget \nCommittees to file allocations, aggregates, and levels in the Senate \nand the House for budget year 2014.\n  Specifically, to provide for continued enforcement in the Senate, \nsection 111 requires the chairman of the Budget Committee to file: No. \n1, an allocation for fiscal year 2014 for the Committee on \nAppropriations; No. 2, allocations for fiscal years 2014, 2014 through \n2018, and 2014 through 2023 for committees other than the Committee on \nAppropriations; No. 3, aggregate spending levels for fiscal year 2014; \nNo. 4, aggregate revenue levels for fiscal years 2014, 2014 through \n2018, and 2014 through 2023; and No. 5, aggregate levels of outlays and \nrevenue for fiscal years 2014, 2014 through 2018, and 2014 through 2023 \nfor Social Security.\n  In the case of the Committee on Appropriations for 2014, the \nallocation shall be set consistent with the discretionary spending \nlimits set forth in the Bipartisan Budget Act, which imposes limits on \nthe amount of budget authority that can be provided under both the \nrevised security category and the revised nonsecurity category.\n  Both the discretionary spending limits and the allocation to the \nCommittee on Appropriations can be revised for certain adjustments \nspecifically authorized under the Budget Control Act of 2011. H.R. \n3547, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, which the Senate will \nsoon consider, includes several such adjustments. Consistent with the \nfunding levels included in H.R. 3547, I am incorporating into the \nallocation to the Committee on Appropriations adjustments for overseas \ncontingency operations and the global war on terrorism, disaster \nfunding, and the program integrity initiative in the area of continuing \ndisability reviews. I am also adjusting for a change in outlays \npreviously designated as an emergency requirement. These adjustments \nare authorized by section 251 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \nDeficit Control Act of 1985, as modified by section 101 of the Budget \nControl Act, and by section 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  In the case of allocations for committees other than the Committee on \nAppropriations and for the revenue and Social Security aggregates, the \nlevels shall be set consistent with the Congressional Budget Office's \nMay 2013 baseline, adjusted to account for the budgetary effects of the \nBipartisan Budget Act and other legislation enacted since the release \nof the May 2013 baseline. In other words, in these instances, the new \nallocations and levels are set equal to the updated May baseline.\n  In the case of the spending aggregates for 2014, the levels shall be \nset in accordance with the allocation for the Committee on \nAppropriations and the allocations for committees other than the \nCommittee on Appropriations, as described previously.\n  Section 114 directs the chairman of the Budget Committee also to \nreset the Senate pay-as-you-go scorecard to zero for all fiscal years. \nPursuant to section 114, those revisions occurred immediately upon \nenactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act. I am now notifying the Senate \nand including the revised scorecard as part of the submission on \nrevised enforcement for budget year 2014.\n  Finally, section 112 of the Bipartisan Budget Act establishes a point \nof order in the Senate against appropriations bills that provide \nadvance appropriations. That act includes limited exceptions to this \nprohibition including up to $28.852 billion in advance appropriations \nfor programs, projects, activities, or accounts included in a statement \nsubmitted by the chairman of the Budget Committee in the Congressional \nRecord. Pursuant to section 112, the list of allowable advance \nappropriations subject to the limit is as follows.\n  Accounts Identified for Advance Appropriations. Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Education: Employment and Training Administration; \nJob Corps; education for the disadvantaged; school improvement; special \neducation; and career, technical, and adult education. Financial \nServices and General Government: payment to Postal Service. \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development: tenant-based rental \nassistance and project-based rental assistance.\n  My counterpart, the Chairman of the House Budget Committee, \nCongressman Ryan, similarly is filing allocations, aggregates, and \nlevels in the House. The two filings will allow the House and the \nSenate to extend budget enforcement measures for 2014, an important \nprinciple of the bipartisan deal that Chairman Ryan and I agreed to \nlast month.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following tables detailing \nenforcement in the Senate for budget year 2014, including new committee \nallocations, budgetary and Social Security aggregates, as well as \nadjustments to those levels, and the pay-as-you-go scorecard, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as

Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          FIRST SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT ON SMOKING AND HEALTH\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on January 11, 1964, 50 years ago this \nweek, Dr. Luther Terry released the landmark Surgeon General's report--\nthe first of its kind--on smoking and health. The report established \nconclusive links between smoking and lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, \nemphysema, coronary heart disease, low fetal birthweight among women \nwho smoked during pregnancy, and an overall 70 percent increase in the \nearly mortality rate of smokers over nonsmokers. Today I would like to \nacknowledge the invaluable contribution of Dr. Luther in issuing that \nreport. I want to applaud the historic, life-saving accomplishments \nthat stemmed from it. And yes, I want to call attention to the work we \nhave remaining in front of us to end the scourge of tobacco use once \nand for all.\n  Mr. President, this 50th anniversary gives us an opportunity to \nreflect on one of the monumental public health successes of our time. \nNew research released just last week reports that, from 1964 to 2012, \nat least 8 million premature, smoking-related deaths were prevented. \nThat's eight million Americans who otherwise may not have lived long \nenough to see their kids graduate from high school, to meet their \ngrandchildren, or to enjoy retirement. In fact, among these 8 million \npeople, they lived an extra 20 years, on average.\n  Successful tobacco prevention programs have led to dramatic \nreductions in smoking rates. In 1964, about 42 percent of all American \nadults smoked tobacco on a regular basis. By 2012, that number \nplummeted to 18 percent.\n  The Surgeon General's report also served as an important catalyst for \nnew research at Federal agencies on the effects of smoking--agencies \nincluding the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Substance \nAbuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and the National \nInstitutes of Health.\n  Thanks to this research, we now know that smoking can damage almost \nevery organ in the body; is implicated in at least 18 different types \nof cancer; is a major contributor to heart disease; can cause \ncomplications with pregnancy and prenatal development; and contributes \nto and exacerbates a host of other medical conditions. We also better \nunderstand the addictive nature of tobacco, and how to support our \nfriends and loved ones who want to quit--because we also know that 7 \nout of 10 current smokers want to quit.\n  Because the Surgeon General's report brought into the American \nconsciousness just how dangerous smoking really is, we have made great \nstrides in elevating smoking prevention as a national priority. Thirty \nstates, as well as Washington, DC, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin \nIslands, plus hundreds of cities and counties, have enacted strong \nsmoke-free laws that include restaurants and bars. At times, the days \nof smoky airplanes and conference rooms seem a blessedly distant \nmemory.\n  In 1998, I was proud to introduce the first comprehensive, bipartisan \nbill to give the FDA authority to regulate tobacco--the precursor to \nthe Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which finally \ngave FDA that critical authority in 2009, along with banning candy and \nfruit-flavored cigarettes, and misleading health claims such as \n``light'' and ``low-tar.'' Tobacco companies are now required to \ndisclose the contents of tobacco products, and the FDA is empowered to \nrequire changes in tobacco products. There is perhaps nothing that will \nmore significantly amplify our efforts to reduce tobacco use than FDA's \nfull implementation of this historic legislation.\n  The Affordable Care Act marked another turning point in the fight \nagainst tobacco, guaranteeing all Americans access to cost-free tobacco \ncessation services, and creating the Prevention and Public Health \nFund--which has already supported more than $200,000,000 in lifesaving \ntobacco prevention and control work. I am proud of the work I did to \ninclude those provisions in the health reform law, and I am confident \nthat we will continue to see decreases in the rates of smoking for \nyears to come as a result.\n  Yet even as we celebrate the success of these efforts, we cannot \nforget that our work is not done. In the last 50\n\n[[Page S364]]\n\nyears, at least 17.6 million deaths in this country were attributable \nto smoking, and 440,000 lives are claimed by smoking each year. In \nfact, smoking cigarettes kills more Americans than alcohol, car \naccidents, suicide, AIDS, homicide, and illegal drugs combined. \nFurthermore, more than 3,000 kids in the United States try their first \ncigarette every day, 700 of whom will become daily smokers into \nadulthood. In total, this results in more than 250,000 new underage \ndaily smokers in the U.S. annually. The numbers are clear: the battle \nagainst the harm caused by tobacco use is far from over, and we need to \ndo more to protect vulnerable youth from becoming addicted to tobacco.\n  With these remaining challenges in front of us, it's never been more \nimportant that we continue to make strides in tobacco prevention \nthrough innovative approaches, bold policies and programs, and a \nstrengthened and sustained investment in public health. Today, in both \nthe public and private sectors, we are continuing to make progress by \nexpanding the number of smoke-free environments, supporting cutting-\nedge research on the effects of smoking, cracking down on unethical \nmarketing practices, and using technology and social media to help \npeople quit smoking. Tobacco prevention simply must remain a top public \nhealth priority.\n  As we reflect on these accomplishments on this 50th anniversary of \nthe first Surgeon General's report on smoking and health, I urge my \ncolleagues to continue this fight, so that 50 years hence, Americans \nwill be able to look back on a full century of amazing progress in the \nfight against smoking and tobacco-related illnesses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/15/senate-section/article/S364-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          TRIBUTE TO LIZ RYAN\n\n Mr. CARPER.

The Ulster \nProject is designed to bring young Catholic and protestant youth from \nNorthern Ireland to Wilmington, DE, where they live with Delaware \nfamilies. The program allows these young potential leaders to build \nbridges in a safe environment and then return, hopefully to develop and \nmaintain those bridges in their native Northern Ireland. Hopefully, \nthey learn skills and attitudes that are needed to unite people when \ndifferences divide them. This program inspired Liz to work with \nchildren at risk both overseas and here in the United States. Bridging \ndifferences has become the hallmark signature of Liz's work.\n  I came to know Liz when she joined my congressional staff as a \nlegislative aide in the late 1980s, and she eventually rose to the \nposition of legislative director. After I was elected Governor of \nDelaware in 1992, Liz worked on my transition team and then took on the \nassignment of setting up Delaware's first staffed Washington, DC, \noffice. In addition to her work for our State, she also worked closely \nwith the National Governors Association, where she was a respected \ncontributor to the development and growth of that organization.\n  After establishing the Delaware office, which has continued to make \nvaluable contributions to the administrations of the governors who \nfollowed me, Liz returned to Delaware as my Deputy Chief of Staff, \nwhere she focused her attention on the Cabinet Family Services Council. \nShe worked to develop programs for special needs and at-risk children.\n  Liz's commitment and energy needed a bigger stage. She left \nWashington to become a VISTA volunteer, but eventually returned to \ncontinue her work advocating for children at the Children's Defense \nFund, Juvenile Court Centennial Initiative, and the Youth Law Center \nbefore founding the Campaign for Youth Justice in 2005. The campaign \nunder Liz's dynamic leadership focused on changing both state and \nfederal laws and policies impacting on youth caught up in the adult \ncriminal justice system. As a result, today there are several thousand \nfewer kids in the adult system, giving them a better prospect for a \nsuccessful transition to adulthood. Through many years of work, she has \nbecome one of the most influential people in the field of juvenile \njustice today.\n  It is clear that children in Delaware and across the country have \nbenefitted from Liz's steadfast work on their behalf. Even though she \nwill be missed as she steps down from the Campaign for Youth Justice, \nshe leaves beyond a strong and vibrant organization that will continue \nher valuable work. I am proud of the work Liz accomplished during her \ntime on my staff and for her work for our nation's youth. I know Liz is \nnot done, and I can't wait to see what comes next. Today I say thank \nyou, Liz, and good luck in all that lies ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/15/senate-section/article/S364-2", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:31 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 801.

A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of South Carolina repealing Joint Resolution 775 from \n     1976 and rescinding all previous calls for a constitutional \n     convention; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                                H. 3400\n\n       Whereas, the General Assembly of the State of South \n     Carolina, acting with the best of intentions, at various \n     times and during various sessions, has previously made \n     applications to Congress to call one or more conventions to \n     propose either a single amendment concerning a specific \n     subject or to call a general convention to propose an \n     unspecified and unlimited number of amendments to the United \n     States Constitution, pursuant to the provisions of Article V \n     thereof; and\n       Whereas, former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the \n     United States of America Warren E. Burger, former Associate \n     Justice of the United States Supreme Court Arthur J. \n     Goldberg, and other leading constitutional scholars agree \n     that such a convention may propose sweeping changes to the \n     Constitution, any limitations or restrictions purportedly \n     imposed by the states in applying for such a convention or \n     conventions to the contrary notwithstanding, thereby creating \n     an imminent peril to the well-established rights of the \n     citizens and the duties of various levels of government; and\n       Whereas, the Constitution of the United States of America \n     has been amended many times in the history of this nation and \n     may be amended many more times, without the need to resort to \n     a constitutional convention, and has been interpreted for \n     more than two hundred years and has been found to be a sound \n     document which protects the lives and liberties of the \n     citizens; and\n       Whereas, there is no need for, rather, there is great \n     danger in, a new constitution or in opening the Constitution \n     to sweeping changes, the adoption of which would only create \n     legal chaos in this nation and only begin the process of \n     another two centuries of litigation over its meaning and \n     interpretation. Now, therefore, be it\n       Enacted by the General Assembly of the State of South \n     Carolina:\n     Repeal\n       SECTION 1. Joint Resolution 775 of 1976 is repealed.\n     Disavowed\n       SECTION 2.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nestablish a Medicare Better Care Program to provide integrated care for \nMedicare beneficiaries with chronic conditions, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to show my strong support for \nthe Medicare Program with the introduction of the Better Care, Lower \nCost Act with my colleague, Senator Isakson.\n  The Medicare Program, treasured by millions of Americans today, is \nnow dominated by cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic \nconditions. It is time for reform that offers seniors with chronic \nhealth challenges better quality, more affordable health care.\n  Fortunately, there are several pioneering health care leaders already \npaving the way to reform. The bipartisan legislation we are offering is \ndesigned to remove the government's shackles on innovation so that the \ntypes of successful approaches discussed by health care leaders here \nthis morning become the norm rather than the exception.\n  The good news is that when the Senate Finance Committee recently \napproved legislation to fix Medicare's broken system of reimbursing \ndoctors, the bill locked in specific incentives to move away from fee-\nfor-service medicine. As part of its markup, the Senate Finance \nCommittee added the foundation for improving chronic care for seniors: \nreforms that guarantee many more seniors access to individual care \nplans tailored to their unique needs.\n  The Better Care, Lower Cost Act builds on that progress and \nintroduces a bold new concept in Medicare: the idea that chronic care \nshould come first. Here are a few things the legislation does to \npromote this idea:\n  First, the legislation creates the Better Care Program, allowing \nhealth practices to create better care practices and health plans to \nbecome better health plans that care for patients with teams led by \nnurses, doctors, and physician assistants that must adhere to the \nhighest quality standards. These innovators will receive one payment \nfor their collective efforts to meet the chronic health needs of the \nseniors enrolled. This will give providers the flexibility to deliver \nthe right care at the right time in the right place.\n  Second, because most seniors lack access to coordinated, chronic care \nservices today, the legislation sets aside the limiting Federal \nmandates--like the ``attribution rule''--that prevent these teams from \nactively reaching out to the seniors who would benefit most from \nspecialized chronic care. Our legislation also changes Federal law so \nthat participating practices and plans are able to reward seniors who \nparticipate in the Better Care Program by lowering their out-of-pocket \ncosts when they work with their health care team.\n  Third, this bill recognizes that seniors with chronic conditions live \nall over the country and sets out a plan for bringing providers and \nplans to every nook and cranny of America. And for those seniors and \nproviders in rural or underserved areas, the legislation uses \ntelemedicine and other technologies as resources to help to closely \nmonitor and manage chronic conditions.\n\n[[Page S374]]\n\n  Finally, a word about the private sector. This bill recognizes the \nadvances that have been made that prove that better care can be \nprovided at lower cost. There should not be as many barriers when \narriving at the gates of Medicare. In fact, in my hometown of Portland, \nOR, when seniors talk about their Medicare, they are really talking \nabout plans like Kaiser and Providence that are fully integrated. \nSeniors should have those care choices no matter where they live.\n  In Washington, there is talk a lot about ``Medicare delivery system \nreform'' without mentioning why it is necessary or how it will actually \nhelp the people Medicare serves. The legislation Senator Isakson and I \nare introducing today is about giving seniors with chronic illnesses \nthe focus and attention they need and deserve.\n  Every day Americans hear new statistics about the impact chronic \nillness has on families, productivity, and the economy as a whole. But \nI can't recall a legislative effort where all those involved have \nremained singularly focused on solutions to this big problem.\n  To be clear, this legislation is not driven by a simple desire to cut \ncosts. Anyone can save money by cutting benefits, but this legislation \nwould actually improve the care that seniors receive. I urge my \ncolleagues to join us in this effort by cosponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1932\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

MEDICARE BETTER CARE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new section:\n\n\n                     ``medicare better care program\n\n       ``Sec. 1899B.

If we are not able to get an agreement to move \nforward on it, setting up the situation to have some amendments and \nmove forward, which we have agreed to, then we will file cloture.\n  It is a shame that we would have to do that on a totally bipartisan \nbill.
