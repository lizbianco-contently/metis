Mr. President, just by chance last night I was reading a \nbook and it included a speech given by John McCain, our fellow Senator. \nWhat Senator McCain talked about was some of his experiences in the \nprison camp in Vietnam where a man by the name of Mike Christian had \nspent an inordinate amount of time sewing on the inside of the pajama-\nlike outfit they gave him to wear, and he put a flag inside his \njacket--his shirt. This jacket was discovered, the flag was discovered \nby the prison officials, and he was beaten really very much. He was \nbeaten severely. Of course, they ripped the flag out of his coat.\n  We take for granted saluting the flag. We come in here and we do it \nevery morning. By rote, we stand and do it. I am not too sure that we \nshouldn't think a little bit more about what we are doing when we \nsalute the flag. I am going to bring that excerpt from home and I am \ngoing to submit it for publication in the Congressional Record for \neverybody to see, about people who have been--for example, Senator \nMcCain was in prison for 5\\1/2\\ years. As we know, he was, on many \ndifferent occasions, tortured. So when John McCain salutes the flag and \nwhen Mike Christian, a fellow pilot--he was actually a navigator on an \nairplane--salute the flag, it means a lot to them, and we should \nencapsulate that when we think about saluting the flag.\n  I will submit that excerpt for the Record tomorrow. I read that last \nnight, late. I thought, when we salute our flag, we should think about \nit more than, I am sure, we do all the time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/08/senate-section/article/S4233-6", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, it is no secret that the Senate, as of late, \nhas been beset by partisan rancor and obstruction: one Republican \nfilibuster and then another, and then another, and still more \nfilibusters. That is why the legislation that is before us today \nrepresents a rare opportunity for the Senate to complete work on a bill \nthat enjoys broad bipartisan support.\n  Senator Kay Hagan's sportsmen's bill is overwhelmingly popular with \nDemocrats and Republicans around the country, and for good reason. \nForty million Americans who hunt and fish stand to benefit from this \nlegislation.\n  The sportsmen's package represents years of bipartisan work--years--\ncombining some 20 bills important to the sportsmen's community. The \nbill expands opportunities for sportsmen, promoting an industry that \ncontributes almost $200 billion annually to our Nation's economy. In \nNevada, over 200,000 people hunt and fish every year. It is good for \ntourism. People come to Nevada to hunt for game, including antelope, \nelk, and bighorn desert sheep. We have wonderful fishing. We don't have \na lot of lakes and rivers, but what we have is terrific. That is why \nfishermen come from around the country to fish in Nevada. To Nevada, it \nis a $1 billion industry.\n  I was talking to my friend Senator Bennet from Colorado and he said \nin Colorado it is a $4 billion industry. I would bet that even in a \nheavily populated State such as New Jersey there is a lot of hunting \nand fishing that goes on. It is good for the economy.\n  Senator Hagan's legislation promotes hunting, fishing, and \nrecreation, all while fostering habitat conservation through voluntary \nprograms. Because of her tireless efforts building bipartisan \nconsensus, Senator Hagan's\n\n[[Page S4234]]\n\nbill is cosponsored by 25 Republicans and 19 Democrats. This \nlegislation also enjoys the support of more than 50 national sportsmen \nand conservation groups all over this country.\n  As Benjamin Disraeli, the famous statesman from Great Britain, said, \n``The secret of success is to be ready when your opportunity comes.'' \nThis bill is ready and the opportunity is now. After years of hard work \nby Senator Hagan and others, now is the time to consider and pass this \nlegislation. But, as always, our success in moving this legislation \nwill depend on the cooperation of all Senators in putting aside \npolitical games and petty disputes over amendments in order to pass a \nbill that will benefit millions of Americans.\n  This is a bill that is as much a Republican bill as it is a Democrat \nbill. So why should this bill be killed for procedural reasons? This is \na bill they have worked on for many years.\n  I am hopeful that through bipartisan support we can get this bill \nover the finish line, as we were able to do with the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant Act earlier this year, and the Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act a few weeks ago.\n  I urge my colleagues to respect the hard work of those Senators who \nhave put this measure before us and allow this matter to pass--and \nquickly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/08/senate-section/article/S4234-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

First, a few observations about ObamaCare. It may not \nhave existed in the English language a few years ago, but in short \norder it has become a battle word for broken promises and almost \ncartoonish inefficiency. It is no wonder why: You can keep your plan. \nYou can keep your doctor. Premiums will go down. The law will create \nmillions of jobs.\n  We knew the promises wouldn't hold up. Many of us said so. One even \nearned the dubious distinction of being declared the ``lie of the \nyear.'' And that is why it is so hard to trust much of what the Obama \nadministration claims about ObamaCare these days, such as back in \nDecember when administration officials issued another promise--that \nthey would make sure any taxpayer-funded ObamaCare subsidies would go \nonly to enrollees who actually qualify for them under the law.\n  We wanted this assurance not only because so many other promises had \nbeen broken; we wanted it because eligibility verification is so \nimportant. Middle-class taxpayers are feeling enough pain from this law \nalready. They shouldn't have to subsidize inaccurate or even fraudulent \nObamaCare claims on top of all the rest. So I helped pass a law that \nrequires a nonpartisan watchdog to keep an eye on the procedures the \nadministration claimed would protect taxpayers to see how they will \nwork and then report back to us in Congress.\n  Last week that watchdog, the inspector general, issued the first two \nreports on the issue, and it turns out we were pretty correct to be \nworried. The inspector general concluded that the administration was \noften ineffective at verifying such basic details about ObamaCare \nenrollees as their citizen status, their income, their Social Security \nnumber, and whether they were even eligible to purchase ObamaCare in \nthe first place. The administration, the IG reported, didn't even \nfollow its own eligibility verification procedures in many cases.\n  And that wasn't all. The IG also discovered nearly 3 million \ninconsistencies in the information ObamaCare enrollees provided in \ntheir applications, nearly 90 percent of which couldn't even be \nresolved because the necessary software--the necessary software--wasn't \neven operational.\n  It is completely ridiculous.\n  And the administration is still struggling to get a handle on the \nproblem. Computer systems that should have been ready to go last \nOctober have not been built yet. It is the kind of scenario we would \nexpect to see in a Leslie Nielsen movie, not in real life.\n  Worse still, administration officials are now indicating they are \ngoing to keep chugging ahead with their deeply flawed verification \npractices, even after everything the government's own watchdog \nuncovered. Many individuals enrolled with the current flawed enrollment \nprocess will automatically be enrolled for the same taxpayer subsidies \nnext year.\n\n  They are defiant--defiant--in the face of all of this. This is \nprecisely the kind of flippant attitude that is so infuriating to many \nof our constituents.\n  Many of us predicted these kinds of problems would be the likely \noutcome of giving government such expansive power over a huge segment \nof our economy. Of course we are going to have massive inefficiency and \nprobable fraud and migraines for middle-class families who already have \nenough to deal with. Of course we are going to see all this. It seems \ninevitable.\n  That is why Republicans say we need to start over with actual health \ncare reform--reform that can actually lower costs and increase the \nquality of care without resorting to this tired sort of government-\ncentric approach.\n  ObamaCare is built upon the intellectually lazy idea that we can \nsimply legislate a desirable outcome into existence, that we can tell a \nhulking Federal bureaucracy to simply bureaucratize affordable health \ncare into being. Unfortunately, life does not work that way. Reality \nalways intervenes, as we have been seeing with the pain of ObamaCare \nthese past few years--pain that will only continue until Washington \nDemocrats join us to enact a serious bipartisan solution that actually \naddresses many of our health care challenges and dispenses with the \nfailed policies of this administration. Yet that is exactly the \nopposite of what we have seen from our friends on the other side so \nfar.\n  Instead of working with us to solve massive problems, such as the \nones the inspector general identified, Democrats in Washington are \nsimply hiding from the issue altogether. They are trying to change the \nsubject. Even hinting at it prompts the Democratic majority to shut \ndown the legislative process altogether and cancel committee markups. \nThey block votes and amendments. They will not allow the Senate to \nconsider numerous bipartisan House-passed bills that would address some \nof ObamaCare's most glaring problems.\n  Even when a bipartisan group proposes a plan to address a flaw in the \nlaw that is reducing incomes for working families, they reject it. \nInstead, they schedule show votes designed to inflame one group or \nanother.\n  As for the President, he is traveling around the country this week to \ngive campaign speeches--not working with Congress to help middle-class \nfamilies struggling under the weight of his policies. So the Democratic \nplan seems to be to double down on the mess they created and to hope \nAmericans can be distracted enough to forget about it come November.\n  If that is the plan, it is not going to work. Middle-class Americans \nknow who has been standing by their side throughout this entire \nObamaCare fiasco. They know who has been standing against them, serving \nas a shield for the President and the hard left.\n\n[[Page S4235]]\n\n  It is not too late for Democrats in Washington to work with \nRepublicans to address the massive problem they created. If they truly \ncare about the millions they have already hurt in this country with \nthis law, it is time to do just that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/08/senate-section/article/S4235-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4235-S4236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING HOWARD BAKER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senators from Tennessee and I had \nan opportunity 1 week ago today to attend the funeral of Senator Howard \nBaker, who led the Senate Republicans for 8 years and was a truly \nwonderful American.\n  Actually, it was just an honor to attend his funeral down in \nHuntsville, TN, a town of 1,248 souls that Senator Baker often referred \nto as the ``center of the known universe.'' It was a wonderful tribute, \nand it carried a lot of lessons about the work we do.\n  Senator Corker was there too, and I am sure he felt the same way. \nJust before the funeral, he noted that Senator Baker was the kind of \nperson who seemed to evoke ``wisdom in everything he did.'' I was glad \nto hear the two men got to spend some time together a few months before \nSenator Baker passed away.\n  Anyway, a real highlight of the funeral for me was a magnificent--\nabsolutely magnificent--eulogy by Senator Alexander. It captured not \nonly the closeness of their friendship but also the qualities that made \nSenator Baker such an important figure. This morning I would like to \ntake just a moment to thank Senator Alexander for those thoughtful \nwords and at this point insert his eulogy into the Record. I ask \nunanimous consent that be done.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [Eulogy of Senator Howard Baker, Jr., July 1, 2014]\n\n``Howard Baker, Jr.: Tennessee's Favorite Son and One of Our Country's \n                            Finest Leaders''\n\n                          (By Lamar Alexander)\n\n       On behalf of the Baker family and all of us Tennesseans, \n     let me welcome Vice President Biden, Senator Reid, Senator \n     McConnell, and Senator Danforth, who married Howard and \n     Nancy.\n       It was August, 1960. Republican Day at the Illinois State \n     Fair. Senator Everett McKinley Dirksen was warming up the \n     crowd of 30,000, explaining why Vice President Richard Nixon \n     should be president of the United States instead of Senator \n     John F. Kennedy.\n       Seated on the platform behind him were Dirksen's daughter \n     Joy, and her husband Howard Henry Baker, Jr., a 34-year-old \n     lawyer from Huntsville, Tennessee, who looked about 24.\n       ``Jack Kennedy is a nice young man,'' Dirksen was saying. \n     ``But all they can say he has ever done was serve on a PT \n     boat in World War II.''\n       Turning toward his son-in-law with a flourish, Dirksen \n     said, ``Why, my own son-in-law, Howard Baker, Jr., was on a \n     PT boat in World War II, and I've never heard anyone suggest \n     that he was qualified to serve in any public office.''\n       Four years later, instead of running for the safe \n     congressional seat that his father and stepmother had held, \n     Howard Baker, Jr., ran to become the first Tennessee \n     Republican popularly elected to the United States Senate. He \n     probably would have won if presidential candidate Barry \n     Goldwater hadn't stopped at the Knoxville airport a few days \n     before the election and promised to sell the Tennessee Valley \n     Authority.\n       Howard ran again in 1966. I remember standing at that same \n     airport being embarrassed by his prediction to the media that \n     he would win by 100,000 votes, and then, a few days later, he \n     did just that.\n       Behind Howard Baker's pleasant demeanor was a restless \n     ambition that would propel him to the heights of American \n     politics and government for forty years.\n       He learned quickly. His maiden address in the Senate lasted \n     about an hour. Afterwards, he asked Senator Dirksen, the \n     Senate Republican Leader, ``How did I do?''\n       ``Howard,'' Dirksen replied, ``perhaps you should \n     occasionally enjoy the luxury of an unexpressed thought.''\n       In 1968, Howard and Congressman George Bush were runners-up \n     to Governor Spiro Agnew when Nixon picked a vice president. \n     In 1969, when Dirksen died, after only three years in the \n     Senate, he ran for Republican Leader, only to be defeated by \n     Senator Hugh Scott.\n       In 1971, President Nixon asked him to be on the Supreme \n     Court. Howard declined, then called back and said he would \n     accept if the president insisted, but Nixon had already \n     appointed Bill Rehnquist.\n       In 1973 came the Watergate hearings. Eight-five percent of \n     Americans saw those hearings, broadcast most days by all of \n     the only four television networks that then existed. And the \n     most famous words were Howard Baker's: ``What did the \n     president know and when did he know it?''\n       Howard suspected that Senator Scott had made him Ranking \n     Republican on the Watergate Committee to ``get rid of me as a \n     competitor.'' He had run against Scott a second time for \n     Leader, and lost. But instead, the exposure made Baker a \n     national hero and, once again, runner-up in the vice-\n     presidential sweepstakes in 1976 when Gerald Ford picked Bob \n     Dole instead of Howard.\n       Senator Scott retired, and a few months later, in January, \n     1977, Howard was elected Republican Leader by one vote. He \n     served for eight years. When, in 1980, the Republican sweep \n     made him majority leader, he visited the wily Democratic \n     Leader Robert Byrd. First, Howard surprised Byrd by \n     suggesting that Byrd keep his ornate office.\n       Having softened up Byrd, Baker then said, ``Senator Byrd, \n     I'll never learn the rules as well as you know them, so I'll \n     make a deal with you: I won't surprise you if you won't \n     surprise me.''\n       Byrd replied, ``Let me think about it.'' The next day he \n     agreed. And they ran the Senate together for four more years.\n       Baker then commandeered an additional set of offices next \n     to the Republican Leader's less-spacious quarters that are \n     today called the ``Howard Baker Rooms.'' He always said that \n     the view from the Howard Baker rooms was the second best view \n     in Washington. The best, of course, is from the White House, \n     which he also occupied--but not in the way he had planned.\n       In late 1986, while the Bakers were vacationing in Miami, \n     the phone rang. Joy answered. It was President Reagan.\n       ``Where's Howard?'' asked Reagan.\n       ``At the zoo with the grandchildren,'' Joy said.\n       ``Wait till he hears about the zoo I have planned for \n     him,'' the president said.\n       Howard became White House chief of staff, helping to \n     cleanse the Reagan presidency of its Iran-Contra troubles.\n       President Reagan and Howard Baker began each day telling \n     each other a little story. ``It got to be a lot of stories,'' \n     Howard said. I always felt a little better about our country \n     knowing we had two men at the top with such temperament.\n       Joy died in 1993. In 1996, Howard married Nancy. Those of \n     us at the wedding were happy because we had never seen two \n     people so happy.\n       In 1996, the two Senators Baker moved to Tokyo where Howard \n     became U.S. Ambassador to Japan. When he returned, he headed \n     the law firm that is a descendant of a law firm his \n     grandfather founded in Huntsville.\n       What skills allowed Howard Baker to accomplish so much?\n       He was an eloquent listener. He said in 2011, ``There is a \n     difference between hearing and understanding what people say. \n     You don't have to agree, but you have to hear what they've \n     got to say. And if you do, the chances are much better you'll \n     be able to translate that into a useful position and even \n     useful leadership.''\n       He was called ``The Great Conciliator'' for his habit of \n     gathering disputing senators into one room, listening for a \n     while, and then his summary of the discussion would become \n     the senators' agreement.\n       He demonstrated courage. He supported civil rights when \n     most southerners didn't. He and Senator Byrd found 68 votes \n     to ratify the Panama Canal Treaty. Several Republican \n     senators signed a letter asking Baker to resign as Leader \n     because of that.\n       Roy Blount, Jr., says you start getting into trouble when \n     you stop sounding like where you grew up. Howard Baker never \n     stopped sounding like where he grew up. He always went home \n     to Huntsville, which he called the ``center of the known \n     universe.''\n       He had an eye for talent. In 1969, he told me, ``You ought \n     to meet that smart young legislative assistant who works for \n     Senator Marlow Cook.'' That assistant was Mitch McConnell. \n     Howard mentored another Tennessee majority leader, Bill \n     Frist; Senators Thompson and Corker; and Governors Sundquist \n     and Haslam; Ambassadors Ashe and Montgomery; Congressman \n     Duncan--as well as many others in this congregation.\n       With Bill Brock and Winfield Dunn, he kept the door open to \n     Republican primaries, attracting hundreds of thousands of \n     ``discerning Democrats'' and independents and creating the \n     majority status the Tennessee Republican Party enjoys today.\n       Howard Baker knew how to make the Senate work. He \n     understood that the Senate's unique role is as a place for \n     extended debate and amendment on important issues until there \n     is a consensus. That is how he fixed Social Security with Tip \n     O'Neill and Ronald Reagan, how he passed the Reagan tax cuts \n     and the Clean Air and Water laws.\n       One thing he did not do well was fundraising. He left that \n     to Ted Welch and Jim Haslam and Bill Swain. According to Jim, \n     ``Howard would not raise any money at all, until he started \n     raising money for the Baker Center and then he made every \n     call with me.\n                                  ____\n\n       In the new version of Lamar Alexander's Little Plaid Book, \n     there is this rule: ``When invited to speak at a funeral, \n     remember to mention the deceased at least as often as \n     yourself.''\n       I have done my best to follow that rule today, but I hope \n     you understand how difficult that is for me, as it would be \n     for many of you.\n       So let me just get it out all at once:\n       For the last half century, Howard Baker has had more \n     influence on my life than anyone outside my own family. He \n     inspired me to help him build a two-party system. I babysat \n     for Darek and Cissy. I met Honey at\n\n[[Page S4236]]\n\n     a softball game between the Baker staff and the John Tower \n     staff. My favorite photograph of her is one Howard took at \n     the Baker home when we were celebrating our marriage. Our \n     daughter Leslee was flower girl at Darek and Karen's wedding. \n     I occupy the same Senate office Howard once had in the \n     Dirksen Senate office building. My desk on the Senate floor \n     was once his desk.\n       As his legislative assistant, I wrote his speeches, \n     prompting him to tell the story at least 100 times of how I \n     once asked to see him privately to determine if there was \n     some problem with our relationship because I had learned that \n     he never said in his speeches any of the words that I had \n     written.\n       ``Lamar,'' he replied, ``we have a perfect relationship. \n     You write what you want to write--and I'll say what I want to \n     say.''\n       Occasionally a young person will ask me, ``How can I become \n     involved in politics?''\n       My answer always is, ``Find someone you respect, volunteer \n     to help him or her do anything legal, and learn all you can \n     from them. That's what I did.''\n       How fortunate we were to know, to be inspired by, and to \n     learn from Tennessee's favorite son and one of our country's \n     finest leaders, Howard Baker.\n       Dan Quayle, when he was a senator, summed it up: ``There's \n     Howard Baker,'' he said, ``and then there's the rest of us \n     senators.''\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would like to share some of Senator Alexander's \nobservations about Senator Baker because, as I said, I think they are \nimportant, timely lessons about the purpose and potential of our \nservice.\n  One of the things that stands out in all the tributes to Senator \nBaker, including Senator Alexander's, is the way in which he embodied \nthe rare trait of taking himself lightly even as he took his duties \nseriously.\n  I will give you an example. One of the time-honored traditions around \nhere is for new Senators to labor over their maiden speeches as if \nPericles himself were standing in judgment from the Presiding Officer's \nchair. Senator Baker was no exception. His maiden speech was long, \nthoughtful, and dense--so much so that when he asked his father-in-law, \nthen-Senate Republican Leader Everett Dirksen, for his reaction, \nDirksen is said to have remarked: ``Howard, Howard, perhaps you should \noccasionally enjoy the luxury of an unexpressed thought.''\n  It was the kind of comment that might have stung a lesser Senator, \nbut as Senator Alexander pointed out in mentioning that last week, \nBaker was a quick learner. About a week or so later, Howard rose \nagain--this time to challenge one of his Democratic colleagues to a \ngame of tennis. The Senator in question had just taken a swipe at the \nvigor of his Republican colleagues, particularly the new ones, and \nSenator Baker decided to rise to the challenge, tongue firmly in cheek.\n  It was a star performance. The Senator that Baker challenged even \ninterrupted him at one point to suggest that it was ``one of the best \nmaiden speeches that has ever been delivered in this chamber.'' \nEvidently he had missed Baker's actual maiden speech. But Senator \nBaker's legendary ability to adapt was now firmly established and it \nset the tone for a two-decade run in which he would be called upon to \ndeploy his many other talents and skills to defuse tensions, resolve \nconflicts, repair trust, build consensus, and, frankly, just to put \npeople at ease--because sometimes in this business there is nothing \nmore important than just that: to just keep the bearings oiled.\n  We have all been recently reminded of how Senator Baker put his own \nambitions aside to help rebuild the Reagan White House after Iran-\nContra. It was a great testament to his values and to his feel for \npriorities. What Senator Alexander reminded us last week was that these \nformer political rivals--Baker and Reagan--started every day in the \nWhite House together telling each other a little story. They had no \nproblem putting their past disputes behind them and building a close \nworking friendship based on mutual respect, common purpose, love of \ncountry, and of course good humor. They were adults, busy about serious \nbusiness, and they conducted that business with dignity and with grace.\n  The larger point is that while people talk a lot about the importance \nof having political skill in Washington these days, the importance of \ntemperament cannot be overstated. The way Senator Baker conducted \nhimself here and in the White House is eloquent testimony of that.\n  It is not that he was laid back. As Senator Alexander put it, behind \nBaker's pleasant demeanor was a restless ambition that would propel him \nto the heights of American politics and government for 40 years, but he \ncould subordinate that ambition when he felt the moment or the country \nneeded him to. He was persistent about achieving a result but never \ninsisted that his way was the only way to do it. It is a quality that \nrequired an ability to listen. In Baker's case that meant being an \neloquent listener, a trait Senator Alexander put above all the others \nin Baker's formidable arsenal.\n  Here is how Senator Baker himself once put it:\n\n       There is a difference between hearing and understanding \n     what people say. You don't have to agree, but you have to \n     hear what they've got to say. And if you do, the chances are \n     much better you'll be able to translate that into a useful \n     position and even useful leadership.\n\n  Senator Alexander pointed out Howard Baker had courage. He helped \nround up the votes to ratify the Panama Canal Treaty even though he \nmust have known it would not help him much in a Republican primary for \nPresident, to put it mildly. When the integrity of our politics was at \nstake, he did not hesitate to take on a President of his own party in a \nvery public way--an impulse that one hopes lawmakers in both parties \ncould muster today if the integrity of our system called for it again.\n  But perhaps most important of all, Howard Baker was grounded. He had \nan important job to do, and he did it well, but he also kept a healthy \ndistance from his work. His photograph of President Reagan's inaugural \nin January 1981 illustrates the point. Just behind the new President we \ncan spot the Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill and the new Vice \nPresident George Bush. Then right there between them is a man holding \nup a camera to capture the moment. It is the new Senate majority leader \nstanding there like an ordinary spectator with a very good seat. It was \nHoward Baker.\n  Senator Alexander summed up Baker's groundedness this way: ``Howard \nBaker never stopped sounding like where he grew up.''\n  Senator Baker was a fixture here for decades, but Huntsville was \nalways home. Perhaps that is also why Senator Baker took his \nstewardship of the Senate so very seriously. He knew he was not going \nto be around forever and that meant he had a duty to make the Senate \nwork and to preserve it as a place where disputes and disagreements are \nsifted and sorted out and where stable, durable solutions are slowly \nbut surely achieved. It is how he earned the nickname ``the great \nconciliator.''\n  When Dan Quayle was a Senator here, he used to say: ``There's Howard \nBaker, and then there's the rest of us.''\n  Over the past week, we have been reminded of why that was, and I \nthank Senator Alexander for helping us remember why his friend and \nmentor meant so much to this country and this institution.\n  May the memory of Howard Henry Baker inspire us to be our best selves \nand even better Senators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/08/senate-section/article/S4236-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank Senator McConnell from Kentucky \nfor his eloquent remarks. One other thing I said at the funeral was \nthat Senator Baker had an eye for talent. In 1969, when I was a young \naide in the Nixon White House, Senator Baker came to me and said: ``You \nmight want to get to know that smart young legislative assistant for \nSenator Marlow Cook.'' That young legislative assistant was Mitch \nMcConnell. So I did get to know him.\n  I thank Senator McConnell for coming to the funeral. I thank Senator \nReid, our majority leader, for being there as well. They were there at \nthe front of that small church in Huntsville, TN. The Vice President \ncame. He sat there, met everybody, showed his respect for both former \nSenator Baker and his wife, former Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker. We \nTennesseans appreciated that courtesy by the Vice President, the \nmajority leader, and the minority leader very much.\n  There were a number of others there. Our Governor was there; Senator \nCorker and I, of course, were there; Senator Fred Thompson; majority \nleader Bill Frist, whom Senator Baker had mentored; Senator Pete \nDomenici, Senator Bill Brock, Senator Elizabeth Dole, and Senator \nBennett Johnston were also there; as well as Senator Jack Danforth, who \nmarried Howard and Nancy; and our former Governors, Winfield Dunn and \nDon Sundquist. It was a small church, but along with former Vice \nPresident Al Gore and the current Vice President and the majority \nleader, as well as the minority leader, there was real respect for the \nformer majority leader of the Senate.\n  I will not try to repeat what I said at the funeral, and it was a \nprivilege for me to be asked by the family to speak, but I did want to \nmake two comments briefly, one personal and one about the Senate.\n  The personal one that I said at the funeral was that I had tried to \nfollow the rule in Lamar Alexander's ``Little Plaid Book'' that when \ninvited to speak at a funeral, remember to mention the deceased more \noften than yourself and to talk more about Howard Baker than my \nrelationship with him, but that was hard to do. I waited until the end \nof my remarks to try to do that.\n  No one had more influence on my life over the last half century than \nHoward Baker. I came here with him in 1967 as his only legislative \nassistant. That is how many legislative assistants Senators had then. \nThey dealt mainly with one another, not through staff members. I came \nback in 1977 when suddenly he was elected Republican leader on his \nthird try by one vote, and I worked in the office that is now the \nRepublican leader's office for 3 months helping him find a permanent \nchief of staff until I went back to Tennessee.\n  Throughout my entire public life and private life, no one has had \nmore effect on me by virtue of his effort to encourage me--as well as \nmany other younger people who were working their way up in a variety of \nways--and as an example for how to do things.\n  My advice to younger people who want to know how to become involved \nin politics is to find someone whom you respect and admire, volunteer \nto go to work for them and do anything legal they ask you to do and \nlearn from them, both the good and the bad. I had the great privilege \nof working with the best.\n  To give one small example of how closely intertwined our lives have \nbecome, I had the same office he had in the Dirksen Office Building. I \nhad the same phone number he had in the Dirksen Office Building. If you \nopen the drawer of this desk, you will find scratched in the drawer the \nnames Baker, Thompson, and my name. I have the same desk on this floor.\n  As far as the Senate, just one story. A remarkably effective \npresentation at the funeral was made by the Reverend Martha Anne \nFairchild, who for 20 years has been the minister of the small \nPresbyterian church in Huntsville. She told a story about lightbulbs \nand Senator Baker.\n  He was on the Session, which is the governing body of the church. He \nwas an elder, and he insisted on coming to the meetings. She said that \nat one of the meetings of the Session the elders, who represent the \nmaybe 70 members of the church, fell into a discussion about new \nlightbulbs. It was pretty contentious, and eventually they resolved it \nbecause Senator Baker insisted that they discuss it all the way through \nto the end.\n  She talked with him later, and he said: ``Well, I could have pulled \nout my checkbook and written a check for the new lightbulbs, but I \nthought it was more important that the elders have a full and long \ndiscussion so they all could be comfortable with the decision they \nmade.''\n  That story about lightbulbs is how Howard Baker saw the U.S. Senate--\nas a forum for extended discussion where you have the patience to allow \neveryone to pretty well have their say in the hopes that you come to a \nconclusion that most of us are comfortable with and therefore the \ncountry is comfortable with it. He understood that you only govern a \ncomplex country such as ours by consensus. And whether it was \nlightbulbs or an 9-week debate on the Panama Canal during which there \nwere nearly 200 contentious amendments and reservations and arguments, \nyou have those discussion all the way through to the end.\n  It is said that these days are much more contentious than the days of \nHoward Baker. There are some things that are different today that make \nthat sort of discussion more difficult, but we shouldn't kid \nourselves--those weren't easy days either. Those were the days when \nVietnam veterans came home with Americans spitting on them. Those were \nthe days of Watergate. Those were the days of Social Security going \nbankrupt and a 9-week contentious debate on the Panama Canal. Those \nwere the days of the Equal Rights Amendment. Those were difficult days \ntoo. Senator Baker and Senator Byrd on the Democratic side were able, \ngenerally speaking, to allow the Senate to take up those big issues and \nhave an extended discussion all the way through to the end and come to \na result.\n  Most of us in this body have the same principles. Those principles \nall belong to what we call the American character. They include such \nprinciples as equal opportunity, liberty, and E pluribus unum. And most \nof our conflicts, the late Samuel Huntington used to say, are about \nresolving conflicts among those principles. For example, if we are \ntalking about immigration, we have a conflict between rule of law and \nequal opportunity, so how do we put those together and how do we come \nto a conclusion? Howard Baker saw the way to do that as bringing to the \nfloor a subject, hopefully with bipartisan support, and talking it all \nthe way through to the end until most Senators are comfortable with the \ndecision. His aid in that was, as Senator McConnell said, being an \neloquent listener. That is why he was admired by Members of both \nparties. In one poll in the 1980s, he was considered to be the most \nadmired Senator by Democrats and by Republicans. That is why Dan Quayle \nsaid: There is Howard Baker ``and then there's the rest of us \nSenators.''\n  So I think the memory of Howard Baker, his lesson for us, is that--\nwithout assigning any blame to the Republican side or the Democratic \nside--we don't need a change of rules to make the Senate function, we \nneed a change of behavior. Howard Baker's behavior is a very good \nexample, whether it was the Panama Canal, whether it was fixing Social \nSecurity, whether it was President Reagan's tax cuts, or whether it was \nresolving whether how to buy new lightbulbs for the First Presbyterian \nChurch of Huntsville, TN.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the remarks of \nMartha Anne Fairchild, the pastor of\n\n[[Page S4238]]\n\nthe First Presbyterian Church of Huntsville, TN, as well as two other \ndocuments, one by Arthur B. Culvahouse, Jr., who was Senator Baker's \nlegislative assistant and President Reagan's counsel. According to \nCulvahouse, Howard Baker told him that if the President did not truly \nknow about the diversion of Iranian arms sales proceeds to the Contras, \nhe was to help him--if he did not truly know. The other is an article \nby Keel Hunt from the Tennessean about Senator Baker, and finally the \nfuneral order of worship from the Baker ceremony.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   In Memory of Howard H. Baker, Jr.\n\n\n    Funeral sermon by The Rev. Martha Anne Fairchild, Pastor, First \n               Presbyterian Church, Huntsville, Tennessee\n\n       Dear friends, thank you for your presence here this \n     afternoon. Thank you for joining us as we gather to remember \n     and give thanks for the remarkable life of Howard H. Baker, \n     Jr., We are grateful and honored that you are here with us.\n       I would like to read one more Scripture lesson, one with \n     opening words that may surprise you. But as I continue \n     reading, you will understand why I chose it. It was written \n     by the Apostle Paul, from a prison cell, perhaps within a \n     very short time before his own death. He was writing to a \n     community of faithful Christians he held in such high esteem \n     that he considered them to be equal co-workers with him in \n     the work of Christ, and he wrote these words at the end of a \n     letter full of tender concern and advice for dear friends he \n     knew he might never see again. Here are Paul's words from the \n     fourth chapter of his letter to the church at Philippi: \n     (Philippians 4:4-9)\n       ``Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice! \n     Let your gentleness be known to everyone. The Lord is near. \n     Do not worry about anything, but in everything by prayer and \n     supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made \n     known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all \n     understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in \n     Christ Jesus.\n       ``Finally, beloved, whatever is true, whatever is \n     honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is \n     pleasing, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence \n     and if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these \n     things. Keep on doing the things that you have learned and \n     received and heard and seen in me, and the God of peace will \n     be with you.''\n       ``Rejoice in the Lord always,'' Paul says. I'll admit it, \n     those are odd words for a funeral sermon. We may be \n     celebrating the life of a great man, but we do not feel much \n     like rejoicing. Our feelings are too bittersweet for that. We \n     have lost someone we loved deeply, someone who was an immense \n     influence for good not only in our own country but around the \n     world. How is rejoicing part of this picture? How can we say, \n     ``Rejoice!''\n       Rejoicing is part of the picture for us for the same reason \n     it was part of the picture for Paul. Paul was nearing his own \n     death. He had already lost his freedom--he was writing this \n     letter from a prison cell. He was writing to people he would \n     never see again. In the stark conditions of imprisonment in \n     the first century, he was suffering physically, in chains and \n     without sufficient food or clothing, often alone and in pain, \n     with no certainty about what would happen to him. Yet he \n     invites us to rejoice, because the sources of his joy were \n     not tied to his particular difficult circumstances. They were \n     tied to the kind of man he was.\n       Can we quiet our hearts enough to hear his words? ``Let \n     your gentleness be known to everyone.'' In gentleness Paul \n     found the key that led him into the surrender of worry, into \n     a life of prayer, and above all else into a peace beyond \n     human understanding. This gentleness, this prayer, this \n     peace, made it possible for him to live in joy whatever his \n     circumstances and to invite his friends to do exactly the \n     same.\n       I chose to read these words today because we are saying \n     goodbye to a supremely gentle man. Howard Baker embodied in \n     his life all the qualities Paul commends to our reflection \n     and attention. He was a true, honorable, and just man. He \n     lived a pure, pleasing, and commendable life, and surely he \n     was a man of excellence and worthy of praise. In a public \n     life spanning decades of serious, selfless service to his \n     country, Howard Baker embodied every public virtue.\n       Of his public virtues, in fact, so much has been said over \n     the past few days that I can add very little. So I share with \n     you something of the gentleness Howard Baker shared with his \n     church. He was a member of this congregation from his \n     childhood, and one of the most faithful attenders of public \n     worship I have ever known. When he was in town, he was in \n     church on Sunday morning--it was one of his priorities. There \n     is an old catch phrase about sharing time, talents, and \n     treasure with one's church, and Howard Baker shared all those \n     things: He shared his time with his faithful attendance at \n     worship and church events. He shared his talents with his \n     photography of church happenings from Homecoming to Easter \n     egg hunts, and of course his cooking prowess when got up \n     early on Easter Sunday to join the other church men cooking \n     breakfast--his particular talent was putting the biscuits in \n     the oven and getting them out on time. He shared his treasure \n     in a lifetime of generous financial support of the church. \n     But most of all Howard Baker supported this church with his \n     presence.\n       Here is an example. Some years ago the congregation of this \n     church elected him as a ruling elder, a lifelong position in \n     our denomination. His election placed him in active service \n     on our church board, called the Session, for a three year \n     term. Now, I must share a little secret with you. Session \n     meetings only rarely concern matters of any great import. So \n     I mentioned to him that I understood the many demands he had \n     on his time, and offered him a blanket excused absence for \n     any meeting he needed to miss. That was a mistake. He was \n     quite offended by this suggestion of mine and told me \n     firmly--but very gently--that he intended to make every \n     meeting. And that is what he did, on one occasion even flying \n     in for our evening meeting and flying out again that very \n     same night to meet a commitment elsewhere the following day. \n     When Howard Baker made a promise, he kept it.\n       At every meeting, he was an attentive, helpful, encouraging \n     elder among fellow elders. He tried to get all of us to call \n     him Howard, and some of us managed to do that and some of us \n     never could. Even when the discussion revolved around the \n     purchase of new light bulbs--yes, I know all those jokes, \n     too--he was patient and helpful in not only contributing to \n     the discussion but in helping me as his moderator to guide it \n     to a conclusion. He told me later he considered just pulling \n     out his checkbook and writing a check for the bulbs we were \n     dithering over, but he wanted his fellow elders to go through \n     the process of making a decision we were all comfortable \n     with. And for that he was willing to devote a little more \n     time, a little more patience, and, yes, a little more love to \n     the task.\n       When he accepted President Bush's appointment to become the \n     United States Ambassador to Japan, his term of active service \n     on the Session was not quite over. It was necessary for him \n     to resign, and he called me to apologize that he could not \n     complete his term. It may seem that no apologies would be \n     necessary, but he reminded me that he had made a commitment \n     to serve his church, and he truly regretted being unable to \n     complete that commitment.\n       I am humbly grateful that he was so willing to accept me as \n     his pastor when I came here almost 20 years ago, a woman only \n     a few years out of seminary who still had much to learn about \n     the serious business of Christian ministry. From the very \n     beginning he treated me with affection and respect, and I \n     hope I have learned from him.\n       One of the things we all admire him for was his gift of \n     attention. Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the great 20th century \n     Christian theologian and martyr, once remarked, ``The first \n     duty one owes to others in the fellowship is to listen to \n     them.'' Howard Baker had a deep commitment to listening. When \n     you talked to him he paid attention to you--even if he could \n     only speak to you for 60 seconds, you had his focused \n     attention for that entire 60 seconds. You knew he heard you. \n     And every time you came away a little encouraged, a little \n     cheered, a little more content, because he had paid \n     attention--that great gift of being listened to that we all \n     hunger to receive.\n       Among the questions a Presbyterian elder must answer in the \n     affirmative at his or her ordination is this one: ``Will you \n     seek to serve the people with energy, intelligence, \n     imagination, and love?'' That is a vow every leader should \n     take. It is a vow Howard Baker lived up to in his entire life \n     of service, for that is what he was: a servant leader, one \n     who embodied not only the qualities of courage, confidence, \n     and consensus-building that were the hallmarks of his public \n     life, but also the qualities of humility, good humor, and \n     selfless love that made those other qualities possible. He \n     was a servant leader in the truest sense of the term.\n       As we remember him for his gentleness, his good humor, his \n     deep wisdom, as we recall shared moments of tears and \n     laughter, tense times of debate and controversy, satisfying \n     times of concord and shared accomplishment, as we pay tribute \n     to him for his deep love for his family, for his unwavering \n     devotion to the well-being of his country, and even for his \n     unfailing appetite for all things chocolate and sweet, \n     perhaps you can see why I think we must say with Paul, \n     ``Rejoice in the Lord always!'' By God's great gifts to him, \n     Howard Baker became a great gift to us. And surely that great \n     gift is worth rejoicing over always.\n       Shortly we will follow his casket out to the cemetery \n     adjacent to this church. When we go I invite you to remember \n     that across the street from that cemetery once stood the \n     house where Howard Baker was born. We will be laying him to \n     rest just a few hundred feet from where his life began. In \n     the completion of that great life well lived, I hope that, \n     even in the midst of our sorrow, we will find cause to \n     rejoice always.\n       Thanks be to God for the life of Howard Baker. Thanks be to \n     God.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the National Review Online, July 2, 2014]\n\n             Howard Baker Jr., Courageous Constitutionalist\n\n                     (By Arthur B. Culvahouse, Jr.)\n\n       Many of the recent obituaries of Howard Baker, the former \n     Senate majority leader,\n\n[[Page S4239]]\n\n     White House chief of staff, and U.S. ambassador to Japan, \n     quote Jim Baker's accurate observation that Howard was a \n     ``mediator, negotiator, and moderator.'' As a son of a \n     congressmen, a son-in-law of Senator Everett Dirksen's, and a \n     three-term senator, Howard understood that transacting the \n     people's business required at least 51 votes in the Senate \n     and 218 votes in the House. On the tough votes that require \n     leadership and political courage, he knew that the necessary \n     majority was to be found on both sides of the aisle.\n       Contrary to recent suggestions by approving left-leaning \n     news commentators and critics on the inexperienced right, \n     Howard Baker's interpretation of acceptable ``compromise'' \n     did not entail splitting the difference or seeking a watered-\n     down consensus. As Bob Dole observed, Howard Baker believed, \n     along with Ronald Reagan, that achieving 70 percent or more \n     of one's priorities is a victory in our democracy. Above all, \n     Howard Baker was the most civil and respectful person I have \n     known. As a consequence, he had many friends across the \n     political and policy spectrums who would give his views a \n     fair and careful hearing.\n       Howard Baker exercised political courage wisely and with \n     the intention to win. His views, even when they were in the \n     minority in the Republican caucus and among Tennessee voters, \n     were the result of careful study and measured against long-\n     term national interests. His support for the Panama Canal \n     Treaty, for instance, clearly damaged his prospects in the \n     1980 Republican presidential primaries, and his leadership in \n     securing passage of the Clean Air Act and strip-mine \n     reclamation disappointed his friends and neighbors in the \n     coal country of East Tennessee. Those and other unpopular \n     votes did not occur in isolation; they were co-joined and \n     hedged by his unrelenting support for a strong military, for \n     nuclear power and coal gasification, and for dispensing with \n     the prolonged environmental review of the Alyeska Pipeline.\n       Jim Neal, the renowned Tennessee trial lawyer and Kennedy-\n     administration prosecutor, presciently predicted that Howard, \n     owing to his ``strong moral compass,'' would be the star of \n     the Senate Watergate Committee. From announcing at the \n     beginning of the Watergate Committee hearings that ``he would \n     follow every lead, unrestrained by any fear of where that \n     lead might ultimately take us,'' to assembling a minority \n     staff that discovered the existence of the Nixon Oval Office \n     tapes, to making the motion that the Committee subpoena the \n     tapes, Howard set aside partisan considerations and led the \n     effort to find the answers to the key question: ``What did \n     the President know and when did he know it?'' In 1987, when \n     he was the new Reagan White House chief of staff, Howard \n     instructed me that my job as the recently appointed White \n     House counsel was to guide and advise President Reagan \n     through the Iran-Contra investigations without his being \n     impeached--if the president truly did not know about the \n     diversion of Iranian arms-sales proceeds to the Contras. \n     Query how many current and recent senior officials would \n     append that all-important modifier: if.\n       In his farewell speech to the Senate, Howard stated that \n     ``our wisest course is to follow the Constitution rather than \n     improvise around it.'' He expressed deep concern that the \n     Clinton impeachment proceeding votes were along party lines \n     and that we were reaping the whirlwind of the Watergate \n     convulsion--that we had not learned our lesson but were \n     instead enacting ill-advised and constitutionally suspect \n     laws that were no substitute for judging the character of our \n     leaders on a non-partisan basis.\n       I have no doubt that if Howard Baker and his long-time \n     Democratic counterpart in the Senate leadership, Robert Byrd, \n     were in the Senate today, both would be working together to \n     put an end to the current (and any other) administration's \n     blatant disregard of congressionally enacted statutes. In \n     that vein, Howard instructed me and other senior Reagan-\n     administration lawyers to drop our objections to the Senate's \n     proposed ``ratification record'' underlying the Intermediate \n     Nuclear Forces Treaty; that was the Senate's prerogative, \n     Howard reminded me, and the president wanted the INF Treaty \n     ratified as part of his strategy to end, and win, the Cold \n     War.\n       Shortly before the 2010 midterm congressional elections, I \n     visited with Howard Baker at his home in the mountains of \n     East Tennessee. When I expressed concern about the dramatic \n     swings in the recent election results, he replied: ``I taught \n     you better than that. Those swings are the self-corrections \n     built into our republican form of government.'' All of us are \n     well-advised to reflect upon the teachings of Howard H. Baker \n     Jr.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the Tennessean, June 29, 2014]\n\n        Howard Baker's Legacy: ``The Other Guy Might Be Right''\n\n                             (By Keel Hunt)\n\n       For Tennesseans who knew Howard Baker in his day, the news \n     of his death on Thursday brought an afternoon of emptiness, \n     feelings of great loss, and a deep sense that one very \n     special had left the building.\n       There are certainly people who knew him better than I did, \n     but in my own memory this man of moderate height looms larger \n     than life. Let me count the ways.\n       Baker was a master politician, the great conciliator and a \n     builder of human bridges.\n       Especially from the vantage point of this current angry \n     age, Baker's gifts shine brightly now: that calming voice, \n     the steady temperament, his gift for reaching out and drawing \n     people together, a knack for reasoned compromise, his abiding \n     sense of how government can and should work.\n       Today, you hear some of those terms attacked, by the people \n     who thrive on dividing, as being somehow unpatriotic. Baker's \n     life was a demonstration of how politics and the skills of \n     collaboration are noble, of how government can work to move \n     society forward.\n       Hearing both sides of an issue, finding the common ground--\n     these are the gifts we associate with Baker now and all the \n     moderate politicians he inspired (see below). This is how \n     good government happens.\n       He often quoted his own father, U.S. Rep. Howard Baker Sr., \n     who told him: ``You should always go through life working on \n     the assumption that the other guy might be right.'' His \n     stepmother once said of Baker Jr., ``He's like the Tennessee \n     River--he flows right down the middle.''\n       Before politics, Baker was reared in tiny Huntsville, in \n     Scott County, and educated in Chattanooga, Sewanee and \n     Knoxville. In the early 1960s, by this time a lawyer working \n     in Huntsville and Knoxville, he became an architect of the \n     modern Republican Party in Tennessee.\n       In 1964, wanting to mount his own campaign for U.S. Senate, \n     Baker allied with Republican organizers at the far end of the \n     state in Memphis and Shelby County, notably the lawyers Lewis \n     Donelson and Harry Wellford. Together, they laid the \n     foundation for a two-party state.\n       Baker's aim was to fill the unexpired term of Sen. Estes \n     Kefauver, who had died, and he came very close to winning. \n     But it was a Democratic year driven by national factors well \n     beyond his control: Barry Goldwater, the GOP's presidential \n     nominee, came to Tennessee saying TVA ought to be sold; and \n     Lyndon Johnson, who had succeeded President John F. Kennedy \n     after the assassination, would win in a landslide.\n       Two years later, the statewide coalition that Baker and the \n     Shelby Countians formed scored its first victory, with Baker \n     winning the Senate seat for a full term. He was the first \n     Republican since Reconstruction to be elected statewide in \n     Tennessee. Four years after that, there were two more GOP \n     victories statewide: Winfield Dunn was elected governor, and \n     the Chattanooga U.S. Rep. Bill Brock joined Baker in the \n     Senate.\n       Today, three decades on, two generations of political \n     leaders can be seen in the Baker lineage: Lamar Alexander, \n     Bob Corker, Bill Haslam, Fred Thompson, Bill Frist, Don \n     Sundquist.\n       Alexander, very early in his career, was Baker's top \n     legislative aide, and left that office in 1970 to be Dunn's \n     campaign manager. In 1973, Baker made Thompson minority \n     counsel to the Senate Watergate Committee, putting him on TV \n     screens across America. Haslam, in 1978, worked in Baker's \n     re-election office. Corker and Haslam became mayors of \n     Chattanooga and Knoxville, respectively, and later on senator \n     and governor.\n       Baker had a way with Democrats, too. He was the first \n     Republican ever endorsed by The Tennessean, in its partisan \n     Democratic heyday. The editorial on this page that supported \n     him was a breakthrough in Democratic territory for Baker's \n     East-West alliance.\n       When President Jimmy Carter proposed the Panama Canal \n     Treaty, handing the canal over to Panama, Baker was a key \n     advocate on the Senate floor when it passed.\n       Plenty will be written this week about his roles on the \n     national and global stages--as Senate majority leader, \n     President Reagan's chief of staff, ambassador to Japan. But \n     through it all, and more so than many senators who have \n     become national politicians, Baker also stayed close to his \n     Tennessee roots.\n       One morning long ago, two years into his second term, I was \n     in a room full of reporters in Washington, D.C., and heard \n     the senator say: ``I am from Huntsville, Tennessee, which is \n     the center of the known universe.''\n       That is where, on Tuesday afternoon, he will come to his \n     final rest.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                        Funeral Order of Worship\n\n     Prelude\n     *Entrance of the Family\n     *Sentences of Scripture\n     *Hymn  America the Beautiful\n\n     O beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain,\n     For purple mountain majesties above the fruited plain!\n     America!

I thank the Senate for this time, and I yield the \nfloor for my colleague from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. I would like to join our distinguished leader Mitch \nMcConnell in seconding the comments about the presentation the senior \nSenator from Tennessee made at the Howard Baker funeral.\n  It is a great privilege for us to serve in this body. While times are \ntough relative to our ability or willingness to solve some of the major \nproblems, many of the major problems of our Nation today--and sometimes \nthere are comments made about serving in the Senate--what I say to \npeople back home is that if any of us ever forget what a privilege it \nis to serve, we should go home. That privilege allows us to meet people \nand to be in conversation with people like Howard Baker who affect us \nand cause us to be better people. It also allows us to witness what \ntook place last week. I have to say I have seen Senator Alexander on \nmany occasions say and do things that I thought were impressive. I \ndon't think I have ever seen anything that measures up to what was said \nin that small Presbyterian church last week. I think all of us were \ntouched. The Senator had a lot of good material to work with and was \ndescribing a man who probably has had more effect in a positive way on \nTennessee politics--in many ways, national politics--like Howard Baker.\n  He was an inspiration to all of us. When we were around him, his \ngraciousness and humility caused all of us to be much better people. \nHis encouragement, especially when dealing with tough issues, I think \ncaused all of us to want to strive even harder to be better Senators \nand better people.\n  I certainly cannot give the comments with the eloquence the Senator \ngave last week and certainly the ones just given. I know you and he \nwere very close, and he impacted you more than any other person outside \nyour immediate family, but he had an impact on all of us. He had an \nimpact on this Nation. It is a great honor and privilege to stand with \nthe Senator today to acknowledge Senator Baker's greatness as a person, \nhis greatness as a Senator.\n  Many times we see presentations as people talk about someone's life, \nand a lot of times that is embellished. I will say in this case none of \nit was. It was all about the man serving here in the Senate but also \nserving in that small church in Huntsville, TN, to which he was so \nloyal.\n  I thank the Senator for the opportunity to serve with him. I know \neach of us strives to carry out those characteristics Howard Baker so \nwisely showed us, and I do agree that the Senate would be a much better \nplace if all of us could embody those characteristics most of the time.\n  I thank the senior Senator for his leadership and for his comments.\n  I thank our distinguished minority leader, during a time of great \nbusy-ness in his own personal life, for taking the time to be a part of \nsomething that I think is meaningful to him also.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have been moved by the comments from the Senators \nregarding Senator Baker. The story the senior Senator from Tennessee \ntold about the lightbulbs is--those of us who knew Senator Baker could \nwell understand that. He was a man who brought Senators together--both \nparties.\n  I will tell two very quick stories. One is referencing a leadership \nrace won by one vote. He had called a good friend of his, who was at \nhome on official business, and said: I know the press says I am going \nto lose this race, but I know you are voting for me. Can you come back \nand vote?\n  That Senator did. The Senator was the then-senior Senator from \nVermont, Robert Stafford, and he flew back to get to the caucus to vote \nfor his friend Howard Baker--the first one by one vote; all the rest by \nacclamation. I know this because both Senator Stafford and Howard Baker \ntold me that story. They were also two of the finest Senators with whom \nI have ever served. Both tried to work things out.\n  My other story is we were going to be in session until midnight one \nnight on a technically contested matter.\n  Senator Ted Stevens and I and a few others went to see Howard Baker, \nwho was the majority leader. We talked about the issue that was \ndivisive. We said: We think we have a solution. We have all been \ntalking. We can work it out but it is going to take some time for the \ndrafting. Could you recess and not stay until midnight when all it is \ngoing to do is exacerbate tempers? Come back in the morning and we will \nhave it all worked out, and we will get this done.\n  Senator Baker knew that we were all Senators in both parties who kept \nour word. He said: ``Of course.'' So we recessed. Now, as the Senator \nfrom Tennessee knows, we have cloakrooms here in the back of this \nChamber. We all--if we have late-night votes, most of us hang around \nthe cloakroom between votes. At that time they had beautiful stained \nglass windows in the alcoves.\n  We recessed and went home. An hour or so after we went home a bomb \nwent off out here in the corridor. When we came in the next morning, \nthis place looked like a war zone. Shards of glass from those windows \nin both cloakrooms were embedded in the walls. The door to where the \ndistinguished Republican deputy leader has his office now was blown in, \nthe stained window above of it was ruined. Paintings out here were \nshredded, and some of the marble busts of former vice presidents were \ndamaged. You could smell the gunpowder of the explosive when we came to \nwork.\n  I mention this because his form of leadership was that if we could \nget together and work things out, he preferred we do that. He would \nencourage it--both Republicans and Democrats. Then because he could \nrely on those of us--again both Republicans and Democrats--who would \nkeep our word, he agreed to that. We knew he would keep his word.\n  I wonder how many lives of Senators were saved that night because of \nthat. How many would have been terribly injured. Of course our staffs \nwho work often long after we have gone--how many people could have been \nharmed if it had not been for the fact that the Senate was a different \nplace, and I believe a better place.\n  But I say this not so much to tell historical stories, but I say this \nout of my great respect for Howard Baker. Somebody calculated the other \nday that I\n\n[[Page S4241]]\n\nhave served with 18 percent of all of the Senators since the beginning \nof this country. If I put my tiny handful of the best, Howard Baker is \nin there, hands down--a wonderful, wonderful man. He was a Senator's \nSenator. He believed in the Senate. He believed what a privilege it was \nto serve here.\n  He believed that the Senate could be the conscience of the Nation. I \nappreciate the tribute that was paid by my dear friend, the senior \nSenator from Tennessee, who I knew as Governor and as Cabinet member. \nWe have always had a good personal relationship. I listened to his \ntales of Howard Baker. His colleague from Tennessee painted quite a \npicture of him. I thank them for doing that. I thank them for adding to \nthe history of the Senate by doing it.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

These tiny explosives, about the size of a hockey puck or a \ncan of soup, can kill a child or blow the legs and arms off an adult. \nThey are triggered by the victim. In other words, unlike a gun that a \nsoldier aims and fires or a bomb that is dropped and explodes on a \ntarget, landmines sit there and wait for their victims.\n  It could be hours or days or weeks, even years. But however long it \nis after they are scattered and hidden beneath a layer of sand or dirt, \nthey explode when an unsuspecting person, whether a combatant or an \ninnocent civilian, steps on it or triggers it with a plow or a \nwheelbarrow or a bicycle. That person's life is changed forever.\n  In many countries where there are few doctors, landmine victims bleed \nto death. Those who survive with a leg or both legs gone are the lucky \nones. This girl is an example of who I am talking about. We do not know \nher nationality, but the picture tells a lot. She is learning to walk \non artificial legs. Her life has been made immeasurably harder because \nof a landmine that probably cost less than $2. I have a granddaughter \nnot much older than her.\n  Each of these photographs tell a similar story. None of these people \nwere combatants. Each are facing lives of pain, and sometimes in their \ncommunities stigmatization because of weapons that are designed to be \nindiscriminate.\n  The Leahy War Victims Fund has helped some of them, as this \nphotograph taken in Vietnam shows. My wife Marcelle and I have seen the \ndifference the Fund has made, but I wish there were no need for it \nbecause there would be no landmines.\n  Over the years, as people around the world became aware of the \nlandmine problem, they took action. The Senate was the first \nlegislative body in the world to ban exports of antipersonnel \nlandmines. I am proud of writing that amendment. Other countries soon \nfollowed our example.\n  And there were others, especially Canada's former Foreign Minister \nLloyd Axworthy and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. Thanks \nto them an international treaty outlawing the weapons has been joined \nby 161 countries. I regret that the United States, of all the NATO \ncountries, is the only one that has not joined, even though the U.S. \nmilitary has not used antipersonnel mines for 22 years, despite two \nlong wars.\n  On June 27, though, the Obama administration finally took a step--it \nis an incremental step, but it is a significant one--to put the United \nStates on a path to join the treaty. Although the United States has not \nproduced or purchased antipersonnel mines since the 1990s, the White \nHouse announced that as a matter of official policy that it will no \nlonger produce or otherwise acquire antipersonnel mines, nor will the \nPentagon replenish its stockpile of mines as they become obsolete.\n  Our closest allies and many others around the world welcomed this \nstep, even though it falls far short of what supporters of the treaty \nhave called for.\n  But one senior Member of the House of Representatives immediately \naccused President Obama of ignoring U.S. military commanders, some of \nwhom have defended the use of landmines, just as the military defended \npoison gas a century ago when nations acted to ban it.\n  This Member of the House said: The President ``owes our military an \nexplanation for ignoring their advice'', and he went on to say that \nthis decision represents an ``expensive solution in search of a \nnonexistent problem.''\n  A Member of our body, the Senate, called the announcement a ``brazen \nattempt by the President to circumvent the constitutional \nresponsibility of the Senate to provide advice and consent to \ninternational treaties that bind the United States.''\n  These are strong words. They make great sound bites for the press. \nBut the truth lies elsewhere.\n  Over the years, the White House has consulted closely with the \nPentagon, including about this decision. The policy just announced \nsimply makes official what has been an informal fact for at least 17 \nyears through three Presidential administrations.\n  It also ignores the fact that the United States has neither joined \nthe treaty nor has the President sent it to the Senate for \nratification, so the President has obviously not circumvented the \nSenate's advice and consent role.\n  And it ignores that every one of our NATO allies and most of our \ncoalition partners have renounced antipersonnel mines, as have dozens \nof countries that could never dream of having a powerful, modern army \nas we do--countries that look to the United States, the most powerful \nNation on Earth, but they got rid of their landmines.\n  The naysayers' argument is simple. It goes like this: The United \nStates is no longer causing the misery captured in these photographs, \nso why should we join the treaty? Does that mean they also oppose the \nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, such as the \ncrippled people in this photograph? Do they oppose the Chemical Weapons \nTreaty, and every other treaty dealing with international relations \nthat the United States has joined since the time of George Washington?\n  Does the fact that we are not causing a problem, that we do not use \nlandmines or chemical weapons, absolve us from having a responsibility \nto be part of an international treaty to stop it? Of course not. The \nworld looks to the United States for leadership.\n  In 1992, if the Senate had accepted the argument now being made this \nbody would never have voted 100 to 0 to ban the export of antipersonnel \nlandmines.\n  I suppose those in the House who criticize President Obama today \nwould say the entire Senate was wrong 22 years ago. Those 100 Democrats \nand Republicans who voted back then to ban U.S. exports of \nantipersonnel mines understood that while the United States may not \nhave been causing the problem, we needed to be part of the solution. \nThe same holds true today.\n  In 1996 President Clinton called on the Pentagon to develop \nalternatives to antipersonnel mines, whether they were technological or \ndoctrinal alternatives. He was Commander in Chief, but the Pentagon \nlargely ignored him. But now 18 years later it needs to be done. Not at \nsome unspecified time in the future but by a reasonable deadline--\nbecause it can be done.\n  Now, I am not so naive to think that a treaty will prevent every last \nperson on Earth from using landmines. But if people use them, they pay \na price for using them. Bashar Assad used poison gas, but look at the \npolitical price he paid. Are those who oppose the landmine treaty so \ndismissive of the benefits of outlawing and stigmatizing a weapon like \nIEDs, which pose a danger to our own troops?\n  Rather than opposing a treaty that will make it a war crime to use \nlandmines against our troops, why not support the mine-breaching \ntechnology they need to protect themselves?\n  I always come back to the photographs. I have met many people like \nthese. They may not be Americans, but what happened to them happens to\n\n[[Page S4242]]\n\nthousands of others like them each year. The United States can help \nstop it. It is a moral issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono).

Madam President, yesterday at 6 p.m. on Capitol Hill \nthere was a gathering at a nearby restaurant known as The Monocle. It \nwas a gathering of former staffers of U.S. Senator Alan Dixon of \nIllinois. They picked The Monocle because he would have picked it. It \nwas his favorite place on Capitol Hill. And it was a sad day, because \nSenator Dixon passed away Sunday morning in Fairview Heights, IL.\n  His staff gathered at The Monocle the next day, which would have been \nhis birthday, to toast him and to pay tribute to a great boss, a great \nfriend, and a great Senator from the State of Illinois.\n  Senator Dixon passed away in his sleep in the early hours on Sunday \nmorning. His son Jeff had dropped him off at home, and he was there \nwith his wife Jody when he passed away. So instead of celebrating his \nbirthday on Monday, we had a day of remembrance of an extraordinary \npublic servant for the State of Illinois.\n  Alan Dixon used to be known in political circles as Al the Pal, and \nhe loved it. It really described him. For him, friendship and loyalty \nwere everything. It showed in his life and, I think, was a great part \nof his success.\n  He was a person who gloried in representing Illinois. He never \nharbored any national ambitions. Being a Senator from Illinois was his \ngoal in life. He reached it and performed so well as Senator that he is \nfondly remembered by many who served with him in the House and in the \nSenate.\n  He represented an old-school style of politics. He believed in his \nheart that people of good will could find common ground if they worked \nat it. He knew how to make this government work, how to make this \nSenate work, and work for the State of Illinois.\n  In his memoir, which he published last year, he wrote:\n\n       Generally speaking, my political career was built on good \n     will and accommodation.\n\n  He was known by Senators on both sides of the aisle as a friendly, \nhelpful, articulate, and effective colleague.\n  He was a downstate guy in our State. He grew up in Belleville and St. \nClair County, not too far away from my hometown of East St. Louis. He \ngrew up just across the river from the great city of St. Louis. His dad \nowned and ran the Dixon Wine and Liquor Company in Belleville.\n  Alan served in World War II, in the U.S. Navy Air Corps. After the \nwar, he went to the University of Illinois where they had a special \narrangement for vets to earn a bachelor's degree. He went for a short \ntime to the University of Illinois Law School and then, when his dad's \nbusiness was struggling, he transferred to Washington University Law \nSchool where he graduated second in his class.\n  In 1948, at the age of 21, a neighbor said: Alan, I have been \nwatching you and I think you ought to consider running for police \nmagistrate in Belleville, IL. Alan hadn't even graduated from law \nschool, and his friend reminded him you didn't have to be a lawyer to \nbe a police magistrate in those days. So he ran and he won.\n  Two years later, after getting out of law school and passing the bar, \nboth in Missouri and Illinois, he was elected to the Illinois House of \nRepresentatives--the youngest member ever elected to the Illinois \nGeneral Assembly. His starting salary: $3,000.\n  He went on to become one of the most successful vote-getters in the \nhistory of the State of Illinois. He won 29 consecutive bids for public \noffice, for State representative, State senator, secretary of state, \nand state treasurer. During one of those races, he carried all 102 \ncounties in Illinois, all 30 townships in Cook County, and all 50 \nwards. That is a record I don't think anybody will ever break.\n  When he served in Springfield, IL, as a State representative and a \nState senator, he did a lot of things, but he pointed with pride to his \npassage of a constitutional change in Illinois to finally modernize our \njudiciary. He remembered his days as police magistrate and thought our \nsystem of justice had to be brought into the 20th century. Alan Dixon \nof Belleville, IL, led that effort--an enormous political lift. He got \nit done. He was effective. People trusted him and they respected him.\n  He led an unpopular fight against loyalty oaths during the McCarthy \nera, and he helped create the Illinois college system.\n  In 1980, the people of Illinois chose Alan Dixon to represent them \nhere in the Senate. He teamed up with his old friend a couple years \nlater who had joined him in the Illinois General Assembly, his seatmate \nin the Assembly, a man named Paul Simon. Senator Dixon and then-\nCongressman Paul Simon, soon to be Senator Paul Simon, were colleagues \nand buddies and business partners. What an unlikely duo. There was Paul \nSimon who might be persuaded once in a blue moon to drink a little \nglass of wine, and there was Alan Dixon who loved that cold beer that \nhe grew up with in Belleville, IL. But the two of them were fast \nfriends. I witnessed that friendship over the years. I didn't see the \nearly days when they owned newspapers together--Paul was a newspaper \nman and Alan more an investor--but I did witness the political part of \nthat friendship, and it was amazing to see.\n\n  There were moments in their lives when the two of them could have \nclashed over their political ambitions, but they always worked it out. \nThey were always friends, and that made a big difference in both of \ntheir lives.\n  It was Alan Dixon as Senator who came up with an idea that had never \nbeen tried before in Illinois: He decided to try to get all of the \nmembers of the Illinois congressional delegation--Democrats and \nRepublicans--together for lunch on a regular basis. Well, he had to \npersuade a few of the oldtimers who weren't really open to the idea, \nbut it was his personality and his determination that got it done, a \ntradition which continues to this day.\n  In his 12 years in the Senate, Alan Dixon didn't forget where he came \nfrom. He remembered growing up in a family of modest means in \nBelleville. He remembered those tough summer jobs--and there were \nplenty of them. And he never forgot the working people he represented \nin St. Clair County and across the State of Illinois.\n  Alan was at the top of his game and in the strongest voice when it \ncame to standing up for working people and the little guy. He fought \nfor affordable housing and lending practices. He denounced wasteful \nspending and created a procurement czar to oversee spending at the \nPentagon.\n  One of the things which he is remembered for as a Senator was \ndeciding to personally test a new weapons system. They sent him down to \ntest the Sergeant York gun. They put him in a helmet and sat him on the \ngun. He was going to test it and fire it, and he soon discovered the \ngun was a dud--it couldn't shoot straight. He came back and reported it \nto his colleagues in the Senate, including Senator Sam Nunn, and they \nwent along with Senator Dixon and said: We are going to junk this \nproject. It is a waste of taxpayers' money.\n  It was Alan Dixon who called for tougher oversight of the savings and \nloan industry and vigorous prosecution of scam artists who defrauded \nS and left taxpayers holding the bag.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S4242, July 8, 2014, the Record reads:He was a downstate \nguy in our State.

And he never forgot \nthe working people he represented in St. Clair County andacross \nthe State of Illinois. It was Alan Dixon who called for tougher \noversight of the savings and loan industry and vigorous \nprosecution of scam artists who defrauded S and left taxpayers \nholding the bag.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  In 1992, Alan lost his bid for reelection to the Senate in a hotly \ncontested three-way primary. It was the political upset of the year. It \nisn't often around here that a Senator would lose in a primary race for \nreelection--and a lot of people were wondering, his first political \nloss, how would it affect Alan Dixon.\n  Election night, Alan stood up and gave the most heartfelt, touching \nspeech I can ever remember of a person who lost a campaign. It was \nrepeated over and over that he was a real gentleman, and his words that \nhe had to say even in defeat added to his reputation as a fine, honest, \ngreat public servant. A tearful crowd listened as he said he had \n``loved every golden moment'' of his time in politics.\n  His fellow Democratic Senators had twice unanimously elected him to \nserve as chief deputy whip. After his loss in that election and then \nretirement, he was praised on the floor of the Senate by not only Ted \nKennedy and George Mitchell but Bob Dole and Strom Thurmond as well.\n  In 1995, his public life was resumed when President Clinton appointed \nAlan\n\n[[Page S4243]]\n\nDixon to chair the base closure commission known as the Defense Base \nRealignment and Closure Commission. It made sense. As a Senator, Alan \nDixon had written the section of the Defense authorization bill that \ncreated the BRAC.\n  Here was a man who had spent his entire career making political \nfriends, but now he took on a job that was bound to test some of those \nfriendships. He accepted that assignment because the President asked, \nand Dixon knew it was right for America. It was the same decision he \nmade when he enlisted to serve in World War II.\n  Last October, Alan Dixon published his memoirs with the appropriate \ntitle ``The Gentleman From Illinois.'' He returned to Washington \nbriefly with Jody and members of the family to head on over to his \nfavorite Capitol Hill restaurant, The Monocle. It is about a stone's \nthrow from the Dirksen Senate Office Building where he used to have his \nold meetings in his office. The Monocle was the place where, \nafterwards, you joined for bipartisan dinners and a lot of good times.\n  Alan Dixon told his old friends gathered at The Monocle that evening:\n\n       What this country needs now is more friends on the Hill \n     working together and talking together, and working for \n     solutions that will serve the interest of the public.\n\n  Well, Alan Dixon was right about that. I hope that some day, in his \nmemory, we will see the return of that spirit in this Senate Chamber. \nThis country truly needs to work together.\n  Before Dixon left the Senate, then-Senator Paul Simon praised him \nwith these words:\n\n       In generations to come, his children, his \n     grandchildren, and his great-grandchildren will look back and \n     say with pride, ``Alan Dixon was my father, my grandfather, \n     my great-grandfather,'' whatever that relationship will be.\n\n  Those words by Paul Simon about his lifelong political friend and \ncolleague Alan Dixon ring true today as we reflect not only on his \nservice as a Senator and public official but also as a person.\n  I lost a pal when Alan Dixon passed away. My wife and I extend our \ncondolences to Alan's wife of 60 years, Jody. What a sweetheart of a \nwoman. People don't realize what spouses put up with because of our \npublic lives. She put up with it for many years. There were good times, \nbut I am sure there were tough times too. Mothers have to work a little \nextra harder when the father happens to be in public life. She was his \nrock.\n  To Alan and Jody's three children Stephanie, Jeff, and Elizabeth, and \nto their families, to the grandchildren and the great-grandchildren--\nyou can be proud of Alan Dixon. He was truly ``the gentleman from \nIllinois.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/08/senate-section/article/S4243-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4243-S4244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this last weekend in Chicago was \nmemorable--memorable for the wrong reasons. This last weekend in \nChicago, gun violence took the lives of 14 people and wounded 82.\n  I am honored to represent Illinois. I am especially honored to \nrepresent a great city such as Chicago. But I am heartbroken to think \nabout what happened this past weekend.\n  Mayor Emanuel and Superintendent Gary McCarthy anticipated the Fourth \nof July weekend would be a challenge, and they dispatched hundreds of \npolice to the streets of Chicago in an effort to avert this violence. I \nwouldn't say they failed, but I would say the tragedy that followed \ntells us we have a lot of work to do.\n  I am sure Mayor Emanuel and all of the elected officials in Chicago, \nincluding Superintendent McCarthy, are looking over what happened this \npast weekend trying to think of what they can do to bring peace to the \ncity and end the violence which has taken so many lives. They will be \nworking overtime, and a lot of people will point the finger of blame \nand say they could have done more. I think the mayor would acknowledge \nhe could have done more. But let me add, we all could have done more. \nIt isn't just the city's responsibility that this kind of violence has \noccurred. It isn't just the misfortune of the city of Chicago that \nthese lives were lost and that gun violence continues to plague us. It \nis a responsibility that goes far beyond the city of Chicago. It is a \nresponsibility we have visited on this Chamber, of the Senate.\n\n  How can we ignore gun violence in America wherever it occurs--in \nChicago, in Washington, DC, across this country? What are we doing as \nMembers of the Senate? What efforts are we making to make America a \nsafer place to live? We have run away from it. We ran away from our \nresponsibility when it comes to an honest, conscientious discussion \nabout gun control.\n  Some people are frightened of this issue. They think when you get \nnear the Second Amendment, it is the third rail of politics, and that \nthere are gun lobby groups out there just waiting to pounce on any \nMember who comes to the floor of this Senate and talks about changing \nour gun laws. That has been the case for a long time, and yet the \nAmerican people, when you ask them about the basics, get it. They \nunderstand you can protect our Second Amendment rights to own and use \nfirearms legally and responsibly and still put reasonable limits in \nplace to keep guns out of the hands of people who will misuse them.\n  Is there anyone who believes it is an infringement of constitutional \nrights to say that no one who has been convicted of a felony should be \nallowed to purchase a firearm in America? That makes sense.\n  This weekend in Chicago convicted felons were out on the street with \nfirearms firing away. We should do everything in our power to stop that \nfrom occurring. After all of the senseless tragedies which we have seen \nover the last several years--in Connecticut, in so many different \nplaces, even in the State of Illinois--is there anyone who argues with \nthe premise that people who are so mentally unstable they cannot accept \nthe responsibility of a firearm should not be allowed to buy a firearm? \nTwo categories: Convicted felons, mentally unstable people, should not \nbe allowed to purchase firearms in America, period.\n  We had the vote--a bipartisan vote. Senator Joe Manchin of West \nVirginia is no liberal. Senator Manchin is a real conservative and pro-\ngun. He joined up with Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, who is about \nas conservative a Republican as you can find. Both Senators Manchin and \nToomey came to the floor and said let us do background checks to make \nsure convicted felons and people who are mentally unstable cannot \npurchase a firearm. It failed. It failed because it faced a filibuster \nwe couldn't break. The majority of Senators voted for it, but that \nwasn't enough because we needed 60 and we didn't have it. We lost a \nhandful of Democrats and we attracted only a few Republicans to support \nus.\n  To me, that is not the end of the debate. It is time for us to \nrevisit that issue. It is time for us to have another vote on the floor \nof the Senate. I am not sure the outcome will be much different, but we \nowe it to the people of this country to continue this debate, and we \nowe it as fellow Senators, Democrats and Republicans, to search for \nsolutions.\n  Let me tell you another measure that could have helped in Chicago and \nother cities across America. There is a term called straw purchaser. A \nstraw purchaser is someone who will walk into a gun store, present \ntheir identification, and purchase a firearm because they are legally \nentitled to purchase it, and then turn around and give it or sell it to \nsomeone who could not legally buy that same gun. Many times it turns \nout to be the girlfriend who is sent in to make the purchase. It is \ntime to change that law. It is time to send out an all-points bulletin \nto the girlfriends of thugs that they are going to be sent away to \nprison for a long time for that kind of irresponsible act. Straw \npurchasers pass these guns into the community, and when they do, we \nknow what happens: Innocent people die. That is another provision we \nshould vote on on the floor of the Senate.\n  If there are colleagues who want to stand and defend the right of \nstraw purchasers to buy guns and turn them over to convicted felons, be \nmy guest. I want to hear that debate. Tell me how that is an exercise \nof your constitutional right. It is not.\n  I have thousands and thousands of people across Illinois who own \nfirearms, who store them safely, use them legally, and enjoy their \nrights under the Constitution. Well, what I am suggesting today is not \ngoing to change\n\n[[Page S4244]]\n\nthat at all, but they live in communities where people will misuse \nthese firearms.\n  We have a moral responsibility in the Senate to do everything we can \nto keep firearms out of the hands of people who misuse them. We have a \nlegal and moral responsibility to accept this opportunity in the Senate \nto debate these issues. We cannot run away from them any more than we \ncan run away from the violence in our streets. I am not alone in my \nfeelings on this issue. There are other Senators who share them. It is \ntime for us to stand up and speak up. We have a responsibility to the \npeople we represent, to innocent people who are being threatened and \nkilled across America.\n  What happened in Chicago over the Fourth of July weekend is a wakeup \ncall--another wakeup call--to the Senate to get about the business of \nour purpose here, the reason we were elected--to try to make America a \nbetter and safer place.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to Calendar No. 384, S. \n2363.\n  The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 384, S. 2363, a bill to \n     protect and enhance opportunities for recreational hunting, \n     fishing, and shooting, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I rise in support of the Bipartisan \nSportsmen's Act.\n  First, I thank Senators Hagan and Murkowski for their leadership in \ngathering support and getting this bill to the floor.\n  Nearly half of the Senate is cosponsoring this legislation from every \ncorner of our country. It is truly a national bill, and that is why \nover 30 groups--from the National Shooting Sports Foundation and Ducks \nUnlimited to the Dallas Safari Club and many others--support this bill. \nIt is an ambitious proposal that includes dozens of smart ideas from \nboth sides of the aisle. It encourages private investment into fish \nhabitat as well as land and wildlife management.\n  This bill supports public shooting ranges so more folks have a place \nto take their kids to teach them how to responsibly handle a firearm, \nand it protects some of our best places to hunt, fish, and recreate.\n  Make no mistake, the Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act is also a jobs bill, \nwhich is something we constantly talk about needing more of around \nhere.\n  In my State of Montana, outdoor recreation supports tens of thousands \nof jobs. It is a $6 billion-a-year industry. Nationwide our outdoor \neconomy creates and sustains more than 6 million jobs every single \nyear.\n  Despite the economic power of public lands to sustain the rural \neconomy, some folks are talking about closing off the land and \nprivatizing it. We cannot let that happen. Instead, we need to pass the \nBipartisan Sportsmen's Act, which will strengthen our economy as we \ncreate more opportunities for folks to continue recreating in our great \noutdoors. Responsibly enjoying our outdoors is part of our way of life \nin Montana. In the Big Sky State we are proud hunters, anglers, sports \nmen and women, and that is why it is critical that this bill will open \nmore of our public lands to every law-abiding American who has a right \nto access them.\n  In Montana alone, nearly 2 million acres of public land is not easily \naccessible to folks, and I am proud my colleagues included the making \nlands public provision that I have pushed for, for years. These lands \nwere set aside for our parents to enjoy, for all of us to enjoy, and \nultimately for our children and grandchildren to enjoy. Accessing these \nlands is our birthright, and this bill delivers on a century-old \npromise to preserve our outdoor heritage.\n  By passing this bipartisan legislation, we will help ensure future \ngenerations get to experience the natural wonders that were passed down \nto us.\n  In the last Congress, the Senate took up a similar package only to \nsee political gamesmanship get in the way. We cannot let that happen \nagain. Millions of sports men and women across this country expect \nbetter. The American people deserve better. There is too much in this \nbill that we agree on to let it fail once again.\n\n  Senators Hagan and Murkowski have worked diligently for months to \ncraft a bill that has an incredible amount of support in the Senate, \nbut, most importantly, back home in the States we all represent. Let's \npass this bill once and for all.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, Americans might have noticed a trend in \nObamaCare headlines over the past two days. There was Sunday's Politico \nstory and it basically had this title: ``Why liberals are abandoning \nthe Obamacare employer mandate.''\n  There was an Associated Press story entitled ``Senate Democrats Try \nto Pull Focus From Obamacare.''\n  Then on Monday, Politico published a story called ``Obamacare's next \nthreat: A September surprise'' about the White House efforts to prepare \nDemocrats to meet September rate hike announcements.\n  All of these stories amount to one thing. Democrats are running \nscared from ObamaCare.\n  These three articles are just a few of the many pieces to be \npublished about Democrats' efforts to distance themselves from \nObamaCare in preparation for the November election.\n  It is not surprising they are worried. ObamaCare is Democrats' and \nthe White House's main legislative achievement, and Americans don't \nlike it. They didn't like it in 2010 when the law was passed, they \ndidn't like it when the law was being implemented, and they don't like \nit now. A Quinnipiac poll from last week reported that 55 percent of \nAmericans oppose ObamaCare. Similar numbers of Americans opposed it 3 \nmonths earlier, and almost 3 months before that. In fact, when we \naverage polling on the health care law from late 2009 until today, we \nfind the health care law has consistently been opposed by the majority \nof Americans. Opposition to the health care law currently averages \nnearly 14 percentage points higher than support. That is not a good \nsign for Democrats.\n  Many Democrats who firmly supported the health care law in 2009 and \n2010 believed the law would grow more popular when the American people \nfound out what was in the bill and how it would benefit them. But the \nhealth care law has not gotten more popular. Americans found out what \nwas in the bill and they didn't like it. Democrats are realizing that \ntheir support for the bill may cost them their seats in November. So \nnow they are running in the opposite direction.\n  According to Monday's Politico article, the White House knows very \nwell that Democrats are finding ObamaCare to be a big problem in their \ncampaigns.\n\n[[Page S4245]]\n\nSo it has redirected the efforts of its ObamaCare war room to prepare \nfor the release of rate hikes that are coming in September. ``The White \nHouse and its allies know''--this is a quote from the story--``they've \nbeen beaten in every previous round of ObamaCare messaging, never more \ndevastatingly than in 2010.'' The story goes on to say:\n\n       And they know the results this November could hinge in \n     large part on whether that happens again. So they are trying \n     to avoid--or at least get ahead of--any September surprise.\n\n  That is from the Politico story.\n  Let me just say to the White House: Good luck with that.\n  There is a reason why the White House and its allies have been, as \nPolitico notes, ``beaten in every previous round of ObamaCare \nmessaging.'' It is because the White House's messaging didn't match up \nwith the reality it promised Americans.\n  The White House can talk all it wants about ObamaCare's supposed \nbenefits, but if Americans aren't experiencing those benefits, no \namount of talking is going to work. Most Americans aren't experiencing \nObamaCare benefits. They are experiencing ObamaCare pain: higher \npremiums, higher deductibles, the loss of doctors and hospitals, less \ncontrol and less freedom.\n  As have most Members of Congress, I have gotten countless letters \nfrom constituents telling me about the pain ObamaCare is causing them. \nTom from Hurley, SD, wrote to me to tell me his premiums have more than \ndoubled and his deductible has quadrupled since the President's health \ncare law was enacted.\n  Harvey from Mitchell, SD, wrote to tell me that his insurance went up \n16 percent effective April 1 of this year. ``Biggest increase ever,'' \nhe said.\n  Jill from Sturgis, SD, wrote to tell me that she went on line to get \na health insurance estimate at healthcare.gov and found that the \ncheapest plan would cost her $366 a month with a $5,000 deductible. \n``Are you kidding me?'', she wrote. ``That's $9,392 a year I have to \npay in, every year, before it pays anything . . . which is roughly 16 \npercent of our combined income. I can't afford that and try to save \nmoney for retirement at the same time'' she says.\n\n  Jill is not alone in not being able to afford that. Too many \nAmericans are in similar situations, facing the prospect of huge health \ncare bills and wondering how on Earth they are going to pay them.\n  All the talk in the world from the White House isn't going to make \npeople enthusiastic about ObamaCare if they can't afford their \nObamaCare premiums or have lost access to the doctor or the hospital \nthey like.\n  Politico reports that 21 States--21 States--have posted preliminary \nhealth insurance premiums for 2015, and that average preliminary \npremiums went up in all 21 States. Those proposed increases--several in \nthe double digits--are coming on top of the State premium hikes many \nAmericans faced this year.\n  The White House can attempt to defend these increases as much as it \nwants, but there really isn't any way to spin huge premium hikes when \nthey promised people their premiums not only wouldn't increase but \nwould actually go down.\n  ObamaCare is fundamentally broken. This bill was supposed to reduce \nhealth care premiums and lower the cost of care while allowing \nAmericans to keep the doctors they like. Instead, it has done the exact \nopposite. ObamaCare isn't just driving up health care premiums; it is \nalso devastating our already damaged economy.\n  The ObamaCare 30-hour workweek rule is forcing businesses, large and \nsmall, to reduce employees' hours at a time when many Americans are \nstruggling to find full-time work. USA Today reported yesterday that \nFriday's unemployment report found a sharp rise in the number of part-\ntime workers who prefer full-time jobs. So what we have is people who \nwant to work full-time but full-time jobs are unavailable, so they are \ntaking part-time work. Why? Well, one of the reasons they attribute it \nto is the ObamaCare requirement that the work week be a 30-hour week as \nopposed to a 40-hour week. So what is happening is employers are hiring \nemployees for less than 30 hours a week so they won't be stuck with all \nof the requirements and the mandates that come with ObamaCare. So it is \nleading to more part-time jobs when people are actually looking for \nfull-time work in our economy.\n  The law's burdensome mandates and regulations are placing a heavy \nburden on small businesses and making it impossible for many of them to \nexpand and to hire employees. As Politico reported, when it comes to \nthe employer mandate, even liberals are admitting that the rule is \nunnecessary and burdensome. Politico notes:\n\n       The shift among liberal policy experts and advocates has \n     been rapid. A stream of studies and statements have deemed \n     the mandate only moderately useful for getting more people \n     covered in ObamaCare. And they too have come to see it as \n     clumsy, a regulatory and financial burden that creates as \n     many problems as it solves.\n\n  That is from the Politico story talking about many of the liberal \npolicy experts who are now turning their backs on the employer mandate.\n  Then there is the potential for fraud, with the Health and Human \nServices inspector general's office reporting that the administration \nis not properly verifying that those receiving subsidies actually \nqualify for them. And the disastrous Web sites have cost taxpayers \nhundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n  The list goes on and on and on. Whether they admit it or not, \neveryone knows that ObamaCare is not working. It is time to start over \nand replace this law with real reforms--reforms that will actually \nlower costs and improve access to care.\n  Republicans have offered solution after solution to solve the many \nproblems created by ObamaCare--from Senator Collins' bill to repeal \nObamaCare's 30-hour workweek, which I just mentioned earlier, to a \nprovision I came up with that would exempt schools, colleges, and \nuniversities from ObamaCare's crippling employer mandate--something \nthat our colleges and universities across the country are feeling and \nit is impacting their ability to hire employees.\n  Instead of fleeing from ObamaCare or attempting to put a positive \nspin on its many failures, Democrats should join Republicans to repeal \nthis broken law and replace it with real reforms. Then Democrats would \nhave a real accomplishment to take home to their constituents, and they \nwould not have to worry about having the White House send a team of \npeople in the war room assigned to Democrats here on Capitol Hill who \nare trying to figure out ways to message the bad news that keeps coming \nout about higher premiums, higher copays, higher deductibles, fewer \ndoctors, and fewer hospitals. That is the message that Democrats here \nin Congress are having to deal with when they respond to the \nconstituents they hear from in their districts or their States. And \nthat is why the White House is so focused on changing the subject to \nanything from ObamaCare.\n  That is the reality, and it is an economic reality that is affecting \nand impacting way to many American families. Middle-income families in \nthis country are squeezed. Household income has gone down by $3,300 \nsince the President took office. Everything middle-income Americans \nhave to pay for has gone up--from health care to college education to \nfuel, electricity, food--you name it.\n  So those middle-income families in this country are increasingly \nfeeling squeezed and pinched by this economy, made much, much worse by \nthe passage of a health care law that has driven up the cost of health \ncare--higher premiums, fewer doctors, fewer hospitals, fewer full-time \njobs or part-time jobs. Why? Because employers are trying to avoid the \nheavyhanded mandates and requirements to provide government-approved \ninsurance, and so they are finding more and more part-time employees \nwhen the employees--people out there in the workforce--are looking for \nfull-time jobs so they can provide for their families. Good-paying jobs \nwith opportunities for advancement--that is what we ought to be focused \non. Unfortunately, everything coming out of Washington, DC, and \nparticularly the policies coming out of this administration--namely, \nfirst and foremost, ObamaCare is making it more expensive and more \ndifficult for employers to hire. It is costing middle-income families \nmore to cover their families with health coverage, and it is\n\n[[Page S4246]]\n\nmaking everything else in our economy more expensive.\n  That is the reality that most Americans are dealing with. We can do \nso much better. We should do so much better. If Democrats will \nacknowledge the error of their ways in the passage of this bad law to \nstart with, we can go back to the drawing board and do this in a way \nthat actually does reduce cost and provide better access to health care \nfor American families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak to the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Excess Federal Property\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, while I was home over the recess, I had \nthe opportunity to visit with lots of Kansans. One of the conversations \nI had was with a county emergency preparedness director in advance of a \nFourth of July parade. He brought to my attention something we had \nheard just in the last few days about a development at the Department \nof Defense.\n  I want to mention to my colleagues and ask them, but ask the agencies \ninvolved--which would be the Department of Defense, the Department of \nAgriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency--to see if we cannot \nfind a solution to a problem that should not be a problem.\n\n  In the Presiding Officer's State and mine we have lots of volunteer \nfire departments. One of the developments over time has been their \nequipment is excess military equipment that is either loaned or given \nto those small town fire departments. They are volunteers. In my \nhometown, the fire whistle blows and men and women from across the \ncommunity gather at the fire station, get in the truck, and go to the \nfire and fight the fire.\n  Their equipment is expensive and the budget they have to fulfill \ntheir mission is small. One way they have been able to overcome that \nsmall budget and expensive equipment is through the Department of \nDefense, which has, over a long period of time, donated excess military \nequipment to the local fire departments. They do this through the State \nforester. In fact, 95 percent of the communities in Kansas are \nprotected by a volunteer fire department and 50 million acres of land \nis protected by volunteer fire departments.\n  Well, 3 weeks ago, the Department of Defense halted the transfer of \nexcess trucks, generators, pumps, and engine parts, based upon \nemissions regulations and an agreement that apparently exists between \nthe Department of Defense and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  The EPA, apparently, has to approve the transfer of those vehicles \nbecause they may not satisfy the clean air standards. So what seems to \nme to be a commonsense solution to the need for fire equipment--\nincluding trucks--is now being halted because of concerns of whether \nthose vehicles--those old vehicles no longer used by the Department of \nDefense--meet the emissions standards.\n  Well, I would certainly first remind folks that these trucks are very \nimportant when there is a fire, but there is not a fire every day. It \nis not as if these vehicles are on the road in a constant fashion day \nin and day out. I would also indicate that the fires they put out \nincrease emissions, so the marginal increase in the amount of emissions \nbecause you may be using a fire truck that does not meet the emissions \nstandards is well overcome by the fire that burns the grass, the \nforest, the trees or a home by what that fire puts into the atmosphere.\n  Since January 1 of this year, there have been nearly 92,000 acres \nburned in more than 5,000 wild land fires--grass fires--across Kansas.\n  For most of those rural fire departments, the Federal excess \nequipment is the only equipment they can afford to handle those natural \nor manmade disasters.\n  The Kansas Forest Service, as I said, administers this program \nthrough the U.S. Department of Agriculture. They provided 40 to 50 \ntrucks per year, and they were able to set aside again that number for \nKansas--40 to 50 trucks--for Kansas fire departments for this year.\n  We currently have 445 trucks issued in Kansas, valued at about $21 \nmillion, and there are 52 fire departments in Kansas waiting for a \nreplacement truck.\n  The Department of Defense decision to implement this policy will cost \nfire departments in Kansas and across the country the opportunity to \nutilize excess equipment, save lives, and protect property.\n  My request is that my colleagues who have an interest in this issue \nwork with me and others and help us bring to the attention of the \nSecretary of Defense, Secretary Hagel, and the EPA Administrator, Gina \nMcCarthy, as well as USDA, which administers the program for the fire \ndepartments, that we work together to find a commonsense solution.\n  Apparently the alternative is if these trucks are not available to be \ntransferred to Kansas and elsewhere, to local fire departments, then \nthe trucks are destroyed, smashed, and somehow disposed of in a \nlandfill. Again, I would suggest that the conservation, the \nenvironmental opportunity to see the life of these vehicles extended, \nas compared to being destroyed, smashed, and disposed of, would work in \nthe favor of the environment as well as in the opportunity to provide \nsafety and security for hundreds of thousands of Kansans, hundreds of \nthousands of Americans, who depend upon rural fire departments, \nhometown fire departments, to meet the needs of their safety and \nsecurity.\n  It seems to me we are asking for something simple. We need a little \ncommon sense and cooperation among an agency and two departments. I \nwould ask my colleagues that you help me find a solution to this \nproblem by getting those agencies, the Department of Defense in \nparticular, to explain why this is a good policy with such detriment to \nthe American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/08/senate-section/article/S4246-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4246-S4248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I come to the floor today because it seems day after \nday there is another story or two in the paper about what is happening \nwith the President's health care law. As I go home to Wyoming each \nweek, I go through Denver and the airport there. Today the headline in \nthe Denver Post has to do with the Colorado health exchanges. The first \nline says: ``Colorado's health care exchange is expecting nearly twice \nas many people to drop or to decline to pay for their policies.'' You \nknow, they predicted how many people would continue to make payments if \nthey had signed up under the President's health care law. Today they \nare predicting that twice as many as they anticipated would be either \ndropping or failing to pay for their health care premiums.\n  The Wall Street Journal today, above the fold, front page, ``Newly \nInsured Face Coverage Gaps.'' So you get people who may have signed up \nunder the President's health care law, coverage gaps, not paying, \ndropping, truly not the deal the President has said was something he \nfelt would be helpful to Americans. More and more people are finding \nout they are having bigger problems under the President's health care \nlaw, problems with the promises that were made by this President, by \nthis administration, and by those who voted for the health care law.\n  I get home just about every weekend in Wyoming to talk with people, \nto listen to them, to hear what they have to say. But also as chairman \nof the Republican Policy Committee, one of my responsibilities is also \nto see how policies such as the President's health care law come out \nacross the country, what happens in other States, how policies out of \nWashington affect people all across America.\n  Today I wish to talk a little about how the health care law is \nimpacting people not just in my home State of Wyoming but all across \nthe country. In addition to being in Wyoming last week, I had a chance \nto visit Alaska. What I heard from people there as well as people in \nWyoming is that people\n\n[[Page S4247]]\n\nhave been hurt by the President's health care law. They are anxious \nabout it in terms of their own health care, and they are angry about \ninsurance they have had that they have lost, and the implications of \nthe President's health care law where many promises were made and now \npeople are finding out the President's promises, in terms of their own \nlives, their own health and their own families, have not actually been \nkept.\n  The President, Democrats here in the Senate, promised their law was \ngoing to be great for the American people. That is the promise. Well, I \ncan tell you the people I talk to in Wyoming, people I heard from in \nAlaska, are very worried about the terrible side effects they are \nfeeling specifically as a result of this awful health care law.\n  Small businesses--and small businesses are a major part of the \neconomy in rural States. Small businesses and the people who \nspecifically work in those small businesses are the backbone of the \neconomy for so many of our communities. So it is very troubling when I \nread about something in the health care law that threatens the very \nhealth of the people who work in these small businesses.\n  When Democrats were trying to sell their health care law, they \nbragged. They bragged about something called the SHOP program. That is \nthe exchange where small businesses in a State were supposed to be able \nto buy insurance for their workers, to be able to shop for it, be able \nto get something that is affordable. That is the promise made by \nDemocrats who voted for this health care law.\n  Democrats actually gave speeches on the floor about small businesses \nbeing able to find affordable insurance. This program was supposed to \nopen last year, but just like the failed exchanges the President set \nup, when the exchanges opened October 1, this was not ready to go. So \nwhat the Obama administration did is they said: We will delay it for a \nyear, because the program was not ready. So they left all of the \nbusinesses kind of in a lurch. Now they say it might be ready this \nfall. Well, time will tell.\n\n  Here is what the Wall Street Journal found in an article last month, \nJune 10. They ran a headline that said, ``Some small business employees \nto have only one health plan choice: 18 states will offer only one plan \nwhen small-business exchanges open.''\n  The Democrats promised a lot more than that. Those who voted for that \npromised a lot more. Those who gave speeches promised a lot more. But \nin 18 States, there will be only one plan when they finally get it \nopen, 18 States where workers and small businesses will not have any \nchoice among insurance plans and no competition, and Alaska is one of \nthem. Less choice, less competition, and of course that means higher \npremiums.\n  People all across the country are experiencing higher premiums. That \nis the thing that causes so much anger and anxiety among families all \nacross the country. When that letter comes--and the newspaper stories \nare already starting to get out there, as well as television, radio, \nreading about it on the Internet--the question is: How much higher?\n  The President promised $2,500 lower premiums. Nobody believes that. \nNobody in America believes the President of the United States and the \npromise he made. It is a sad situation when the President is not \nbelieved by anyone. But yet that is what we have. He made a promise: \n$2,500 per family lower. People all know that prices are going higher. \nThe question is: How much higher?\n  This is what an article said in the Alaska Dispatch: ``Alaska's small \nbusinesses feel pinch of rising health care costs.'' The article tells \na story of a restaurant owner with 24 employees. He is paying about \n$5,000 a month more than he paid last year for his share of his \nworkers' insurance. That is about a 40-percent increase over last \nyear--40 percent. The President said it was going to go down. This is a \n40-percent increase. This small business owner in Alaska says the costs \nare ``crippling'' and he said it is like meeting another payroll every \nmonth. This small business owner says:\n\n       It's killing me. I just don't know how long we can keep \n     absorbing these costs.\n\n  Those costs are a devastating side effect of the health care law. \nDemocrats voted for it. Every Democrat in the Senate voted for that. \nThere was a story on television up there, channel 13, a television \nstation in Anchorage, KYUR. They aired a story last month about Linda \nPeters. She is another local business owner. She had 14 employees. She \npays for the health insurance for her employees. Her share of the \npremium has gone up, gone up from $600 per person 2 years ago to $950 \ntoday. She says it has gotten so expensive that she has had to shift \nthe cost of employees' dependents back to her workers.\n  So she was providing insurance for the dependents of the employees, \nbut now she is not able to do that. Why? Because of the President's \nhealth care law. She told the TV station, ``It was really tragic, it's \nenraging in fact, as employers who care about our employees. `` Tragic \nand enraging.\n  But the President forced this on her and every Democrat in this body, \nevery Democratic Senator who voted for this.\n  This woman in Alaska: Tragic and enraging. She is looking into \ndropping insurance coverage altogether. She pays her employees well so \nthey will not get a subsidy in the State exchange. So here is a small \nbusiness owner who can speak personally about the expensive, the \ntragic, and the enraging side effects of the Obama health care law on \nher employees.\n  Of course, there is a lot of uncertainty about what happens next and \nhow much rates might continue to go up. Of course, that makes it even \nworse. The business owner said:\n\n       I just can't penalize my employees by dropping the plan, \n     and I can't figure out: Where am I going to get the money? \n     It's frightening. What happens next year?\n\n  That is a big concern, what happens next year. People worry about \nnext year. They budget for next year. They plan for next year. They \nthink about their expenses, balancing it with their income. President \nObama says: The Democrats who voted for this law--in the President's \nown words--should forcefully defend and be proud--should forcefully \ndefend and be proud--of the health care law.\n  Are Democrats in this Senate who voted for this health care law \nproud? Are they proud of what the law is doing to these people in \nAlaska and other States? Are Democrats willing to come to this floor \nand forcefully defend and be proud of the extra stress, the extra costs \nthey are causing for these people all across the country?\n  According to a recent study by the Manhattan Institute, people in \nAlaska are paying a hospital more for their coverage. They found the \npremiums of the average 64-year-old woman in Alaska would have been \n$693 a month in 2013. That is before they were forced onto the \nObamaCare exchange. But in 2014, buying insurance from the exchange, \nher premiums jumped to $813 a month. She is paying $1,400 more this \nyear than she did last year because of the specifics of the health care \nlaw.\n  For a 27-year-old man, he would have paid an average of $130 a month \nin 2013. But under the health care law and the exchange, he now pays \n$284 a month. That is more than double. That is an extra $1,800 more \nthis year than it was last year.\n  Is there a Senator in this body who will come to the floor and \nforcefully defend the fact that there are these people all across \nAmerica who are paying twice as much for insurance because of the \nhealth care law?\n  Democrats did not solve the problem with our health care system. They \njust mandated coverage, and mandated more expensive coverage. They made \nit more expensive and they have more mandates. People wanted reform \nthat gave them access to quality affordable care, not more expensive \ncoverage.\n  Republicans have offered solutions, solutions for patient-centered \ncare, for patient-centered health care reform. We have talked about \nthings such as increasing the ability of small businesses to be able to \njoin together and negotiate better rates, about expanding health \nsavings accounts, and allowing people to shop for and buy health \ninsurance in other States that work best for them and for their \nfamilies.\n  In 18 States, including Alaska, the small business exchange will \noffer just one choice for insurance. Shopping in other States could \nincrease competition and help lower premiums for people who work for \nthose small businesses.\n  That would have been a simple solution that works and helps people \nactually afford coverage and care. It is not\n\n[[Page S4248]]\n\nwhat Democrats did with their health care law, but it is what \nRepublicans are offering. We have suggested ideas to get people the \ncare they need from a doctor they choose at lower costs--not higher \ncosts with a subsidy for some people, but actually lowering the cost \nfor everyone.\n  Republicans are going to keep coming to the floor. We are going to \nkeep offering real solutions for better health care without all of \nthese tragic side effects.\n  I am sure that tomorrow there will be another headline and another \none the day after that of people who have been harmed by the health \ncare law as we see more and more and hear from more and more Americans \nwho feel the President has not kept his promises, that the Democrats \nwho voted for the health care law have failed the American people and \nhave failed to answer the concerns of the American people, which was \naffordable quality care.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/08/senate-section/article/S4248-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wanted to say a few words about the \nconference committee in terms of legislation protecting the health of \nour veterans. We are working hard on it in the Senate, the House is \nworking hard on it, and our staffs have been meeting. I have been in \ntouch often with Chairman Miller in the House. We had, I thought, a \nvery productive conference committee before we left.\n  As we continue to proceed, if there is anything I have learned since \nI have been chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, it \nis that I think as a people, as a nation, we underestimate the cost of \nwar, and before anyone votes to go to war again I think they should \nfully appreciate the repercussions of that vote.\n  What going to war means is not--as in the case of Afghanistan and \nIraq--losing some 6,700 brave men and women. That is a terrible loss, \nbut I also want people to remember the families, the wives, the kids, \nthe mothers, and the impact that loss has had on their lives and the \nneed for us to protect those wives and those children to make sure they \ncan have the quality of life they are entitled to despite their loss.\n  But it is not only loss of life. We have had in this war a horrendous \nepidemic of men and women coming home with post-traumatic stress \ndisorder. I am not sure of exactly the number, but it could be as high \nas 500,000 men and women coming home from war with PTSD and that is a \nvery difficult illness which needs a lot of care and that illness, \nagain, impacts the entire family--wives, kids. It impacts the ability \nof a worker to go out and get a job to earn an income. That is a cost \nof war.\n  Needless to say, the cost of war is the many who came home without \nlegs, who came home without arms, who came home without eyesight. The \ncost of war is a high divorce rate for folks who come home who cannot \nreadjust well into their family life. The cost of war is an extremely \nhigh rate of suicides. The cost of war is widows who are now having to \nrebuild their lives. And on and on it goes. The bottom line is the cost \nof war is enormous in terms of human suffering and the impact on not \nonly the individual who fought in that war but on the entire family.\n  As I think our colleagues know, several weeks ago Senator McCain and \nI put together a proposal to deal with the current crisis at the VA, \nand I am very proud that legislation passed the Senate by a vote of 93 \nto 3.\n  What are we dealing with? What is the cost of this proposal? This is \nan expensive proposal because the cost of war is expensive. What a VA \naudit told us is that more than 57,000 veterans are waiting to be \nscheduled for medical appointments. These are the folks who are on \nthese waiting lists, some of which were secret, some of which had data \nmanipulated. These are folks who should have been getting into the VA \nfor timely health care but who were not. On top of that, there is an \nunknown number of veterans who are on no lists because of poor work \nbeing done at the VA. They were not on any list. How many there are we \ndon't know, but many of those people need to be seen.\n  So what our legislation does is say we are going to make certain that \nall of these veterans who are waiting for health care--who have waited \nfar too long for health care--will, in fact, get health care as soon as \nthey possibly can, and they will get that health care either through \nprivate physicians, they will get that health care in community health \ncenters, they will get that health care at the Department of Defense \nmilitary bases, they will get that health care at the Indian Health \nService, but they will get that health care in a timely manner, and \nthat is going to be an expensive proposition. We cannot provide health \ncare to tens and tens of thousands of veterans in a short period of \ntime outside of the VA without spending a substantial sum of money.\n  No. 2, long-term, what is clear to me and I think to anybody who has \nstudied the issue is that if we are serious about eliminating these \nwaiting lists and getting people into the VA in a timely manner, we \nhave to make sure that at every facility in this country the VA has the \nrequisite number of doctors, nurses, and other types of personnel they \nneed in order to accommodate the growing numbers of people who are \ncoming into the VA.\n  If we are talking about hiring thousands of doctors in a moment, by \nthe way, where we have a very serious doctor shortage in this country, \nthat is going to be an expensive proposition, as well as hiring the \nnurses and other personnel and building or leasing the space we need. \nThat is issue No. 2. That is going to be expensive, but long term, if \nwe are serious about keeping our commitment to the men and women who \nput their lives on the line to defend this country, that is exactly \nwhat we have to do.\n  The third area in this legislation which is going to be expensive is \nwe have now for the first time said to veterans that if they are living \na distance away from a VA facility, more than 40 miles, they are going \nto be able to go to a private doctor. That will cost us some money as \nwell.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Vermont yield for a question \nthrough the Chair?\n  Mr. SANDERS. I am happy to yield the floor to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I don't ask the Senator to yield the floor, but I would, \nthrough the Chair, address the Senator from Vermont.\n  First, I thank the Senator for his bipartisan effort with Senator \nJohn McCain which led to an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote on the \nfloor of the Senate to address what we consider to be a crisis in the \nVeterans' Administration. Press reports have suggested in the most \nextreme situation that some veterans' lives were being compromised \nbecause of the failure of providing timely care to these veterans. It \nresulted in an investigation of VA facilities all across the United \nStates. It resulted in the resignation of the Secretary of the \nVeterans' Administration and promises for dramatic reform, but I have \nto say to the Senator from Vermont what he has accomplished with \nSenator McCain is tangible.\n\n  I would like to ask him two or three questions about the current \nstate of affairs. How long ago was it that we passed on the floor of \nthe Senate this bipartisan measure?\n  Secondly, did this measure involve emergency spending to deal with \nthe emergency in the Veterans' Administration?\n  Third, did the House version of their VA reform include the resources \nthe Senator from Vermont mentioned, the new doctors, the new nurses, \nthe new facilities to accommodate this wave of veterans. Those are the \nthree questions that I think are critical.\n\n[[Page S4249]]\n\n  I close by saying thank you again and again, because as chairman of \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs, the Senator has reminded us of the \nreal cost of war.\n  There are many people who vote quickly to go to war who will not vote \nquickly to pay for the care we promised our veterans when they come \nhome. Thank you for caring.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I very much thank the Senator. Let me answer the very \nlast question first, and I will go through the others.\n  I think throughout the history of this country, not only in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, I think as a people we have underestimated the real cost \nof war. There was no word called PTSD at the end of World War II, but \nanyone who thinks that men and women did not come home from war \nsuffering from that ailment would be very mistaken. So the cost of war \nis real, and it is not just missiles and tanks and guns. If this \ncountry means anything, we take care of all of those who serve, to the \nlast day of their lives, when they need that care. I don't have the \ndate in front of me, but I think it was about 3 weeks ago when we \npassed that legislation by a huge vote. I think there were only 3 \npeople who voted against it. It was a vote of 93 to 3--huge bipartisan \nsupport for the bill.\n  But equally important, to answer the important question raised by the \nSenator from Illinois, there was also an overwhelming understanding \nthat paying for this bill is a cost of war. It has to be emergency \nfunded, and in a strong bipartisan vote the Senate said, yes, that is \nhow we are going to pay for it.\n  In terms of the House bill, the House bill was a reasonable bill, but \nthey did not go into the detail we did in terms of how it will be paid. \nBut the major point I do want to make--I was just going to get to that \nand I appreciate the Senator from Illinois raising it. This bill is not \ngoing to be paid for by cutting education or food stamps. That isn't \ngoing to happen. That isn't going to happen, first of all, because it \nis not going to happen and, second of all, it would be grossly \ndisrespectful to the veterans of this country. The veterans of this \ncountry need help. They need help now. This legislation must be passed \nas soon as possible, and it must be passed in terms of the emergency \nfunding. This is a cost of war.\n  I would ask my friend from Illinois, the whip, can he recall what \nkind of programs were offset and what kind of taxes were raised to pay \nfor the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Through the Chair, I would answer the Senator, without \nasking him to yield the floor, and say this: When we decided to embark \non the invasion of Iraq and the invasion of Afghanistan, it was with at \nleast the understanding of then-President Bush that these would be \ncosts that would be added to the deficit of the United States. We would \nnot be paying as we fought. We would be waging a war, spending the \nmoney necessary to wage it successfully, and we would deal with the \ncost of it at a later moment in time. Many of us, even those of us who \nvoted against the invasion of Iraq--and I was 1 of 23 on the floor of \nthe Senate voting against it--voted for the resources to wage the war, \nsaying if our men and women in uniform are risking their lives, we will \nstand by them, equip them, and bring them home safely. I also believed \nand understood that I had an obligation to every one of those men and \nwomen in uniform, having promised them that if they would risk their \nlives for America and come home needing our help, whether it is health \ncare or education or the basics of life, we would be there.\n  I say to the Senator from Vermont thank you for reminding us of the \npledge made by America to these veterans and I believe the pledge made \nby Republicans and Democrats in Congress to stand by them when they \ncame home.\n  Mr. SANDERS. The Senator is exactly right. While no one is quite \nexactly clear how much those two wars will end up costing us, the \nestimate is between $3 and $6 trillion. The point Senator Durbin made \nis even those who voted against the war--and I did as well--understood \nthat when we sent men and women off to battle they would have to have \nall of the resources they needed to do their mission. Equally \nimportant, what we are saying now is when they come home wounded in \nbody, wounded in spirit, we need them to have the resources they \nrequire to make their lives whole again. That is a moral obligation. I \nthank the Senator for raising that point.\n\n  I will yield the floor in a second, but first I will conclude by \nsaying that I want to see this bill passed as soon as possible. We are \nworking as hard as we possibly can, but anyone who magically thinks the \nonly problem facing the VA is more accountability and better management \nis not correct. We do need better management at the VA, we do need more \naccountability at the VA, and this legislation will provide that.\n  People who are incompetent and people who are dishonest should be \nfired. There must be more transparency, and there certainly must be a \nmuch clearer chain of command that goes from Washington to regional \nhospitals and facilities and back up again.\n  At the end of the day, the best management in the world is not going \nto provide the quality and timely health care veterans need unless we \nhave the doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel, and that is the \nsimple fact. Excellent management, yes; transparency, yes; fire \nincompetent people, yes; but we also need the doctors and nurses to \nprovide quality and timely care to the veterans of our country.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, it has been 2 weeks since the House and \nSenate Veterans' Affairs Committees held our first conference meeting \nto fix the VA health care system. It is a disservice to our veterans \nthat we have not met again. My fellow conferees and I should be at the \ntable actively negotiating a path forward.\n  Chairman Sanders is right when he says the situation at the VA is an \nemergency. I had the opportunity to meet with veterans last week in \nHilo, HI. My discussion with them underscored the urgency of addressing \nthe longstanding issues at the VA.\n  For those who have not visited Hawaii, Hilo is on the Big Island of \nHawaii, and it is home to volcanoes, rain forests, and just about every \nother climate. It is also twice as big as the rest of Hawaii's islands \ncombined. In fact, it is roughly the size of Connecticut but with only \na fraction of the population. It can take hours to drive from Hilo to \nthe second largest town, Kailua-Kona. Of the roughly 143,000 people \nliving on the island, 15,000 are veterans.\n  I am raising these facts because I want my colleagues to understand \nthat veterans in communities like those who live on Hawaii Island need \nour help and they need it now.\n  The veterans I met in Hilo expressed to me that they cannot get care \nanywhere other than the VA on the Big Island, as private physicians are \nfew and far between. In fact, while 90 percent of Hawaii Island \nresidents have health insurance, there is a serious physician shortage. \nThis results in long wait times for non-VA health care. Given these \nlong wait times for private physicians, Big Island veterans rely on VA \nfor their primary care. Those Hawaii Island veterans who have private \ninsurance have, out of their own pockets, paid for flights to the \nisland of Oahu to get the care they need. This means over $300 out-of-\npocket just to get to their medical appointments. The $300 does not \ninclude any costs associated with the care itself.\n  This is another reason that expanding access to non-VA providers is \nneeded to immediately address the VA health care emergency. With this \nexpansion, we must ensure that every veteran in our country, whether \nrural or urban, can more easily get the care they need if the VA is \nunable to accommodate them. Rural and urban veterans in Hawaii and \nacross our Nation deserve better.\n  A recent audit of the VA in Hawaii found that veterans were waiting \nover 140 days to receive care. A more recent update found that while \nprogress is being made, the wait is still over 100 days. Nationwide, \nnearly 60,000 veterans are waiting simply to get an appointment, and of \ncourse that is unacceptable. This is why I stand eager and ready to \nwork with my Senate and House colleagues to ensure that the veterans of \nthis country get the care they need and the benefits they have earned.\n  This conference committee must reconvene as soon as possible to move\n\n[[Page S4250]]\n\nforward on the important task to finalize legislation that does three \nimportant things: No. 1, directly addresses the emergency circumstances \nthat have been uncovered at the Veterans' Administration; No. 2, \nensures that all of our veterans receive access to the care they \ndeserve; and No. 3, begins the long-term work of restoring veterans' \ntrust not only in the VA but in Congress's ability to effectively \noversee the VA and provide the resources necessary to care for our \nveterans.\n  Nearly the entire Senate agrees that the current VA situation is an \nemergency and that Congress must act. I am hopeful we can all agree on \nthat point, but my fellow conferees need to be at the table now, face \nto face, to work out solutions to make the VA work for our veterans.\n\n  I hope we will include provisions in the Senate-passed legislation \nthat will provide for 26 major medical facility leases and provide for \nthe resources and authority to expedite hiring of VA doctors and \nnurses.\n  In addition, while I agree that accountability of executives is \nneeded, we should avoid politicizing the nonappointed civil service \nprocess and allow some due process for VA employees.\n  Furthermore, our veterans rely on the services of qualified, \ncommitted professionals at the VA. In fact, the veterans I met with \nlast week indicated that they really liked VA care; however, they were \nconcerned that VA doctors were already overstretched in terms of \npatients. I don't believe that simply telling VA doctors to see more \npatients is the only or best answer, nor is it enough to allow veterans \nto seek care from private providers. We should be doing more to attract \nmore health professionals to VA, especially primary care providers. We \nhave to recognize the long-term benefits of attracting a high-quality \nworkforce to VA and that we can improve accountability in a carefully \nbalanced way.\n  Investing in the VA is an essential step toward building back the \ntrust of our veterans.\n  I understand my colleagues' concerns with the cost of the proposals \nbefore us, but inaction will not overcome those concerns. Those of us \nserving as conferees need to sit down and discuss how to get our \nveterans what they need quickly. The time for action is now. Veterans \nin Hawaii and across the country are counting on us and deserve no \nless.\n  I yield the remainder of my time and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking my \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Illinois, for his very eloquent and \npowerful remarks on the need to address gun violence in this country \nand to do it as part of our consideration of the Bipartisan Sportsmen's \nAct. I look forward to joining with him in the coming days--in fact, \nperhaps in the coming hours--in offering commonsense, sensible measures \nthat will give us the opportunity to help stop gun violence in this \ncountry, addressing domestic violence as well, which so often leads to \ngun violence. Women are five times more likely to be killed in domestic \nviolence when there is a gun in the home. The Senator from Illinois \nalso addressed straw purchases and issues relating to drug trafficking. \nWe have raised those and other issues in the past but have not yet \nsuccessfully passed legislation in the Senate, not even addressed it in \ndepth.\n\n  So I hope we will have the opportunity in these next couple of days \nto consider these kinds of measures, because the scourge of gun \nviolence is continuing in our neighborhoods and on our streets, just as \nit took the lives of 20 beautiful children and 6 great educators in \nNewtown, CT, almost a year and a half ago, and 2 more people on Sunday \non the east side of Bridgeport alone, and tens of thousands of others. \nIt continues to cause death and injury and costs in lost lives and \ndollars throughout this country. We have an obligation as part of this \nmeasure to do better than we have in dealing with this tremendous, \nhorrific, and unspeakable problem. It affects so many innocent \nchildren, particularly the children who are affected in urban \nneighborhoods where there are driveby shootings; in rural neighborhoods \nall across the country; in our cities and on our streets and in our \nschools.\n  We have an obligation to do better and to put priorities first when \nit comes to the use of guns. I understand the reasons for expanding or \nproviding more opportunities in this bill that may involve firearms, \nbut first things first. Let's cure the safety of the country. Let's \nconsider commonsense, sensible measures on gun control before we expand \nthe use of guns and firearms in this country.\n\n\n                         Veterans' Health Care\n\n  I am here as well to address the separate, unrelated issue of doing \nbetter to care for our veterans. The Veterans Access to Care Through \nChoice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014 is now in \nconference. I am on that conference committee. This body passed that \nbill by an overwhelming bipartisan majority of 93 to 3 on June 11. It \nis a comprehensive bill to start addressing the problems that came to \nour attention so dramatically. There were reports of deadly delays, \ndestruction of documents, manipulation of data, and falsification of \nrecords, as well as tragic reports of unacceptable wait times that were \nconcealed at VA health care facilities. Books were cooked and criminal \nwrongdoing was covered up. That is the reason I have called for a \ncriminal investigation, and one has now begun. I hope it will produce \naccountability from the health care system of the VA.\n  More fundamentally, we have an obligation in the Senate and in the \nCongress to address the underlying issues that led to those deadly wait \ntimes and delays, the cooking of books and covering it up that has so \ndramatically undermined trust and confidence in the VA health care \nsystem. If anything, since June 11, the problem seems to have worsened. \nIn fact, comparing May to July, the recently released figures of July \n3--just last week--the numbers of medical appointments delayed for \nlonger than 30 days has tripled in Connecticut and doubled nationwide. \nNationwide, that number has gone from 242,069--roughly a quarter of a \nmillion veterans whose appointments were postponed by 30 days or more--\nto 636,436. That is the number of veterans waiting longer than 30 days \nfor an appointment. In Connecticut, the comparable numbers are 998 to \n2,727--a tripling of the appointments delayed for longer than 30 days. \nIn other parts of the country at other clinics and facilities, those \nnumbers quadrupled.\n  The possible good news is that maybe--just maybe--the doubling, \ntripling, quadrupling of those numbers of appointments longer than 30 \ndays delayed means the numbers are more accurate and truthful. We don't \nknow. I have demanded an explanation. I have written to the Acting \nSecretary of the VA, Sloan Gibson, calling for a public explanation for \nthese numbers and the very alarming and astonishing trends, drastic and \ndramatic increases in those numbers of appointments suffering from \ndelays.\n  Justice Brandeis once said:\n\n       Publicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and \n     industrial diseases. Sunlight is said to be the best of \n     disinfectants.\n\n  These chronic failings at the VA demand a better explanation. \nVeterans deserve to know if things have gotten worse or is the \nreporting just better. All of us--the public whose taxpayer monies fund \nthe VA--deserve the same kind of explanation. There should be a \ncriminal investigation if there has been obstruction of justice and \ndestruction of documents and falsification of records which involve \nFederal criminal wrongdoing.\n  The act we now have in conference committee will help address many of \nthese problems looking forward, moving ahead, by providing more access \nto private doctors and private hospitals outside the VA system to \nminimize and reduce and perhaps even eliminate those unacceptable \nwaiting times of longer than 30 days for an appointment. It will \nprovide more doctors--more than $500 million for that purpose alone. It \nwill impose accountability by enabling easier firing and seeking to, in \neffect, claw back, or at best stop, some of the financial incentives \nthat may have driven the false reporting.\n\n[[Page S4251]]\n\n  In those ways and a variety of others, this bill will help us move \nforward and achieve progress.\n  No one should be under any illusion that this bill alone will solve \nall the problems. It is not a panacea. It is not a permanent solution \nto the VA's problems. We need, for starters, a new leader. The VA has \nno permanent Secretary. The confirmation of a new one is imperative. \nBut tough questions are absolutely essential to determine whether the \nPresident's nominee should be the one to lead this agency, and I am \ncertainly hoping he will be.\n  The Veterans' Affairs conference committee met on June 24. I \nemphasized the importance at that hearing of honoring the commitment of \nour men and women in uniform by addressing the VA challenges with \nadequate funding and essential legislation. I am hopeful we will move \nquickly and effectively after that first June 24 meeting now to present \nto both Houses a final version of this bill so we can truly address the \nproblems our veterans deserve to have solved and the VA has an \nobligation to eliminate. We need to assure that the differences between \nthe two bodies are resolved and send this bill to the President for his \nsignature. A country that really values its veterans, truly honors \ntheir service, should not subject them to waiting delays, secret \nwaiting lists, and false records. This broad, bipartisan, historic bill \nto ensure that delays in treatment are eliminated and bad actors at the \nVA health centers are held accountable is a critical step to keep faith \nwith our veterans and let us move forward quickly and responsibly with \nthis bill.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Afghanistan\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, there are a few of us who want to come \ndown and talk a little bit about specific things in our States that are \nreaching a crisis point by having to participate in ObamaCare. But \nbefore doing that I want to make just one comment to make sure it is in \nthe Record and that we can talk about the election that took place over \nin Afghanistan.\n  We have had quite a time over there. We have lost actually 2,197 of \nour own troops in Afghanistan, and we have had about ten times that \nmany who have been injured. So it has been a real crisis for a lot of \npeople. For a long period of time things had been going well. I think \nwhen the decision was made by this President to pull everything out at \na given time things started turning around a little bit. Now they are \nin the middle of a--in Afghanistan the election took place. I know we \nare not supposed to say this, and there is no official position--I want \nto make that clear--by the United States of America, but to me there \nare two people running against each other. There is a good guy and a \nbad guy--that holdover from the old administration, whose name is \nAshraf Ghani, who is Karzai's chosen one, who is one who would continue \nto go in a lack of leadership and not take advantage of the \nopportunities they have right now; then Abdullah Abdullah is the other \none.\n  My concern with this--and I expressed this concern on the Senate \nfloor about 3 weeks ago. I said: I know we have deadlines. We are going \nto have a primary, which we already had. Then we are going to have a \nprimary runoff. Then on June 22, which is 2 weeks from today, there \nwill be an official declaration as to who won the primary runoff.\n  The Presiding Officer is fully familiar with this. We talked about \nthat this morning. Well, in this runoff situation, we have found a lot \nof discrepancies. It seems to me that while I consider one guy to be \nthe good one and one to be the bad one, all of the mistakes that were \nmade and the irregularities that were found were found in favor of \nAshraf Ghani, as opposed to Abdullah Abdullah.\n  Let me give you an example. In one of the provinces--it was the \nWardak Province--Ghani's vote count went from about 17,000 in April to \n170,000 in the runoff. Stop and think about that. That is almost \nmathematically impossible. When you consider the number of registered \nvoters there, this number actually exceeds the number of registered \nvoters. So you went from 17,000 in the same province when they went \nthrough the primary back in April, and then that jumped up by tenfold \nto 170,000 in the runoff. That is an increase of 1,000 percent over \nApril's result. All of those, of course, were in an area where--it is \nin a part of the country where Ghani's vote was more favorable.\n  Then the other thing I think is unprecedented, I think we all know in \nour own States, whether it is in West Virginia, Oklahoma, or any of the \nrest of them, the vote percentage turnout is less in rural areas than \nit is in urban areas. In urban areas you have to go next door to vote. \nIt is very convenient. In many rural areas, certainly in my State of \nOklahoma, you have to drive maybe 30 or 40 miles to vote. So the \npercentage turnout is less. It happens that Ghani's support comes from \nthe rural areas. In this runoff election that just took place, they had \na 75-percent turnout in those areas. At the same time, in the urban \nareas, they only had a 24-percent turnout.\n  First of all, I do not think we can name one election in history that \nhad a larger turnout in a rural area than it did the urban areas in the \nsame election. So we are looking at something that could not happen and \nlogically it did not happen. That was something that certainly worked \nin the favor of Ghani's election.\n  Right now everyone agrees on one thing; that is, that the election \nwas at least falsified. If not, it was just a rigged election. There \nare a lot of organizations out there--the European Union, for example, \nand the U.N. and other groups such as OSCE, which is the Office of \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe--that all agree we should have an \naudit of this election--at least an audit which should include some \nindependent source. So I want to get on record now, because I fear if \nnothing is done in the next 14 days, he will be declared the winner, \nwith these discrepancies, I think that would be doing a great \ndisservice to the people of Afghanistan. They would lose faith in their \nsystem, because what I am saying here on the Senate floor they already \nknow.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Let me jump into another area I am very interested in, as is every \nMember of this body. I can remember back in the 1990s we had what was \nreferred to as ``Hillary health care.'' At that time, there were \nseveral members of Parliament--one of them was up here and we had a \nhearing. That person said: You know, it is hard for us in the United \nKingdom to understand why we have had this type of socialized medicine \nfor as many years as I can remember--this is his quote. He said:\n\n       Yet we are now finally realizing that your system over in \n     the United States is a much better system. We are now \n     starting to discard the whole socialized medicine system.\n\n  That is something we saw way back in the 1990s. It came again with \nthe Affordable Care Act or ObamaCare. We have a lot of examples in my \nState of Oklahoma, heartbreaking accounts. Since the rollout last fall, \nmy office has been flooded with stories from Oklahomans who found \nObamaCare to be one massive broken promise from President Obama.\n  These stories include a woman from Broken Arrow, OK, who reported a \n20-percent increase in her monthly premiums.\n  A father from Owasso, OK, shared a story--I talked to all of these \nindividuals personally--of his son and daughter who serve as \nmissionaries in Indonesia. Their health care deductibles in the United \nStates have more than doubled from $1,200 per person to $2,600 a \nperson.\n  One teacher, a public schoolteacher from Copan, OK, who teaches--\nactually not in public school, it is adjunct college classes. She \nshared that not only did she have her work hours cut but is now paying \n$950 a month in premiums for health care with a $6,000 deductible.\n  Another teacher from Sallisaw, OK--that happens to be the strawberry \ncapital of the world in case you guys did not know that--shared that \nher deductible increased by $1,000 from last year.\n\n[[Page S4252]]\n\n  A man from Noble told us his company modified health plans to match \nthe ObamaCare requirements. It is a company he owns. He says these \nchanges cost him a 40-percent increase in his out-of-pocket expenses \nand his premium costs.\n  A man from Tulsa who lives actually in my same neighborhood has a \nfamily of five. He works for a small business. He shared with us that \nhe is now paying $4,000 more for insurance than he had paid a year ago.\n\n  This November, a new open enrollment period will begin in at least \none State, Virginia, which has already reported an astounding 22-\npercent increase over the past year.\n  All of that is happening. People from any State, any of the 50 \nStates, could come down and talk about the individual cases in their \nStates. We have one good thing that is going on right now. We have a \ngreat attorney general by the name of Scott Pruitt. Scott Pruitt, the \nattorney general from Oklahoma, has a lawsuit. It is called Pruitt v. \nBurwell. Oklahoma has standing to proceed on a case that the IRS acted \nbeyond Congress's intent in its effort to impose penalties in States \nthat have Federal exchanges.\n  We have 36 States that have Federal exchanges. These exchanges are--\nwell, first of all, the administration had a motion to dismiss. It was \noverruled 11 months ago, so this is a real case. The State has asked \nfor summary judgment.\n  Success in this case would mean the dismantling of the ObamaCare \nemployer and individual mandates for all 36 States that have at least a \npartially federally facilitated exchange. I guess you can say it might \nend up being our attorney general from the State of Oklahoma is going \nto be the one who is going to be the most successful in doing something \nabout this thing we should have learned a long time ago was not going \nto work.\n  I have a personal interest in this, having had--there are states or \ncountries that have socialized medicine. We have Canada, we have Great \nBritain, we have many other countries. In making a study of these, you \nfind there is limited coverage for people when they reach a certain \nage.\n  I see our good friend from Wyoming who is a medical doctor. He has \ngiven his second opinion many times. In one of those he talked about \nyou get past a certain age, you are unable to get the treatment. I \nhappen to have had occasion to have four bypasses at an age when in \nsome countries I would not have qualified.\n  It is something we have been very active in. We are going to \nhopefully be the heroes from the State of Oklahoma in offering relief \nto at least 36 of our States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments from the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma who, like the Senator from Wyoming who is on the floor \nhere with us here today, has heard from many of his constituents about \nthe impact ObamaCare is having on them, the real-world economic impact.\n  I have received countless letters from my constituents in South \nDakota telling me about the challenges they are facing because of \nObamaCare. Those challenges consist of the economic costs associated \nwith the new health care law: higher premiums, higher deductibles, \nhigher copays, the loss of the doctors they like, the burden the law is \nplacing on their businesses if they are an employer, and less control \nand less freedom, which is something that is important to so many \nAmericans, particularly when it comes to their health care.\n  I want to take a few moments to highlight some of the stories that \nconstituents of mine have shared with me. I know the Senator from \nWyoming is here to do the same, to talk about the impact not only in \nhis State of Wyoming but all across the country.\n  One person named Erik from southeast South Dakota wrote to me to tell \nme his family's health care plan was cancelled thanks to ObamaCare. His \nold plan was $448 a month, with a $5,000 deductible and a 20-percent \ncopay after that. The cheapest bronze plan he could find was $987 a \nmonth, more than double what he was paying before, with a $6,500 \ndeductible and a 40-percent copay. He said, ``This means that I would \nneed to incur about $26,000 in eligible medical expenses each year \nbefore insurance is a benefit to me.''\n  Then there is Megan from McCook County, SD, who contacted me to tell \nme the cheapest plan she could find for her family of 4 would cost her \na staggering $17,000. Seventeen thousand dollars. That is more than \nsome people pay for their mortgage in an entire year.\n  Randy from Hot Springs, SD, contacted me to tell me an exchange plan \nsimilar to his old insurance plan is $1,222 a month, almost 2\\1/2\\ \ntimes the cost of his old insurance plan.\n  Sheri, from a small town in Minnehaha County, said:\n\n       Next year, our insurance is changing, and I will lose my \n     family practice doctor of 22 years--the doctor that delivered \n     all my children and that has cared for our teenage children \n     all of their lives. We'll also lose all of the back-up \n     doctors our family has seen when we couldn't see our regular \n     doctor. . . . I was happy with my insurance, and now I have \n     to lose my doctor.\n\n  Then there is Denny from Rapid City, SD, who told me the following:\n\n       My insurance company cancelled my policy. I am currently \n     paying over $800 a month for a family of four. . . . If I \n     sign up for ObamaCare, I would be paying over $2,500 a month. \n     I cannot think of any way this is considered affordable \n     health care!\n\n  Linda, a small business owner and operator from a small town along \nthe Missouri River, wrote this:\n\n       We need your help. . . . We have one full-time employee, \n     and we provide health care coverage for him, his wife, and \n     their children. . . . Our monthly premium in 2013 was \n     $2,964.20 or $35,570.40 annually. Our monthly premium--as a \n     result of the ``Affordable Care Act''--for 2014 is $3,524.75 \n     or $42,297 annually.\n\n  A huge increase from what they were paying before, from 2013 to 2014.\n  She says:\n\n       I have been told by our agent to expect even more \n     substantial increases in 2015. This is very frightening for \n     us.\n\n  Lyle from Brookings, SD, said that thanks to ObamaCare, his monthly \npremium almost doubled and his deductible doubled.\n  He says:\n\n       I'm a small business owner, and would like to hire an \n     employee next spring. Well, that's not going to happen!\n\n  We were told that ObamaCare would lower costs and make health care \nmore affordable. Instead, it has driven up costs for these Americans \nand for many others. What middle-class family can afford to spend \n$17,000 a year on insurance? How can a small business with one employee \nafford a $7,000 yearly hike in insurance premiums? The answer is they \ncannot.\n  As if high health care prices were not enough, ObamaCare is also \ndamaging many Americans' job prospects.\n  There is the 30-hour workweek rule, which is forcing many employers \nto cut their employees' hours. There is the medical device tax, which \nhas already resulted in thousands and thousands of lost jobs in the \nindustry and will likely result in many more if it isn't repealed. \nThere is the employer mandate, which is discouraging many employers \nfrom expanding and hiring new employees. And there are the many rules \nand regulations that are placing a huge financial and logistical burden \non small businesses.\n  ObamaCare isn't working. It was supposed to help Americans. Instead, \nit is hurting them. It is time to start over and to replace this law \nwith real health care reforms--reforms that will actually lower costs \nfor Americans, give them back their health care choices, and improve \naccess to care.\n  That is what we ought to be doing. But, unfortunately, we have lots \nof folks here in this Chamber who are trying as desperately as they can \nto run away from the issue without fixing it.\n  So as we get into these November elections and the run-up to them, a \nlot of vulnerable Democrats who voted for this are looking for a way \nout. But in many cases this was their signature achievement. This is \nthe President's signature law. So they own it. They own that vote. Yet \nthey are trying to figure out a way to spin it to the American people \nso that it will come across in a different way than the reality the \nAmerican people are experiencing.\n  This is the headline in Politico from yesterday: ObamaCare ``War Room \nPrepares for Sept. Surprise.'' They know there is more bad news coming \nout in September of this year when the new insurance rates are \nannounced to kick in.\n\n[[Page S4253]]\n\n  So what is the White House doing? They have six people assigned to \ncongressional Democrats to help do damage control in their States or \ntheir districts when this bad news comes out. And it inevitably will \nbecause there is no way that all the new mandates and requirements \nassociated with this law don't lead to higher prices--in addition to \nall the higher taxes that go with it.\n  So the headline is the ``War Room Prepares for Sept. Surprise,'' and \nit goes on to detail how they are trying their best to spin this in a \nway that confuses the American people into thinking it is something \nbetter than it is. Unfortunately for the spinners, the reality that \nmost Americans are confronting and experiencing is a very different \none--and that is the reality I talked about earlier: higher premiums, \nhigher deductibles, higher copays, fewer choices when it comes to \ndoctors and hospitals, fewer full-time jobs and more part-time jobs as \nemployers look for ways to avoid dealing with these mandates and \nrequirements that are imposed under ObamaCare. But it is forcing more \nand more people onto part-time jobs when they would like to be working \nfull time. That is why last week when the jobs numbers came out and \npeople were hailing the numbers--sure, there was some good news there. \nBut there was an awful lot of bad news, and one of the bad news items \nwas that a good majority were actually part-time and not full-time \njobs.\n  Why? One of the reasons is the mandates and requirements under \nObamaCare and the institution of a 30-hour workweek, which is forcing \nemployers to hire employees for fewer than 30 hours so they don't get \nstuck with having to provide government-approved health care, which \nwould dramatically increase what they are paying for health care today.\n  That is the reality that most Americans are confronting. I hope at \nsome point, as these realities continue to sink in with the American \npeople, their elected officials here in Washington will come together \nand realize this isn't working; it is not working for employers; and it \nis not working for middle-class families in this country who are \nincreasingly squeezed by these higher costs; and it certainly isn't \nworking for our economy.\n  I know the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Barrasso, who has been mentioned \nby the Senator from Oklahoma, is a physician and understands these \nissues very well and has spoken at great length here on the floor about \nObamaCare and its impacts. I know he is going to share some of the \nstories that he has received from not only the people he represents \nfrom the State of Wyoming but from those around the country who are \nfeeling the impacts of this law.\n  So would I yield for the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I join my colleague from South Dakota \nand agree with what he is seeing in South Dakota and I am seeing in \nWyoming and that people all across the country are seeing with regard \nto the President's health care law. People are very concerned because \nit hits them in their pocketbook.\n  What we are seeing is that people's premiums are going up. The \ndeductible that they have to pay before they get to use their insurance \nis going way up. The copay that they have to make has gone way up.\n  So in terms of people's actual pocketbook issues and the things that \nconcern them, they are paying more and getting less, and it is because \nof the mandates in the Obama health care law.\n  The President of the United States says: ``Forcefully defend and be \nproud'' of this law. Yet day after day, I don't see Democrats who voted \nfor the health care law coming to the floor to forcefully defend or be \nproud of it. And there is very little to be proud of.\n  We all get letters from people in our home States. I was home over \nthe Fourth of July visiting around the State, going to many \ncommunities. I haven't run into anyone who says this has actually \nsignificantly helped make their life better. People have come up to me \nat parade routes, rodeos--all the different places we have been--and \nthey have great concerns about the health care law and the impact on \ntheir own personal life, what money is left over at the end of the day \nto help put food on the table, to get the kids off to school, clothing \nfor the kids, and how the impact of the health care law is making it \nharder and lowering the quality of life in spite of the President's \npromises, which they say are just not true.\n  I got a letter from a young woman, Shelly in Worland, WY, in Washakie \nCounty, in the center of the State. I know the community very well. She \nwrites to me:\n\n       I know you have heard my story a hundred times, but I feel \n     maybe one more won't hurt.\n\n  She wanted to share what is going on in her specific life in Wyoming \nrelated to the health care law.\n\n       Yesterday in the mail I received a notice that my . . . \n     health insurance will go from $637 to $897, and my $10,000 \n     deductible is now $11,000.\n\n  So her premiums have gone up and the deductible has gone up. It is a \ndouble whammy hitting her. But, she says:\n\n       My plan now meets the requirements of the health care \n     reform law.\n\n  And let's be serious about this. The requirements of the health care \nlaw mandate that many people all across the country end up buying much \nmore insurance than they ever will need, ever will want, and will ever \nuse. But it has to comply with what the Federal Government says they \nneed.\n  The families of Wyoming have a better idea of what they need for \ntheir health insurance than Barack Obama has in terms of what he thinks \nthey might need. The families of Wyoming know what they need much more \nso than the Democrats in this body who voted the mandates onto these \npeople and said they have to have all of this insurance. This woman \ndoesn't need it, doesn't want it, and is not going to use it. Yet she \nis paying more out of her pocket, impacting that family's life so it \ncan comply with the health care law instead of what is best for her and \nher family.\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       My husband is self employed on the family farm, and I am \n     also self employed at a beauty shop. Needless to say we have \n     always pinched our pennies. My children are all grown, my two \n     daughters are both kindergarten teachers in our wonderful \n     state, and my son is working with us on the farm. We have \n     worked very hard not to use any of the government assistance \n     raising our children on less than $30,000 a year.\n\n  We are talking about hardworking families from all across the country \npinching their pennies, making sure that they use their money wisely, \nnot relying on the government. That is what we have here.\n\n       So now I am forced to enter the health care reform circus.\n\n  That is what this is. This is a circus forced down the throats of the \nAmerican people by the Democrats in this body and by the President of \nthe United States who forced this onto the American people, this health \ncare reform circus.\n\n       I know I missed the deadline because I was determined to \n     not be a part of this, but now I simply cannot afford this \n     insurance. I tried to navigate the website last night and \n     finally gave up after being kicked off three times.\n       To make matters worse my insurance was offering one \n     decreasing deductible that we were counting on. We also lost \n     that in our new policy. We had our deductible down to 3,000. \n     We have been saving in an HA, but I'm afraid it won't last \n     long. I have just been told I have a rare bone disease called \n     fibrous dysplasia. It is causing some eye issues, and I am \n     facing some sort of surgery to remove the diseased bone \n     behind my eye.\n\n  This hardworking Wyoming family:\n\n       After working so hard to take care of ourselves my husband \n     and I are faced with having to have help. This makes no sense \n     to us. We were doing fine until the government stepped in.\n       There has to be an answer somewhere. Thanks for your time.\n\n  I practiced medicine for 25 years in Wyoming and took care of many \nfamilies just like we have here with Shelly, knowing how hardworking \npeople are--and the Presiding Officer knows that as well--in rural \ncommunities, people who roll up their sleeves, go to work every \nday, and don't want assistance from the government. They just do their \njob. And this is a family that has been hurt by the President's health \ncare law--hurt dramatically. They had gotten their deductible down to \n$3,000, and now it is up to $11,000. Their premiums are higher than \nthey were before, and she has a lot more insurance than she is ever \ngoing to want, need, can afford or will ever use.\n\n  But we are seeing this all around the country. It is not just in \nstories from\n\n[[Page S4254]]\n\nWyoming. CBS Money Watch in the middle of June came out with a report \ncalled ``For some, Obamacare delivers sticker shock.''\n  It is interesting, just trying to follow the press from around the \ncountry. These aren't isolated cases. We are seeing this all across the \ncountry.\n  The article goes on:\n\n     . . . Obamacare is delivering a hefty dose of sticker shock.\n\n  What did the President of the United States promise the American \npeople? He promised the American people that under his plan insurance \npremiums would drop $2,500 per family by the end of his first term--not \nstay flat, not go up a little--would actually go lower $2,500 per \nfamily per year by the end of his first term. ``Obamacare is delivering \na hefty dose of sticker shock.''\n  Now, who is getting hurt by this? All Americans are getting hurt, but \nthe Washington Post had an interesting story on June 24. I wish the \nPresident would pay attention to this. The President of the United \nStates needs to know that it is ``Older women who bear the brunt of \nhigher insurance costs under Obamacare''--the headline in the \nWashington Post June 24.\n  The new government report is out:\n\n     . . . women age 55 to 64 will face a huge spike in cost when \n     they go out to buy individual insurance on the federal \n     exchange. These women bear the brunt of the increased \n     premiums and out of pocket expenses after the Affordable Care \n     Act.\n\n  Winners and losers--and President Obama has chosen older women to \nbear the brunt of higher increased insurance costs under the President \nhealth care law.\n  We are going to hear that again and again as Democrats stand up to \ntalk about the issues facing our country. It is older women who are \nbearing the brunt of the higher insurance costs under the President's \nhealth care law, as reported in the Washington Post.\n  Then, how incompetent is the Web site? Let's take a look at what the \nNew York Times said July 1: ``Eligibility for Health Insurance Was Not \nProperly Checked, Audit Finds.''\n\n       An independent audit of insurance exchanges established \n     under the health care law has found that federal and state \n     officials did not properly check the eligibility of people \n     seeking coverage and applying for subsidies, the latest \n     indication of unresolved problems at HealthCare.gov.\n\n  I remember listening to President Obama talk and be interviewed by \nPresident Clinton in September of last year in New York City at the \nClinton Global Initiative, or something like that. President Obama \nsaid: Easier than shopping on Amazon. Cheaper than your cell phone \nbill.\n  This is in a report to Congress on Tuesday:\n\n       In a report to Congress on Tuesday, the inspector general \n     for the Department of Health and Human Services . . . said \n     that the exchanges . . . did not have adequate safeguards \n     ``to prevent the use of inaccurate or fraudulent information \n     when determining eligibility.''\n       Moreover, in a companion report, the inspector general said \n     that the government had been unable to verify much of the \n     information reported by people applying for insurance \n     coverage and financial assistance to help pay premiums.\n       We are talking about the Inspector General of the \n     Department of Health and Human Services of the Obama \n     administration.\n       ``As of the first quarter of 2014,'' [the Inspector \n     General] said, ``the federal marketplace was unable to \n     resolve about 2.6 million of 2.9 million inconsistencies''--\n\n--because the Web site that President Obama has said would be easier to \nuse than Amazon, cheaper than your cell phone was not fully \noperational. What kind of government incompetence are we talking about?\n  The Associated Press on July 1: ``Health law sign-ups dogged by data \nflaws.'' Unable to resolve 2.6 million so-called inconsistencies--it is \nastonishing. And they call it ``another health care headache for the \nWhite House.'' The problems continue out of sight. The President is \ntrying to hide these problems--trying to hide them from the American \npeople. The President says one thing, tries to sell a story. The \nPresident now has his own war room set up--not to solve the problems. \nOh, no. He is not trying to solve the problems. He has a war room to \ntry to spin the information so the voters don't get to see what they \nare not being deceived by. They can see through this. You have a war \nroom with six people trying to spin the health care numbers rather than \ntrying to solve the problems, trying to lower the cost of care, trying \nto help patients get care--not empty coverage and expensive coverage. \nThere are so many problems in the world, and what the White House has \ndecided to spend its time and money on is set up a war room to try to \nspin the issues of the Obama health care law, not to solve the \nproblems.\n\n  Go around the country, State by State. California: ObamaCare massive \nbacklog stalls medical expansion. Connecticut: Anthem seeks 12.5 \npercent rate increase. Back to California: Confusion over doctor list \nis costly for ObamaCare enrollees in the State.\n  You can work your way around the country, and State by State, whether \nyou do it from east to west, north to south, do it in alphabetical \norder, in every State there are horror stories about the impact of this \nhealth care law.\n  Connecticut again: ObamaCare glitch leading to canceled policies. \nConstituents calling to talk to their State representatives say their \ninsurance policies have been canceled because the subsidies that helped \ndiscount the premiums hadn't been paid--hadn't been paid. According to \npeople involved with the insurance companies, the issue of mistaken \npolicy cancellation ``is real.'' So the insurance companies are saying \nit is absolutely true, it is absolutely real.\n  I see other colleagues on the floor.\n  I would say that in Colorado, a State that I go through every weekend \nat least twice going to Wyoming and coming back to DC from Wyoming, \npeople in Colorado are very concerned. ``Colorado health exchange site \nneeds surgery.'' This is NBC 9 News, Colorado. A reporter said:\n\n       I'm not going to sugar-coat this: The official state \n     website where Coloradans can shop for health insurance is a \n     mess. Sure [the web site] looks pretty slick at first glance. \n     It lets you window shop for plans and offers some (but not \n     all) good info about the health care law. But when you \n     actually create an account and start shopping, the site \n     offers an experience that is clunky, counter-intuitive, and \n     often confusing.\n\n  That sounds to me like the Obama administration--clunky, \ncounterintuitive, and often confusing.\n\n       That's the web product being offered to Coloradans after \n     receiving more than $179 million in federal grants to develop \n     the state exchange.\n\n  This reporter says:\n\n       If you are looking for a passionate argument of the pros \n     and cons of [ObamaCare], as a reporter I avoid making public \n     policy arguments.\n       However, if this is the official system the people of \n     Colorado are getting to shop for individual coverage, it \n     should be a good one. Nine months after it began selling \n     health plans, this website is not a good one. It should be \n     upsetting to everyone in the state of Colorado, especially \n     supporters of the healthcare law.\n\n  I would apply that to anyone from Colorado who is on this Senate \nfloor or in the House of Representatives who voted for the health care \nlaw.\n  He said:\n\n       It should be upsetting to everyone in the state, especially \n     supporters of the healthcare law. My family obtained a health \n     plan despite the website.\n       By way of background, I am not remotely anti-technology. I \n     grew up in Silicon Valley. I built my own computers as a kid. \n     I once had a job working in tech support for [a dot-com \n     company], a sophisticated e-commerce platform . . . My goal \n     in this review is to shine a light on some really basic (and \n     deeply frustrating) problems that any commercial dot-com \n     would be pulling all-nighters to fix.\n\n  Well, that shows you the difference between a commercial dot-com and \nthe government of the United States.\n  It says:\n\n       For some reason, these issues have been allowed to hang \n     around for the better part of a year by the Connect for \n     Health Colorado.\n\n  And then today, the Denver Post: ``Colorado exchange expects more to \ndrop health coverage''--giving up, not paying their premiums, not \nrenewing their coverage. They are expecting double what was initially \nanticipated of the number of people who aren't paying their premiums. \nThey realize this empty coverage they are paying a lot of money for \nisn't actually good for them. They are paying too much in premiums. \nTheir deductibles are high, their copays are high.\n  I can go on and on. The people of America know what they wanted with \nhealth care reform. They wanted to be able to get care they need from a \ndoctor they choose at lower costs. That is not what they got from \nPresident\n\n[[Page S4255]]\n\nObama's health care law that the Democrats in this body voted for. What \nthey got are higher premiums, higher copays, higher deductibles, maybe \ncannot keep their doctor, cannot keep their hospital--not what the \nPresident promised, not what people wanted, and it is time to go back \nand start over to work on a health care system that gives the American \npeople what they truly want, truly need, and deserve.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank my friends who have been here talking about this. \nBoth Senator Thune and Senator Barrasso spent so much time on figuring \nout ways this could work better and obviously it is not working as well \nas people hoped it would.\n  There is a series of headlines I saw on my desk today. CNN Money \nsaid: ``Were ObamaCare applications accurate? Who knows?''\n  Reuters says, ``Obama care exchange is not properly verifying \napplicant data.''\n  The New York Post: ``Obamacare data errors could jeopardize coverage \nfor millions.''\n  The Washington Times: ``ObamaCare markets foul up eligibility and \nverification parts in applications.''\n  The New York Times: ``Eligibility for health insurance was not \nproperly checked audit finds.''\n  Wall Street Journal: ``Reports Fault Controls of Health Exchanges.''\n  This is simply not working. It wasn't as though there was a lot of \ntime to make it work either. It was from early in 2010 until the law \nwas implemented in the end of 2013, and there is one problem after \nanother, which is a good indication of what happens when the government \ntries to do more than the government is capable of doing, when the \ngovernment tries to prescribe all kinds of decisions that would be so \nmuch better left to individuals as long as the government has done what \nit could to ensure a more aggressive, active, competitive marketplace. \nBut that is not what happened here.\n  The Associated Press this weekend had a headline that read: ``Senate \nDemocrats try to pull focus from ObamaCare.'' Of course they would, \nbecause every Democrat who is in the Senate when this bill passed voted \nfor the bill.\n  You know, if there is one long-term political lesson to learn here, \nsurely it is that when you do something this big, you should do it in a \nway that no matter what you have to do you find a way to get people on \nboth sides involved. Don't do this in a way that shoves it down the \nthroats of the country or your colleagues.\n  More bad news, more broken promises, higher premiums. The \nanticipation this fall is that premiums, notices of which are going to \ngo out later this year, are going to go up. They are going to go up in \ndouble digits. The promise in 2009 was not only that families would pay \nless money but they would pay $2,500 less money. Somehow the people who \nwere for this bill in the administration knew so much about health care \nand so much about the impact of what government having more control of \npeople's health care would do, told us not only that the premiums were \ngoing to go down, but that they were going to go down $2,500 per \nfamily. Now most families are finding that there is a $2,500 number, \nbut it is the number that you would feel lucky to have if your \ninsurance for your family just went up that much.\n  July 1, Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General \nreleased a report that was the subject of all those headlines I just \nread. The report said they didn't do enough to verify, haven't checked \nthis closely enough, don't know if people are eligible for the \ngovernment assistance they are getting for their insurance. It said the \nadministration was unable to put safeguards in place to protect \ntaxpayers and prevent incorrect subsidy payments from happening.\n  The report also found the administration didn't even follow its own \neligibility verification in many instances. They didn't go through the \nprocedures they had set up for themselves. In fact, of the 2.9 million \nverification inconsistencies, they were unable to resolve 2.6 million \nof them. They wind up with 2.9 million problems when they find out \ntheir verification inconsistencies, and 2.6 million of the 2.9 \nmillion--hey, we cannot figure this out. We didn't get enough \ninformation. We don't know why the system is not working, but it is \nnot.\n  In January 2014, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nSecretary Sebelius, certified to Congress that the ObamaCare exchanges \ncould verify that individuals receiving tax credits and cost-sharing \nassistance were actually eligible to receive taxpayer-provided \nassistance. Now apparently by July of 2014, 6 months later, the people \nwho check to see if that was true or not find out it is not true at \nall.\n  Middle-class Americans have enough pain with this law already without \nfinding out their tax dollars are going to pay bills of people who \ndon't qualify to have that much of their bill paid or maybe not even \nany of their bill paid. Recently I spoke on the floor about a contract \nin Missouri and three other States with a British company, Serco, about \nthe lack of transparency and accountability in the act. As the St. \nLouis Post-Dispatch recently reported: ``Whistleblower allegations last \nmonth claimed that workers slept, read or played games at \nWentzville''--this is the Wentzville facility--``played games at \nWentzville and provoked a flurry of questions from congressional \ndelegation[s].''\n  Further quoting, ``We played Pictionary. We played 20 Questions. We \nplayed Trivial Pursuit,'' one employee told the Post-Dispatch. She \nestimated she processed six applications the entire month of December.\n  CMS didn't acknowledge these allegations but they said they had \n``adjusted Serco's work to accommodate changing operational needs.''\n  Two months ago Senator Alexander and I called these reports into \nquestion and we sent a letter to CMS and said: What are you doing there \nand why is this not working? I don't know if we said it in the letter \nbut we could have said: Why did you contract with a British company \nthat was already in trouble with the British Government for not \nproviding these services?\n  These are not particularly technical services. If there is only one \ncountry in the world that can provide services to the United States, we \nfound the one place in the world where we found a company that was \nalready in trouble with their own government for not providing services \nand said you're the company for us. We want you to be the ones that \nprovide these services for people who cannot apply over the Internet \nand send in their applications in some other way.\n\n  So to Senator Alexander I say: What about these charges that people \nsimply don't have anything to do and rather than admit that they have \nnothing to do, you see library books stacked up on the table. Here is \nthe Trivial Pursuit game. Touch your computer every once in a while. \nRefresh your computer once every 10 minutes so it looks as though you \nare doing something.\n  Two weeks ago we finally received a reply after 2 months of having \nthis question out there, and I think I put that reply in the \nCongressional Record. It was so much of a non-answer answer. It was \nmore like: We got your letter. We are going to look into this and see \nif we can figure out what's happening.\n  I don't think it would be that hard to figure out.\n  I recently learned that CMS determined that Serco had met the terms \nand conditions of the contract which apparently involved, if you \nbelieve these employees, playing board games and reading library books, \nand CMS decided this British company does such a great job they were \ngoing to exercise the first option of the contract and on June 28 they \nawarded an extended contract to the company through what they said was \n``a full and open competition'' to provide these services.\n  The lesson here is that the government needs to think long and hard \nbefore it gets into the world of making decisions for people that \npeople can better make for themselves. The government doesn't need to \nthink long and hard to believe there is a government responsibility to \nensure a certain amount of consumer protection, that what companies say \nthey are going to do they are required to do, that they clearly tell \nyou what they are going to do. Families can decide what they want in \ntheir insurance policy better than\n\n[[Page S4256]]\n\nthe government can decide what they want in their insurance policy.\n\n  I am sure every Member in the Senate gets stacks of letters--I know I \nget them--from those who are retired and don't understand why they need \npediatric dental care and policies that cover a half dozen things they \ncould never possibly use. They don't understand why those policies are \nnow so expensive that they can no longer afford to have the policy they \nhad. They don't understand the reason for cutting Medicare and starting \na new government program. It doesn't make sense to them. It doesn't \nmake sense to cut funding to a program--a program which is clearly \nfacing challenges as our society gets older--by $600 or $700 billion \nover 10 years in order to start a new program where the costs will be \nso much more than anybody anticipated.\n  I am pleased to join my friends today who have been here for the \nbetter part of this last hour talking about the challenges we face. We \nknow there are better solutions. More competition and buying health \ncare insurance across State lines would have been a couple of \nsolutions. Associated health plans where a small business or an \nindividual can find some group to become part of--the government could \nhave made that easier instead of making it illegal and impossible.\n  There should be more transparency by providers. I would like to know \nwhat hospitals and doctors charge and what their results are. And they \nknow. There is no reason that cannot be made available. In fact, one of \nthe better provisions in the Affordable Care Act said the government is \nsupposed to do that, but of all the things the government could have \ndone, that is something the government has not found time to do.\n  They could address medical liability reform. There was a double \nhandful and maybe even just a single handful of things we could have \ndone to say: Let's try these things and see if they don't make the \nsystem work better and see what lesson we learn by injecting these two \nor three or four or five things into a health care system that was the \nbest health care system in the world; it just didn't have the amount of \ncompetition, transparency, and access it needed to have.\n  I will continue to hope we will move forward, learn the hard-learned \nlessons of the implementation of this plan, and go back and find what \nwas working so well and figure out what we need to do to make that work \neven better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yesterday I came to the floor and spoke \nabout President Obama's reluctance to see firsthand the ongoing and \ngrowing humanitarian crisis occurring on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n  Today I come to the floor to renew my call--as other elected \nofficials from both sides of the aisle have done--urging President \nObama to please come to the border, where this humanitarian crisis is \nunfolding. It has been reported that the President will be in Texas for \n2 days starting tomorrow. He will be there Wednesday and Thursday on a \nfundraising trip.\n  I am not suggesting a handshake on the tarmac or a roundtable 500 \nmiles away from the border, but please come and see it with your own \neyes, as I have. Talk to the Border Patrol. Learn from not only the \nmigrants who have traversed Mexico at the risk of their own lives to \ncome to the United States, but find out what we need to do to deal with \nthe ongoing crisis and what we need to do to solve it.\n  I urge him to do so not as a political statement but so he can \nwitness what is a very sad and in many ways tragic situation and one \nthat could have been mitigated if not prevented. Unfortunately, this is \na humanitarian crisis that his policies and the perception about his \ncommitment to enforce our laws have helped create.\n  Given the recent White House announcement that the President refuses \nto visit the Rio Grande Valley this week, it unfortunately appears that \nmy request today will fall on deaf ears and therefore suggests to the \nAmerican people that either the President doesn't really understand \nthis border crisis or he simply doesn't care.\n  To give the President a fair shake, I was with the President after \nthe tragic shootings at Fort Hood in 2009 and last year. I was with the \nPresident at the memorial service in West, where first responders were \ntragically killed as a result of an explosion. Why he is so stubborn \nand hardheaded that he refuses to visit the Rio Grande Valley and \nwitness this ongoing humanitarian crisis with his own eyes is really \nmystifying.\n  Governor Perry has been doing what I have been doing and urging the \nPresident to visit the border. He happened to share with the media--\nGovernor Perry, that is--last night a White House letter inviting him \nto an immigration roundtable in Dallas. This crisis is unfolding on the \nborder and not in Dallas. I brought a map of Texas with me so the \nPresident can see this for himself. This is Dallas. This is where the \ncrisis is unfolding in the Rio Grande Valley, which is about 500 miles \naway.\n  Thankfully, the President doesn't have to fly commercial; he flies on \nAir Force One. My guess is that it would probably take him an hour out \nof his scheduled activities in Texas to go to the border and maybe \nanother hour on the ground to talk to the Border Patrol, as I did last \nweek. If he did that, he would see these children jammed in detention \nfacilities at the Border Patrol detention stations. It would give him \nan opportunity to talk to some of them, as I did in my visit last week. \nI think it would be helpful to the President.\n  I think one of the biggest problems Presidents have is they end up \nliving in a bubble. They only get access to information that is \nfiltered through their advisers and counselors, and sometimes \nPresidents simply don't understand; they are tone deaf to the problems \nwhich confront the country. That is why it would be in the best \ninterests of my constituents in Texas, it would be in the best \ninterests of these children who are part of this humanitarian crisis, \nand it would be a contribution toward a solution to this crisis if the \nPresident would simply travel 500 miles from Dallas, TX, where he \ninvited Governor Perry to a roundtable, down to the Rio Grande Valley.\n  As I said, the President's trip to Texas will focus on fundraising, \nand I understand that. But the problem is his policies have had a \ndisproportionate impact upon my constituents who live along the U.S.-\nMexico border. In fact, it is my recollection that the President of the \nUnited States has not once visited the Rio Grande Valley, where a \nmajority of this ongoing crisis is taking place.\n  He did come to El Paso back in 2011. When people suggested we had a \nproblem with security at the border, he ridiculed them by saying: Well, \nmaybe we ought to build a moat along the border. That is actually \ninsulting coming from a person who has never actually been to the \nborder, particularly the Rio Grande Valley, where a majority of these \nchildren are crossing.\n  Indeed, over time what has happened is much of the illegal \nimmigration that comes across the border has migrated from Nogales, AZ, \nto the Rio Grande Valley. You can't see it on this map, but if you \nunderstand the geography here, most of these children are coming from \nCentral America. The shortest distance from Guatemala and Honduras to \nthe United States is through the Rio Grande Valley of Texas.\n  The President should also visit Brooks County, which is a place I \nhave visited. This is where the Falfurrias checkpoint is located. They \nhave found many dead bodies of immigrants who died from exposure while \ntrying to circumvent the checkpoint at Fallfurrias. What happens is \ncoyotes, as they call them--human smugglers--will bring them across the \nborder, put them in stash houses on the border, and many of those \nconditions are inhumane in and of themselves. What will then happen is \nthat the coyotes--smugglers--will bring them in trucks up the highway, \nand before they hit the checkpoint in Fallfurrias, they will tell them \nto get out of the truck, give them a milk jug full of water, and tell \nthem they will see them on the north side of the checkpoint.\n  So dozens, if not hundreds, if not thousands of immigrants over time \ntry to walk--some in the 100-plus-degree Texas weather--around this \ncheckpoint, and some simply don't make it. If you understand where they \nhave come from--some from Central America--many are terribly \ndehydrated, already ill from exposure, and for many\n\n[[Page S4257]]\n\nof them their last steps are in Brooks County while trying to walk \naround this checkpoint in Fallfurrias.\n  I think the President would benefit from doing what I have done. He \nshould visit the residents in Brooks County, talk to the Border Patrol, \nand learn more about the problem and how we might effect a solution. If \nhe refuses to go out of stubborn pride or whatever the reason is, then \nhe will simply be ignorant of the best ways we can work together to \nsolve this underlying problem.\n\n  In recent weeks I have shared only a few of the many horrific stories \nregarding the dangerous journey countless numbers of children take to \nget to the United States from Central America. They call the train that \nmany of them ride in the corridors controlled by the cartels who treat \nhuman beings as a commodity--like drugs and guns. They treat human \nbeings as a commodity that makes money for them. These immigrants go \nthrough the corridors on a train system they call The Beast.\n  There is a chilling book written by Salvadoran journalist Oscar \nMartinez about The Beast. In it, you find out that 6 out of 10--maybe \nmore--women who come up along this train system known as The Beast are \nsexually assaulted. Migrants are routinely kidnapped and held for \nransom by the gangs and cartels that patrol this area, and many of them \nsimply don't make it.\n  I shudder to think of how many of the young children--some as young \nas 5 have been detained at the border region--never make it to the \nborder because they die in the process. That is not humanitarian. That \nis not friendly. That is cruel. We ought to be telling the truth about \nthis horrific journey and discouraging parents from sending their \nchildren from Central America up through Mexico on the back of The \nBeast only to die in the process or to be assaulted, kidnapped, or \nhorribly injured and maimed.\n  Well, this is one of the many reasons why I think the President would \nbenefit from a visit. It is hard to ignore the facts, especially when \nyou see them with your own eyes and you get a chance to talk to our \nhard-working professional Border Patrol, doing an incredible job with \nlimited resources.\n  When you have 52,000 children coming across the southwestern border \nat the Rio Grande sector since October and 39,000 women with minor \nchildren detained in the Rio Grande sector, unless you go and talk to \nthe Border Patrol and learn about this with your own ears and eyes, you \nmay not realize that drug interdictions are depressed because our \nBorder Patrol is basically trying to change diapers and deal with the \nhumanitarian crisis. They are overwhelmed and are unable to do one of \ntheir principal jobs, which is to interdict illegal drug importations \ninto the United States.\n  So I hope the President will reconsider. He is not going to Texas \nuntil tomorrow. My understanding is he will be there for 2 days, and \ncertainly he has an hour or 2 hours out of his schedule that he could \ndedicate to seeing the crisis for himself and learning more about it, \nand then coming back and working with us to try to stop it.\n  Of course, we all feel nothing but sympathy for the children and \nfamilies who sacrifice their lives trying to make it to the United \nStates but fail because of the impression that our immigration laws \nsimply will not be enforced. Many of my colleagues have come to the \nfloor and said, If we would pass the comprehensive immigration bill the \nSenate passed last year, that would do it. Well, I would say, with all \nrespect, that is demonstrably false, because even the President and \nSecretary Johnson of the Department of Homeland Security have conceded \nthat none of these children would be eligible, under the President's \ndeferred action Executive order--none of them would be eligible for \nentry and to stay in the United States. So passing that law would have \nnothing to do with this current crisis.\n  Between President Obama's failure to enforce our immigration laws and \nhis ever-shifting explanations, it is no wonder he has lost credibility \non this issue. Many Americans simply don't have confidence that the \nPresident is willing to faithfully execute the laws of the United \nStates, including our immigration laws. No wonder Speaker Boehner and \nso many of our House colleagues have gotten so frustrated they have \ndecided maybe the only alternative is to take the President to court. \nWe know the President has had a pretty bad couple of weeks when it \ncomes to overreach, and he has been rebuked several times recently for \nunconstitutional acts such as trying to determine when the Senate is in \nrecess and evade the confirmation process in the Senate.\n  If the President wants to know why we haven't been able to pass \nimmigration reform, all he has to do is look in the mirror. All he has \nto do is look at his own policies which have created an enormous amount \nof distrust between not only Congress and the executive branch but in \nhis agencies so that they will actually do what they are supposed to \ndo, such as the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement--ICE--and the other components of the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  Given all the differing narratives coming out of the White House \nconcerning this surge of unaccompanied minors, it is time for the \nPresident to directly address the problem.\n  I know the President has sent over today a $3.7 billion request for \nmore money. I have no doubt that some pieces of it are justified. For \nexample, we need enhanced detention facilities. We need more \nimmigration judges and other people as part of that process so hearings \ncan be conducted on a timely basis and a legal determination made \naccording to existing law whether people can stay or whether they have \nto be returned to their country of origin.\n  Visiting the border is just one in a series of steps the President \ncould take to regain some of his own credibility but also to help \naddress this crisis.\n  This is not just a humanitarian crisis; this is also a national \nsecurity crisis, as recently testified to by the head of Southern \nCommand, General Kelly, a Marine general who is head of that combatant \ncommand. He is in charge of that area of the globe from Mexico south \nknown as Southern Command, and he says because of inadequate resources \nand equipment and manpower to deal with the drug cartels moving illegal \ndrugs from South America up through Central America through Mexico to \nthe United States, 75 percent of the time, General Kelly said, they \nsimply have to sit and watch because they don't have the resources. I \nwould hope that some of the money included in this $3.7 billion request \nwould be dedicated to making sure that General Kelly and our law \nenforcement agencies have the resources and equipment necessary to stop \nthe drug cartels from moving drugs from South America through Central \nAmerica and up through Mexico.\n  As General Kelly said, we have this intersection of criminal conduct \nand terrorism that sometimes takes place with organizations such as \nHezbollah, for example, that has established a presence in South \nAmerica, historically, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure \nout this vulnerability can be exploited by other people and not just \nthe drug cartels.\n  The question remains, if one has enough money, can one make it into \nthe United States? Unfortunately, I think we have to answer that \nquestion in the affirmative. Last year alone, 414,000 people were \ndetained on our southwestern border from 100 different countries--100 \ndifferent countries. So this isn't just about people who have no hope \nand no opportunity trying to come to the United States from Mexico and \ntrying to get a job; this is about uncontrolled immigration through our \nsouthwestern border from all over the world. Admittedly, most of them \ncome from Mexico and Central America, but this is a vulnerability where \npeople can come from Pakistan, they can come from Afghanistan, they can \neven come from Iran--countries of special interest, countries that are \nstate sponsors of international terrorism. So this is worthy of the \nPresident's attention and worthy of a Presidential visit, and I hope he \nwill change his mind and do that.\n  I think President Obama needs a wakeup call. He needs to realize that \nthe situation along the border is not as rosy as perhaps he is under \nthe impression it is. Only by visiting the border and visiting \nfirsthand and seeing with his own eyes and listening with his own ears \nto the professionals who are working there so hard and are simply \noverwhelmed will he be able to get a good\n\n[[Page S4258]]\n\nidea of not only what the problem is but what the solutions are. Then \nand only then, I believe, will he be ready and will we be ready to sit \ndown and work together through this request the President has sent us \nand figure out how we can solve the problem.\n  Once again, I hope the President will reconsider his decision, since \nhe is going to be in Texas anyway on Wednesday and Thursday, and go to \nthe border, just 500 miles away. On Air Force One it is easy to get \nthere. It won't take much time. He could spend an hour on the ground, \nand then I think he will come away glad he has taken advantage and \naccepted this invitation by Governor Perry and me and other Texans to \ncome see the problem for himself.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             VA Health Care\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I believe when it comes to caring for our \nNation's heroes, we can't accept anything less than excellence.\n  As have many of my colleagues, I have been very troubled by the most \nrecent allegations of the VA failing to provide veterans timely health \ncare. The VA generally offers very high-quality health care and does \nmany things as well or better than the private sector. But when you are \ncaring for our Nation's heroes and you have the backing of the full \nresources of the Federal Government, ``just as good'' is not enough. We \nexpect more. So I am very frustrated to be here again talking about \nthese deeply disturbing issues and the Department's repeated failures \nto change.\n  GAO and the inspector general have reported on these problems many \ntimes over the years. Last Congress we did a great deal of work around \nwait times, particularly for mental health care. I think the VA is \nstarting to see that business as usual is not acceptable.\n  The administration has taken steps to begin addressing some of the \nmajor systemwide problems, but much more needs to be done. Tomorrow, \nwhen I meet with the President's nominee for the VA Secretary, I am \ngoing to ask him how he plans to make these changes. That is why I am \nvery glad to be serving on the veterans conference committee, because \nCongress needs to act as well.\n  The most important thing we can do right now is to pass responsible \nand effective legislation to bring much-needed reforms to the VA, and \nwe need to do it soon.\n  There have been major bipartisan efforts in both the House and in the \nSenate to move legislation addressing these problems. Many Members have \nbeen part of those efforts, and I commend them all for their commitment \nto bipartisanship and for putting the needs of our veterans first. It \nis vital that we continue to build on this bipartisan momentum and to \ncontinue making progress if we are going to address some of the \nimmediate accountability and transparency concerns that are plaguing \nthe VA and to fix its deep-seated structural and cultural challenges.\n  I know Members have a wide range of concerns with the bill, and I \nbelieve we can address those concerns responsibly and in a way that \nputs our veterans first and gives the VA the tools it needs to address \nthe challenges it faces. That means building and strengthening the VA \nsystem so it delivers the best care for the long term. But it is \nimportant for us to act quickly to start making these changes. We \ncannot allow this process to break down. Veterans are still waiting to \nget the care they need.\n  Many of us were rightly outraged the VA did not act to help veterans \nbecause the Department ignored all the information and did nothing. \nThis Congress must not do the same and fail veterans by not acting.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to work as hard and as quickly as \npossible to finalize an agreement and get it to the President. More \nproblems will be uncovered and the investigations will proceed, and we \nwill need more action from the VA, the administration, and Congress, \nbecause our Nation made a promise to the men and women who answer the \ncall of duty, and one of the most important ways we uphold that is by \nmaking sure our veterans can get access to the health care they need \nand they deserve, no matter what it takes.\n\n\n                           Highway Trust Fund\n\n  I also wish to speak about another important issue Congress needs to \nact on, and that is the looming crisis with the highway trust fund.\n  As is the case with other States around the country, my home State of \nWashington relies on the highway trust fund to pay for construction \nprojects. These are projects that ease traffic on our highways, repair \nbridges, and make safety improvements. This year, for example, \nofficials in Washington State plan to use money from the highway trust \nfund to improve safety at railroad crossings in Centralia. They plan to \nreplace anchor cables on bridges in Seattle, and they plan to repave \nroads across the State to fix potholes and to make roads smoother for \nour drivers. But here in DC, the Department of Transportation and many \nof us in Congress have been warning for months that the highway trust \nfund needs more revenue to pay for these critical projects in my home \nState and across the country. Without that revenue, the trust fund is \ngoing to reach critically low levels next month.\n  This is coming now just a few months after Republicans pushed us into \na government shutdown. If Congress fails to act soon, families and \nbusinesses and States would see another shutdown, this time with \nhighway projects around the country.\n  I had hoped we would be able to get this done by now. The last thing, \nI can tell my colleagues, the American people want to see right now is \nanother countdown clock on the evening news. But we still have a chance \nto get this done before it is too late. Instead of lurching to yet \nanother crisis and putting our construction projects at risk, let's \nwork together and do the right thing for our families and our workers \nand the economy.\n  The clock is ticking for Congress to find the much-needed revenue. \nStarting August 1, the Department of Transportation said it will start \ndelaying payments to our States for projects that ease traffic on \nclogged highways and make important repairs to our bridges. On average, \nStates will lose 28 percent of their Federal funding. Without that \nmoney, many States are going to have to delay or stop work on their \nconstruction sites. Officials in my home State have said up to 43 \nhighway projects could be threatened, and across the country more than \n1,000 construction projects could be at risk, according to the \nDepartment of Transportation.\n  If there is one thing Democrats and Republicans should be able to \nagree on, and usually do, is that we should be investing in and \nimproving our transportation infrastructure, not letting it crumble. A \nconstruction shutdown would threaten jobs and businesses. If States \nhave to scale back their plans, companies are going to hire fewer \nworkers to repair and improve roads and bridges across the country. \nWithout a fix, nearly 700,000 jobs will be at risk next year, according \nto the Department of Transportation. And let's remember, the \nconstruction industry was one of the hardest hit sectors after the \neconomic downturn and has not yet fully bounced back. In fact, weakness \nin the U.S. labor market is actually due to the lack of growth in the \nconstruction sector, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. \nLouis. Allowing our highway trust fund to dip to critically low levels \nwould deliver another blow to the construction sector as it is \nstruggling to recover.\n\n  Last fall, families and communities across our country were forced to \nendure a completely unnecessary government shutdown. That shutdown, we \nall know, hurt our people and threatened a very fragile economic \nrecovery and shook the confidence of the American people who expect \ntheir elected officials to come together and avoid such an unnecessary \ncrisis. I was proud to work with Democrats and Republicans at the end \nof last year to pass a bipartisan budget deal that prevented another \ngovernment shutdown. It restored critical investments in families and \nthe economy and it put a halt to the constant budget crises.\n  I was proud to build on that bipartisan momentum and work with my \nfriend Senator Isakson and others on a\n\n[[Page S4259]]\n\nworkforce investment deal that passed the Senate with strong bipartisan \nsupport. We hope, by the way, that will pass the House tomorrow and get \nsigned into law.\n\n  We know bipartisanship work is possible. We know the country is \nbetter for it when it happens. We know it is what families we represent \nexpect from all of us. So today I am calling on Republicans to work \nwith us in good faith to do the right thing and help us avoid this \nconstruction shutdown. I know Republican leaders once again are worried \nabout their tea party fringe pushing them into another unnecessary \ncrisis, but I hope they are able to push them aside and work with us to \nget this done. Republicans saw how devastating it was for them--and \ntheir constituents--when they hurt the country with the government \nshutdown. I am hopeful that gives them any additional incentive they \nmay need to work with us this time.\n  State and local governments, workers, businesses, and drivers are \nlooking to us to resolve this crisis and avoid another shutdown. States \ncannot afford important highway construction projects without this \nimportant highway trust fund. Families cannot afford to have a few \nMembers of Congress putting jobs at risk again. With the clock winding \ndown fast, we cannot afford to put this off any longer. So let's \nresolve this looming crisis. Let's work together and prevent a \nconstruction shutdown this summer for our economy, for our businesses, \nand for our families across the country.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Summer Food Programs\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to talk about the \nchallenge we have to make sure every child in America who is eligible \nfor one of the programs that help children have enough to eat and have \nnutritious food is getting served. The problem across the country is we \nhave a number of children who are receiving meals during the school \nyear, either school breakfast as part of the School Breakfast Program, \nor the School Lunch Program. So at some point in time they are getting \na meal at school, and maybe more than one meal. Then they go home for \nthe summer, and even though they are eligible for the summer programs, \nwhich tend to be in different locations, may not be at one school or \none central location, a lot of children do not get the benefit of those \nprograms. The program name is the Summer Food Service Program. Many \nAmericans may have heard of the School Lunch Program, the School \nBreakfast Program, probably have heard less about the Summer Food \nService Program.\n  We know that even though children are taking a summer vacation from \nschool, hunger does not take a summer vacation. Hunger is always a \nclear and present danger, a reality for children, especially children \nin low-income communities from low-income families. This is a reality \nfor so many children, millions of them across the country and their \nfamilies. But it is also preventable. It is a tragedy when a child does \nnot have enough to eat. But this is preventable if we do the right \nthing.\n  We know that during the school year, when you add up all of the \nchildren who receive a meal at school, it amounts to about 21 million. \nThat is the good news, that that many children are being served. The \nbad news is when they go home for their summer vacation, by one count, \nthe last count we have, only 3 million children are getting a summer \nmeal, even though as high as 21 million are eligible--or 21 million \nreceive that kind of help during the school year.\n  In my home State of Pennsylvania, the dropoff, the last number we \nhave, is during the course of the year, just about 777,000 children \nreceived a meal, about three-quarters of a million children. The \nproblem, though, is the summer number goes way down to, at last count, \n105,000, just a little more than 105,000, so there is a little more \nthan a 7-to-1 difference between the school year and the summer \nprogram.\n  One of the things we have to do is to get the word out. That is why I \nbrought along this poster that highlights this. To find a site in your \nState, in your community--there are many sites, tens of thousands of \nthem across the country--you may need to inquire about it. You may need \nto make a phone call to find out about the sites--1-866-3-HUNGRY, and \nthen a different one, 1-877-8-HAMBRE.\n  We want to make sure that in addition to knowing the 800 numbers, you \nhave a Web site. It is pasummermeals.com. That, of course, applies to \nPennsylvania, pasummermeals.com. So if you live in Pennsylvania, that \nis your Web site.\n  These numbers are national numbers, the 1-866-3-HUNGRY, and then 1-\n877-8-HAMBRE. That is one way to find out, for families to find out, \nfor advocates, anyone who is concerned about this or wants to know more \nabout what their community has available for them, because, as I said \nbefore, it is different than the circumstances during the year. During \nthe year, children go to a school and that school has a School \nBreakfast Program and/or a School Lunch Program. In the summer, you \nhave the same services available, the same opportunities, same \neligibility for children, but the sites are--there are more sites. And \nsometimes, when people do not know, when they cannot be served by a \nschool, they may have to go to another place in their community.\n  This is a major issue. Because we know that all the science tells us \nif we want children to learn more now and earn more later, that is what \nwe all hope is not just the right thing to do, but if you have enough \nto eat you probably learn better. Obviously if you can learn more, you \nare going to earn more, literally, in your lifetime. This is not just a \nrhyme, it has a scientific foundation.\n  We want to make sure that in addition to having the best possible \neducational programs for children to learn, we want to also create the \nbest circumstances for them to learn. I do not know about people here, \nbut in the course of my day, if I do not eat breakfast and then it gets \nto noontime or 1:00 and I have not had something to eat, it is pretty \nhard for me to be as functional and as effective as I want to be. I can \nonly imagine what it is like for a child who does not have enough to \neat, not just on one particular day of the week but maybe more than one \nday or a couple of days in a row. I do not know how they can function, \nlet alone learn and study, take tests and achieve and be successful \nover time. They need the same kind of help in the summer as they have \nduring the year.\n  So if we are making it possible, if our government and communities \naround the country are making it possible for a child to have a school \nbreakfast and/or a school lunch, why would we not make sure they have \nmeals during the summer as well, especially when there is a program in \nplace they are eligible for?\n  We have to call attention to it. I know this is a challenge in all of \nour States. We want to make sure we are highlighting, getting \ninformation out so our children can have opportunities not only to have \nenough to eat but to eat meals that are nutritious.\n  I was at a site in Philadelphia yesterday, the Gesu School, which is \nin north Philadelphia. I taught there as a volunteer 31 years ago. I \nactually not only handed out the lunches to the children at that site, \nbut I was able to see what was in them. They were good meals, but they \nwere also very nutritious, something that can help a child grow and \nlearn and move into the future. We are grateful we have these programs. \nBut if we do not tell people enough about them, we are going to \ncontinue to have that terrible dropoff from the number of children \nserved during the year--again, as I said, 21 million children, dropping \noff to only 3 million children served in the summer. There is no reason \nwhy we should allow that to happen. There is no reason why we should \nsay that is anything other than unacceptable.\n\n  I am grateful to have this opportunity and grateful for the support \nthis\n\n[[Page S4260]]\n\nprogram has across the country. We need to get the word out. We need to \nget these 800 numbers out as much as we can.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 or 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Research Misconduct\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Earlier this year I learned about a case of research \nmisconduct that happened at Iowa State University. A team of scientists \nwas working on a vaccine to fight HIV. One of the researchers, Dr. Han, \ncommitted fraud to make it appear as though the vaccine for HIV was \nworking. He purposely spiked the testing samples so it looked as if the \nvaccines actually fought HIV. Dr. Han's fraud helped his team get $16 \nmillion in national grant money from the National Institutes of Health \nor around here we refer to that as the NIH. NIH is part of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services or what we refer to as HHS.\n  HHS gives out billions of dollars in research grants every year. In \n2013 NIH gave out over $20 billion in research grants. Obviously that \nis a huge amount of money by any standard.\n  The government has a responsibility to make sure this money is well \nspent. Unfortunately, it looks as if the government is relying on the \ngrant recipients to do oversight instead of the government seeing that \nthe money is well spent.\n  In this case officials at Iowa State University were unaware of the \nfraud until another team of scientists couldn't duplicate the results. \nIowa State University took the problem very seriously and notified \nHealth and Human Services. I compliment them for that. But if it \nweren't for Iowa State University's actions, I doubt the Government \never would have found out about this tremendous amount of fraud.\n  The Office of Research Integrity at Health and Human Services was \ncreated for the specific purpose to prevent and investigate research \nmisconduct. The Office of Research Integrity investigated the \nallegations of misconduct at Iowa State University and in fact \nconfirmed that Dr. Han knowingly committed fraud. Dr. Han even admitted \nto the fraud. The Office of Research Integrity imposed only a 3-year \nban on Dr. Han from receiving any more Federal grant money.\n  That is basically a slap on the wrist from the Office of Research \nIntegrity. It makes absolutely no sense that someone who admitted to \nthat level of fraud could be eligible for another Federal grant in just \n3 years.\n  I asked the Office of Research Integrity why the penalty for Dr. Han \nwas so light and if it would try to recover any of the $19 million in \nresearch grants. The taxpayers subsidized what was supposed to be \npromising HIV research, but it was based on Dr. Han's fraud. His phony \nresults were the basis for those grant applications. The Office of \nResearch Integrity says it considers a 3-year ban a very strict \npenalty. To Iowans, that doesn't sound like a very commonsense penalty.\n  In fact, the Office of Research Integrity says that 3 years is the \nmaximum penalty it can give unless there are aggravating circumstances. \nThat 3-year limit is set by the White House Office of Management and \nBudget. So the Office of Research Integrity claims that somehow its \nhands are tied. But in this case the Office of Research Integrity did \nnot even try to demonstrate aggravating circumstances to enforce a \nlonger debarment than 3 years against Dr. Han.\n  The Office of Research Integrity admitted that there is nothing to \nkeep Dr. Han from conducting research again funded by American \ntaxpayers after those 3 years. The Office of Research Integrity claims \nit does not have the authority to recover funds in case of research \nconduct.\n  Now, think about that for a minute. This Office of Research \nIntegrity, with the responsibility to make sure money is wisely used \nand research is honest, says it does not have the authority to recover \nfunds obtained by fraud.\n  The Office of Research Integrity--we are talking about research \nintegrity--says it is the responsibility of the agency that issued the \nresearch grant to recover money obtained by fraud.\n  So I asked the National Institutes of Health about its involvement in \nthis case. The National Institutes of Health first said that only \n$500,000 of the $19 million in research grants would be recovered. The \nNational Institutes of Health also claimed it was not responsible for \nrecovering the fraudulent grant money. According to the National \nInstitutes of Health, oversight is the responsibility of the \neducational institution receiving the money. NIH said:\n\n       ISU as grantee is legally responsible and accountable for \n     the use of funds provided for the performance of grant-\n     supported project or activity.\n\n  It looks as if each office I asked just simply passes the buck along \nto somebody else. But a pass-the-buck attitude doesn't work when it \ncomes to government oversight.\n  I also asked Health and Human Services about the case. Health and \nHuman Services said that:\n\n       Grant recipients have the primary obligation to conduct \n     investigations of their own researchers.\n\n  Universities need to be responsible and accountable with Federal \nresearch grants. By taking action when it learned of the fraud, Iowa \nState University did that in this case. But that does not give the \ngovernment an excuse not to do oversight. And if the government is \nrelying on universities to report fraud instead of doing the oversight, \nthere are probably other cases of fraud that are never caught.\n  If someone writes a taxpayer-funded check, they should be responsible \nfor making sure the money is being well spent. The funding agency, and \nHealth and Human Services as a whole, should do more to protect \ntaxpayers' dollars, especially when many are calling for even more \ntaxpayer funding for the National Institutes of Health.\n  The Office of Research Integrity has a clear mission to prevent and \ninvestigate cases of research misconduct.\n  But I am concerned not only about this case but allegations about the \nOffice of Research Integrity made by its former director, Dr. David \nWright. Dr. Wright resigned only days after I started my investigation.\n  In his resignation letter, Dr. Wright said that bureaucratic red tape \nwas keeping him--Dr. Wright--from doing his job. He said up to 65 \npercent of his time was spent ``navigating the remarkably dysfunctional \nHHS bureaucracy to secure resources and . . . get permission for ORI to \nserve the research community.''\n\n  We ought to take his allegations very seriously, and HHS should do so \nas well. When researchers abuse the public's trust, the Office of \nResearch Integrity should use all the powers at its disposal to resolve \nthe problem.\n  I recently learned that Dr. Han has been indicted for four felony \ncounts of making false statements. Regardless of the outcome of this \nindictment, it is encouraging to see an effort to increase \naccountability for spending of taxpayers' money.\n  Also earlier this week the National Institutes of Health confirmed \nfor the Des Moines Register that it would stop the final grant payment. \nThat of course will save taxpayers $1.4 million.\n  So it is good news that the National Institutes of Health is taking \naction to recover taxpayers' money in this fraud case. But this is only \none case, and the National Institutes of Health's actions came after \nmonths of public attention and my investigating. I worry that more \ncases may go unnoticed and even unaddressed if there isn't a public \noutcry. We can't afford that. We can't afford to have cases like this \ngo unnoticed and unaddressed.\n  Federal oversight of research funds is far too weak. The government \nis doing far too little to recover money lost to fraud. We can't afford \na ``fund it and forget it'' attitude. Fraudsters need to be held \naccountable, and people handing out taxpayers' money need to know that \nif they are careless with that money, Uncle Sam will come knocking at \nthe door for a refund.\n  Although Secretary Sebelius recently left Health and Human Services, \nI expect the new Secretary Sylvia Mathews\n\n[[Page S4261]]\n\nBurwell to take this issue very seriously. Ultimately, the Secretary of \nHHS has the responsibility to ensure that health research grants are \nnot abused. She needs to ensure that agencies within HHS have all the \ntools they need to recover money lost to fraud and to prevent it from \nhappening in the first place. Secretary Burwell should investigate Dr. \nWright's allegations about the Office of Research Integrity and fix the \nproblems that Dr. Wright outlined before his resignation.\n  Oversight is an extremely important part of the government's role. \nUnfortunately, it is often ignored and taxpayers' dollars are abused. \nWhen researchers abuse the public's trust, Health and Human Services \nand its components should use all the power they have to investigate, \nresolve the problem, and get the money back. They owe it to the \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this past Wednesday, July 2, I was \nextremely pleased and honored to be a part of the awarding of the \nPurple Heart Medal with Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster to a brave soldier \nKentucky is proud to call one of its own. SPC Earl Wilson of Liberty, \nKY, received his Purple Heart with Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for wounds \nsuffered while serving our country in Vietnam. I want to share the \nhonor and majesty of this event with my colleagues and so therefore ask \nunanimous consent that the full text of my remarks at the ceremony to \naward SPC Earl Wilson his Purple Heart with Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster, as \nwell as the text of the two proclamations for the Purple Hearts, be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record:\n\nSenator McConnell's Remarks at Awarding of Purple Heart With Bronze Oak \n          Leaf Cluster to Specialist Earl Wilson, July 2, 2014\n\n       Thank you for that kind introduction. It is my great honor \n     to be here for the presentation of the Purple Heart Medal \n     with Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster to Army Specialist Earl Wilson \n     of Liberty, Kentucky, for wounds received in action while in \n     service to our country in Vietnam.\n       It's a long-overdue honor that is finally upon us, thanks \n     to Earl's many family and friends who helped make this moment \n     possible. This event today is a testament to the unbreakable \n     bonds of family and friendship.\n       Because this ceremony is a high honor and a prestigious \n     occasion, we have several dignitaries with us who I want to \n     recognize, including State Senator Jimmy Higdon and Casey \n     County Judge-Executive Ronald Wright. Casey County Sheriff \n     Jerry Coleman and the county circuit court clerk, Craig \n     Overstreet, are with us. And I'm pleased to welcome Casey \n     County Attorney Tom Weddle and Liberty Mayor Steve Sweeny.\n       It's a pleasure to have Chris Smrt of the Kentucky chapter \n     of the Military Order of the Purple Heart here today to \n     welcome Specialist Wilson into their ranks, as well as VFW \n     Post 5704 Commander Claude Wyatt. Both organizations are \n     strong advocates for our veterans.\n       I'd like to recognize Glen Phillips, a veteran who played \n     an important role in today's ceremony.\n       Let me also say a special hello to my longtime friends, \n     Betty Lou and T.M. Weddle.\n       It's also an honor to recognize Sergeant Jesse T. \n     Wethington, fellow resident of Liberty and fellow member of \n     the Military Order of the Purple Heart, here today. Jesse, \n     welcome.\n       Finally, I'd like to welcome the members of Earl Wilson's \n     family who are from right here in Liberty and came to join us \n     today, including Earl's wife, Brenda, and family members \n     Crystal and John Davis; Melissa Wilson Durham; Addison and \n     Ian Davis; Tanner and Blake Durham; Jimmy Couch, Cierra \n     Couch, and Dave Brown.\n       The original Purple Heart was established by General George \n     Washington himself, and as such the Purple Heart is the \n     oldest existing military award that is still given to \n     servicemembers.\n       For a period in our country's history, however, the honor \n     fell into disuse. In 1932, to mark the bicentennial of \n     Washington's birth, it was General Douglas MacArthur who \n     spearheaded its revival.\n       We remember MacArthur for many things, not least of which \n     are his words. To an audience at West Point Military Academy, \n     he once said:\n       `` `Duty, Honor, Country'--those three hallowed words \n     reverently dictate what you ought to be, what you can be, \n     what you will be. They are your rallying point to build \n     courage when courage seems to fail, to regain faith when \n     there seems to be little cause for faith, to create hope when \n     hope becomes forlorn.''\n       As it turns out, these words have particular meaning for \n     the life and service of Specialist Earl Wilson. In the \n     jungles of Vietnam, he found courage where we could have not \n     blamed him for his courage failing, he found faith where \n     there was little cause for it, and he created hope when it \n     might have been lost.\n       Earl's time of service ended nearly 40 years ago, but our \n     admiration of it has not. Earl was drafted into the U.S. Army \n     and inducted on November 17, 1969. After completing basic \n     training, he was sent to Fort Polk, Louisiana, for infantry \n     school. Earl has said that in those days, if you went to Fort \n     Polk, you knew you were going to Vietnam, because Fort Polk \n     was the hottest, most miserable place there was. It was like \n     training for the intense heat.\n       Sure enough, Earl was deployed to Vietnam and served there \n     for one year, from July 1970 to July 1971. Traversing the \n     mountains and jungles of Vietnam, in an entrenched battle \n     with the enemy, was hazardous duty. Earl spent as long as 40 \n     days on patrol in the sweltering jungles, without hot food, \n     without showers, without any of the luxuries or amenities so \n     many of us take for granted here at home.\n       Deployed with Company D, 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry \n     Regiment, 23rd Infantry Division, Earl and his unit came \n     under attack one night in January 1971. As daylight broke on \n     the morning of January 7, Earl's unit went in pursuit of the \n     enemy. Following a blood trail, they were in hot pursuit when \n     they came upon a gate along their path.\n       One of Earl's fellow soldiers tried to open the gate. It \n     was stuck, so he yanked on it, not knowing the gate was booby \n     trapped. A hand grenade went off, knocking Earl and several \n     other soldiers clean to the ground. Earl got pieces of \n     shrapnel lodged in his leg, and had to be flown out for \n     medical treatment.\n       Earl may have been down, but he was not out. After \n     receiving care for his wound, he was back in action with the \n     1st Battalion, and was present on January 25 later that year \n     on patrol in Quang Ngai.\n       As his unit proceeded on foot patrol, Earl was at the \n     point. Earl circled back to the rear to check on his fellow \n     soldier and best friend Specialist William Creech Jr. of \n     Paris, Illinois. Earl's entire company had trekked the same \n     path through the bushes, but as Specialist Creech entered the \n     bushes along the same path he stepped on a hidden landmine \n     and was killed.\n       Shrapnel from the landmine struck Earl in his head and arm \n     and threw him backwards onto the ground. Earl suffered not \n     only the loss of his best friend but also a severe hearing \n     loss, which he still carries to this day. But Earl's injuries \n     could have been worse. The landmine was so powerful it tore \n     down trees that were up to five inches thick within the blast \n     radius. Earl is lucky to be alive today.\n       Earl spent another six months in Vietnam before shipping \n     out on July 8, 1971. It's ironic that as he was handed a \n     four-inch thick stack of paperwork to process out of Vietnam, \n     Earl accidentally dropped one of the folders--and learned \n     from one document that he had received the Bronze Star Medal \n     for bravery. But Earl never received the Purple Heart he \n     earned with his blood and sacrifice--until now.\n       It is thanks to the unbreakable bonds of family and \n     friendship that Earl is receiving his Purple Heart with \n     Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster today. Earl's daughter, Melissa \n     Wilson Durham, wrote me to ask for help getting her father \n     the medals he deserved. Thank you, Melissa, for honoring your \n     father's service.\n       Earl was also helped by his friend and fellow soldier, and \n     friend to Kentucky soldiers everywhere, retired Staff \n     Sergeant Glen Phillips. It was Staff Sergeant Phillips who \n     helped gather the facts in order for Earl to receive his \n     Purple Heart today.\n       Glen, who is also from Liberty, has helped look out for \n     many veterans in the area over the years. Thank you Glen, for \n     your service and for your efforts on behalf of Earl and so \n     many other fellow veterans.\n       Earl, I know you accept this award with humility and grace, \n     and with reverence and respect for your fellow soldiers who \n     fought alongside you in the jungles of Vietnam, including the \n     many who did not make it home, such as Specialist William \n     Creech.\n       We're grateful for your service, Earl, and we're grateful \n     to celebrate your sacrifice. It's never too late to honor the \n     brave.\n       By the way, for those who do not know, the Bronze Oak Leaf \n     Cluster is to signify that\n\n[[Page S4262]]\n\n     Earl is actually eligible to receive two Purple Hearts, for \n     the incident on January 7 and then also on January 25.\n       The presentation of this Purple Heart with Bronze Oak Leaf \n     Cluster is just a small recognition of the wealth of respect \n     you deserve for your service to our country and your service \n     in protecting all of us.\n       And to the values of duty, honor, country that you hold in \n     abundance, as General MacArthur prescribed--in a way that you \n     have demonstrated to all of us that it is possible to build \n     courage where there is none, to regain faith when it seems \n     lost, and to create hope when hope is what's most needed.\n       Now, the solemn moment we're gathered here for today has \n     arrived.

WEGE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, on July 7, Michigan lost a great \nchampion. Over his 94 years, Peter M. Wege accomplished many lifetimes \nworth of goals. He helped the company his father founded, Steelcase, \ninto one of the world's leading office furniture companies, employing \nthousands of Michiganians and helping cement the status of Grand Rapids \nas the world's hub of office furniture making. And had he done no more \nthan lead a great company and provide jobs to great workers, he would \nbe worthy of celebration.\n  But as his hometown paper, the Grand Rapids Press, described him with \ntypical West Michigan understatement, Pete Wege was ``an unconventional \nindustrialist.'' In a community that has benefited greatly from the \npublic spirit of its business leaders, few have rivaled the impact of \nthis remarkable man. Always aware of his good fortune and of the needs \nof his community, he poured money that could have made him one of the \nworld's wealthiest people into the Grand Rapids area and beyond. \nLibraries and schools, theaters and museums, churches and civic \nbuildings, parks and wilderness areas all benefitted from his \ngenerosity and vision.\n  And he had those two qualities--generosity and vision--in abundance. \nHe was more than a philanthropist; he was a man on a mission. That \nmission began when he was on another kind of mission, serving his \ncountry during World War II, when he flew as a transport pilot. \nPiloting an aircraft to Pittsburgh during the war, the landing field \nwas so shrouded in smog that he couldn't land. That polluted air \nlaunched him on a lifetime of dedication to environmental causes. He \ncreated the Wege Foundation in 1967 to promote educational, cultural, \nenvironmental and scientific efforts. Two years later, he established \nthe Center for Environmental Study. He wrote two books laying out his \nargument that environmental stewardship would boost the economy, rather \nthan harming growth.\n  Perhaps nowhere was Pete Wege's impact more strongly felt than in his \nlove for the Great Lakes. In 2004, he sponsored the Healing Our Waters \nconference in Michigan. His agenda was simple and powerful: ``The lakes \nare our life support system, and we've got to treat them that way,'' he \nsaid. The conference brought together environmental leaders from across \nthe country, and led to publication of a report on the need for a plan \nto restore the Great Lakes. That powerful call helped lead to the Great \nLakes Restoration Initiative, which has devoted millions of dollars to \nhabitat restoration and environmental cleanup on the lakes. The Healing \nour Waters Coalition continues today to advocate for restoration and \npreservation of the lakes Pete Wege cared about so deeply.\n  Peter Wege dedicated his life to preserving this world's natural \nbeauty, and to promoting the beauty that humankind creates. His legacy \nwill live in the cleaner waters of the Great Lakes he loved, and in the \nartistic and scientific endeavors he helped to promote. He represents \nthe best part of Michigan, the best part of America, that part that \ncelebrates what makes our world and its people so irreplaceable. I will \nmiss him and Michigan will miss him.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I too wish to pay tribute to a great \nindustrialist who became an even greater philanthropist, a passionate \nprotector of our Great Lakes, and a dear friend, Peter Wege, who passed \naway yesterday at the age of 94.\n  A man of profound faith, with a deep love for his country, Peter was \nborn in Grand Rapids, MI. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, \nPeter left the University of Michigan to serve his country as a multi-\nengine pilot for the Army Air Force.\n  When he returned from World War II, he became a salesman for an \noffice furniture company founded by his father. He wasn't given any \nbreaks--he was forced to rise through the company by virtue of his own \nhard work, not his name.\n  He eventually became vice chairman of that company, whose name was \nchanged to Steelcase, Inc., in 1954. The company became the world's \nlargest manufacturer of office furniture, and Peter was eager to use \nthe wealth he had earned to make a difference in the many causes that \nmattered to him.\n  Through the Wege Foundation, Peter made generous donations to the \narts, to education, to health care, and to other human services.\n  His greatest passion, however, was the environment and our beautiful \nGreat Lakes.\n  When he gave money to be used for the construction of a building, \nPeter never asked to see his name in gold. He only wanted the building \nto be green: He insisted on sustainable, LEED-certified design.\n  I can remember how proud Peter was to give me a book he had written. \nThe title ``Economicology,'' was a word he coined to describe his \nbelief that you could make profits without making pollution.\n  As an outgrowth of his love for Michigan, Peter was a champion for \nthe Great Lakes: His sponsorship of the ``Healing Our Waters'' \nconference brought conservationists and environmentalists from around \nthe world. This helped provide the vision for the Great Lakes \nRestoration Initiative, which has provided over $1 billion in funding \nfor nearly 3,000 projects around the Great Lakes since 2010.\n  Throughout his life, Peter strived to make the world a better place \nfor future generations. In that respect--as in every other endeavor he \ndevoted himself to--Peter was an unqualified success.\n  He will be deeply missed, but Peter's generous spirit will live on.\n  Peter will be remembered every time a child plays in the sand on one \nof our beautiful Michigan beaches.\n  Peter will be remembered every time a family gathers around a dinner \ntable to enjoy fish caught in one of our beautiful Great Lakes or the \nmany fresh, clean rivers and streams across the region.\n\n[[Page S4263]]\n\n  Peter will be remembered with every refreshing glass of clean water \nthat comes from the tap and every invigorating breath of fresh air.\n  He will never be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/08/senate-section/article/S4263-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4263-S4264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Army Specialist Ryan J. Grady\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I wish to remember the life and \nsacrifice of a remarkable young man, Army SPC Ryan J. Grady. Ryan died \nJuly 1, 2010 in Bagram, Afghanistan, in support of Operation Enduring \nFreedom due to injuries sustained when an improvised explosive device \ndetonated near his vehicle.\n  Ryan was born May 30, 1985 in Marion, KS and later moved to Bristow, \nOK. After graduating from Thunderbird Military Academy in 2003, he \njoined the Army as a combat engineer. He was awarded a Purple Heart \nfrom shrapnel wounds he received when his vehicle struck an improvised \nexplosive device during his first deployment to Iraq in 2005-2006 in \nsupport of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  After returning home in 2006, he joined the Vermont National Guard. \nIn 2008 he transferred to the Oklahoma National Guard and then returned \nto the Vermont National Guard in 2009 because he heard the unit was \ndeploying to Afghanistan.\n  Ryan grew up in a military family, with his father and brothers \nserving in the Army as well. On the day of the incident, Ryan shared a \nmeal with his brother, Kevin Grady, who was also deployed to \nAfghanistan with the Vermont National Guard.\n  Jim Grady, Jr. said Ryan's size 6-foot-4 and 240 pounds sometimes \nintimidated people, but said anyone who met him quickly could tell he \nhad a warm heart. As a soldier, he would sign off on notes with the \nwords ``saving the world one mission at a time,'' his brother said.\n  At the grand opening of the Grady Dining Facility on Bargram \nAirfield's Camp Warrior, acting director of the Army National Guard, MG \nRaymond Carpenter, said ``Specialist Ryan Grady represents to us what \nthe modern National Guard is. He joined the guard because he wanted to \nserve his country.''\n  Ryan was posthumously promoted from private first class to specialist \nand was laid to rest in Mount Pleasant Cemetery in St. Johnsbury, VT.\n  Ryan is survived by his wife Heaven, of Bristow, OK, his daughter \nAlexis, his father SFC James A. Grady of West Burke, VT, his mother \nDebbie Hudacek of Bristow, OK, stepfather Tom Hudacek of Bristow, OK, \nand his brothers: Kevin Grady of St. Johnsbury, VT and James Grady of \nMuskogee, OK.\n  Today we remember Army SPC Ryan J. Grady, a young man who loved his \nfamily and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.\n\n\n                       Sergeant Charles S. Jirtle\n\n  Madam President, today I also wish to remember the life and sacrifice \nof a remarkable young man, Army SGT Charles S. Jirtle. Along with four \nother soldiers, Scott died June 7, 2010 of injuries he sustained from \nan improvised explosive device in Dangam district of Kunar Province, \nAfghanistan, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  Scott was born September 13, 1980 in Lawton, OK and graduated from \nMacArthur High School. After graduating, he served in the Navy Reserves \nin Oklahoma City.\n  The son of an Active Duty Army master sergeant, he enlisted in the \nArmy in 2007. After completing basic training at Fort Benning, GA, he \nwas assigned to Company A, 2nd Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment, 1st \nBrigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division, Fort Campbell, KY as an \nindirect fire infantryman.\n  Scott, who served a tour in Iraq in 2007 and 2008, knew the impact \nthe deployments had on his family. His final posting on Facebook read: \n``Savannah is having a real problem with this deployment, and I pray to \nGod that He will watch over her and my children.''\n  Pastor Trey Smart said Scott's four older brothers would recruit him \nwhen they heard the ice cream truck coming down the street. ``They \nalways knew if they sent Scott to ask Terry and Virginia for money, \nthey wouldn't turn him down because he was the youngest,'' Smart said.\n  His parents said, ``Our son Charles Scott Jirtle joined the Army \nbecause he wanted to take care of his children. He extended his \nenlistment for this deployment, knowing that he was going to a very hot \nspot.''\n  Those thanking Scott for his ultimate sacrifice for the protection of \nthis great country say John 15:13 describes his selfless virtues \nperfectly: ``greater love hath not man than this, that he lay down his \nlife for his friends.''\n  On June 16, 2010, the family held church services at First Baptist \nChurch East in Lawton, OK.\n  He is survived by his wife Savannah, daughters: Chelsie and Cheyenne, \na son Jordan, unborn son Charles Scott Jirtle, Jr., stepdaughter Rylee \nJo Jirtle, parents, MSG (Retired) Terry L. and Virginia Jirtle, Lawton, \nOK; 4 brothers: Joseph Elkins and wife Tammy, James Jirtle, Kendall \nJirtle and wife Brandi, all of Lawton and AME2 (AW) Anthony Jirtle, Oak \nHarbor, WA; stepbrother, Danny Henry and wife Shauna; several nieces \nand nephews: Ashley, Kayla, Starr, Alexis, Skyler, Payton, Preston, \nMorgan, Bryce and Kolby.\n  Today we remember Army SGT Charles S. Jirtle, a young man who loved \nhis family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.\n\n\n                     Specialist Augustus J. Vicari\n\n  Madam President, I now wish to pay tribute to a true American hero, \nArmy SPC Augustus ``Augy'' J. Vicari of Broken Arrow, OK who died on \nJuly 29th, 2011 serving our Nation in Paktia Province, Afghanistan. \nSpecialist Vicari was assigned to Headquarters and Headquarters \nCompany, 1st Battalion, 179th Infantry Regiment, 45th Infantry Brigade \nCombat Team, Oklahoma Army National Guard.\n  Specialist Vicari died of injuries sustained when his unit was \nattacked with an improvised explosive device while on patrol in the \ntown of Janak Kheyl. He was 22 years old.\n  Our thoughts and prayers go out to those in his family he left \nbehind: his wife Holly, parents Michael and Evelyn Vicari, and \nsiblings: Joseph, Michael, Emily, and Mollie.\n  A native of Lowell, IN, Augy graduated from Lowell High School in \n2008. After graduation, he and his wife then moved to Broken Arrow to \nbe close to his father-in-law. Augy then enlisted in the Oklahoma \nNational Guard and attended basic training and advanced individual \ntraining in 2009.\n  In addition to being a soldier, Augy enjoyed working on cars and \nspending time with family and friends. As evident by reading through \nsome quotes from family and friends, he consistently impressed and \ntouched the lives of those he interacted with on a daily basis:\n  John and Barb Slankard said ``Augy's smile lit up every room he was \nin . . . a truly amazing person that was taken far too soon. We thank \nhim for his courage and sacrifice and we are honored to have known \nhim.''\n  MG Myles Deering, the Oklahoma National Guard Adjutant General said, \n``This loss of life has shaken every member of the Oklahoma National \nGuard to their core. We have lost a very brave man who once raised his \nhand and took an oath to defend our nation. He courageously gave \neverything he had to ensure our freedom and safety and his sacrifice \nwill not be forgotten.''\n  SSG Kyle Wachtendorf of the Oklahoma National Guard praised Augy by \nsaying, ``He was a Oklahoman who chose to stand up and fight for what \nwas right. Chose to leave his family in order to fight for others and \nmade the ultimate sacrifice for God and their country.''\n  Reverend Tony Janik said ``Augy wanted to see the world. He wanted to \nsee justice in the world.''\n  U.S. Congressman Peter Visclosky from Indiana's 1st District honored \nand paid tribute to Augy on the floor of the House of Representatives \non September 7, 2011.\n  A true warrior, Augy died while participating in a patrol in the town \nof Janak Kheyl of Paktia Province on his way back to the U.S. combat \noutpost just barely over a month after arriving in Afghanistan. This \ntough fight took Augy from us prematurely, but make no mistake; it is a \nfight we will win. We must continue our unwavering support for the men \nand women protecting our Nation and allies.\n  I extend our deepest gratitude and condolences to Augy's family and \nfriends. Augy lived a life of love for his\n\n[[Page S4264]]\n\nwife and daughter, family, friends, and country. He will be remembered \nfor his commitment to and belief in the greatness of our Nation. I am \nhonored to pay tribute to this true American hero who volunteered to go \ninto the fight and made the ultimate sacrifice for our protection and \nfreedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/08/senate-section/article/S4264-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NEWPORT, MAINE BICENTENNIAL\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I wish to commemorate the 200th \nanniversary of the Town of Newport, ME. Newport was built with a spirit \nof determination and resiliency that still guides the community today, \nand this bicentennial is a time to celebrate the generations of hard-\nworking and caring people who have made it such a wonderful place to \nlive, work, and raise families.\n  While this bicentennial marks Newport's incorporation, the year 1814 \nwas but one milestone in a long journey of progress. For thousands of \nyears, the region was the hunting and fishing grounds of the Abenaki, \nand the chain of lakes and streams formed their highway between the \nmighty Kennebec and Penobscot Rivers. The very name of the town a \ntranslation of Sebasticook, the Abenaki word for portage is evidence of \nthe friendship between the first white settlers and the Native \nAmericans.\n  The settlers were drawn by fertile soil, vast forests, and fast-\nmoving waters, which they turned into productive farms and busy lumber \nmills that were soon followed by blacksmiths, leather manufacturing, \ntextiles, and other endeavors vital to Maine's development. The wealth \nproduced by the land, and by hard work and determination, was invested \nin schools and churches to create a true community. In the decades that \nfollowed, Newport became a center of industry and innovation with such \nremarkable endeavors as silk production, condensed milk manufacturing, \nand the fabrication of what were considered the finest carriages in \nMaine.\n  Today, the people of Newport continue to build. Their strong \nenvironmental ethic has helped make Sebasticook Lake a favorite \nrecreation destination for residents and visitors. The Newport \nIndustrial Center offers a home to new or expanding businesses, and the \nNewport Cultural Center contributes to a vibrant downtown.\n  A quality that runs through Newport's history is courage, best \ndemonstrated by the memorial the town dedicated 3 years ago to SGT \nDonald Skidgel, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for giving his life \nto save the lives of his fellow soldiers in Vietnam. From the Civil War \nto the conflicts of our time, the names of some 500 patriots from \nNewport who have served our Nation with honor and defended our freedom \nwith valor are inscribed on the Veterans Memorial.\n  This 200th anniversary is not just about something that is measured \nin calendar years. It is about human accomplishment, an occasion to \ncelebrate the people who for more than two centuries have pulled \ntogether, cared for one another, and built a community. Thanks to those \nwho came before, Newport has a wonderful history. Thanks to those who \nare there today, it has a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/08/senate-section/article/S4264-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUSTICE FROM SERBIA\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, 15 years ago this week three American \ncitizens--the brothers Ylli, Agron and Mehmet Bytyqi--were transferred \nfrom a prison to an Interior Ministry camp in Eastern Serbia. At that \ncamp, they were executed and buried in a mass grave with dozens of \nAlbanians from Kosovo.\n  Today, I again call upon the Serbian authorities to bring those \nresponsible for these murders to justice. Belgrade has given us \nassurances in recent years that action will be taken, but no clear \nsteps have actually been taken to apprehend and prosecute those known \nto have been in command of the camp or the forces operating there.\n  The three Bytyqi brothers went to Kosovo in 1999, a time of conflict \nand NATO intervention. Well after an agreed cessation of hostilities in \nearly June, the brothers escorted an ethnic Romani family from Kosovo \nto territory still under Serbian control, where that family would be \nsafer. Serbian authorities apprehended the brothers as they were \nundertaking this humanitarian task and held them in jail for 15 days \nfor illegal entry. When time came for their release, they were instead \nturned over to a special operations unit of the Serbian Interior \nMinistry, transported to the camp and brutally executed. There was no \ndue process, no trial, and no opportunity for the brothers to defend \nthemselves. There was nothing but the cold-blooded murder of three \nAmerican citizen brothers.\n  Serbia today is not the Serbia of 15 years ago. The people of Serbia \nousted the undemocratic and extreme nationalist regime of Slobodan \nMilosevic in 2000, and the country has since made a steady, if at times \ndifficult, transition to democracy and the rule of law. In 2014, Serbia \nbegan accession talks to join the European Union, and in 2015 it will \nchair the OSCE, a European organization which promotes democratic norms \nand human rights.\n  I applaud Serbia on its progress and I support its integration into \nEurope, but I cannot overlook the continued and contrasting absence of \njustice in the Bytyqi case. The new government of Prime Minister \nAleksandar Vucic has pledged to act. It must now generate the political \nwill to act. The protection of those responsible for this crime can no \nlonger be tolerated.\n  The surviving Bytyqi family deserves to see justice. Serbia itself \nwill put a dark past behind it by providing this justice. Serbian-\nAmerican relations and Serbia's OSCE chairmanship will be enhanced by \nproviding justice. It is time for those responsible for the Bytyqi \nbrother murders to lose their protection and to answer for the crimes \nthey committed 15 years ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/08/senate-section/article/S4264-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           PORT LIONS, ALASKA\n\n Mr. BEGICH.

Residents of Port Lions began moving into the village in \nDecember, after receiving incredible support from the Lions Club to \nbuild anew. Over the years, Port Lions has become a community with a \nstrong sense of pride in family, friendship, and the kind of resilience \nthat characterizes Alaskans.\n  This year the city of Port Lions and the Native village of Port Lions \nhave organized events to celebrate their 50-year history.

Madam President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State. And it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and\n\n[[Page S4265]]\n\nresidents of Bremer County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Bremer County worth over $2 million \nand successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I have \nfought hard to support, which have provided more than $38 million to \nthe local economy.\n  Of course, one of my favorite memories of working together includes \nthe community's tremendous success with the Main Street Iowa program, \nparticularly the great work they have done rehabilitating the Last \nNational Bank Building.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Investing in Iowa's economic development through targeted community \nprojects: In Northeast Iowa, we have worked together to grow the \neconomy by making targeted investments in important economic \ndevelopment projects including improved roads and bridges, modernized \nsewer and water systems, and better housing options for residents of \nBremer County. In many cases, I have secured Federal funding that has \nleveraged local investments and served as a catalyst for a whole ripple \neffect of positive, creative changes. For example, over many years, I \nfought for more than $5.2 million in funding for ag-based industrial \nlubricant research, as well as $500,000 for the 10th Avenue South \ncorridor, and $400,000 to rehabilitate abandoned military facility just \noutside of Waverly, helping to create jobs and expand economic \nopportunities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Bremer County has received $961,998 in Harkin grants. Similarly, \nschools in Bremer County have received funds that I designated for Iowa \nStar Schools for technology totaling $89,295.\n  Disaster mitigation and prevention: In 1993, when historic floods \nripped through Iowa, it became clear to me that the national emergency-\nresponse infrastructure was woefully inadequate to meet the needs of \nIowans in flood-ravaged communities. I went to work dramatically \nexpanding the Federal Emergency Management Agency's hazard mitigation \nprogram, which helps communities reduce the loss of life and property \ndue to natural disasters and enables mitigation measures to be \nimplemented during the immediate recovery period. Disaster relief means \nmore than helping people and businesses get back on their feet after a \ndisaster, it means doing our best to prevent the same predictable flood \nor other catastrophe from recurring in the future. The hazard \nmitigation program that I helped create in 1993 provided critical \nsupport to Iowa communities impacted by the devastating floods of 2008. \nBremer County has received over $6 million to remediate and prevent \nwidespread destruction from natural disasters.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Bremer County has received more than $1 million \nfrom a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as \nthe methamphetamine epidemic. For instance, Bremer County has received \n$200,000 in Community Oriented Policing Services, COPS, grants. Also, \nsince 2001, Bremer County's fire departments have received over $6 \nmillion for firefighter safety and operations equipment.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the ADA \nAmendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow citizens \nwith disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, independent \nliving, and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter century since \npassage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in communities everywhere \nI go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed captioned television, but \nin the full participation of people with disabilities in our society \nand economy, folks who at long last have the opportunity to contribute \ntheir talents and to be fully included. These changes have incresed \neconomic opportunities for all citizens of Bremer County, both those \nwith and without disabilities.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Bremer County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Bremer \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/08/senate-section/article/S4265-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4265-S4266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FRANKLIN COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

This is not just about economics. It is \nalso about maintaining our identity as Iowans. Main Street Iowa helps \npreserve Iowa's heart and soul by providing funds to revitalize \ndowntown business districts. This program has allowed towns like \nHampton to use that money to leverage other investments to jumpstart \nchange and renewal. I am so pleased that Franklin County has earned \n$80,000 through this program. These grants build much more than \nbuildings. They build up the spirit and morale of people in our small \ntowns and local communities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern.

Madam President, today, I wish to pay tribute to \nBrig. Gen. Bruce Prunk. After 35 years of service to our Nation and the \nState of Oregon, General Prunk will retire from the Oregon National \nGuard. I know I speak for Oregonians across the State in thanking him \nfor his service.\n  I got to know Bruce well during the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure \nCommissions, BRAC, process. He was a key player in leading the Oregon \nNational Guard's efforts and working with my office to build an \noverwhelming business case for keeping the 142nd Fighter Wing open at \nthe Portland Air National Guard Base. Everywhere you turned, it seemed \nlike he was at community meetings, making media presentations, and \ndoing outreach with elected officials and business leaders to build \nconsensus. As a result of these herculean efforts, we successfully beat \nback Secretary Rumsfeld's recommendation to close the 142nd Fighter \nWing, and the wing's airmen keep the skies of the Pacific Northwest \nsafe to this day.\n  General Prunk enlisted in the Oregon Air National Guard in 1983 and \nworked his way up to serve in several high-level positions throughout \nthe Oregon Air National Guard, including vice wing commander of the \n142nd Fighter Wing, chief of staff for air at Joint Force Headquarters, \nand assistant adjutant general of the Oregon National Guard. He also \nheld positions in the National Guard Bureau out in Washington, DC, \nserving as assistant and as special assistant to the Director of the \nAir National Guard. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention that \nBruce volunteered to deploy to Iraq in 2007 with the 732nd Air \nExpeditionary Group, 332nd Air Expeditionary Wing and that he earned \nthe Bronze Star for actions during that deployment.\n  Rising to the level of general is quite an accomplishment and enough \nof a career for most folks, but not Bruce. In his civilian life, he \njoined the Portland Police in 1976, working his way up to captain, then \nto commander, and finally to assistant chief of police. In these \npositions, he led community policing efforts, working with local \nleaders and elected officials to improve neighborhood livability in \nPortland. He retired from the Portland Police in 2004 and was able to \ndevote more time to the Oregon National Guard.\n  I think General Prunk's career epitomizes the citizen-soldier \nenvisioned by the Founders. His civilian service and long military \ncareer have given him an appreciation for the various challenges \nOregon's National Guard soldiers and airmen face balancing family, \nemployer, and often medical issues. His ability to bring different \ngroups together to solve problems is perhaps best illustrated through \nhis work with Camp Rosenbaum, a free camp on the Oregon coast for low-\nincome, inner-city children. For over 25 years he has led efforts to \nbuild a unique partnership between police, public employees, and \nprivate sponsors to help thousands of at-risk young people go to Camp \nRosenbaum.\n  From his work on the BRAC recommendations to his service in the \nPortland Police to his involvement with Oregon's military crisis \nhotline on suicide prevention, General Prunk has just about done it \nall. Oregon is grateful for all of his hard work on the State's behalf \nand for the leadership he has displayed over his long and decorated \ncareer. It has been a privilege to get to know such a dedicated public \nofficial, and I want to thank him for his many years of outstanding \nservice. His retirement will be a loss to Oregon, but we wish him a \nlong, happy, and healthy retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/08/senate-section/article/S4267-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4267-S4268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT RELATIVE TO THE ISSUANCE OF AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO TAKE \n  ADDITIONAL STEPS WITH RESPECT TO THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY ORIGINALLY \n DECLARED ON OCTOBER 27, 2006 IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13413 WITH RESPECT TO \n              THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO--PM 48\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 \nU.S.C.\n\n[[Page S4268]]\n\n1701 et seq.)

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to enhance \nthe dependent care tax credit, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am here to discuss the Helping Working \nFamilies Afford Child Care Act, which is a bill my colleagues Senators \nShaheen, Boxer, Gillibrand, and I introduced today. It will update the \nchild and dependent care tax credit to offer working families more \nrelief from the rising costs of childcare.\n  When the child and dependent care tax credit was enacted originally, \nkids were playing with Rubik's Cubes and listening to eight-track \ntapes. As we all know, a lot has changed since then, and one of the \nmost important changes our country has seen since that time is the rise \nof women in the labor force.\n  Since the mid-1970s, women's participation in the labor force has \nincreased by 23 percent, and most women now do work full time. In two-\nthirds of families with dependent children, both parents work outside \nthe home.\n  Over a period of time in which the middle class has been squeezed by \nan increasingly global economy with higher prices for everything from \nhealth care to college, women joining the labor force has helped to \nease some of those burdens for families. In fact, Federal Reserve Chair \nJanet Yellen has called the increasing participation of women in the \nworkforce: ``A major factor in sustaining growing families incomes.'' A \nrecent study by the Center for American Progress found between 1979 and \n2012, the U.S. economy grew by 11 percent as a result of women joining \nthe labor force.\n  As we look for ways to create jobs and expand growth in the 21st \ncentury, it is clear our country's economic success goes hand in hand \nwith that of women and working families. We have to make sure our \npolicies are updated to meet the needs of today's working parents, and \none area we need to take a look at is childcare. The cost of childcare \nhas skyrocketed in recent\n\n[[Page S4273]]\n\nyears. Full-time childcare for just one child can cost families more \nthan $10,000 annually, and for families below the poverty level--those \nwho are already struggling the most to make ends meet--childcare can, \non average, swallow one-third of what those parents are able to bring \nhome.\n  This is a real problem for far too many hard-working parents, and it \nis a problem for our economy, because when parents are struggling to \nfind reliable, safe, affordable care for their children during the day, \nit is harder for them to give their all on the job. Even worse, \nchildcare is so expensive, some parents--most often mothers--are \ndeciding it is not even worth returning to the workforce. This means \nfamilies are being held back from gaining the economic security they \nare working so hard to achieve.\n  The child and dependent care tax credit was of course intended to \nhelp parents overcome these barriers, but today the benefit working \nparents get from the credit is a small fraction of what childcare \nactually costs. Because of how it is structured, the lowest income \nworking families cannot benefit from it at all, meaning they have to \nbear the full brunt of childcare costs on very low wages.\n  It is clear this credit is one of the policies we need to bring into \nthe 21st century, and that is exactly what we were doing when we \nintroduced the Helping Working Families Afford Child Care Act. This \nlegislation will boost the benefit working families can receive for \nchildcare costs, and it will make the child and dependent care tax \ncredit refundable so those working parents who are struggling the most \nto make ends meet can better afford the childcare they need to work and \nsupport their families.\n  If Congress passes our bill, next year working families could see a \ncredit of $1,600 for one child or $3,200 for more than one child. That \nis almost three times the maximum benefit many families are currently \neligible to receive.\n  Our bill would be a real help to hard-working families who are trying \nto raise their children, pay the bills, save for college, and put \nsomething away for retirement. It could break down one of the biggest \nbarriers mothers face when thinking about reentering the workforce.\n  The need to expand access to affordable childcare is something I \noften talk about with my own constituents in Washington State. During \nthose conversations, what I hear from parents is: I am so glad you \nfocused on this. It is a real issue for us.\n  Updating this tax credit to reflect the needs of families in today's \neconomy would be a critical step forward in terms of our larger effort \nto ensure that working parents, dads and moms, have a fair shot.\n  I believe by putting in place policies to make childcare more \naffordable, make sure women get the equal pay they deserve by raising \nthe minimum wage so millions of workers have a better shot at lifting \nthemselves out of poverty, and by taking steps to ensure students are \nnot overwhelmed by debt after they graduate from college, we could \nbreak down some very real barriers that are holding our families and \nour economy back. There is no reason we should not start that right now \nwith the bill we are introducing today.\n  I hope all of our colleagues will take a minute, look at this--\nHelping Working Families Afford Child Care Act--and take this \nseriously. I hope we will be able to make it easier for moms and dads \nto afford safe reliable care for their children while they are at work. \nI think we can all agree parents deserve to have that peace of mind. I \nbelieve if we enact this bill and build on it with other critical \npolicies to help working families, our economy will be much stronger \nnow and over the long term.\n  I thank Senators Shaheen, Boxer, and Gillibrand again for all of \ntheir hard work and leadership on the part of working families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/08/senate-section/article/S4273-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3454.

CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution \n     provides that the right of the people to keep and bear arms \n     shall not be infringed.\n       (2) As the Congress and the Supreme Court of the United \n     States have recognized, the Second Amendment to the United \n     States Constitution protects the rights of individuals, \n     including those who are not members of a militia or engaged \n     in military service or training, to keep and bear arms.\n       (3) The law-abiding citizens of the District of Columbia \n     are deprived by local laws of handguns, rifles, and shotguns \n     that are commonly kept by law-abiding persons throughout the \n     United States for sporting use and for lawful defense of \n     their persons, homes, businesses, and families.\n       (4) The District of Columbia has the highest per capita \n     murder rate in the Nation, which may be attributed in part to \n     local laws prohibiting possession of firearms by law-abiding \n     persons who would otherwise be able to defend themselves and \n     their loved ones in their own homes and businesses.\n       (5) The Federal Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended by the \n     Firearms Owners' Protection Act of 1986, and the Brady \n     Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993, provide \n     comprehensive Federal regulations applicable in the District \n     of Columbia as elsewhere. In addition, existing District of \n     Columbia criminal laws punish possession and illegal use of \n     firearms by violent criminals and felons. Consequently, there \n     is no need for local laws which only affect and disarm law-\n     abiding citizens.\n       (6) Officials of the District of Columbia have indicated \n     their intention to continue to unduly restrict lawful firearm \n     possession and use by citizens of the District.\n       (7) Legislation is required to correct the District of \n     Columbia's law in order to restore the fundamental rights of \n     its citizens under the Second Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution and thereby enhance public safety.\n\n     SEC. 303.

this right includes freedom to hold \n     opinions without interference and to seek, receive, and \n     impart information and ideas through any media and regardless \n     of frontiers'';\n       Whereas, in 1993, the United Nations General Assembly \n     proclaimed May 3 of each year as ``World Press Freedom Day'' \n     to celebrate the fundamental principles of freedom of the \n     press, to evaluate freedom of the press around the world, to \n     defend the media from attacks on its independence, and to pay \n     tribute to journalists who have lost their lives in the \n     exercise of their profession;\n       Whereas, on December 18, 2013, the United Nations General \n     Assembly adopted a resolution (A/RES/68/163) on the safety of \n     journalists and the issue of impunity, which unequivocally \n     condemns all attacks and violence against journalists and \n     media workers, including torture, extrajudicial killings, \n     enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention, and \n     intimidation and harassment in both conflict and non-conflict \n     situations;\n       Whereas 2014 is the 21st anniversary of World Press Freedom \n     Day, which focuses on the theme ``Media Freedom for a Better \n     Future: Shaping the Post-2015 Development Agenda'';\n       Whereas the Daniel Pearl Freedom of the Press Act of 2009 \n     (22 U.S.C. 2151 note; Public Law 111-166), which was passed \n     by unanimous consent in the Senate and signed into law by \n     President Barack Obama in 2010, expanded the examination of \n     freedom of the press around the world in the annual human \n     rights report of the Department of State;\n       Whereas, according to Reporters Without Borders, 71 \n     journalists and 39 citizen journalists were killed in 2013 in \n     connection with their collection and dissemination of news \n     and information;\n       Whereas, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, \n     the 3 deadliest countries for journalists on assignment in \n     2013 were Syria, Iraq, and Egypt, and in Syria, the deadliest \n     country for such journalists, an unprecedented number of \n     journalists were abducted;\n       Whereas, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, \n     617 journalists have been murdered since 1992 without the \n     perpetrators of such crimes facing punishment;\n       Whereas, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, \n     the 5 countries with the highest number of unpunished \n     journalist murders between 2004 to 2013 are Iraq, Somalia, \n     the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Syria;\n       Whereas, according to Reporters Without Borders, 826 \n     journalists and 127 citizen journalists were arrested in \n     2013;\n       Whereas, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, \n     211 journalists worldwide were in prison on December 1, 2013;\n       Whereas, according to Reporters Without Borders, the 5 \n     countries with the highest number of journalists in prison \n     are Syria, China, Eritrea, Turkey, and Iran;\n       Whereas, according to Reporters Without Borders, the \n     Government of Syria and extremist rebel militias have \n     intentionally targeted professional and citizen journalists, \n     causing dramatic repercussions for the freedom of the press \n     throughout the region;\n\n[[Page S4285]]\n\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation has \n     engaged in an unprecedented campaign to silence the \n     independent press and undermine freedom of expression, \n     including its recent efforts to destabilize Ukraine;\n       Whereas Reporters Without Borders has expressed concern \n     that journalists in Cuba have suffered physical attacks, \n     arbitrary detention, and death threats, and have been \n     prevented access to information;\n       Whereas Freedom House has cited a deteriorating environment \n     for internet freedom around the world and has ranked Iran, \n     Cuba, China, Syria, and Ethiopia as having the worst \n     obstacles to access, limits on content, and violations of \n     user rights among the countries and territories rated by \n     Freedom House as ``Not Free'';\n       Whereas freedom of the press is a key component of \n     democratic governance, the activism of civil society, and \n     socioeconomic development; and\n       Whereas freedom of the press enhances public \n     accountability, transparency, and participation: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n       That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses concern about the threats to freedom of the \n     press and expression around the world following World Press \n     Freedom Day, held on May 3, 2014;\n       (2) commends journalists and media workers around the world \n     for their essential role in promoting government \n     accountability, defending democratic activity, and \n     strengthening civil society, despite threats to their safety;\n       (3) pays tribute to the journalists who have lost their \n     lives carrying out their work;\n       (4) calls on governments abroad to implement United Nations \n     General Assembly Resolution (A/RES/68/163), by thoroughly \n     investigating and seeking to resolve outstanding cases of \n     violence against journalists, including murders and \n     kidnappings, while ensuring the protection of witnesses;\n       (5) condemns all actions around the world that suppress \n     freedom of the press, such as the recent kidnappings of \n     journalists and media workers in eastern Ukraine by pro-\n     Russian militant groups;\n       (6) reaffirms the centrality of freedom of the press to \n     efforts by the United States Government to support democracy, \n     mitigate conflict, and promote good governance domestically \n     and around the world; and\n       (7) calls on the President and the Secretary of State--\n       (A) to ensure that the United States Government rapidly \n     identifies, publicizes, and responds to threats against \n     freedom of the press around the world;\n       (B) to continue to urge foreign governments to \n     transparently investigate and bring to justice the \n     perpetrators of attacks against journalists; and\n       (C) to continue to highlight the issue of threats against \n     freedom of the press year-round.\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY.
