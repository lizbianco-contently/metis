Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 384, S. \n2363, the Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2014.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 384, S. 2363, a bill to \n     protect and enhance opportunities for recreational hunting, \n     fishing, and shooting, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, the Senate will be in a period of morning business \nuntil 5:30 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate will proceed to \nexecutive session and proceed to a series of four cloture votes on \nthree U.S. district court judges from Florida and one from Vermont.\n\n\n                           60-vote Threshold\n\n  We tried all last week--I am sorry to say unsuccessfully--to consider \nthree very important appropriations bills. These bills are very \nsignificant because they provide this great government of ours with the \nresources it needs to serve the American people.\n  I think we have had enough sequestrations and government shutdowns, \nand I hope my Republican colleagues aren't headed in that direction \nagain.\n  Given the importance of the appropriations legislation and the need \nto keep our government operating, I had hoped we could have a \ncooperative amendment process and participation from all Senators.\n  Our vote last Tuesday on the motion to proceed was promising, as 95 \nSenators voted to move forward on these three important bills. However, \nit is a shame we had to file cloture. If we had not had to file \ncloture, which resulted in 95 Senators voting to move forward on very \nimportant bills, we could have saved 3 days' worth of downtime and \ndoing nothing. But that has happened for many years now with \nRepublicans blocking, obstructing, and misdirecting basically \neverything we do here.\n  On the bill we had before the Senate last week, unfortunately, the \nRepublican leader stalled the Senate's progress on these appropriations \nbills with his recent conversion to the idea of insisting on simple \nmajority votes. He now insists on majority votes or nothing.\n  Over the past 5 years, virtually everything we have done here in the \nSenate has been subject to a 60-vote threshold. Why? Because the \nRepublican leader has insisted on that.\n  Almost 50 times since President Obama took office, the Republican \nleader has employed the 60-vote threshold in order to block \nlegislation--and good legislation. Bills pertaining to the treatment of \n9/11 responders, funding our military, disclosure of campaign \ncontributions, and small business jobs bills all received majority \nvotes but were blocked at one time or another by the new McConnell \nrule. Under the McConnell rule, everything that comes before the Senate \nhas to have 60 votes.\n  He has called himself ``the proud guardian of gridlock.'' He has even \ngone to great lengths in defending the use of the 60-vote threshold.\n  Allow me to share, as I did last week--and I will do it again because \nI\n\n[[Page S3888]]\n\nthink it is worth repeating--a few of the Republican leader's past \nstatements on the importance of 60 votes.\n  The Republican leader said: ``Now, look, we know that on \ncontroversial matters in the Senate, it has for quite some time \nrequired 60 votes.''\n  Another direct quote by the Republican leader:\n\n       [R]equiring 60 votes, particularly on matters of this \n     enormous importance, is not at all unusual. It is the way \n     the Senate operates.\n\n  The Republican leader also said:\n\n       Matters of this level of controversy always require 60 \n     votes. So I would ask my friend, the majority leader, if he \n     would modify his consent request to set the threshold for \n     this vote at 60?\n\n  On July 30 the Republican leader said again--I am running through the \nmonths here:\n\n       For him to suggest that a matter of this magnitude, in a \n     body that requires 60 votes for almost everything, is going \n     to be done with 51 votes makes no sense at all.\n\n  Again he said:\n\n       So it is not at all unusual that the President's proposal \n     of this consequence . . . would have to achieve 60 votes. \n     That is the way virtually all business is done in the Senate \n     . . .\n\n  The Republican leader holds himself as the person who has established \nthis rule--the so-called McConnell rule--and is boasting about it. He \nhas insisted on the 60-vote threshold time and time again over the past \n5 years. So it is without logic, and it would deviate from the norm, \nthat he, the Republican leader, has made. So I guess that is where we \nare. We are now operating under a 60-vote threshold and that is the \nnorm that he, the Republican leader, has established around here.\n  The Republican leader's newfound support of the 51-vote threshold is \ntimely, given his proposal to curb EPA regulatory powers because of an \nissue he thinks exists, even though there has been no rule promulgated \nby the White House. He is looking way off into the future. We have had \nmonths and months of people offering their opinions and suggestions as \nto how, if at all, this proposed rule could be changed, but he wants to \ndo something about it even though there is nothing to change right now.\n  It is patently unfair to give the Republican leader a simple majority \nvote on his amendment when there have been so many other pieces of \nlegislation he has blocked with the 60-vote threshold. However, we \nDemocrats are willing to meet the Republican leader and his caucus \nhalfway.\n  Here is the suggestion. We will agree to a simple majority vote on \nthe Republican leader's EPA amendment in exchange for a 51-vote \nthreshold on bills that are important to American families, such as an \nincrease in the Federal minimum wage. A vast majority of the American \npeople--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--want the minimum wage \nraised.\n  How about a vote on equal pay for working women? The vast majority of \nAmerican people want their wives, daughters, mothers, and sisters to \nhave the same paycheck when they do the same work as a man.\n  How about legislation permitting student borrowers to refinance their \nstudent loans? They blocked us on that legislation with the 60-vote \nthreshold.\n  How about energy efficiency legislation? They blocked that many \ntimes.\n  How about a simple majority vote on the disclosure of campaign \ncontributions? How about a simple majority vote on updating voting \nright protections that the Supreme Court did away with? How about a \nsimple majority vote for background checks on gun purchases? Eight-five \nto 90 percent of the American people support that, and over half the \nNRA members support that.\n  What I am saying is, OK, if the Republican leader wants to vote on \nthe EPA amendment with a simple majority vote, fine, we will take that. \nBut let's have a simple majority vote on these other issues we feel are \nextremely important to help the middle class.\n  In exchange for a simple majority vote on legislation--I repeat, \nlegislation that is so timely--such as, minimum wage, student loans, \nequal pay for men and women, energy efficiency legislation, and \nbackground checks for gun purchases, we could have a simple majority \nvote on the EPA amendment.\n  It is only fair that bills blocked by the McConnell rule be granted \nthe same treatment as the Republican leader's own legislation. To do \notherwise would be unjust to the many Senators who introduced \nlegislation that is important to American families.\n  I hope we can come to a quick agreement on this offer and move to an \nopen amendment process on appropriations bills, which should make \nRepublicans happy. They said they wanted amendments; they can have \namendments.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  Will the Chair announce the business of the day.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise \nthis evening to honor the life and service of U.S. Marine Corps LCpl \nBrandon Garabrant. Brandon was a native of Greenfield, NH, who, sadly, \nwas killed in action on Friday in Afghanistan.\n  Lance Corporal Garabrant was serving his first tour overseas after \ncompleting basic training at Camp Lejeune last year.\n  In the days since we learned that Brandon made the ultimate sacrifice \nfor his country, we have been touched by the selfless devotion with \nwhich he lived his life and which defined him as a citizen and a \nmarine.\n  His dedication to our country was so focused that he completed his \nbasic training at Camp Lejeune just 1 day before he graduated from \nConVal Regional High School. Brandon also served throughout his high \nschool years as a volunteer firefighter with the Temple Volunteer Fire \nDepartment.\n  Although he was just 19 years old when he deployed to Afghanistan, \nBrandon faced the enormous task of defending our Nation with unshakable \nconviction.\n  Brandon's thoughts on the eve of his April deployment most aptly \ndemonstrate his devotion to his country, to his community, and to his \nfellow marines. Brandon wrote:\n\n       Fighting for our country, our brothers to the left and \n     right, our friends and families back home. So that you can \n     have the right for freedom and to live the American dream \n     without fear of anything. Here comes a long journey into the \n     unknown.\n\n  It is certainly a very long journey for Brandon.\n  Brandon is survived by his mother Jessie, his father John, and his \nyounger siblings Jacob and Mykala.\n  It is my hope that during this extremely difficult time Brandon's \nfamily and friends will find comfort in knowing that Americans \neverywhere appreciate deeply his sacrifice in defense of our country so \nthe rest of us may continue to live in peace and freedom.\n  Brandon epitomized the best New Hampshire tradition of service, and \nhis example will not soon be forgotten by those who were fortunate \nenough to have known him.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Americans to join me in honoring the life \nand service of this brave young American, Brandon Garabrant.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I just returned a couple of hours ago to \nWashington from Indiana, and over the last several months, as I have \nbeen visiting and talking to Hoosiers, I have continued to hear \nconcerns about--and I am concerned, frankly--this widening trust \ndeficit between the American people--at least the people I represent, \nand I think I can say pretty much across this country--and Washington. \nThe American people lack confidence in Washington, confidence that they \nare getting the straight story, the hard truth. Not a lot of good \nthings over the past several months have come out of either this body \nor a number of Washington agencies.\n  This trust gap is ever widening as we have kind of careened from \nscandal to scandal, incident to incident, broken promises made by top \nofficials, false statements being made, the latest of which is now this \nresurrection again of the IRS scandal.\n  Let me say this: It has been said that no agency in Washington is \nless forgiving than the Internal Revenue Service. No agency in \nWashington has more power over the American people than the Internal \nRevenue Service. If there is an agency that needs to be apolitical and \nto not engage in anything that could even be deemed political, it is \nthe IRS, given the power they have to destroy your reputation, destroy \nyour finances, and destroy your business.\n  The way they work is they determine you are in violation, in a sense \nreversing what is sacrosanct in America; that is, you are innocent \nuntil proven guilty, but under the IRS, you are guilty until proven \ninnocent. You have to hire lawyers and accountants and sit down with \nthem to prove you are not violating their rules. That is upside down.\n  One of the founding principles which sets the United States apart \nfrom other nations and makes us exceptional is the First Amendment to \nthe Constitution. Under the First Amendment, Americans are \nconstitutionally guaranteed the right to organize around the issues and \nvalues they believe in and the right to disagree with their government. \nWe look around the world and see that is not the case in very many \nplaces. But in America, that cherished right to take a position \nopposite our government--to protest, to organize, and to seek changes \nas a result of that organization--this liberty is part of what \nenergizes and fuels the very spirit of America and everything we stand \nfor.\n  So when a so-called independent agency of the Federal Government \nattacks average American citizens for expressing their beliefs, a \nfundamental trust is broken and it is very hard to repair. Again, no \nagency has perhaps more intimidating power over American citizens than \nthe Internal Revenue Service.\n  We owe it to the American taxpayers to reveal the truth--the full \ntruth--of what has happened at the IRS and repair the damage of this \nagency's reckless actions in regard to those who have organized for \npolitical purposes, to protest, to assert their First Amendment rights, \nto follow the law and exercise those First Amendment rights, without \nhaving an agency of the government targeting them and intruding on what \nthey are trying to do.\n  It is clear now that in 2010 the IRS targeted conservative groups--\nincluding one in my home State--for extra scrutiny based on political \nleanings. The agency displayed a stunning abuse of power and complete \ndisregard of our Constitution in taking this action.\n  Lois Lerner, the former Director of the IRS's Exempt Organizations \nUnit and the official at the center of this ongoing congressional \ninvestigation, refuses to testify before Congress on the advice of her \nattorney. Yes, she has the right to plead the Fifth Amendment to not \nanswer questions, but we are getting stonewalled by the IRS in getting \nto the bottom of this and determining what kind of abuse has taken \nplace against the American people. We are trying to reach the truth, \nbut we are being denied that opportunity to reach the truth because \nthose who know the truth refuse to testify under subpoena from the \nCongress.\n  Last Friday my House colleagues heard testimony from IRS Commissioner \nJohn Koskinen about missing emails from Lerner and six of her IRS \nsubordinates.\n  Now, isn't this a coincidence? We know the IRS has been targeting \ngroups, attacking their First Amendment rights, and the House oversight \ncommittee is seeking to find out whether this happened. The IRS is \ndenying it, but Lois Lerner refuses to testify.\n  IRS Commissioner Koskinen comes in and says this is not true. OK. \nLet's prove it.\n  The IRS asks taxpayers to prove they didn't violate their rights \nunder the IRS rules, but when we ask the IRS: Can you prove whether \nwhat you are saying is the truth, that you were not targeting these \norganizations, they claim they lost the evidence. They say the server \ncrashed and all the emails we could trace back to determine the truth \nof this are lost. They are all gone.\n  The American people know that you can get into hard drives and find \nout everything ever put in there. Isn't it strange that only the IRS \ndetermined that, well, this whole thing crashed, so let's get rid of \nthe hard drives.\n  Now, thousands of emails that could have led to a trace and allowed \nus to find the truth, disappeared. What a coincidence.\n  Do we think the American people buy this story? It would be laughable \nif it wasn't so serious. To claim that 2 years' worth of emails were \ncompletely, inadvertently lost is laughable on its face.\n  So no emails, no backups, a crashed server, assertions made long \nafter Members of Congress requested the information demonstrates at \nbest a troubling lack of transparency and potentially criminal \nnegligence. After all, the IRS is required to archive these emails by \nlaw.\n  But let's put this in perspective. The very organization that expects \nbusy, hard-working Americans to maintain meticulous financial records \nand complete extensive, confusing tax forms each year can't find 2 \nyears' worth of emails sent by its own employees. Even though we live \nin a day and age where virtually nothing ever disappears from the \nInternet, the IRS wants us to believe these emails are lost for good--\nand maybe they are if they took all the steps they have taken.\n  So to echo the comments of my colleague chairman Paul Ryan: The IRS \nowes every American taxpayer an apology.\n  But an apology is not enough. We need answers and we need to find the \ntruth. When this scandal first surfaced, the President promised \nAmericans that he would ``work hand-in-hand with Congress to get this \nthing fixed.'' That is a quote, ``I will work hand in hand with \nCongress to get this thing fixed.''\n  So how are they fixing it? They are sending the employees who were \nengaged and involved in this, and they basically either take the Fifth \nAmendment, saying they will not answer the questions, or they say: Gee. \nWe lost all this stuff. I am sorry. Each of our six hard drives \ncollapsed, and therefore we can't retrieve any kind of evidence that \nwould prove where they are.\n  I am not a big fan of special prosecutors. I think giving them that \npower has not always proven to be the best way to get to the bottom of \nsomething, but in certain cases where there is such clear evidence that \nthe truth is being withheld and evidence that could lead us to a \nconclusion is potentially being destroyed--I think that is the only way \nwe are going to get to the bottom of this.\n  We need to start restoring the trust of the American people in their \ngovernment agencies and in their government. Until we get to the bottom \nof this, this widening trust gap is going to continue.\n  Appointing an independent investigator would allow us access to \nFederal computer records to determine whether copies of these missing \nemails can be found on the government IT network. Perhaps they have \nscrubbed them in a way that it will not happen, but at least it would \nallow us an independent assessment of what is going on.\n  We can work to restore trust, but doing so will require answers and \nhonesty from the Internal Revenue Service, which we are not getting.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/23/senate-section/article/S3889-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3889-S3890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RETIREMENT OF COLONEL MICHAEL COLBURN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, next month Col. Michael Colburn, who is \nthe\n\n[[Page S3890]]\n\ndirector of the U.S. Marine Band, will retire after nearly 30 years \nwith this history-rich and venerated organization.\n  We like the Marine Band, of course. My son is a Marine. But it is \nespecially nice because Colonel Colburn is a native Vermonter, and his \nappreciation for the band, known worldwide as ``The President's Own,'' \nbegan decades ago when the then-12-year-old euphonium-playing St. \nAlbans native met a principal in the band while at summer band camp in \nVermont.\n  In 1987, Colonel Colburn joined ``The President's Own'' as a \neuphonium player and ultimately became the band's director, a post he \nhas held for the last decade. His tenure has taken him around the world \nand back again. He has played for Presidents and foreign dignitaries, \nat state dinners and inaugurations and regular performances that \nthousands have witnessed in Washington at the Marine Barracks during \nthe weekly parades.\n  I have represented the Green Mountain State of Vermont in this \nChamber longer than anyone in the history of our State. So you can \nimagine my enthusiasm when I see a Vermonter here in Washington and all \nthe more so when I have the opportunity of capturing an image such as \nthis, of Colonel Colburn conducting ``The President's Own'' during the \nJanuary 2013 inauguration of President Obama. I was standing up on the \nstand when the President was being inaugurated and took that picture of \nColonel Colburn. Of course, the whole world was watching the Colonel \nand watching the President.\n  I join with the proud citizens of Vermont and the people of a \ngrateful nation in thanking Colonel Colburn for his service and his \nmany, many memorable performances conducting ``The President's Own,'' \nfollowing in the footsteps of John Philip Sousa and making his own \ngiant footsteps for others to follow. I wish him the very best as he \nbegins the next chapter of his career as the director of bands at the \nUniversity of Indianapolis.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an interview \nwith Colonel Colburn published in the Marine Corps Times in February.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Marine Corps Times, Feb. 2, 2014]\n\n   `President's Own' Leader Looks Back on Time With Elite Marine Band\n\n                           (By Gina Harkins)\n\n       When Col. Michael Colburn was a 12-year-old euphonium \n     player at a summer band camp in Vermont, he was in awe of one \n     of the instructors there, Lucas Spiros, a principal in the \n     United States Marine Band.\n       Colburn said the Marine, a fellow euphonium player, left a \n     lasting impression.\n       ``It was really the first time I thought, `Hey, I could do \n     that for a living,' '' Colburn said. ``From that moment on, I \n     pursued my musical studies more diligently.''\n       When Colburn himself joined ``The President's Own'' as a \n     euphonium player in 1987, he had no idea his career path \n     would lead to becoming director of the prestigious band. Now \n     27 years later, he's just months shy of his final performance \n     with the band. He'll retire from the Marine Corps in July, \n     and take over as the next director of bands at Butler \n     University in Indianapolis.\n       Colburn said he wants young musicians to know that if they \n     work hard and use their creativity, they can still pursue a \n     career doing what they love. After all, his perseverance led \n     him through seven presidential inaugurations, to the former \n     Soviet Union and to the stage of the ``Late Show with David \n     Letterman.''\n       Q. Tell us what has surprised you during your time with \n     ``The President's Own.''\n       A. In my early days as a conductor [while a member of the \n     band], I had an interesting experience at the White House. I \n     was leading our orchestra and was tapped on the elbow. I \n     turned around and it was President Bill Clinton. He was very \n     interested in the piece of music we were playing and had many \n     questions that I tried to answer while I was conducting the \n     orchestra. I realized that even though we were providing \n     background music for a social event, you never know who's \n     listening very carefully--it could be your commander in \n     chief.\n       Q. What's one of the most rewarding things you've done with \n     the band as a Marine?\n       A. Back when I was a player in the band, we toured the \n     former Soviet Union for three weeks. That was really a \n     memorable experience because it was in the 1990s, when the \n     Soviet Union was really starting to come apart at the seams. \n     To spend three weeks traveling the country and getting to \n     know the people who lived behind the Iron Curtain--who we \n     really didn't know on a personal level at all--to hear their \n     stories and learn how much we had in common is something I'll \n     never forget.\n       Q. After all these years with the band, is there any one \n     song that you tend to feel strongly about when you guys play \n     it?\n       A. People often ask whether I'm sick of playing ``The Stars \n     and Stripes Forever.'' But even after these thousands of \n     performances, we never get tired of it. And there's one \n     reason for that, and it's the audience's response to it, \n     especially if they don't know it's coming. The ``oohs and \n     aahs'' and the cheering make you feel like you're playing it \n     for the first time.\n       Q. Most troops do their job without much interaction with \n     the public. What's it like to carry out your job on a stage?\n       A. We really do understand that so much of our military \n     indeed works behind the scenes. They don't have the privilege \n     of being on a stage and receiving applause. It's especially \n     during our tour concerts when we play the ``Armed Forces \n     Medley,'' which includes all the service songs, that we \n     remember all the men and women serving in uniform who are in \n     difficult and trying circumstances where no one is offering \n     applause. In those moments, we feel we are representing all \n     those troops when performing for the American public.\n       Q. As you move into academia, what are some of the things \n     you're going to miss the most about the Marine Corps?\n       A. A lot of people assume my favorite part of the job is \n     making music at the White House or meeting politicians and \n     celebrities. That is thrilling, and I've loved it. But really \n     the best part has to do with the quality of the people I've \n     had the chance to work with in ``The President's Own.'' \n     They're some of the finest people I've met. I'm really \n     excited about the opportunity to make music with students, \n     and I hope I can bring the very high standards that I have \n     hopefully developed during my Marine Corps career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/23/senate-section/article/S3890-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3890-S3891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the judges that fill the two Federal \ndistrict court seats in my home State have an extraordinary impact on \nthe lives of Vermonters. So when I learned that one of my dearest \nfriends, Judge William Sessions, was to take senior status after 18 \nyears of distinguished service on the Vermont district court, I took \nseriously my responsibility to act swiftly to identify a candidate to \nrecommend to President Obama for nomination. I worked with Senator \nSanders, Representative Welch, and the Vermont Bar Association to \nconvene a nonpartisan merit commission to find highly qualified \ncandidates.\n  So I again thank the nine members of the nonpartisan Vermont Judicial \nSelection Commission, under the leadership of Peter Van Oot, for the \ntime, effort, and insight they invested in the screening process. We \nare fortunate in our small State of Vermont to have so many highly \nqualified lawyers in the field of applicants willing to serve in such a \ndemanding post. There were a number of highly qualified people. After \nbeing vetted and recommended to me by the commission, I recommended \nJustice Geoffrey Crawford to President Obama. I told the President I \nwas not surprised that after the American Bar Association Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary finished its vetting, they gave him \ntheir highest rating of unanimously well qualified.\n\n  Justice Crawford has significant criminal and civil experience. He \nwas a Vermont trial court judge for 11 years and recently became an \nAssociate Justice on the Vermont Supreme Court. He formerly was a \npartner in a Burlington law firm. Justice Crawford earned his B.A., cum \nlaude, from Yale University and his J.D., cum laude, from Harvard Law \nSchool. Following law school he served as a law clerk to Judge Albert \nCoffrin of the U.S. District Court for the District of Vermont.\n  I did not know Justice Crawford personally before this process, but \nwhen I did meet him I was struck by his brilliance, compassion, and \nhumility. Justice Crawford earned a stellar reputation in Vermont's \nlegal community, and also from those who had appeared before him, as a \ncareful jurist who understands the effects that legal rulings have on \npeople's lives. I have no doubt that once confirmed he will bring that \nsame understanding and impartiality to the Federal bench.\n  The Judiciary Committee favorably reported Justice Crawford's \nnomination unanimously by voice vote to the full Senate. Justice \nCrawford, like the three other nominees we will vote on today, has been \nnominated to fill an emergency vacancy. He is a qualified \nuncontroversial nominee with the full support of his home state \nSenators. He and the three other nominees deserve to be confirmed \nwithout delay.\n  I thank the majority leader for bringing these nominations up for a \nvote and urge Senators to vote to defeat\n\n[[Page S3891]]\n\nthese filibusters and get these nominees working for the American \npeople in courthouses around the Nation. Justice Geoffrey Crawford will \nserve Vermont well as a Federal district judge, and I look forward to \nhis confirmation.\n  Madam President, I don't see anyone else at the moment, so I would \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE.

Madam President, I rise today to honor the life and \nlegacy of LCpl Brandon Garabrant, a proud marine from Greenfield, NH, \nwho was tragically killed in action in Afghanistan last week.\n  Lance Corporal Garabrant was an extraordinary young man who cared \ndeeply about his country. Before he even graduated from ConVal Regional \nHigh School last year, he had already graduated from marine boot camp \nat Parris Island. Brandon was eager to serve and he followed in the \nfootsteps of his great-grandfather and his grandfather in joining the \nmilitary to serve our country.\n  Long before he joined the Marines, Brandon had already earned a \nreputation as someone who was passionate about serving others. \nVolunteering with the Temple Volunteer Fire Department starting at age \n17, he became a full-time member of that fire department when he turned \n18. The fire chief at Temple, George Clark, was quoted as saying \nBrandon ``was all about helping people,'' adding that ``no matter what \nneeded doing, he was always the first guy there.'' Chief Clark said \neven when Brandon was home on leave he would get in touch and he would \nask how could he help, a true reflection on Brandon's commitment to \nserving others as reflected in his service to our country.\n  Lance Corporal Garabrant was proud to be a marine and enjoyed the \nimportant work he was doing. He was a big-hearted young man with a \nbright future ahead of him, and he represented the very best of New \nHampshire and the very best of our great Nation.\n  Brandon was taken from us far too soon. As we mourn his tragic loss, \nwe commit ourselves to forever honor and cherish his memory and to \ncarry on the proud legacy of service he leaves behind. Brandon was a \ntrue American hero for the sacrifice he made for our country, for our \nfreedom. At this very sad time we also support and comfort his family \nwho have made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country.\n  In the difficult days and weeks ahead, my thoughts and prayers will \nremain with his mother Jessie, his father John, as well as his brother \nJacob and his sister Mykala. May God forever bless LCpl Brandon \nGarabrant. May we honor his selfless sacrifice for our country. If it \nweren't for people such as Brandon, we would not enjoy the freedoms we \nhave in this great country. If it were not for marines such as Lance \nCorporal Garabrant, who stepped up to serve his country and volunteered \non behalf of our great Nation, we would not have the free speech rights \nwe enjoy or any of the other rights we enjoy.\n  My thoughts and prayers will remain with his family. My thoughts and \nprayers will remain with all of his fellow soldiers who have lost a \nfriend, and my thoughts and prayers will remain with all of those in \nthe Greenfield community, with the fire station, with Chief Clark, and \nall of those who have lost a great American hero.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I would suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

His \nleadership knows no borders, as he has also served as vice president of \nEducation International for North America and the Caribbean to pursue \nmeans to raise student achievement and provide adequate funding in a \nway that could serve as a model worldwide.\n  Mr. Van Roekel has long been an honorable and fervent supporter of \nthe rights of teachers and public education. Before becoming president \nof the NEA, he served two terms as NEA vice president and secretary-\ntreasurer, and he has held key positions in all levels of the \nassociation, including Arizona Education Association president and \nParadise Valley Education Association president. He established the \nCommission on Effective Teachers and Teaching to examine the teaching \nprofession on a national scale. As a recognized leader on education \nissues, he has testified before Congress, served on leading boards, \nsuch as the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards \nExecutive Committee and the National Council for the Accreditation of \nTeacher Education Executive Board.\n  His excellence is unmistakable and has been recognized at numerous \nforums and national summits sponsored by the Coalition for Community \nSchools, Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, Council of Chief \nState School Officers, and Congressional Black Caucus Foundation. He \nhas been a leader in discussing education issues with leading \npublications and networks, including C-SPAN, MSNBC, the New York Times, \nWall Street Journal, Education Week, and TIME.\n\n[[Page S3894]]\n\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the Senate, I commend Dennis Van Roekel \non a lifetime of public service, and I wish him the best in all his \nfuture endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/23/senate-section/article/S3894-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING JOHN KEY McKINLEY\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I wish to honor the life and legacy of my \nfriend John Key McKinley, a Tuscaloosa native, who passed away on June \n12. John was a dedicated philanthropist and skilled businessman who \nwill be forever remembered as a dear friend to the State of Alabama and \nto the University of Alabama.\n  Born in Tuscaloosa in 1920, John graduated from Tuscaloosa High \nSchool. He went to earn a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering and \na master's degree in organic chemistry from the University of Alabama. \nHe was inducted into Tau Beta Pi and the Scabbard and Blade Society at \nthe University and was a member of the Capstone Engineering Society. \nWhile in college, John was also a cadet in the ROTC and rose to the \nrank of cadet colonel and brigade commander. However, John's \ncontributions go on well beyond his days as a student--he was a \ngenerous benefactor and steadfast supporter of the university \nthroughout his life.\n  After graduating from Alabama in 1941, John began his career at \nTexaco. He left Texaco in August 1941 to join the Army and serve in \nNewfoundland and Europe during World War II. In August 1944 shortly \nafter D-day, John landed on Utah Beach and took part in battles across \nFrance, Belgium, and Germany--including the Battle of the Bulge as the \nAllied troops moved through Western Europe and onto Berlin. As a result \nof his unwavering bravery during the battle for the Roer River, he \nreceived the prestigious Bronze Star. He also rose to the rank of major \nduring his service in the Army.\n  Following the war, John returned to Texaco, where he held numerous \npositions within the company. He excelled in research and development--\nholding over a dozen patents from petroleum additives and grease \ncomponents--and also continued his education. In 1962, he graduated \nfrom Harvard University's Advanced Management Program. Less than 10 \nyears later, John was named the company's president, and in 1980 he \nbecame Texaco's president, chief executive, and chairman until his \nretirement in 1986.\n  In addition to his work at Texaco, John served on the board of \ndirectors for several companies, including Texaco, Inc., Federated \nDepartment Stores, Burlington Industries, Martin Marietta Corporation, \nMerck & Co., Inc., Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, Manufacturers \nHanover Corporation, and Apollo Computer, Inc. He also served on the \nboard of directors of the Metropolitan Opera, the Peregrine Fund, the \nAmericas Society, Business Council for Effective Literacy, and Memorial \nSloan-Kettering Cancer Center. John also took an active role in many \ncivic and professional organizations, such as the Brookings Council, \nthe Business Council--Washington DC, and President's Commission on \nExecutive Exchange.\n  John's contributions did not go unnoticed. He was awarded the George \nWashington Honor Medal by the Freedom Foundation, the Gold Medal by the \nNational Institute of Social Sciences, the American Eagle Award by the \nInvest-In-America National Council, and the Wallace Award by the \nAmerican-Scottish Foundation. He was inducted into the Alabama Business \nHall of Fame in 1982 and was installed in the Alabama Academy of Honor \nin 1983. Additionally, the Belgian Government presented John with the \nCommandeur de L'Ordre de la Courrone in 1984, which is the highest \ndecoration given to a corporate leader in recognition of significant \ncontributions to Belgium's economic sector.\n  I had the honor of knowing John and his wife Helen, who preceded him \nin death, as well as their two sons, John Jr. and Mark. I offer my \ndeepest condolences to them and to all of their loved ones as they \ncelebrate his many life accomplishments and mourn this great loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/23/senate-section/article/S3894-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING LINDA LANGSTON\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I want to recognize an exceptional \nlocal leader in Iowa who has used her experience and expertise to help \ncommunities across America to become more resilient. Back home, we know \nLinda Langston as an effective and tireless county supervisor in Linn \nCounty. Over the past year, however, I have enjoyed partnering with \nSupervisor Langston in her role as president of the National \nAssociation of Counties.\n  In this capacity, Supervisor Langston served as the principal \nspokesperson for our Nation's 3,069 counties and their nearly 40,000 \nelected officials. This is an important and demanding leadership post. \nThink about it: County governments employ almost 3.3 million people and \ninvest nearly $500 billion each year in our local communities, \nespecially in the areas of transportation and infrastructure, justice \nand public safety, and health and human services.\n  As national president, Supervisor Langston has focused a tremendous \namount of energy and attention this year on community, economic, and \nsocial resiliency, with a special focus on natural disaster \npreparedness and recovery. In addition, she has provided a local, \nmidwestern perspective on national advisory committees with the \nNational Academy of Sciences and the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency. She has also convened numerous national and regional forums \nwith public, private, and nonprofit leaders to address the urgent issue \nof natural disaster preparedness and recovery.\n  Every day, it seems, we encounter news reports of extraordinary \nnatural disasters, everything from droughts, floods, tornadoes, and \nwildfires, to hurricanes, ice storms and extreme temperatures. Thanks \nto Supervisor Langston's thoughtful and expert leadership at the \nNational Association of Counties, we can be confident that America's \ncounties are better prepared for the natural disasters that inevitably \nlie ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/23/senate-section/article/S3894-3", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3894-S3895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         IOWA CONCESSION STUDY\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to \nrecognize an innovative effort aimed at improving youth nutrition that \ntook place at Muscatine High School in Iowa. Communities across the \ncountry are focusing on ways to build health and wellness into everyday \nlife--in schools, workplaces, or elsewhere in the community--and this \nis one excellent example of just such an initiative.\n  In a collaboration between the University of Iowa and the parent-led \nMuscatine booster club--``Muskie Boosters''--researchers and booster \nclub members added new healthy items such as apples, carrots, granola \nbars, and grilled chicken to the concession stand's menu during high \nschool athletic events. They didn't stop there--they also modified the \ningredients in other items to make them healthier. For example, they \neliminated the use of trans fats in the nachos. These menu changes had \none main goal: give the Muscatine High School community access to fresh \nand healthy food, where previously only junk food could be found.\n  And here is the really great news: The University of Iowa researchers \nwho participated in this experiment found that selling healthier \nproducts had almost no impact on concession revenues and actually \nresulted in a slight increase in sales per football game with the \nintroduction of healthier items and ingredient changes. Sales of some \nnew items increased with each game, and--no surprise--parents were more \nsatisfied with the healthier foods than they were with the less healthy \nfood options.\n  The results of this study are further evidence that offering healthy \nfood can be good for both our Nation's physical and our Nation's fiscal \nhealth. In fact, these results show us that selling healthier foods can \nactually increase profits and customer satisfaction. The study also \nprovides an exemplary model of how academic institutions can work \ncollaboratively with local communities to improve nutrition and health.\n  Given the alarming rates of childhood obesity, it is more important \nthan ever that we continue to find creative and innovative solutions to \nconfront the obesity epidemic. I commend the Muskie Boosters, the \nUniversity of Iowa researchers, and other study authors who worked \ntogether to find innovative yet simple ways to improve\n\n[[Page S3895]]\n\nthe quality of food being offered to our kids in the Muscatine \ncommunity. I hope we can expand the great work they have done to other \ncommunities in Iowa and all across the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/23/senate-section/article/S3895-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HIRAM, MAINE\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. I wish to commemorate the 200th \nanniversary of the Town of Hiram, ME. Known today as a gateway to the \nrugged and beautiful Western Maine Mountains, Hiram was built with a \nspirit of determination and resiliency that still guides the community \ntoday.\n  Hiram's incorporation on June 14, 1814, was but one milestone on a \nlong journey of progress. For thousands of years, the banks of the Saco \nRiver were the hunting grounds of the Sokokis Tribe, and the legendary \nPequawket Trail was their route between the Atlantic Ocean and the \nmountains. The reverence the Sokokis had for the natural beauty and \nresources of the region is upheld by the people of Hiram today.\n  The very name of the town, dating to the first European settlement in \nthe 1780s, speaks of this reverence. Like the realm of the biblical \nKing Hiram I of Tyre, the community was established among the trees \nthat were its first source of prosperity. With the fast-moving Saco \nRiver and its tributaries providing power, sawmills became an important \nindustry, soon followed by blacksmiths, leather manufacturing, and \nother endeavors vital to Maine's development. As a junction of two of \nMaine's early railroads, Hiram became the gateway to the White \nMountains of New Hampshire. The wealth produced by the land was \ninvested in schools and churches to create a true community.\n  The history of Hiram is directly connected to the very birth of our \nNation. One of the town's first settlers was General Peleg Wadsworth, \nwhose company of Minutemen answered the call of freedom at Lexington \nand Concord. After a life of remarkable service to our young country, \nin the military and in public office, General Wadsworth settled in \nHiram in 1807, established a farm, and led the incorporation of the \ntownship. It is fascinating to consider the influence the beautiful \nsurroundings had upon his grandson, the poet Henry Wadsworth \nLongfellow, who spent many summers in Hiram as a boy.\n  A quality that runs through Hiram's history is courage. Some 100 \nyoung men from the town fought to save our Nation in the Civil War, and \n39 gave their lives in that noble cause. It is humbling to know that \nPleasant Ridge Cemetery is the final resting place for patriots from \nfour generations of the Lyons family who served with valor and \ndistinction.\n  Today, Hiram is a charming town of involved citizens. The historic \nSoldiers Memorial Library, built nearly a century ago in honor of those \nwho defended our country, is avidly supported and remains a center of \ncommunity activity. The saw and scythe depicted on the new bicentennial \nseal are reminders of Hiram's past and indicators of the hard work and \nenthusiasm the townspeople have put into this year's landmark birthday \ncelebration.\n  This 200th anniversary is not just about something that is measured \nin calendar years; it is about human accomplishment, an occasion to \ncelebrate the people who for more than two centuries have pulled \ntogether, cared for one another, and built a community. Thanks to those \nwho came before, Hiram has a wonderful history. Thanks to those who are \nthere today, it has a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/23/senate-section/article/S3895-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3895-S3896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          MARION COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State. And it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Marion County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Marion County worth over $5 million \nand successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I have \nfought hard to support, which have provided more than $95 million to \nthe local economy.\n  Of course, one of my favorite memories of working together is working \nwith Central College to provide $1.8 million for the Center for Math, \nScience, and Technology to expand its curriculum, increase technology \ntraining in teacher education, and provide distance learning for \nteachers in the field.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Investing in Iowa's economic development through targeted community \nprojects: In Central Iowa, we have worked together to grow the economy \nby making targeted investments in important economic development \nprojects, including improved roads and bridges, modernized sewer and \nwater systems, and better housing options for residents of Marion \nCounty. In many cases, I have secured Federal funding that has \nleveraged local investments and served as a catalyst for a whole ripple \neffect of positive, creative changes. For example, working with mayors, \ncity council members, and local economic development officials in \nMarion County, I have fought to resurrect the Des Moines River \nGreenbelt account which helped the Marion County Cordova Center on the \nRock to build an environmental learning center, amphitheater, trails, \nand other outdoor recreational opportunities, as well as a 4-mile trail \nconnecting the city of Pella with Cordova area. While there is more to \ndo in the future, I am pleased that construction of the first phase of \nthe project was complete in August 2013 at a cost of $3,100,000.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Marion County has received $319,444 in Harkin grants. Similarly, \nschools in Marion County have received funds that I designated for Iowa \nStar Schools for technology totaling $249,844.\n  Disaster mitigation and prevention: In 1993, when historic floods \nripped through Iowa, it became clear to me that the national emergency-\nresponse infrastructure was woefully inadequate to meet the needs of \nIowans in flood-ravaged communities. I went to work dramatically \nexpanding the Federal Emergency Management Agency's hazard mitigation \nprogram, which helps communities reduce the loss of life and property \ndue to natural disasters and enables mitigation measures to be \nimplemented during the immediate recovery period. Disaster relief means \nmore than helping people and businesses get back on their feet after a \ndisaster; it means doing our best to prevent the same predictable flood \nor other catastrophe from recurring in the future. The hazard \nmitigation program that I helped create in 1993 provided critical\n\n[[Page S3896]]\n\nsupport to Iowa communities impacted by the devastating floods of 2008. \nMarion County has received over $5 billion to remediate and prevent \nwidespread destruction from natural disasters.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Marion County has received more than $2.2 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Marion County's \nfire departments have received over $1.7 million for firefighter safety \nand operations equipment.\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces. I am so proud that Americans have better access to clinical \npreventive services, nutritious food, smoke-free environments, safe \nplaces to engage in physical activity, and information to make healthy \ndecisions for themselves and their families. These efforts not only \nsave lives, they will also save money for generations to come thanks to \nthe prevention of costly chronic diseases, which account for a whopping \n75 percent of annual health care costs. I am pleased that Marion County \nhas recognized this important issue by securing $264,000 for worksite \nwellness programs.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Marion County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Marion \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/23/senate-section/article/S3896-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3896-S3897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WINNESHIEK COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the ADA \nAmendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow citizens \nwith disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, independent \nliving, and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter century since \npassage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in communities everywhere \nI go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed captioned television, but \nin the full participation of people with disabilities in our society \nand economy, folks who at long last have the opportunity to contribute \ntheir talents and to be fully included. These changes have increased \neconomic opportunities for all citizens of Winneshiek County, both \nthose with and without disabilities.

This bill seeks to authorize \nadditional funding for our Nation's critical transportation \ninfrastructure through spending offsets provided by the repeal of the \nantiquated Davis-Bacon Act. Last year, the Congressional Budget Office \nestimated that over 10 years, repealing the Davis-Bacon Act would save \nthe Federal Government some $13 billion.\n  Kentucky is home to a number of critical interstate bridges that are \nin need of replacement, including the Brent Spence Bridge in Northern \nKentucky, the I-65 bridge in Louisville, and an I-69 bridge in \nHenderson. This bill seeks to create a fund to help advance these very \ntypes of interstate bridge projects without raising taxes, adding to \nthe deficit, or by authorizing tolling. Federal funding saved through \nthe repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act could be much better spent building a \nnumber of interstate bridges that are sorely needed in Kentucky and \ncommunities across America. I call on my Senate colleagues to support \nthis measure to invest in our Nation's critical transportation \ninfrastructure, on which American commerce depends.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2512\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Emergency Interstate Bridge \n     Safety Fund Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Davis-Bacon Act requires that workers on all \n     federally funded or federally assisted construction projects \n     be paid what is commonly referred to as a prevailing wage, as \n     calculated by the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of \n     Labor.\n       (2) According to the Congressional Budget Office, if the \n     Davis-Bacon Act were repealed, the Federal Government could \n     save an estimated $12,700,000,000 in discretionary outlays \n     from 2015 through 2023.\n       (3) These savings could be redirected to the reconstruction \n     of closed and functionally obsolete bridges along the \n     Interstate Highway System, which would improve highway safety \n     and interstate commerce.\n\n                   TITLE I--ESTABLISHMENT AND FUNDING\n\n     SEC. 101. REPEAL OF DAVIS-BACON ACT OF 1931 WAGE \n                   REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40, \n     United States Code (40 U.S.C. 3141 et seq.), is repealed.\n       (b) Reference.--Beginning on the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, any reference in any law to a wage requirement \n     under subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40, United States \n     Code, shall be null and void.\n\n     SEC. 102. EMERGENCY INTERSTATE BRIDGE SAFETY FUND.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is established in the Treasury of \n     the United States a trust fund to be known as the ``Emergency \n     Interstate Bridge Safety Fund''.\n       (b) Transfers to Emergency Interstate Bridge Safety Fund.--\n     -\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     regularly transfer amounts equal to the savings achieved \n     through the repeal of the wage requirements under subsection \n     (a) from the capital budgets of each affected Federal agency \n     to the Emergency Interstate Bridge Safety Fund.\n       (2) Emergency relief expenditures.--Section 125(c) of title \n     23, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(3) Emergency interstate bridge safety fund.--Amounts \n     deposited into the Emergency Interstate Bridge Safety Fund \n     established under section 102(a) of the Emergency Interstate \n     Bridge Safety Fund Act are authorized to be obligated to \n     carry out, in priority order, the projects on the current \n     list compiled by the Secretary under section 201(b)(1) of \n     such Act that meet the eligibility requirements set forth in \n     subsection (a).''.\n\n       TITLE II--EMERGENCY INTERSTATE BRIDGE SAFETY PRIORITY LIST\n\n     SEC. 201. EMERGENCY INTERSTATE BRIDGE PRIORITIES.\n\n       (a) List.--The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation \n     with a representative sample of State and local government \n     transportation officials, shall compile a prioritized list of \n     emergency interstate bridge projects, which will guide the \n     allocation of funding to the States from the Emergency \n     Interstate Bridge Safety Fund established under section 102.\n       (b) Criteria.--In compiling the list under subsection (a), \n     the Secretary of Transportation, in addition to any other \n     criteria established by the Secretary, shall rank the \n     emergency interstate bridge projects in descending order, \n     beginning with projects that--\n       (1) are part of the Federal interstate highway system;\n       (2) involve a bridge that is closed or deemed functionally \n     obsolete by the Federal Highway Administration for safety \n     reasons;\n       (3) have a significant impact on interstate commerce;\n       (4) would affect a significant volume of traffic; and\n       (5) have the greatest overall value to the surrounding \n     community.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall \n     submit a report to Congress that includes--\n       (1) a prioritized list of emergency interstate bridge \n     projects to be funded through the Emergency Interstate Bridge \n     Safety Fund; and\n       (2) a description of the criteria used to establish the \n     list referred to in paragraph (1).\n       (d) Quarterly Updates.--Not less frequently than 4 times \n     per year, the Secretary of Transportation shall--\n       (1) update the report submitted pursuant to subsection (c);\n       (2) send a copy of the report to Congress; and\n       (3) make a copy of the report available to the public \n     through the Department of Transportation's website.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/23/senate-section/article/S3899-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3899-S3900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 481--DESIGNATING THE MONTH OF JUNE 2014 AS ``NATIONAL \n            POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP (for herself, Mr. Heller, Mr. Begich, Mr. Donnelly, Mr. \nRockefeller, Mr. Booker, Mr. Hoeven, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. \nHirono, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Franken, Mr. Warner, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \nBoozman, Mr. Johanns, Mr. Casey, Mr. Walsh, Mr. Crapo, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \nJohnson of South Dakota, Mr. Cardin, and Mr. Merkley) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a matter of \nimportance not just to Arizonans but to the people affected across the \ncountry by the Environmental Protection Agency's continuing overreach. \nNamely, I want to talk about air quality standards that are quite \nsimply unattainable and those that penalize States where Mother \nNature--not smokestacks, not factories, not evil industrialists, just \nMother Nature--causes these events that affect air quality.\n  Let me say from the outset we all love and deserve to have clean air, \nand when I am discussing these particular concerns I want to be clear \nthat I am not in favor of pollution, dirty air or asthma. Instead what \nI am in favor of is a little more common sense from the EPA.\n  It won't come as any surprise to most people that Arizona is a desert \nState. We have lots of cactus. We have scorpions. I was stung twice \nlast year. In Arizona, just as in most deserts around the world, we \nhave dust storms. These dust storms are not caused by eroding topsoil \nor overfarming or man. These are naturally occurring events just like \ntornadoes or blizzards in other parts of the country. When you live in \na naturally dusty State, the dust storms sweep across the desert and \nacross State lines. They can obviously cause local and regional air \nquality issues. The same goes for living in a forest-fire-prone State, \nwhich Arizona also is.\n  States simply cannot be expected to control these issues. Yet despite \nadopting an ``exceptional events rule'' and issuing murky guidance, the \nEPA still forces States to squander resources on these spikes in air \npollutants that are outside anybody's control, with no actual \nimprovement to air quality.\n  The EPA's reviews to prove that spikes in air quality are the result \nof naturally occurring events are arbitrary, cumbersome, and they are \ncostly. Let me give you an example.\n  In 2011 and 2012, the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, \nthe Maricopa County Air Quality Department, and the Maricopa \nAssociation of Governments were forced to spend $675,000 and 790 staff \nhours to prove to EPA's satisfaction something that anyone with two \neyes could readily see: Dust storms trip the EPA's air quality \nsensors--not pollution, dust storms.\n  The current regulations are entirely up to the EPA's discretion and \nthey are final and they are not appealable. But in some cases such as \nthose in Arizona, they are a violation of common sense as well.\n  That is why I am introducing the CLEER Act. The CLEER Act will, among \nother things, require the EPA's decisions on those events to be based\n\n[[Page S3901]]\n\non a preponderance of evidence and to accord deference to States' own \nfindings when such an event happens. It will also require the EPA to \nrenew a State's exceptional event documentation within 90 days instead \nof dragging this process out, and to decide which States with \nexceptional events will be evaluated.\n  I am also introducing two other bills: the ORDEAL Act and the Agency \nPAYGO for Greenhouse Gases Act.\n  Much credit goes to the EPA for successfully reducing air pollution \nin the past few decades. This has led to benefits for everyone. But one \nof the most common pollutants--ozone, dealt with by the ORDEAL Act--has \npresented a nearly endless supply of redtape for States and \nmunicipalities for literally decades. When the EPA reduced its \npermitted ozone standards in 2008, counties across the country that \nwere in ``nonattainment'' status were forced to enact expensive and \ncomplicated compliance plans.\n  With scant scientific health bases, the EPA wants to further lower \nozone emissions standards. But there are already 221 counties in 27 \nStates that are noncompliant with the present standards. How will \nlowering these standards even further help these States, communities, \nand counties comply? Is this EPA's version of double-secret probation?\n  By some estimates this lowering of ozone standards from 75 parts per \nbillion to 60 parts per billion will cost a whopping $1 trillion per \nyear from 2020 to 2030. The EPA's own estimate said the proposed \nstandard will cost $25 billion per year at 70 ppb to $90 billion per \nyear at 60 ppb. It will cost as many as 7.3 million jobs.\n  The rationale for further reduction in ozone standards is the \npotential health benefits. The EPA consistently fails to meet its 5-\nyear intervals for ozone, which results in lawsuits, bad policy, and \npoor analysis when the agency is forced by the courts to produce a new \nstandard. My bill, the ORDEAL Act, would provide the EPA more \nflexibility by doubling the statutory review interval to 10 years. It \nwould also push off any decision on EPA's proposal to tighten the ozone \nstandards until 2018, putting that standard on a more realistic 10-year \ncycle. This will give businesses more certainty. It will give them a \nmore certain regulatory environment, not a possible change every 5 \nyears. If you can imagine how to plan on a 5-year cycle for standards \nthat are rarely met and have to be adjusted again. It will also give \nState air quality agencies the time they need to implement their own \nplans.\n  Finally, this administration has set its sights on reducing carbon \nemissions with the most recent attempt being draconian regulations on \nexisting powerplants, despite inevitable job losses and spikes in \nenergy costs.\n  The Agency PAYGO Act I am introducing would simply give the EPA a \ntaste of its own medicine by requiring the agency to offset the cost of \nany greenhouse gas rules to an equivalent reduction in agency spending.\n  If the agency proceeds without offsetting these costs from its own \nbudget, the final greenhouse gas rule must be approved by Congress. \nThis bill specifically forbids the EPA from denying costs to Federal \nagencies by passing costs on to the Federal agency's ratepayers. If \ncapital costs are imposed by the greenhouse gas rule, the EPA must \noffset those costs or get Congress's approval.\n  Specifically this bill will not let underlying agencies--including \npower generating agencies such as the Western Power Authority--pass \nalong these costs to consumers.\n  The modern EPA has a history of implementing increasingly costly and \nstringent standards for negligible or even questionable benefit. All \nthree of these bills, the CLEER Act, the ORDEAL Act, and the Agency \nPAYGO Act, provide more certainty than presently exist to States and \nbusinesses that have to deal with the EPA and will hold the agency \naccountable for its decision-making process.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting these commonsense \nmeasures.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/23/senate-section/article/S3901-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
