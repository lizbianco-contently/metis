Mr. President, I am not sure everyone remembers where they \nwere 13 years ago today, but most of us remember. The vast majority of \nus remember. Just a few feet from here in S-219 Senator Daschle had his \nusual Tuesday morning leadership meeting. I was assistant leader at the \ntime. I was first to come into the room shortly before 9. About 9--\nmaybe a minute or two after--Senator John Breaux from Louisiana walked \nin and said: Flip on the TV. Something is going on in New York. And we \nflipped on the television. Something had happened in one of the towers, \nlike an airplane had hit one of those towers.\n  We said: What happened there? And we kind of looked at each other.\n\n[[Page S5524]]\n\n  People started coming into the room. The TV was turned off and the \nmeeting was started. Just a short time thereafter--5, 6 minutes at the \nmost, as I recall--someone came into the room and grabbed Senator \nDaschle, who was at the head of the table, took him out and came back \nin just a very brief minute and said: The building is being evacuated. \nWe all have to leave. There is an airplane headed for the Capitol.\n  As we left that room, we could look out and see already the smoke \nbillowing from the Pentagon. The airplane had struck the Pentagon.\n  Now that day was a day I will never forget--never forget. I was taken \nwith Senator Daschle, Don Nickles, who was the Republican assistant \nleader, and Trent Lott, and we were flown to a classified location. We \nspent the day there with a number of people, including the Vice \nPresident of the United States.\n  Late in the evening we came back to the Capitol after having been \ncleared to come back. The Senators gathered on the Senate steps in the \nCapitol, Democrats and Republicans. We were gathering just to show we \nwere supportive of this great country. Barbara Mikulski, small in \nstature but powerful in soul, in every way, said so everyone could hear \nit: Let's sing ``God Bless America.''\n  I don't sing very often, but I sang that night. We all did. ``God \nbless America.'' We did it because we knew it was a day we would never \nforget. It was a day we wanted to show we were together as Members of \nCongress.\n  So as I have said already two or three times this morning, I don't \nwant to ever forget that moment, that day, and I want to make sure we \nhonor the heroes who paid the ultimate price for our freedom. The \ngreatest memorial we have to offer the brave men and women who perished \non 9/11, thousands of them, is to simply never forget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/11/senate-section/article/S5524-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TERRORISM\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I have indicated, 13 years since the evil \nattacks of September 11, terrorism continues to rear its ugly head \nthroughout the world. As I speak, the terrorist group ISIS, like a \nscourge, is plaguing the Middle East. These radical Islamic terrorists \nare wreaking havoc in Iraq and Syria, butchering the innocent and \ninstituting brutal edicts.\n  ISIS is a murderous, fanatical organization. It is evil in nature. \nThey must be stopped, and they will be stopped. We will degrade and \ndestroy them.\n  The Presiding Officer is a general who led hundreds and hundreds of \ntroops to battle in the Middle East. We must honor our troops as \nindicated in the prayer this morning by our Chaplain because they are \ngoing to be called as they are through the air, as President Obama said \nlast night, to do something to degrade and, working with others, to get \nrid of this scourge.\n  Last night President Obama delivered a stirring speech to the Nation \noutlining his blueprint for eradicating this threat without repeating \nmistakes of the past. We all know the mistakes about which I speak. The \nPresident made it clear: We will not rush into another ground war in \nthe Middle East and we will not go it alone to destroy this evil. \nInstead, America will lead a coalition that includes European and Arab \nnations in a targeted, strategic mission to destroy ISIS. American air \nstrikes will be supported by local forces that are trained by the U.S. \nmilitary advisers and others who will assume the duties of defending \nand protecting their communities and homes. It falls upon us, Congress \nand the American people, to rally behind the President on his decisive \nstrategy.\n  There are no ground troops--I repeat--and that is the way it should \nbe. I am confident we will put our political differences aside and work \ntogether to give this administration the tools it needs to meet ISIS \nhead-on--not the least of which is the authority to equip and train \nSyrian troops to fight these very bad--I repeat--evil terrorists.\n  However, it is disturbing that at a time such as this there are some \nin Congress taking cheap political shots at the President. Now is the \ntime for us to come together. When tested, Americans have always closed \nranks and engaged our adversaries as one united Nation. A matter such \nas this is no place for political posturing--political positioning. \nThis is time for the rhetoric of campaign commercials to go away. We \nmust draw together as a nation.\n  When President Bush called upon Congress to do something about the \nterrible economic crisis that hit this country, we joined together, we \njoined together as Democrats, Republicans, and Independents and took \nthis head-on. This is the situation now. We must draw together and \nsupport the President in eradicating the evil of ISIS, not only for our \nNation but the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/11/senate-section/article/S5524-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5524-S5530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                              9/11 Tribute\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday I joined Congressional \nleaders in awarding three Congressional Gold Medals to the memory of \nthousands of men and women who perished so tragically on this very day \n13 years ago. Every American that morning bore witness to the terrible \ntragedy and suffering. But that was not all we witnessed. We also saw \nincredible acts of bravery and compassion and heroism. We saw it in a \ngreat city. We saw it on the edge of the Capitol. We heard about it \nhigh above the clouds. The sacrifices of those heroes of 9/11 inspired \nus then and they inspire us now. The memory of every man and woman who \nperished so tragically that day continues to serve as a unifying force \nfor our Nation. We will never stop honoring them.\n\n\n                                  ISIL\n\n  Mr. President, the American people have a lot on their minds these \ndays. Among their greatest concerns is the threat of ISIL, the brutal \nterror group that recently beheaded two American journalists. ISIL is \ngrowing stronger by the day and it is lethal. Every day we wait to \nconfront them is a day they grow more deadly. I and others have called \non the President to provide us with a comprehensive plan to defeat this \nmenace. Last night, he described to the Nation what our military, \nintelligence, and diplomatic corps are doing to confront this threat, \nand outlined ways he will expand on existing operations.\n  Over the next week, following a series of briefings, Congress will \nwork with the administration to ensure that our forces have the \nresources they need to carry out these missions. Specifically, the \nPresident set forth a near-\n\n[[Page S5525]]\n\nterm concept of operations to enhance the defense of Baghdad and \nKurdistan, a midterm plan for retaking Anbar Province and Mosul from \nISIL, and a long-term plan to contain ISIL within Syria.\n  The defense of Baghdad will require an air campaign to strike ISIL \nand target them within Iraq and extending into Syria. The midterm plan \nrequires a new train-and-equip program and an increased scale to return \nthe Iraqi security forces to the fight at a higher degree of combat \nreadiness.\n  The President also envisions an effort to regain the trust and \ncooperation of the Sunni tribes through a new territorial or national \nguard, the same tribes and friends we abandoned when we completely \nwithdrew from Iraq. The President's long-term plan, which is now clear, \nwill be a responsibility left to the next administration, will be an \neffort to field a viable indigenous ground combat component to defeat \nISIL within Syria.\n  Today, the President's staff will begin briefing the Senate on what \nwill be required of our Armed Forces and intelligence community to \neffectuate this indefinite campaign, which we now know will include a \nmultiyear air war of attrition. My expectation is that the \nadministration will explain how best to build a moderate Syrian \nopposition capable of defeating ISIL. I am hoping the Congress will \nconsider what this new multiyear campaign will mean for the overall \ndefense program, the need to modernize our military, to retain \ndominance of the air and sea in the Asia Pacific theatre, to revitalize \nNATO in the face of Russian aggression, and how to field additional \nforce structure and combat power into the U.S. Pacific Command now that \nEurope and Central Command require additional tactical units and \ncapabilities. Our Nation must also rebuild a nuclear triad.\n  That said, I am glad the President has brought a new focus to the \neffort against ISIL. He needs to take this responsibility head on. This \nCongress, the next Congress, and the next administration have serious \nwork ahead as we consider this multiyear commitment and what it will \ntake to defeat ISIL.\n\n\n                           Legislative Agenda\n\n  One more point. Given the urgency of this situation, I have to say it \nis a little disconcerting to see the Democrat-led Senate focusing on \nthings such as reducing free speech protections from the American \npeople. At a time when the rest of the country is worried about the \nthreat of ISIL, at a time when millions wonder how they are ever going \nto find a job in this awful economy, at a time when we find out the \ncrushing Federal regulations have gotten so out of control that they \nnow cost the economy more than $2 trillion a year, this is what they \nchoose to make their top legislative priority this week, taking \nan eraser to the First Amendment?\n\n  Now they plan to devote almost all the remaining time between now and \nNovember to what Democrats like to call messaging bills. These are \nbills designed intentionally to fail so that Democrats can make \ncampaign ads about them failing. Yesterday, Roll Call got hold of an \nemail from a Democratic aide who let the truth slip without meaning to. \nHis email said that Senate Democrats plan to either ``slam \nRepublicans'' for blocking the latest designed-to-fail bill or slam \nRepublicans for voting to go ahead and debate the bill. How cynical can \nthat be? The email just confirmed what everybody already knew, that \nSenate Democrats have zero intention of passing the bill before us \ntoday. Passage of this bill would represent failure for them. All they \nwant is fodder for campaign commercials. That is why they refuse to \naddress the growing crisis at home and abroad. That is why they \nobstruct nearly every good bipartisan bill from the House of \nRepresentatives. They even bury bipartisan bills that would help create \njobs and help struggling middle-class families.\n  It is long past time for the Democrats to get serious. We were lucky \nto get serious things done for the Americans who sent us here. We need \nto let the Senate start doing that kind of thing. A good start would be \nto take up the dozens, literally dozens, of bipartisan jobs bills the \nHouse of Representatives has already sent us. Let's send those to the \nPresident's desk ASAP. Let's help make it easier to put the American \npeople back to work.\n  Let's take up other commonsense legislation, such as a bipartisan \nbill that just passed the House on Tuesday with the votes of dozens of \nDemocrats. The bill, which is similar to legislation I have \ncosponsored, would stop the administration from implementing a so-\ncalled ``waters of the U.S.'' proposal that would allow it to regulate \nand fine almost every pothole and ditch in the country.\n  Passing this bill is critical to protecting the property rights of \nevery American, especially farmers. One Kentucky farmer from Shelby \nCounty wrote me the other day to explain how the administration's \nheavyhanded regulation would affect him. He lamented that ``The White \nHouse clearly wants me to spend more time figuring out additional \npermitting requirements and less time growing food for American \nfamilies.''\n  Let's work together to fix this problem along with the many other \nserious challenges facing our country. Let's address the threat of ISIL \ntogether. Let's pass serious jobs bills together. Let's take Senate \nDemocrats' focus off saving the jobs of Democratic politicians and \nstart focusing on the needs of the American people instead.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                              9/11 Tribute\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, today marks 13 years since the terrorist \nattacks of September 11, 2001. At that moment, I do not think Americans \nwould have been surprised that we would still be dealing with that 13 \nyears later. But in the 13 years that have passed, there have been \nmoments when we wanted to hope this had passed from us, that somehow it \nwas no longer a danger. But it is a danger today as it was a danger \nthen.\n  We clearly should not forget those who lost their lives on 9/11. We \ncontinue and should continue to be grateful to our men and women in \nuniform. I appreciate the service the Presiding Officer provided to the \ncountry wearing that uniform. Intelligence professionals out there are \ndoing what they are supposed to do. The first responder community is \nworking diligently to be ready to respond in ways that keep us safe.\n  I remember well, as others do, one of the things we learned on 9/11 \nwas that those first responders were not properly linked in a way that \nallowed them to communicate with each other as they generally now are \nable to. The response they had was probably adequate in Washington and \nNew York, might not have been adequate in terms of capability in some \nother place. But even in Washington and New York, we found the firemen \ncould not talk to the policemen and the policemen could not talk to \nother first responders. We have done a lot to try to close that gap in \na way that further protects those who protect us.\n  As the President acknowledged in his speech to the country last \nnight, there is no doubt that our Nation and freedom-seeking people \neverywhere still face a real threat from terrorist groups and from \nenemies who wish to do us harm, who cannot tolerate our ability to live \ntogether in a society where everybody does not have to be the same way, \nand everybody does not have to believe the same thing.\n  We are reminded on this date that just 2 years ago four Americans \nwere killed during a terrorist attack on the American consulate in \nBenghazi. There is a new book out, ``13 Hours,'' that provides some \nadditional firsthand accounts of what happened there.\n  It has also been surprising to me that we had that information \navailable to us from the people who were there, and whether it was at \nthe end of the first week or the end of the first year, we still had \nnot heard much of that.\n  We are beginning to hear that in a way that once again clarifies that \nthat was a planned attack in the ongoing efforts to destabilize the \nworld and move it toward some extremist view of the way people need to \nconduct themselves. We have seen what has happened with ISIS, sometimes \nreferred to as ISIL. Whatever they are referred to as, they have \nmanaged to get themselves in a more powerful position than any \nterrorist group ever, a true terrorist army with natural resources that \nproduces income, with looting of banks and financial institutions that \nproduce income, and maybe the most terrifying, with the people from our \ncountry fighting alongside them.\n\n[[Page S5526]]\n\n  They have American passports and can return here. People in probably \nmuch higher numbers from European countries are fighting alongside \nthese extremists and have access in ways they never had because they \nwould be the homegrown terrorists--the terrorists who would have access \nto us in different ways that we have always been most concerned about.\n  These terrorists are clearly not a manageable problem. The President \nmust show it, and he gave real commitment last night to the \nunderstanding that this is a group that cannot be allowed to continue \nto exist. This is a group that we have to destroy--their capacity, \ntheir ability to attack us and to impact our way of life.\n  I am hopeful that the President's resolve and his strategy will \nactually be sufficient in both cases to meet what was his stated \ncommitment to destroy this extremist group.\n  As a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, the Armed \nServices Committee, and the Appropriations Committee, I am going to do \neverything I can to be sure those who serve us, our first responders \nwho protect America, have the resources they need.\n  On this day we should remember--and on every day we should remember--\nthe innocent victims, the first responders, and the families who lost \nso much on 9/11.\n  We also need to remember that it is the strength of our society that \nis what puts the biggest target on us. It is the ability of Americans \nto live together, the ability of Americans to respect other points of \nview, the ability of Americans to share those points of view with each \nother--understanding we could do that in a free society that puts that \nbig target on the United States of America.\n  We are not a target of these extremist groups because of what we have \ndone to them. We are a target of these extremist groups because of what \nwe stand for. May we continue to stand and stand strong. We should \nalways remember the price to be paid by individuals and families if \nterrorism is able to achieve its objectives, which is to scare us away \nfrom standing for freedom and standing for the kind of society in which \nwe live. That is one of the things that certainly 9/11 every year \nbrings back into focus as perhaps no other date does.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  I, as I am sure the Presiding Officer and others did, spent most of \nAugust and the early days September at home.\n  I continue to hear from Missourians about their concerns about the \nimpact of the direction we are headed with health care. We are now at \nthe 1-year anniversary at the end of this month of the launch of the \nexchanges last October 1.\n  The unpopularity of where we are headed continues to grow. Just 35 \npercent of the people who were polled by the monthly poll of the Kaiser \nFoundation released on Tuesday were supportive of the Affordable Care \nAct.\n  How could it possibly be that we are at year-end of this discussion \nand only have that level of support? Maybe it is not so surprising. \nPremium costs continue to go up. PricewaterhouseCoopers finds the \naverage insurance premium for health care is going to rise by 8 percent \nthis year. The President's goal was for families to be paying--in fact, \nhis promised goal--$2,500 less. Instead of that, it seems they are \npaying $3,000 more. That is a very substantial missing of the mark; so \nno wonder they are concerned.\n  Healthcare.gov was supposed to have undergone many repairs but we \nlearned just last week that at some point--and it is my understanding \nthey are not exactly sure how much or when--there was a major breach \ninto that system to find out information that people had put there. \nPeople trying to verify their personal information so they could \ncontinue to have the coverage they have is a challenge. People are \ntrying to submit all kinds of documents--citizenship, immigration \ndocuments--in order to be able to keep their health care. Apparently it \nwould be a huge imposition to prove who you are to vote but not a huge \nimposition to have to prove who you are to have government-assisted \nhealth care.\n\n  A new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report offers the \nlatest proof that there are problems by saying the combined effects of \nthe affordable health care coverage expansion, faster economic growth, \nand an aging population are expected to fuel health spending growth \nthis year and thereafter to where we are going to see 6 percent per \nyear, according to the administration, from 2015 to 2023.\n  This is one of the things that happens when the government believes \nit can do things that people rightly--we need to find better ways for \npeople to have more choices--do for themselves. Hopefully this \ndiscussion will continue in a way that solves these problems, creates \nmore choices for people, more opportunities for them to have people to \nhave the insurance they want, the coverage they want, and what they \nbelieve their family needs and can afford.\n  I hope we can get back to having that debate on a clear problem for \nmillions of families in America today as opposed to having the debate \nwe are having this week, which is, again, to do things that our friends \nin the majority know can't possibly happen.\n  We are here without a budget, without a single appropriations bill \nbeing passed, and without dealing with the problems the country knows \nwe should deal with. We are again going to spend the last 2 weeks we \nare here before the election voting day after day on things that can't \nhappen. The one thing we will have to do is one more stopgap effort to \nkeep the government funded after October 1, since we haven't done any \nof the other work to set our priorities and say what our government \nshould be doing and what we can afford to do beginning October 1 of \nthis year.\n  It is a sad commentary on a Senate that is not working. I hope we all \ncome back after the elections with a greater resolve to get back to the \nbasics of how the Senate, the Congress, and the country are supposed to \nwork.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Remembering 9/11\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, we gather here today in this \nremarkable place--a symbol of freedom and democracy for the whole \nworld--to remember the tragic, horrific, unspeakable attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001, and we remember the innocent lives that were lost, \nthe people of many different ages who worked to help the injured, brave \nheroes who have fought terrorism and extremism around the globe in the \nyears since 9/11, and, of course, the victims themselves, many of them \nfrom Connecticut. This day has special meaning in Connecticut because \nit affects so directly and sadly the loved ones and families of people \nwho sacrificed their lives as a result of that unimaginably cruel and \nbrutal terrorist act. We remember them with pride. We remember their \ngrace, civility, humanity, dedication to the public good, and their \nlove for their families.\n  We have been striving since that terrible day to strengthen our \nNation, to live proudly and unashamedly, consistently with our national \nvalues of peace, tolerance, and service. This effort requires \ncommitment and sacrifice. It has required service at home and abroad \nfrom countless men and women who have served in uniform--our police, \nour firefighters, our first responders--believing that the best way we \ncan honor the men and women who died on that day is to make America the \nbest place it can possibly be. It is the greatest and strongest Nation \nin the history of the world, and it is so because people have always \nbelieved it can be made better, freer, stronger, braver. And that is \nwhat we have tried to do.\n  Today in the Senate, in the Committee on the Judiciary, I was proud \nto cosponsor and vote for a measure that will give those victims and \ntheir families some additional justice. The Justice Against Sponsors of \nTerrorism Act will hold foreign sponsors of terrorism that target \nAmerica accountable in U.S. courts.\n  Obstacles have been raised in our Federal courts, obstacles on \nprocedural grounds and technical issues, most recently in a Second \nCircuit case, In re Terrorist Attacks of September 11,\n\n[[Page S5527]]\n\n2001, which, in my view, misread Federal law to provide immunity to the \nSaudi Government and entities that claim to be associated with the \nSaudi Government against the 9/11 victims' claims alleging its support \nfor those attacks.\n  This new legislation will make clear that terrorism is unsupportable \nand must be held accountable in our U.S. courts. It will erase the \nimmunity and the procedural obstacles that can be raised and make sure \nthat sovereign immunity as a doctrine provides no safe harbor, no haven \nfor terrorism when victims and their families seek to hold those \nterrorist sponsors as well as terrorist groups accountable for their \nhorrific actions.\n  That measure was passed with the tremendous leadership and support of \nits two main cosponsors, Senators Cornyn and Schumer. I thank them for \ntheir work, as well as our chairman, Senator Leahy, and ranking member, \nSenator Grassley, for their willingness to move this matter on \nSeptember 11, and say to the victims and their loved ones: We will hold \naccountable the wrongdoers, and we will make sure the courts of the \nUnited States are places where justice is provided against terrorism.\n  We can also make America a better place by giving more Americans a \nfair shot. A fair shot is what America promises to men and women who \nlive here now and men and women who come here. A fair shot is part of \nour basic principled existence. The terrorists struck the World Trade \nCenter and they hit the Pentagon, but they missed America. What makes \nAmerica great is those principled values.\n  As we gather today, we should say thank you to the brave men and \nwomen in uniform. The Acting President pro tempore is one of them, and \nI thank him. I thank my two sons who have served, one in the Marine \nCorps Reserve, deployed to Afghanistan, another now in the Navy. The \nfact is that the burden of this longest war in our history has been \nborne by less than 1 percent of our population. We owe all of them and \ntheir families our thanks, and we can best say thanks by giving them \nand all Americans a fair shot at the American dream.\n\n\n                              A Fair Shot\n\n  I have just returned from 5 weeks in Connecticut, where I had the \nopportunity to listen to concerns of my constituents. The people of \nConnecticut are proud of this country, but they are also concerned \nabout the great disparities that exist. No one is looking for a free \nlunch. Nobody in Connecticut thinks there is a free lunch. But people \nbelieve in a fair shot and the chance to make a better life for \nthemselves and their families. The present disparities are stark and \ndispiriting and daunting and, at the end of the day, unacceptable and \ndeeply disturbing.\n\n  Our country has made important strides toward recovering from the \neconomic crisis of 2008, but we are far from done. We are still very \nmuch a work in progress economically and socially. Unfortunately, as \nthe Federal Reserve noted just last week, economic burdens continue to \nfall hardest on Americans who can least afford them.\n  The disparities in this country have a particularly severe effect on \nwomen. Today women make up 50 percent of college graduates, but in \norder to do so they take on an average $30,000 in debt, and they go on \nto work at places where they earn only 77 cents or 82 cents for every \n$1 paid to men.\n  When women are treated fairly, we are all treated fairly. When women \nare treated unfairly, we all suffer. When college graduates struggle \nunder crushing loads of debt, our whole economy suffers and we are all \npoorer. These problems affect real people. There are real, attainable \nsolutions available to us all.\n  I have participated in more than a dozen roundtables across the State \nof Connecticut, roundtables at colleges and universities where I have \nheard story after story from them--and also roundtables in high \nschools--about their struggles to stay on top of their debt. They \nunderstood, every one of them, that they were taking on a significant \nburden but not one that is insurmountable, not one that will cripple \nthem financially for the rest of their lives.\n  I heard from Gillon, an honorably discharged Army veteran who is now \nstudying law. He wrote to me to say:\n\n       Despite having done everything that society tells us while \n     growing up is the right thing to do, I'm still saddled with \n     over $132,000 in federal school loan debt. My total monthly \n     payments amount to nearly a third of my take-home salary each \n     month, with no end in sight.\n\n  Dean, who has three children, earned a master's degree to try to move \nahead in his career. A year after graduating, he is $55,000 in debt, \nand he is struggling to support his family even though he and his wife \nwork four jobs between them--four jobs and he is struggling to make \nends meet, to put a roof over his family's head.\n  Along with my friend and colleague Senator Murphy, I met last week \nwith Susan Herbst, the president of the University of Connecticut, and \nwith a number of UConn students and recent graduates, on the campus. \nThey shared with me how excited they are about the vast and limitless \nopportunities afforded them by this great university.\n  I sensed the excitement while I was there of this great campus, \nmaking me envious for the time they are spending there in studying and \nexploring the tremendous reaches of human knowledge, both practical and \ntheoretical, and yet the difficulty of how affording a college \neducation has constrained and constricted the professional climate \nbeyond that campus. As heady and glorious as the days on campus may be, \nthere is an overhang of doubt and debt that restricts the reach of \ntheir lives. It restricts the reach of our economy because it \nconstricts consumer demand, it restricts the reach of their ambitions \nto start businesses, and families to buy homes, and to move ahead with \ntheir lives. And that is a problem for all of us.\n  There are ways for Congress to address this problem. We can pass the \nlegislation I am pleased to cosponsor with Senator Warren of \nMassachusetts which would allow borrowers to refinance student loan \ndebt. We can pass Senator Franken's legislation to ensure that debt \nobligations are explained in clear, comprehensible terms so students \nknow what they are taking on. I am developing a proposal to improve the \nflexibility of loan forgiveness for students who pursue careers in \npublic service such as teaching, public safety, or firefighting.\n  The current program requires students to work a full 10 years in \nthese professions for any debt forgiveness. Any debt forgiveness hinges \non those full 10 years. I believe shorter periods of work should allow \nfor loan forgiveness in proportion to the time they spend on the job. \nThere are ways to make public service a quicker and easier means for \nloan forgiveness.\n  There are other methods as well that we should pursue to enable \ncollege affordability. Paycheck fairness is basic to America. There is \nno reason that American women make only 77 cents per every dollar made \nby men. Male health care workers in Connecticut earn on average almost \ntwice as much as women performing the same job. Men working in finance \nearn 61 percent more than women with the same position.\n  This shocking gap persists when controlled for education, experience, \nand other job-related factors. The data demonstrates unavoidably and \ninescapably that women make less than men in 97 percent of professions.\n  The event I attended in Connecticut, which was a meeting of the \nConnecticut Permanent Commission on the Status of Women, chaired by \nAntonia Moran, highlighted the shameful lag in women's compensation. \nMany women with college degrees told me about their personal struggles.\n  Lori Pelletier, the executive secretary-treasurer of the Connecticut \nAFL-CIO, explained how carefully crafted union contracts can often make \na difference, but everyone agreed that better laws to address the \nproblem are needed.\n  Fortunately, my distinguished colleague Senator Mikulski, who is here \non the floor today, has introduced the Paycheck Fairness Act. It will \nbring into the 21st century, more than 50 years after the Equal Pay Act \nwas signed by President Kennedy, the gap of full equality. It will \nimprove the remedies available to victims of discrimination. It will \nprohibit employers from punishing workers who share salary information. \nIt will require any differences in pay to be determined only by job-\nrelated factors. It will improve\n\n[[Page S5528]]\n\ntraining and education regarding how to take action against \ndiscrimination.\n  Pay equity is good for families, it is good for the economy, it is \ngood for America, and it is a matter of fundamental fairness. I thank \nmy colleague Senator Mikulski for her great work on this issue. I am \nproud to stand here with her today and with so many other colleagues, \nbecause it is basic to a fair shot in the United States of America.\n  I know American people are counting on all of us to help make America \nbetter, to keep faith with the great men and women who have served in \nour military around the world, who have served and sacrificed--the \nloved ones of 9/11 victims, of all the victims of terrorism who have \nperished since and before 9/11. To make America better is what we can \ndo to keep faith with them. To give Americans a fair shot should be our \nmission today and every day. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                            Remembering 9/11\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I first thank the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Blumenthal, for his words on what the middle class is \nfacing and his particular advocacy on behalf of women. It is well known \nand much appreciated.\n  I come to the floor today to talk about middle-class people who are \ntrying to play by the rules. But before I do, on this auspicious day, \nSeptember 11, 2014, I wish to pay my respects once again and express my \nheartfelt sympathy to the families of people who died on September 11 \nthroughout this country--at the World Trade Center, at the Pentagon, in \nPennsylvania--to the wonderful first responders who risked their lives \nand many themselves who perished, to those who were wounded or sick and \nbear the permanent burden of their response to that awful tragedy, and \nto the families of the loved ones who have to live with it every single \nday--who have an absent chair at Christmas or Thanksgiving, or \nHanukkah, whatever faith holiday where families gather and remember.\n  The Nation cannot forget what happened that day and it cannot forget \nwhy it happened, and we cannot forget the people who were there and \npaid this terrible price of terrorism.\n  I express my sympathy, my condolences, to say one way we can honor \nthem is to make sure we don't have another terrorist attack in the \nUnited States. But what they were doing that day is to believe in \nAmerica, and that brings me to what I want to talk about today.\n\n\n                            The Middle Class\n\n  Yes, people talk about when we are out on our break we are on \nvacation. But I have been moving around Maryland, and one of the things \nI see and hear that is so clear is that, No. 1, the middle class is \nworried whether it is going to stay middle class. Those who want to be \nmiddle class worry if there is going to be an opportunity ladder for \nthem to achieve middle-class status, where they can earn a decent \nliving, raise a family, and make a contribution to their community.\n  They are repeatedly told: If you work hard and go by the rules, you \nwill do OK. They are becoming increasingly skeptical of that, because \nthey feel the very rules of government work against them and the very \nclimate of government stops any change to be able to help them. They \neither feel that we are irrelevant or we are working against them.\n  That is why they say: All we want is for America to be America again, \nwhere if you work hard, go by the rules, you can have a pretty good \nlife and make a pretty good contribution to this great country of ours.\n  So when they talk about these issues and if you talk to the old-\ntimers--particularly those who are facing families in long-term care--\nthey worry about the very cruel rules of government that tell them to \nspend down their life savings until they are eligible for Medicaid; \nthat if you worked hard and you saved, you are actually penalized for \nthat--except for legislation I passed 25 years ago--that if they had \ngone and squandered their money, they would be better off and more \neligible.\n  Then there are the young people who want to be able to go to school \nwhere they can make something of themselves and make America a better \nplace to live.\n  I held student roundtables, along with my colleague Senator Cardin. \nPeople talked to us about the careers they wanted. At Bowie State, four \nof the young people who were part of the roundtable want to go into \nnursing, both men as well as women. They think: I could help people. We \nhave a nursing shortage in this country. Yet the very obstacle to them \nbeing able to afford to pay for their education will prohibit it.\n  Why is it that education is so expensive in this country when we look \nat tuition, books, fees? And then what is it that we do? First of all, \nwe make sure that Pell grants aren't year-long. You can only go two \nsemesters. But if you want to go during the summer to ace that class \nthat you have to do for compliance purposes for graduation, or that \nespecially hard class--you only want to take one class a semester--your \ngovernment won't help you finish sooner or finish better. We won't help \nyou. We can give tax break earmarks, but we can't give tax breaks or \nhelp there.\n  Then when they look at their student debt and the interest rates they \ncarry, they ask me: Senator Mikulski, why is it that you can refinance \na yacht but I can't refinance my student loan?\n  And I say: Well, you know, we are stuck on the motion to proceed, and \nwe are two votes short of the filibuster; but then we will go backward \nif we do this.\n  They don't want to hear this parliamentary wonky stuff. What they \nwant to hear is: We believe in them and we need them and we want them, \nand we are going to help them for what they believe we are going to \nhelp them achieve to be able to get a student loan. But underneath it \nall is that work should be worth it and work should be rewarded.\n  That brings me then to paycheck fairness. One of the other rules they \nfeel is against them is: The rules are rigged against you if you want \nto fight for equal pay for equal work. If you want to fight for equal \npay for equal work, you can be retaliated against, you can be \nhumiliated, you can be harassed, you can be fired, simply because you \nare asking the person standing next to you at the water cooler or the \ncomputer printout machine: How much do you make? That simple question, \nhow much do you make, can trigger a whole retaliatory effort against \nyou. That is the rule, and all it is you want to know is what kind of \ndough the person next to you is making. This is why we once again are \nbringing up the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act is to fill and close the loopholes that \ncame about in the original Equal Pay Act. We have been at this for 50 \nyears. When this fight started under Lyndon Johnson, women made almost \n50 cents for every dollar men made--and after 50 years, gee, we are up \nto 77 cents per every dollar. And for Latino women, African-American \nwomen, other women of color, it is even worse.\n  People might say: Didn't you fix this when you did the Lilly \nLedbetter bill? The Lilly Ledbetter bill that we did pass restored the \nlaw to where it was before the Supreme Court decision. This updates and \nstrengthens it. What it does is it deals with this whole issue of \nretaliation. The Lilly Ledbetter bill did not address employers who are \ncurrently able to legally retaliate against workers who share salary \ninformation. This legislation stops employers from being able to sue or \npunish workers for comparing wages.\n\n  It also helps restore congressional intent. It makes sure that \nemployers who claim that differences in pay based on any factor other \nthan sex are dealt with. This legislation limits employers' ability to \nexploit this loophole by requiring that this defense can only be used \nwhen it is related to job performance and is necessary for business.\n  This bill creates a fair playing field, simply knowing what the next \nperson earns and being able to work and to negotiate for equal pay for \nequal work. The Paycheck Fairness Act fixes the law to keep \ndiscrimination from happening. It would have helped keep Lilly from \nhaving to sue in the first place.\n  This bill puts an end to the incentives that cause employers to think \nthat paying women less is just a cost of doing business. It gets rid of \nthe secrecy that makes it harder to uncover pay differences. Why should \npay be such a secret unless you are ashamed to say what it is? Why \nwould you want to keep it a secret? Maybe it is because\n\n[[Page S5529]]\n\nyou don't want to brag that you pay the men more than the women. Maybe \nyou are too ashamed. Maybe you think it will lead you to an EEOC \nlawsuit. We want to end secrecy at the job place, where you know what \nthe person next to you makes--you have a right to ask.\n  I have heard from women all over America and I have heard from men--\nmen who work so hard, particularly for their daughters; men who have \njobs they hate so their girls can go to school and have jobs they love. \nMen want equal pay for equal work. They want it for their spouses, they \nwant it for their widowed mothers, and they want it for their \ndaughters.\n  Listening to the cases--Donna Smith of Maryland's Eastern Shore \nworked as a retail clerk. She was told not to discuss her pay, but when \nshe found out she was being paid less than a male cook and was doing \nthe exact same job, she filed an EEOC complaint. And what happened? \nWhile she fought for her pay, they were fighting her with agitation and \nhumiliation.\n  Latoya Weaver sent a letter to me. She is a single parent with three \nchildren, working in guest services at a hotel. She found out her pay \nof $8 an hour was $2 less than the males doing the same job. Two \ndollars when you are at bare minimum makes a pretty big difference. She \nfiled an EEOC lawsuit. Although she only received compensatory damage \nbecause of the discrimination, the company's policy against discussing \npay means it could happen again.\n  I could give example after example. I have been talking about this \nfor a number of years. It is time. In the Senate, after all is said and \ndone, more gets said than gets done. But this time, in the next 72 \nhours, we could actually vote to move the bill to the floor, to \ncontinue the debate and discussion and actually right the wrongs in \nequal pay for equal work. This is why American women want a fair shot. \nAll they want is to be paid exactly the same--equal pay--as their male \ncounterparts.\n  Mr. President, knowing of your own steadfast advocacy for the middle \nclass in this country and an opportunity ladder in this country, we \nhave to stop and make sure the rules government creates do not rig the \ngame against people who are working hard and trying to play by the \nrules. The rules should work for the people and not for the government \nor for those who want to hold down wages or opportunities.\n  We are not going to accept women being paid less. We have paid \nattention to this problem, we've listened to the voices of the people, \nand we have a solution in the Paycheck Fairness Act. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to see if there are amendments, whatever we \ncould do to move this process forward. I would love a unanimous vote \nout of the Senate to have paycheck fairness finally in our lawbooks and \nin women's checkbooks. It's time to end pay inequity. It's time for \nCongress to act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n\n\n                            Remembering 9/11\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today is the 13th anniversary of 9/11, a \nday that will be burned in all of our collective memories. I remember \ntwo events like this in my lifetime--9/11 is one, and the other is when \nJohn F. Kennedy, our President, was assassinated. I remember where I \nwas, what I was doing, and I remember the feeling of horror as the \nreality of both of those events became more clear. And I bet I am not \nalone. I bet there are Americans all around the country who remember \nwhere they were and what they were doing and what their first thoughts \nwere when those planes hit the World Trade Center in New York, the \nfirst and then the second, only to learn there were other planes that \nwere flying with terrorists who had other targets. Of course there was \nthe Pentagon, where many Americans lost their lives, and then there was \nthe plane that was brought down in Pennsylvania that I will talk about \na little more.\n  This is one of the defining moments in our Nation's history, a day \nthat proved that our love of country and our fellow Americans will \nalways prevail. I remember the overwhelming sense of unity the American \npeople felt when this tragedy unfolded, and it is entirely right that \nwe did so.\n  Nearly 3000 Americans lost their lives on that day, many in an \nattempt to save others from harm. As usually happens in moments of \ntragedy, there were sparks or hints or bright lights of the triumph of \nthe human spirit, people rising to the challenge, showing some of the \nvery best qualities we exhibit as human beings.\n  Today we pause with heavy hearts to remember those we lost and pray \nto God that He will continue to comfort the families of those who still \nmourn. Thirteen years may seem like a long time to many of us who did \nnot have the personal tragedy of losing somebody we were close to or a \nfamily member, but I am confident that for many who did lose family \nmembers and loved ones and friends, that 13 years seems like just \nyesterday.\n  We also continue to keep our military, our intelligence \nprofessionals, our law enforcement officials, first responders, and \nothers who dedicated their lives to that fateful day in our thoughts \nand prayers because it is they who help keep us safe and who have \nhelped us avoid a similar attack on our homeland over the last 13 \nyears. None of them should ever for a moment doubt our gratitude.\n  I wasn't serving in this body when those attacks came on September \n11, but, as I said, I remember exactly where I was. Like other \nAmericans, I was at home in Austin, TX, preparing for work when I heard \nthe terrible news. I remember my wife called my attention to it after \nthe first plane hit the World Trade Center. I didn't actually see it. \nOf course I saw it time and time again as it was replayed. But I turned \nto the television set, as my wife called my attention to it just as the \nsecond plane hit, and we all wondered what in the world was happening. \nThen when the towers actually fell and as people jumped out of the \ntowers to avoid, they hoped, their death--but, in fact, they did jump \nto their death--it was all too vivid and is still today.\n  We should never forget, and that is perhaps the most important lesson \nwe should learn. We should never forget what happened on that terrible \nday. It is said that those who forget history are condemned to relive \nit, and I believe that to be true.\n  September 11 is a solemn reminder of what can be taken from us in the \nblink of an eye and why we must never waiver in our efforts to protect \nthis great Nation and the freedom it embodies.\n  Two simple words were spoken that will be remembered in history as \none of the most courageous and powerful phrases ever uttered, and of \ncourse I am referring to the words spoken by Todd Beamer aboard Flight \n93. When they heard terrorists were in command of the controls of the \nairplane and perhaps heading to the Nation's Capital, perhaps to attack \neither the White House or Congress and to knock out large portions of \nthe U.S. Government, Todd Beamer's response, along with other brave \npatriots, was ``Let's roll.'' They then attempted to overpower the \nterrorists in the cockpit. Those brave passengers on that flight did \nmore than just save the lives of innocent Americans here in the \nNation's Capital; absent their sacrifice, it is likely that flight \nwould have claimed even more lives than just those on board.\n  The passengers on Flight 93, along with every American who died 13 \nyears ago on September 11, were men and women with jobs, with families, \nand with dreams. I am sure that, like all of us, many of them made \npromises to their loved ones before they boarded that plane or left for \nwork that day--promises to be home in time for dinner, to make a \nchild's soccer game or birthday party. Some promises don't come cheap. \nOthers cost us absolutely nothing. Others require that we risk \neverything we have and everything we are, even our very lives, to \nfulfill those promises. Their acts of courage offer us comfort even \ntoday and inspire every American as we have rebuilt from that terrible \nday 13 years ago.\n  The acts of courage displayed on 9/11 mark their last promise in a \nsense--a promise carried on to the Nation, to their children and other \nloved ones left behind; a promise that says the story of freedom will \nnot end in the vile acts of evil men. It will endure and it will not be \ndestroyed.\n  Early this morning I had the privilege of joining my colleagues on \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee in approving an important piece of \nlegislation called the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, which \nwill now be eligible for movement across the floor. It is\n\n[[Page S5530]]\n\nappropriate that we pass that piece of legislation on the anniversary \nof 9/11.\n  By amending the current law to hold foreign sponsors of terrorism \npotentially liable in U.S. courts for acts that injure or kill \nAmericans, this bill will allow the families of the victims of the \nattacks on 9/11 and others to proceed to court against those \nresponsible for those horrific attacks that took place 13 years ago.\n  Part of the attack against international terrorism has to be to go \nagainst the money that finances it, and this will provide another tool \nfor those families to attack those who fund and finance international \nterrorism.\n  This bill, not surprisingly, is strongly supported by the 9/11 family \nvictims, and it would allow their litigation to proceed on its merits. \nI am hopeful it will receive the prompt consideration here on the \nSenate floor that it deserves.\n  Americans have always been deeply concerned about the kind of country \nand the kind of world we leave our children. As parents, that is what \nkeeps us going some days. Of course, grandparents have other reasons to \nkeep going and to keep fighting for a better world. This remains true \nboth abroad and here at home in our own communities and in our schools \nand at work. We must continue to push on undeterred, always confident \nin the pursuit of our ultimate goal: a just, free, and peaceful world \nnot just for ourselves but for our allies and for future generations. \nPart of that mission involves stopping evil at its source, running it \ndown, and eliminating it for good because we learned another thing on \n9/11: We can either take the fight to the source of the evil where it \nexists or we can defend here on the homeland. Speaking for myself and I \nam sure others, I want to go fight it at its source and not just defend \non the homeland.\n  The minions of terror have shown their capacity for inhumanity. We \nhave seen recent reminders of that with the beheading of two American \njournalists by ISIS. We must never underestimate the capacity and \ndesire of these evil people to do so again and again.\n  We have recently been reminded of this, and last night the President \nspoke to the Nation's commitment to deal with this sort of horrific \nactivity and dangerous and extreme ideology. As we adapt to new threats \nand new challenges, Americans must maintain a sense of vigilance, a \nsense of purpose, and a sense of moral clarity.\n  We must never forget why we fight, and we must always make sure that \nour brave men and women in uniform have what they need in order to take \nthe fight to our Nation's enemies. The greatest honor we can give to \nthose we lost is to live our lives worthy of their sacrifice, relish \nthe freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution, and ensure the promise \nthat those freedoms shall not perish for future generations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is an uneasy time in our world. There \nis no shortage of crises that demand our attention and our action. The \nPresident called on us last night to step up to the very real challenge \nposed by the terrorist group ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Russian aggression \nagainst Ukraine demands our attention. A fragile cease-fire continues \nbetween Hamas and Gaza. There is the Central American exodus to our \nsouthern border that riveted the attention of many this summer; and \nthere is continuing negotiations to seek an end to Iran's illicit \nnuclear weapons program.\n  Behind all of this there is another and equally important challenge I \nwanted to draw this body's attention to for a few minutes today--the \nspread of a quiet and vicious virus throughout West Africa. While the \nNation's attention today for good reason is on remembering the tragic \nevents of 9/11, and the President's strategy for combating ISIS today, \nI would like to speak to another urgent challenge to our country and \nworld, and that is the need to dramatically increase our support as \ncommunities across West Africa struggle to confront and combat Ebola.\n  I met and have spoken with Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf. \nShe is a Nobel Prize winner and impressive leader who has brought her \ncountry back from a terrible civil war and was making huge progress \ntoward the development of Liberia. I had the honor of meeting with her \nhere and visiting her country. In my role as the chair of the African \nAffairs Subcommittee, I have met few others who have impressed me as \nmuch as President Johnson-Sirleaf.\n  Leaders throughout this region are doing everything they can to save \nlives, but in my most recent communications with President Johnson-\nSirleaf it is clear that Ebola is rapidly getting beyond the capacity \nand ability of these communities and countries to contain it and to \nrecover from it. They need our action.\n  Individuals on the ground from groups such as Doctors Without Borders \nand Samaritan's Purse have done remarkable, heroic, and extraordinary \nwork by putting their own lives on the line to help others, and they \nhave borne the overwhelming majority of the risks, service, and \nsacrifice so far.\n  The news has just been announced that the Gates Foundation will \ncontribute $50 million to this fight, which is critical, as public \nfunds alone will not be enough to end this crisis.\n  Our own people, through the U.S. Government, can and must do more. It \nneed not be the role of the United States alone to resolve this \nproblem, but it is our responsibility to stand side by side with those \nworking tirelessly to stop it. It is our responsibility to not just \nlend a hand but to help lead in ways that only we can and to use our \nunique capabilities to address this crisis. If Ebola's spread reveals \none thing it is that we are more interconnected today than we have ever \nbeen in our human history and that disease truly knows and respects no \nborders. We need to continue to act, not only because we are morally \ncompelled to help the tens of thousands who are facing an immediate \nthreat, but also because we have a direct stake in the resolution of \nthis crisis.\n  This is a manageable public health crisis that we know how to solve, \nbut doing so requires our focus, our attention, our resolve, and our \nresources, tools that only the United States has.\n  Let me briefly outline five specific steps I believe we should take \nnow.\n  First, I think it is critical the United States has one leadership \npoint--that the White House designate a coordinator to oversee the U.S. \nwhole-of-government emergency response. There are many ways the United \nStates is currently helping across many agencies from the Department of \nDefense to the Centers for Disease Control to the State Department and \nUSAID. Those agencies are doing great work as part of the disaster \nassistance response team on the ground.\n  At a time when the U.S. Government is also facing and addressing \ncrises in Iraq, Ukraine, and elsewhere, I think we need one organizer, \none coordinator, one responsible figure addressing this crisis who is \nappointed by the White House to coordinate all of our resources and all \nthe people necessary from the U.S. Government for this growing effort. \nPresident Obama should designate an official to manage our country's \nresponse both overseas and here in the United States, including \npreparing us for the remote chance this virus might reach American \nsoil.\n  Our ambassadors on the ground in the three most affected countries \nare playing the primary role in coordination right now, and they are \ndoing remarkable work, but I will remind my colleagues in this body \nthat in Sierra Leone there is no currently confirmed U.S. Ambassador. \nThe nominee, John Hoover, has been waiting almost 8 months to be \nconfirmed. This is just one painful reminder that the dysfunction of \nthis body has prevented us from confirming nominated ambassadors to \ndozens of countries around the world. To be effective we need to \ncoordinate our U.S.-based and our field-based efforts through \nambassadors on the ground.\n  Second, we must begin to deploy U.S. military support to the maximum \nextent possible. Let me be clear: I don't mean combat capabilities, I \nmean the unique logistical capabilities of the U.S. military, their \nability to deploy through their logistical capabilities. We have \nresources that no other country can bring to bear as quickly and as \nsuccessfully as we can.\n  I was encouraged to hear an announcement this past week from the \nadministration that they plan to use our military to establish a new \nhospital facility in Liberia to distribute equipment, to provide \ninfrastructure and transportation support. I will admit I am concerned \nit will take weeks to deploy.\n  On my visit to Liberia last August, I was struck at how poor and \nunderdeveloped this nation of brave and inspiring people currently is \nand how paved roads and the ability to move at any speed rapidly ends \njust a few miles from the capital, and how strained the infrastructure \nand the public health systems are by this rapidly growing crisis.\n  This is not everything we can and should be doing. We need to build \nmore field hospitals for civilians in Liberia and beyond so there are \nfacilities for health workers and civilians fighting the disease. We \nalso can and should provide airlift of supplies from private donors.\n  I have heard from organizations that have worked at the \ntransportation facility and have donated supplies that can fill cargo \nplane after cargo plane, but they are having difficulty getting it from \nhere to West Africa. We need to deepen our coordination with foreign \nmilitaries. Other Nations possess similar advance capabilities, as we \ndo, and we will be able to combat this crisis more effectively if we \nall work together.\n  I appreciate Ghana's efforts and partnership as it allows us to use \nsome of their facilities as an air bridge for logistics. As more air \nresources are poured into this fight against Ebola, we need other \ncountries in the region to lend a similarly open hand.\n  My third point is directed to our private sector, to international \norganizations, to the American people, and to citizens of other \ndeveloped nations. We need your support and your generosity and we need \nit now.\n  This is a letter that Liberia's President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf sent \nto President Obama this week, and I wish to read from it briefly.\n\n       Mr. President, as you know, the outbreak has overwhelmed \n     the containment and treatment measures we have attempted thus \n     far.\n\n[[Page S5532]]\n\n     Our already limited resources have been stretched to the \n     breaking point and, up to now, only a private charity, \n     Medecins Sans Frontiers, has responded robustly in all the \n     affected countries. But they, too, have reached their limits.\n\n  My friend President Sirleaf is right: It is time for the rest of us \nto step up.\n  The World Health Organization has issued an Ebola Response Roadmap \nthat calls for $490 million and more than 10,000 additional health \nworkers, and we are far short of reaching those goals today.\n  So far the U.S. Government has contributed more than $100 million and \nhas announced a commitment of another $88 million that we in this body \nwill hopefully approve before we end this session.\n  The Gates Foundation, as I mentioned, has also made an impressive and \nincredible addition of $50 million, but the fact remains we need more.\n  I have heard from many in my State and across the country eager to \ngive support. If you have the means, I urge you to go to usaid.gov/\nebola for links to some of the impressive nongovernmental organizations \nthat are doing what they can on the ground to stem this humanitarian \ncrisis.\n  As much as this crisis needs money and equipment and supplies, it \nmost importantly needs nurses and doctors, paramedics, and other \nmedical professionals--literally thousands of them. The health systems \nof these countries, which were already among the least well resourced \nin the world, are overwhelmed, and so I am asking today for your help. \nWe are asking for you to save lives. If you are a trained medical \nprofessional and willing to help, I urge you to please go to usaid.gov/\nebola and consider how you might serve to help in this crisis.\n  Fourth, we need to develop and deploy a treatment and vaccine as \nrapidly as possible. Here is where in some ways America's unique gifts, \nour talents, and our strength in terms of the development and discovery \nof new pharmaceuticals, of new treatments, and of a new vaccine are a \nunique contribution we can make.\n  American scientists are making progress on both fronts, but the \nreality is it will be hard to confront and ultimately end this disease \nin the long term without either. Much of the $88 million President \nObama has requested from Congress will go toward this most important \ngoal. It is critical we support that funding in this Chamber on a \nbipartisan basis and prepare for the reality that this is only the \nfirst investment we will need to make to quickly develop and deploy \nthese lifesaving drugs and these critically preventive vaccines.\n\n  Lastly, we need to invest in the governing and economic institutions \nin the countries that have been so devastated by this disease.\n  It is not a coincidence that this outbreak has emerged in countries \nwith some of the weakest health care systems on Earth--countries that \nface severe shortages of health care workers, labs essential for \ntesting and diagnosis, clinics and hospitals required for treatment, \nand the medical supplies and protective gear such as latex gloves and \nface masks that are commonly available in the United States but are now \ncompletely exhausted in the countries of Sierra Leone, Guinea, and \nLiberia.\n  We know how to combat this disease with practices such as isolation, \nmeticulous infection control, good public health and burial practices, \ncase investigation, and contact training. But all of these things \nrequire trained personnel and many more resources than are currently \navailable.\n  In the short term we absolutely can fill many of these gaps with the \nadditional resources I have just outlined but we need to act quickly. \nIn the long term we need to think more deeply about why investing in \nlocal health care systems and institutions in the developing world is \nso critical, why a little preventive investment can go a long way \ntoward making the country more resilient in a crisis such as this.\n  As we act now to do what we must to stop Ebola, we also must consider \nthe actions we can and should take together to prevent the next public \nhealth crisis.\n  To that end, yesterday I introduced a resolution in the Senate with \nmy colleagues Senators Menendez, Flake, Durbin, and Corker, outlining \nsome of these very steps and recognizing the severe and real threat the \nEbola outbreak poses to West Africa and, if not properly contained, to \nother regions across the globe.\n  Here is the bottom line: We have what it takes to halt the spread of \nEbola in West Africa and to save tens of thousands, if not hundreds of \nthousands, of lives in the process. Unlike other foreign interventions, \ndoing so will take neither bullets nor bombs but rather our \nwillingness, our compassion, our generosity, and our determination to \nact. The lives of thousands and the stability of entire countries is at \nstake. It is my hope and prayer that we will rise to this occasion with \neverything we have.\n\n\n                             ISIS Strategy\n\n  Mr. President, I have come to the floor this morning to speak about \nour military's critical mission to defeat and degrade the Islamic State \nof Iraq and Syria, a terrorist organization that threatens the \nstability and security of tens of thousands across these two nations.\n  As we consider more deeply involving the U.S. military into a new \ncombat mission, I am reminded of the brave young men and women who will \ncarry out that mission with unparalleled courage and professionalism.\n  This past Saturday I had the opportunity to join hundreds of fellow \nDelawareans to welcome home and celebrate 70 men and women of the 3rd \nBattalion of the 238th Army National Guard Aviation Regiment who were \nreturning from 1 year of service in Kuwait. Many of them were returning \nnot just from one tour of duty but from what was their second or third \ndeployment, having previously served in both Afghanistan and Iraq. Yet \nthese volunteer citizen soldiers were and remain willing to continue \nserving. I have had the honor of knowing several current and former \nmembers of this unit, and my heart was heavy this weekend, thinking \nabout how many more units such as these, how many soldiers and airmen \nand their families will be asked to continue serving in combat or in \ndistant and difficult places supporting combat missions in the years \nahead.\n  After more than a decade of conflict in the exactly 13 years since \nSeptember 11, 2001, I know Americans are tired of war. I know we are \nweary of war. As the President spoke last night, it was clear he is as \nwell, as am I.\n  But I would challenge my colleagues and my friends, as I challenge \nmyself, that though we are weary, we cannot ignore the very real \nthreats we face today. We cannot ignore the brutal events that have \ntaken place in northwestern Iraq and in eastern Syria. We cannot ignore \nthe threat that brutality poses to America and our allies. ISIS is a \nbrutal terrorist organization. It has killed innocent Americans, such \nas the two brave journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff, whom they \nbeheaded. Thousands of innocent Iraqis and Syrians have perished at \ntheir hands, and it will continue to do so unless the world comes \ntogether to stop it.\n  Let us not forget, one of the biggest reasons we first acted against \nISIS militarily in Iraq this summer was to prevent the imminent \ngenocide of a religious minority, the Yazidi people in Iraq. Images of \ntens of thousands of Yazidis and Christians who were being hounded and \npersecuted and threatened by ISIS and who then ultimately retreated to \nthe top of a mountain I think transfixed the American people this \nAugust, and the action our President took and our military executed, to \nallow them to safely flee, encouraged all of us to know there are times \nand places when American military might can and should be used for \ngood.\n  Just as the ISIS terrorists threaten the Yazidis, they too threaten \nthe very survival of Christians, Kurds, Turkmen, and other ethnic and \nreligious minorities in the region.\n  Last night, with my Republican colleague Senator Kirk, I cochaired \nthe first meeting of the Senate Human Rights Caucus. We heard from \nrepresentatives from Iraq's minority communities in a conversation that \nfocused on ISIS's atrocities against innocent civilians simply because \nof who they are or how they worship. As we expand our campaign against \nISIS, we must continue to engage with the people of Iraq and Syria and \nthe region to learn from the past and continue to prevent massacres of \ninnocent men, women, and children. ISIS is a group\n\n[[Page S5533]]\n\nbent on the destruction of all people, of whatever background or \nreligion, who do not subscribe to their hateful ideology.\n  Our President is right. What makes the United States a global force \nfor good is that we are still willing to do what is hard because we \nknow it is right. That is the responsibility that comes from being a \nnation uniquely founded on principles of freedom, of liberty, of \njustice, and of having built one of the most capable and powerful \nmilitaries in the world, of being a nation and a people born of \nimmigrants who came from all over this world and who remain connected \nto it and touched by the things that happen in the far reaches of our \nglobe.\n  Last night President Obama addressed our Nation to make the case for \nexpanding military action against ISIS. Already, sadly, today there are \ncritics of his strategy, just as there have been over the past few \nweeks. In fact, in the 4 years I have served here, I have rarely seen a \nday in the Senate when the President isn't challenged, criticized, \nblocked, and harried by his opponents. There is always some way he \ncould have acted more quickly or with more strength. Critics claim we \nwould be better served by a sterner tone or a more eager finger on the \ntrigger. I must say I was struck when former Vice President Cheney this \npast week criticized President Obama's restraint, as he has throughout \nPresident Obama's tenure. I remind my friends we can do better--we \ncould do better--than to listen to the voices of those who misled this \ncountry into war in Iraq a decade ago, especially when it is clear they \nhave learned none of the lessons of that tragic strategic blunder. \nSurely, as we consider carefully taking expanded military action now, \nwe should applaud our President for proceeding with caution and \nhumility.\n\n  Critical to our current strategy and what sets it apart from some \npast actions is this fact: We are not going alone. Seeking to lead a \nmultilateral coalition is not leading from behind. It is not weakness. \nA muscular multilateralism is recognizing we are an indispensable \nnation, we are a leading nation, but we are not the only Nation that \nshould take on and tackle the challenge ISIS presents. Much of the \nallure of ISIS is the illusion they have created that the Muslim world \nis at war with the West, when the truth is ISIS does not reflect or \nrepresent Islam and ISIS has killed more Muslims than any other people. \nThe President's strategy of building a broad coalition of support, \nincluding across the Arab and Muslim world, is crucial to our success.\n  This is not just an American problem, it is a regional and global \nproblem, and it will not be solved without the hard work of those \nliving in the communities and countries most at risk, most affected, \nmost harmed by ISIS.\n  We cannot and should not do this alone. That is the only way this \nworks. It is a critical reason I support the President's strategy for \nexpanded action.\n  Central to this strategy's success is our military action as well as \ndiplomatic resources and pressure. Let's remember one of the reasons \nthis has even happened is because of the abject failure of Prime \nMinister Maliki and his Iraqi Government to act in a pluralistic, \ninclusive way, as he had pledged he would, and has instead acted more \nas a Shia warlord over the last few years, sewing the seeds of dissent \nand of disconnection with his Sunni citizens that created the very \nvacuum into which ISIS has charged.\n  That is why this administration's diplomatic efforts to build an \ninclusive Iraqi Government--to demand an inclusive Iraqi Government--\nhave been so important. We cannot defeat ISIS without Iraqis working \nhand in hand on the ground, and that requires a united Iraq whose \nfuture every Iraqi has a stake in preserving.\n  As we deepen our involvement, it is also necessary that we broaden \nour strategy. The fact is we cannot defeat ISIS by attacking it in Iraq \nalone. As we hit ISIS from the air, we also need to be cognizant of the \nfact that most of its strength and support is in Syria and that the \nboundary line dividing Iraq from Syria is today on the ground largely a \nfiction. So we need in Syria a strong and a moderate and an armed and a \ntrained Syrian opposition ready, willing, and able to fight ISIS on the \nground.\n  The President referred last night to our successful counterterrorism \nstrategy in several places in the world. Let me, as the cochair of the \nAfrican Affairs Subcommittee, briefly mention ways in which this \nstrategy in Syria is similar to what our strategy has been in Somalia \nin combating al-Shabaab, a deadly Al Qaeda affiliate, which has \ngoverned, ruled, and terrorized much of Somalia over the past decade. \nThere has been a similar strategy to the one articulated last night, \nwhere the United States has combined training, equipment, logistics, \nand tactical support with an African ground force drawn from Uganda, \nKenya, and Ethiopia, where those troops have done the hard work of \nretaking and holding territory while the Somali Government and security \nforces get reestablished.\n  In the case of Syria, Saudi Arabia has just stepped up and agreed to \nprovide the facilities, the funding, and the space to train and equip \nSyrian coalition fighters.\n  In Congress, we must act swiftly and decisively to support that \ntraining and equipment mission that the President has asked us to \nsupport by granting our President the authority and funding he needs.\n  Air strikes could happen soon, and we cannot make the mistake of \ntaking out ISIS while giving Bashar al-Assad, the dictator who still \nterrorizes Syria, the opportunity to rush in. By helping build a \ncohesive, trained, and equipped moderate Syrian opposition, we can help \nprevent the expansion of ISIS and the Assad regime.\n  In the long run, in Syria and in Iraq, it is Syrians--moderate \nSyrians--who must retake their country from ISIS and undertake the very \ndifficult and daunting challenge of rebuilding a stable and inclusive \nand hopefully someday peaceful society, after decades of dictatorship \nand more than 3 years of a withering civil war. The United States and \nSyria's neighbors and the entire international community need to be \ninvested and engaged to help them along this difficult path.\n  We need to be direct with the American people. This is not going to \nbe easy and it is not going to be swift. We must ensure our military \nhas the resources it needs to carry out this mission. As President \nObama said last night, the lives of brave American pilots and \nservicemembers will be put at risk. But we must also be clear. In their \ncourage and service, they will be part of an important effort to \neradicate from this Earth one of the greatest threats currently walking \nthe planet.\n  Last night President Obama asked for the support of the American \npeople as our Armed Forces and our partners begin in combination to \ncarry out this mission. Let me say, he has mine. I am committed to \nworking with my colleagues as later today all Senators attend a \nclassified briefing, an update on ISIS, and as next week committees in \nthis Senate hear testimony from Secretary of State Kerry and Secretary \nof Defense Hagel. I am committed to working with my colleagues and with \nChairman Menendez on the Foreign Relations Committee to review, \nconsider, draft, and approve an authorization for the use of military \nforce when submitted to us by the President that gives Congress an \nappropriate role in oversight and the President the authorization he \nneeds.\n  We need to do everything we can together to ensure that ISIS will be \nstopped. It has already shown itself, demonstrating its capability to \ncommit unspeakable crimes. If left unchecked, these terrorists will \nspread their reach beyond our ability to stop them. We cannot let that \nhappen. As my colleagues discuss and debate this mission, I only ask \nthat we leave the politics of the moment out of it. With an election \nsoon upon us, the temptation is strong to use every opportunity to \nachieve any short-term partisan advantage. But this is too important. \nToo much is at stake.\n  Today all over this country we call to mind and honor the sacrifices \nof Americans who served and those who lost their lives 13 years ago \ntoday. We must consider this new mission with the utmost gravity, \nhumility, and caution. I am eager then to work with my colleagues here \nin the Senate and with the administration in a bipartisan way as we \nmove forward to take on the difficult task of defeating ISIS and \nstrengthening the forces of inclusion\n\n[[Page S5534]]\n\nand moderation in Iraq and Syria. I urge my colleagues to work together \nto support this mission every step of the way.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WALSH. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n              Suicide Prevention For American Veterans Act\n\n  Mr. WALSH. Mr. President, I rise today to remember September 11, \n2001.\n  We all know the changes that came out of that terrible day. I watched \nthe events unfold with my colleagues at the Montana National Guard, and \nwe all knew it would change the course of America's long-term military \nstrategy. That is what I want to talk about today, the victories, the \nconsequences, and the true costs of sending America's men and women to \ndefend our country.\n  In the 13 years that have passed since that awful day, we have \nexperienced more tragedy and adversity. What hasn't changed is how as a \nnation we triumph over adversity. Throughout our history, Americans \nhave united to face our biggest challenges.\n  Past and present, the need to work together to support each other, to \nlift each other, and to inspire each other is what makes the United \nStates a nation that triumphs over adversity.\n  Our Nation is not living up to the promises we made to the men and \nwomen we sent to war following the attacks of 13 years ago. The \nPresident and Congress have stepped up to provide more direction and \nmore resources to the VA and to the Defense Department. We are \naddressing the unacceptable waiting times, and we have taken steps to \nimprove the services our veterans have earned.\n  But when it comes to the health care of our Nation's veterans, we \nstill have a long way to go. Twenty-two veterans die each day by \nsuicide. Let me say that again. Twenty-two veterans die each day by \nsuicide. It is simply intolerable. Imagine. If 22 servicemembers were \ndying each day on the battlefield, our Nation would act.\n  Too many veterans have returned to their homes, to their families, to \ntheir communities changed people. They are suffering from the unseen \nwounds of war: PTSD, traumatic brain injury, and post-concussion \nsyndrome. As the only Member of this body who has fought in Iraq, I can \nstate these unseen wounds are real.\n  Our Nation's veterans and their families are crying out for help. \nThey are suffering, many of them in silence and isolation, and we must \nprovide them with the support they have earned from the grateful Nation \nthey fought to protect.\n  One of the first bills I introduced when I came to the Senate was the \nSuicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, the SAV Act. With the \npartnership from the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the bill \nnow has bipartisan support in the Senate and a companion bipartisan \nbill in the House.\n  Veterans who suffer from unseen wounds of war need access to \nspecialized mental health care in order to be properly treated. In \nMontana, many veterans live in rural or frontier areas where access to \nmental health care means long journeys and long wait times.\n  In August, President Obama unveiled an important Executive order to \ntackle the challenge of helping our Nation's veterans better adjust to \ncivilian life so that no veteran ever feels as if they are left alone. \nThe President's action was a win for veterans and their families. This \naction included several elements of the SAV Act, including better \nstandardization between the Department of Defense and the VA with \nregard to prescription medication, improved health record sharing \nbetween agencies, greater training to identify veterans at risk of \nsuicide, a new focus on recruiting more mental health care providers to \nhelp our veterans and servicemembers, and important accountability \nmeasures to track the success of the VA's mental health care programs.\n  Recently, Secretary Hagel announced that the Department of Defense \nwill more fully consider service-related PTSD when evaluating a \nveteran's petition to upgrade his or her discharge status.\n  All of these are the right steps in the right direction. But even \nwith the President's important actions, there is still more we need to \ndo to prevent suicide among our veterans. One essential component of \nthe SAV Act addresses the need to extend combat eligibility.\n  PTSD can take years to manifest. We owe it to the men and women who \nreturn from combat to give them more time to come forward to receive \ntreatment. Under this bill, veterans who have returned from conflicts \ncan seek treatment for PTSD up to 15 years after returning home. I am \ncommitted to lengthening this eligibility time, which is currently only \n5 years.\n  The SAV Act would also require the review of wrongful discharges for \ntroops who struggle with mental health issues. Behavioral health issues \nare often caused by invisible wounds, and troops who have service-\nconnected mental health problems may have been discharged incorrectly \nor cut off from the benefits and support they need to heal.\n  As we observe National Suicide Prevention Week and the horrific \nevents of 9/11, we must remember our men and women who served our \nNation so honorably. We must remember the sacrifice they made to defend \nus, and for many of them the sacrifices they continue to make after \ntheir return to civilian life. Our veterans deserve our support and we \nhave a responsibility as a country to provide it.\n  Today I ask my colleagues to join me in the fight to live up to the \npromises this country has made to our veterans.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask to be recognized to speak as in \nmorning business for such time as I may consume and engage in a \ncolloquy with my colleague from South Carolina, Senator Graham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  ISIS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Today, Senator Graham and I, on the 13th anniversary of \nthe attacks of September 11, 2001--this anniversary--sadly, and \nunfortunately, we cannot agree and we cannot say, as President Obama \ndid last night, that America is safer.\n  In fact, in many respects, America is in more danger than at any time \nsince the end of the Cold War. We look around the world at the \nchallenges, the aggression, the provocations, and the continued \nslaughter of innocent Ukrainians.\n  It is a classic example of what happens when the United States of \nAmerica decides to withdraw from the world and create a vacuum. That \nvacuum is filled by the forces of evil, innocents throughout the world \nsuffer, and America's security is threatened.\n  So I strongly disagree--and I believe that most objective observers \nwould strongly disagree--with the President's assertion last night that \nAmerica is safer. By no objective measurement is America safer. In \nfact, when we look at Twitter and Facebook, we will see that ISIS is \nthreatening the United States of America and urging others to come to \nthe United States of America and attack the United States of America.\n  Yesterday, from a hearing before the Department of Homeland Security, \nit was very clear that our border is not secure. That is a recipe for \nat least attempts by those of ISIS who have dedicated themselves to the \ndestruction of the United States of America to be made possible.\n  Mr. Baghdadi, the head of ISIS, was once a resident in the U.S.-run \nprison camp in Iraq called Camp Bucca. He spent 4 years there and then \nleft. On his way out he said to his American captures: ``I'll see you \nguys in New York.'' I am not making that up. He said: ``I'll see you \nguys in New York.'' The leader of ISIS, Mr. Baghdadi's message has \nbeen: Attack and destroy the United States of America.\n\n[[Page S5535]]\n\n  So, no, Mr. President, America is not safer. In fact, because of a \nfeckless foreign policy, America is in greater danger than it has been, \nin some respects, in my lifetime--not in all but in some.\n  The fact is the President of the United States sees ISIS as some kind \nof terrorist organization. It is not. ISIS is a terrorist army. ISIS \nhas the largest area in history of wealth, of military equipment and \ncapability than of any terrorist organization in history, and they \nspread in an area larger than the size of the State of Indiana.\n  I would like to say the President got some things right in his speech \non ISIS. He seems to have read the op-ed piece my colleague Senator \nGraham and I wrote in the New York Times 2 weeks ago because he adopted \nmost of our proposals--most but not all.\n  The President compared his plan to the counterterrorism approach he \nhas taken in Somalia and Yemen. It is so disturbing to think that a \nstrategy against ISIS would be the same as against Al Qaeda in Somalia \nand Yemen. There are terrorist organizations in Somalia and Yemen and, \nyes, we have been killing with drones, but we have by no means defeated \nthem.\n  To compare what ISIS has done and the slaughter that ISIS is carrying \nout to the terrorist organizations in Somalia and Yemen reflects a \nfundamental misunderstanding on the part of the President of the United \nStates of the threat that we face.\n  The problem also is that even Al Qaeda has not been defeated in those \ncountries. The President says he wants to degrade and defeat the way \nthey are attacking Al Qaeda in Yemen and Somalia--but they are not \ndefeated.\n  So what the President proposed last night can possibly, if done \ncorrectly, degrade ISIS, but it can't destroy ISIS. And we must destroy \nISIS. Sooner or later, according to our heads of intelligence--whether \nit be the Director of the CIA or the Director of the FBI or the \nSecretary of Homeland Security--they want to attack the United States. \nTheir goal is to attack the United States of America.\n  So let's start with what the President got right. He described the \nright goal: to degrade and to ultimately destroy ISIS. He called for \nexpanding air strikes, to go on offense against ISIS. He explained the \nneed to hit ISIS both in Iraq and Syria. He called for training and \narming moderate Syrian opposition forces, and he described elements of \na comprehensive strategy--diplomatic, economic, and military--all of \nwhich Senator Graham and I have long championed.\n  He talked about the formation of a coalition--his Secretary of State \nhas said he wanted as many as 40 nations. So far there are 9, and the \ninteresting thing is there is not a single Middle Eastern country that \nhas joined this so-called coalition.\n  Why is that? Is it because they are not afraid of ISIS? Of course \nthey are afraid of ISIS. But they don't trust the United States of \nAmerica. I hear that directly from leaders all over the Middle East.\n  They don't trust us because of the President's bungling, incredibly \nbad decision after he once said that if Syria crossed certain reds \nlines and used chemical weapons, then we would respond. They crossed \nthat line. He then said we were going to respond, and then, after a 45-\nminute walk with his chief of staff, he announced to the world that we \nwere not going to strike; he was going to Congress, knowing full well \nhe would not get that permission from Congress. That nuance was lost on \ncountries in the Middle East that were prepared to join us with air \nstrikes into Syria.\n\n  So it is not surprising. It is not surprising at all that so far the \nPresident and his Secretary of State have been unable to convince any \nof these Middle Eastern countries--and we need them. We need them very \nbadly.\n  One of the main things the President didn't say and should have said \nis that he recognizes he made a mistake. Every President has made \nmistakes. Certainly George W. Bush did in Iraq. He at least had the \ncourage to fire his Secretary of Defense and adopt the surge which \nbasically stabilized Iraq. It had stabilized Iraq--before we made the \ndecision not to do so.\n  Every one of the President's military advisers--the smartest people \nthat any of us know: General Petraeus, General Keen, General Allen--I \ncould go down the list--argued strenuously for leaving a residual force \nbehind. The President of the United States decided not to. Now we are \ntrying to rewrite history and say: Well, the President really wanted \nto.\n  Find me one statement the President of the United States made \npublicly that he wanted to leave a residual force behind, and I can \nfind you 50 where he bragged about the last combat troop had left Iraq \nand we had left a safe, stable, prosperous Iraq behind--a lot of \nhowlers about how well we had done in Iraq.\n  If we had left a residual force, the situation in Iraq would not be \nwhere it is today, which allowed Iraqi security forces to weaken, \nsquandered our influence in Iraq, and harmed our ability to check Prime \nMinister Maliki's worst instincts.\n  Then there is his failure to support and arm the Free Syrian Army 2 \nyears ago. I have been in Syria. I know how brave these people are. I \nknow how disappointed they were when we failed to arm and equip them.\n  Two years ago, his entire national security team--including his \nSecretary of State, Secretary Clinton--strongly urged the President of \nthe United States to arm, train, and equip the Free Syrian Army. The \nPresident of the United States turned them down. The President of the \nUnited States overruled the unanimous opinion of his national security \nteam. That, my friends, was a huge impact--again giving rise to ISIS, \ngiving Bashar al-Assad the ability and capability to slaughter innocent \nSyrians.\n  It breaks my heart that 192,000 Syrians have been massacred by Bashar \nal-Assad. He continues to drop these barrel bombs which are horrible \nkillers.\n  Bashar al-Assad continues to have 150,000 Syrians dying in his prison \ncamps.\n  I wish every American could see those pictures that were smuggled out \nof the tortured, killed, and starved-to-death Syrians--192,000 of them. \nWe could have turned that around 2 years ago.\n  Then 3 years ago was when the President of the United States said: It \nis not a matter of whether Bashar al-Assad is leaving. It is a matter \nof when. He also said 3 years ago: It is time for Bashar Assad to \nleave.\n  Yet Bashar Assad today continues to slaughter innocent men, women, \nand children. Millions of refugees have fled the country. The horrors \nof this butchering continue, and what changed?\n  One aspect that changed the battlefield equation, when the President \nof the United States said it is not a matter of if but when, was when \nIran--which some now are asking us to work with--sent in Hezbollah--\n5,000 of them from Lebanon--and it changed the momentum on the \nbattlefield.\n  Senator Lindsey Graham and I were called over to the White House. We \nwent in to meet the President, after the President had said that he was \ngoing to strike Syria. We sat there, and the President looked us in the \neye and he said, I want to do three things: degrade Bashar Assad, \nupgrade the Free Syrian Army, and change the battlefield equation.\n  Senator Graham and I, taking his word for it, went out in the \ndriveway and said: We are backing the President of the United States.\n  Several days later, without being notified, we were stunned to read \nthat the President had changed his mind. He had not told us the truth \nin the Oval Office. That is a unique experience for me, where I have \nbeen in the Oval Office under many Presidents.\n  I am confident the steps the President laid out last night can \ndegrade ISIS. But that is not sufficient to protect our people. We need \nSpecial Forces and advisers on the ground.\n  The President continues to say there will be no boots on the ground. \nThere are 1,700 boots on the ground right now. There will be more boots \non the ground, but they won't be in the form of combat units. If we are \nreally going to defeat ISIS, we are going to need close air support, \nforward air controllers, intelligence capability, Special Forces, and \nmany others. We will soon have more than 1,500 there, and there will \nhave to be more.\n\n  Tell the American people the truth, Mr. President. Those young men \nand women are going there, they are going to be in harm's way, and they \nare going to be exposed to combat. Tell the\n\n[[Page S5536]]\n\nAmerican people the truth. We need to do a lot more.\n  I wish to mention one other aspect before I turn to my friend from \nSouth Carolina, who was with me in 2008 at a townhall meeting.\n  A man stood up at the town hall meeting and said: Senator McCain, how \nlong are we going to be in Iraq?\n  I said: We may be in Iraq for a long, long time because although we \nhave sustained this situation and we have stabilized it--that was after \nthe surge had been implemented and succeeded--it is very fragile. We \nare going to have to leave a residual force behind--as we did in Japan, \nin Germany, Korea, Bosnia, where we have left residual forces behind \nfor the sake of stability.\n  Well, in case any of my colleagues have forgotten, I was pilloried: \nMcCain wants to stay in Iraq.\n  Yes, I wanted a residual force in Iraq--not to engage in combat but \nto provide stability, intelligence, and other capabilities. Now we know \nwhat happened when we left Iraq. Now we know the consequences.\n  I hope all those people who called me all of the names which I am not \ngoing to repeat here will render an apology, because I was right. I \nsaid that if we left Iraq completely, then we risked the great danger \nof it deteriorating.\n  I say to my colleagues, the situation today didn't have to be this \nway. None of the challenges we now face in Iraq and Syria had to be \nthis dire. The rise of ISIS did not have to happen. We have lost too \nmuch time and missed too many opportunities. But we can still defeat \nour terrorist enemies, and we must protect our people and our partners \nand secure our national interests in the Middle East.\n  The President's plan, if he implements it--if he understands that \nthis is not Yemen and Somalia, if he understands that this is a direct \nthreat to the United States of America, if he comes to Congress and \nasks for--not welcomes, but asks for--debate and amendments and votes \nthat show the American people's representatives will support them in \nthis effort, then I think we have a chance of succeeding. But I have to \ntell my colleagues I am not very optimistic from the start I saw last \nnight.\n\n  I would like to yield to my colleague from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you. If I may, this is the anniversary of 9/11. \nThirteen years ago on this date our country was attacked by radical \nIslamists who don't want your car, they don't want your bank account, \nthey don't want your television. They are not criminals. They want to \ndestroy your way of life. And the sooner we come to grips with the fact \nthat there are people like this still out there, the better off we will \nbe.\n  It is hard for the average American to understand why people think \nthis way. I can't explain it. I have been to the Mideast more times \nthan I can count, and I promise you there are plenty of devout Muslims \nwho worship according to the Muslim faith, the Islamic faith, who would \nhave plenty of places for me and you to reside in this world without \nfear. There are plenty of people--the vast majority of people of that \nfaith we could live with in peace. But there is a strain called radical \nIslam that would kill every moderate Muslim, kill every Christian, \ndestroy the State of Israel, and would kill as many of us as they could \nif somebody doesn't stop them.\n  Thirteen years ago close to 3,000 Americans were killed in the \nattacks on our country by the bin Laden group. The only reason it was \nclose to 3,000 and not 3 million is because they couldn't get the \nweapons to kill 3 million of us. If they could, they would.\n  So what do we do? We have to keep them away from those weapons. We \nhave to keep the war over there so it doesn't come back here. And we \nneed allies. I am here to tell you that contrary to what I hear in my \nown party, most people in Syria have two things in common: They don't \nlike Assad and they sure don't like ISIL. If you don't believe that \nabout Syria, you really don't know much about Syria.\n  This whole enterprise in Syria started when people demanded to be \nfree from the dictator. Our lack of attention in not responding to the \nneeds of those Syrians who would have defeated Assad and lived in peace \nwith us has cost us greatly.\n  Three years ago Senator McCain said: It is in our national security \ninterest to side with the Free Syrian Army to get rid of Assad because \nhe is the guy who helped kill Americans during the Iraq war. He is the \nguy who is cozy with Iran.\n  We had them on the ropes. The Free Syrian Army was about to beat \nAssad, and then in came 3,000 to 5,000 Hezbollah fighters--Iranian-\ninspired militia from Lebanon--and the Russians doubled down, we \nwithdrew our support, and the army eventually collapsed. That happened \nsimultaneously with a decision by President Obama--President Obama's \ndecision to withdraw all of our troops from Iraq. We disengaged from \nIraq. We had no presence there, and the rest is history.\n  About the speech last night, what bothered me the most was the way it \nstarted. The President tried to tell us that as a nation we are safer \ntoday than we have ever been. Do you believe that? I don't. There are \nmore terrorist organizations with more money, more capability, and more \nweapons to attack our homeland than existed before 9/11. We are not \nsafer than we were before 9/11, and that is an unfortunate fact.\n  The President also said this operation against ISIL will be like \nother CT--counterterrorism--operations over the last 5 or 6 years. No, \nit will not. This is not a small group of people running around with \nAK-47s; this is a full-blown army. They were going to defeat the \nKurdish Peshmerga--a pretty tough fighting group--if we hadn't \nintervened. To underestimate how hard this will be will bite us.\n  Mr. President, please square. Be honest with the American people \nabout what we face. Somebody has to beat this army. This is not a small \ngroup of terrorists. They have howitzers, they have tanks, and they are \nflush with money. They are getting fighters from all over the world. \nBut they can and will be defeated, and they must be defeated.\n  To the family members who remember this as the day their lives were \nturned upside down, you will always be in my thoughts and prayers, like \neverybody else in the country. This is a day for most of us to remember \nwith sadness, and it is a hurtful day, but if it were one of your \nfamily members who lost their life that day, it would be the day your \nlife was turned upside down.\n  There are four other Americans who died on September 11 whom I won't \nforget--Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Ty Woods, and Glen Doherty. They \ndied 2 years ago in Benghazi. I am not going to forget them or their \nfamilies, and we are going to get to the bottom of what happened in \nBenghazi. That is my commitment to you.\n  How do we move forward?\n  Mr. President, if you need my blessing to destroy ISIL, you have it. \nIf you need to follow them to the gates of hell, I will send you a \nnote--go for it. If you need Congress to authorize your actions, let me \nknow. You say you don't. I agree with you, but if it makes us stronger \nfor this body to vote in support of your plan to destroy ISIL, I will \ngive you my vote. But here is what I expect in return: your full \ncommitment to me.\n  I am tired of half measures. I am tired of misleading the American \npeople about what we face. There is no way in hell we are going to beat \nthese guys without an American ground component in Iraq and Syria. \nThere is not a force in the Mideast that can take these guys on and win \nwithout substantial American help. We don't need the 82nd Airborne, but \nwe are going to need thousands of troops over time on the ground \nholding the hands of the Arab armies that are going to do the fighting \nalong with the Syrians to make sure we will win.\n  One thing I can promise the American people: If we take ISIL on and \nlose, we will unlock the gates of hell, and hell will come our way.\n  This is the last best chance to get this right, Mr. President. You \nmade plenty of mistakes, and so have I, and so has Senator McCain.\n  And Senator McCain, nobody is going to apologize to you. I think they \nshould, but they are not. I am not looking for anybody to apologize. We \nhave all made mistakes. This is the time to do some soul-searching as a \nnation. You and I can do some soul-searching.\n\n  Those who have not seen the threat for what it is, all I ask of you \nis to be willing to embrace reality.\n\n[[Page S5537]]\n\n  All I am asking of President Obama is to do what President Bush did: \nChange your tactics and your strategy because it is not working.\n  Senator McCain and I went to the White House during the Bush years, \nand we told President Bush: This is not a few dead-enders, Mr. \nPresident. It is not working in Iraq. You don't have enough troops. And \nif we don't change course, you are going to lose the country.\n  To his credit, he went from training and advising the Iraqi Army to a \nfull-blown counterinsurgency strategy, taking the fight to the enemy in \nthe surge led by GEN David Petraeus, and it did work. That was an \nadmission by President Bush that he had gotten it wrong and he had to \nchange course.\n  Every President and every Senator makes mistakes. History judges you \nnot by the mistakes you make but by what you learn from them.\n  Here is what I ask of the President: Quit caveating everything. Look \nthe enemy in the eye and say, ``We will destroy you'' and stop. Look \nthe American people in the eye and say, ``We have to win. We will win. \nAnd I will do what is necessary to win.'' Come to the Congress and say, \n``We are in this together.''\n  The American military is tired, but they are not too tired to defend \nthis country. If you had a bunch of them in front of you and you asked \nthem to follow you--``Would you go to Iraq and Syria to fight ISIL?''--\nthey would say ``Send me tomorrow'' because they know what these people \nwill do to the rest of us. Why do they serve over and over again? Why \ndo they go to Iraq three and four times, Afghanistan three and four \ntimes? They have seen the enemy up close. They know what comes our way \nif we lose.\n  So this is the day to reflect as a nation. I am so sorry that 13 \nyears after 9/11 we are having to deal with greater threats than before \n9/11. Fifty years from now, long after I am gone, there is going to be \nan American soldier somewhere in Africa or the Middle East helping \nindigenous populations fight radical Islam. But over time, just as sure \nas I am standing here, radical Islam will fall because--here is the \ntruth--what they are selling, most people don't want to buy. They don't \nhave the capacity yet by themselves to stand and stare these people \ndown.\n  As to Americans who are frustrated with the pace of democracy in the \nMideast and who believe those people can't do this, all I ask you to do \nis to pick up an American history book. Within the first 100 years of \nour country, we were at war with Canada and Mexico. Within the first \n100 years of our country, we were at war with ourselves, and it started \nin my State.\n  This is not easy. It is not easy to this day. To expect people who \nhave lived under brutal dictatorships and had their society divided and \ndestroyed for decades to get to where we are in 12 or 13 years is \nunrealistic.\n  Here is the hope for me. There is good news. There is plenty of will \nthroughout the world to stand up to radical Islam. Our goal is to \nprovide capacity to that will. Sometimes it will be with American \nsoldiers; sometimes it will be clean drinking water; a small health \ncare clinic that you wouldn't send your child to for 5 minutes that \nwill save lives in Africa; a small schoolhouse where a young girl can \nget an education. If we are not willing to do these things over there, \nthey will come here.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If my colleague will yield for one question.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Absolutely.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I note the presence of our colleague from California, so \nI will make it short.\n  Last night I had an exchange with the former spokesperson for the \nWhite House, and again this issue came up and the assertion, the \nincredible assertion that it was the Iraqis who did not want to leave a \nresidual force behind--a statement that continues to amaze me, that \nanyone would believe such a thing, particularly given the circumstances \nwhich the Iraqis were left under, including--by the way, every single \none of our military leaders urged that we leave a residual force \nbehind, and many of them, such as General Keen, General Petraeus, and \nothers, predicted what would happen if we pulled everybody out.\n  I wonder if for the record the Senator from South Carolina would \nrelate the experience we had in Iraq and our personal experience with \nregard to the issue of residual force behind.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I remember getting a phone call from then-Secretary \nClinton asking me and Senator McCain and Senator Levin to go to Iraq \nand see if we could intervene and help the Iraqis make a decision about \na residual force because we thought it was in our interest.\n  President Obama has always looked at this issue as fulfilling a \ncampaign promise. He got the answer he wanted, which was zero. The \nmilitary told him we needed some people, but he really was intent on \nending the war in Iraq.\n  Here is the problem: Without a residual force, we have lost \neverything we fought for. When we met with Barzani, Allawi, and \nMalaki, I was convinced they were willing to accept an American follow-\non force; we just had to put it on the table in a way that it mattered.\n\n  When we were talking to Malaki, they said: Senator Graham, how many \ntroops are we talking about?\n  I turned to General Austin and our then-Ambassador Jeffrey and said: \nHow many?\n  He said: We are still working on that.\n  We went from 18,000 recommended by General Austin--the last time I \ngot a number from the White House, it was below 3,000. This cascading \ndownward from 18,000 to below 3,000 was not because the Iraqis said it \nwas too many; it was because the White House couldn't pick a number \nbecause they didn't want to stay. It is about as accurate to say the \nIraqis didn't want us to stay as it is to say the President never \ncalled ISIS a JV team. The President did, but he is trying to rewrite \nthat statement because it looks pretty naive.\n  Look forward. Let's beat on the Republicans for a minute. The \nRepublican Party--the party of Ronald Reagan--embraced sequestration. \nFor those who don't know what I am talking about, it is a budget \nproposal that will gut our military over the next decade. We have the \nsmallest Army since 1940, the smallest Navy since 1950, and the \nsmallest Air Force in modern history. Republicans embraced that \nconcept.\n  If we want to defeat ISIL, we better change sequestration because we \nare about to gut the military at the time we need it most. There is \nplenty of blame to go around here.\n  Here is the key for me: We as a nation have one last chance to get \nthis right.\n  I will make the same offer to President Obama that I made to \nPresident Bush: If you come up with a strategy that makes sense and you \nare understanding and learning from your mistakes, as I try to learn \nfrom mine, I will be there with you.\n  There was not much help coming from our friends on the other side \nwhen Iraq was bad. Bush got absolutely no support when his mistakes \ncame back to haunt him. I will not make that mistake.\n  The mistakes President Obama has made are real, and they have to be \ncorrected. If the President will correct them, I will stand with him no \nmatter what the polls show about troops on the ground. And I know how \nthe President stands with South Carolinians--not very well. It is not \nabout the President; it is not about this Senator; it is about us.\n  So on this September 11 anniversary, I make an offer to my Commander \nin Chief, Barack Obama: If you will destroy ISIL and mean it, you will \nhave an ally in Senator McCain and Senator Graham.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 3 \nminutes, followed by Senator Merkley, who will speak for 8 minutes, \nfollowed by Senator Vitter, who will speak for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           The War on Terror\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I watched every word of the President's \naddress to the Nation last night, and I have this to say to him: Thank \nyou for your clarity. Thank you for taking the time you needed to put \nthe pieces together so that we don't march into another Iraq war.\n  When I hear my colleagues--cheerleaders for the war in Iraq who told \nus\n\n[[Page S5538]]\n\nit would be over in 6 months--come down here and try to lecture this \nPresident on how to deal with ISIL, I get the chills. When I watch Dick \nCheney come up here to talk to House Republicans and lecture them about \nhow they had it right--had it right? They couldn't have had it more \nwrong. Because we know that the tragedy of 9/11--and as we revere the \nheroes and mourn the loss of those on that horrific day--was an attack \nby Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. It wasn't Iraq and Saddam Hussein.\n  Our then-President Bush turned around--he could have had the whole \nworld in his hand--but instead marches into Iraq. Thank the Lord I \nvoted no on that. I voted yes to going after bin Laden and no to going \ninto Iraq.\n  All those sunny predictions--of the war being only 6 months, and they \nwill have democracy, and we will get the oil and the money, and the \nrest--turned out to be the worst foreign policy disaster. These same \npeople who backed that war now come down here and tell the President: \nLook me in the eye and tell me you want to do exactly what I want to \ndo.\n  Well, Mr. President, since they addressed you, I want to address you. \nFirst, I thank you for taking your time in putting together a winning \nstrategy to defeat ISIL. We have to. We cannot sit by and watch a group \nwith tens of thousands of members who are vicious and trained--some \nforeign, some I believe from this country--go around and behead people \nwho won't convert. They want territory. They want to make their own \nstate. We have to stop them with the world, with combat boots that are \ncombat boots of those in the region, such as we are seeing in Iraq, and \nwe will see in Syria if we give the President the funds he wants to \ntrain the moderate Syrians.\n  Here is the deal from me: We are going to go after ISIL, we are going \nto do it with a coalition of the world, we are not going to have a \ndrumbeat of going back into the Iraq war. This is a counterterrorism \nmission, and I voted for that when I voted to go after Osama bin Laden. \nI believe the President has this authority.\n  I also have no problem with voting to put my feelings right there and \nI would be happy to take that vote. But beware of the people here who \nwere the cheerleaders of the Iraq war who want to get this President to \nnow say he is going to put combat boots on the ground. That is the \nwrong recipe. We already learned that. There are 4,000 dead Americans \nand tens of thousands wounded.\n  Let's do this the right way and the way the President laid it out--\nwith a coalition. Let's not make any of the same mistakes.\n  So, Mr. President, please keep on track--and Secretary Kerry--and \nkeep building that coalition. We already have nine nations and NATO and \nthe Arab League, and we are going to get the U.N. That is the way to \ngo.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor to Senator \nMerkley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I rise to address an issue affecting millions of \nfamilies across America, and that is our rising student loan debt and \nthe impact it is having on the vision of opportunity for every single \nAmerican. As college students return to campus this fall, they are \nthinking about their hopes and dreams for the future, but increasingly, \nthey are also thinking about how that future might be constrained by \nthe debt load they will carry by the time they graduate.\n  Education is the key to the pathway for the American dream. When I \nwas young, my father took me to the schoolhouse doors and he said: \n``Those are the doors to opportunity. If you study hard, you can do or \nbe just about anything here in America.''\n  My father was a millwright, a mechanic who keeps the sawmill \noperating. The vision he had for America and the vision that I have for \nAmerica is that every child should have the opportunity to thrive \nwhether you are the son and daughter of a CEO or you are the son and \ndaughter of a millwright. But the cost of college and the consequential \nstudent loan debt is diminishing, degrading, and destroying that \nvision.\n  I was the first in my family to go to college. I never dreamed I \nwould have the chance to end up in this esteemed Chamber fighting for \nthe vision of the American dream, but throughout my service in the \nSenate, that is exactly what I will do. It is the heart of what our \nNation is about. It is the ``We, the People's'' vision, not the few and \npowerful's vision, but the ``We, the People's'' vision of our \nConstitution, that everyone should have the opportunity to thrive.\n  Today we are competing in a national and world economy that is much \nmore knowledge based. It is a global knowledge economy, and we have to \nbe able to compete, and that often means a path to career technical \neducation and a path to college. But for too many young folks today, \nthe doors to college are looking a little less like doors to \nopportunity and a little more like trapdoors. They see those doors and \nthey are not sure they see opportunity and mobility. They are concerned \nthey see a lifetime of unaffordable and inescapable debt.\n  I live in a blue-collar community, and I hear this all the time--\nparents wrestling with whether their children should incur the debt \nnecessary to go to college, knowing that debt might be the size of a \nhome mortgage and will be hung around their neck like a millstone and \nthat possibly their monthly wages will not even be enough to pay the \nloan payments. The prospect of a high level of debt and low level of \npay has parents sending a different message to their children--not the \nmessage my parents gave to me, that everyone has the opportunity to \nthrive in America, even from our blue-collar community. They are \nsending the message to their kids that the path of opportunity is being \ndiminished by the enormous debt load and cost of college.\n  This situation is unacceptable. It is a threat to the future of our \nchildren, and it is certainly a threat to our economy. The economies \nthat thrive in the world are the ones where the students have the \neducation to compete in the global economy, and that is certainly \ndestroying the aspirational vision of America--the American dream. \nThere is a lot we can do to take on this challenge. We are not helpless \nin this effort. We must control the galloping costs and galloping \ninflation of tuition. We need to invest more in our community colleges \nbecause it is the most cost-effective portion of our higher education \nsystem. We need to enhance the bridges between our community colleges \nand our 4-year colleges and our high schools. We need to make sure \nstudents have the opportunity to get some college credit in high school \nthrough AP classes, the cheapest possible place to get that credit, and \nthat gives them a step up in their route to college so they can see \nthat vision and that path.\n  We should explore new models of financing, such as the pay-it-forward \nmodel, that would eliminate the fears students have between high debt \nand low pay. When Pell grants are not enough, when the job you carry at \ncollege is not enough, when tuition is too high and students of modest \nmeans still need loans, then those loans should be at the minimum \npossible interest rate.\n  Loans should never be viewed, as they have been by my colleagues \nacross the aisle, as a source of profit to the U.S. Government. That \nvision is the wrong vision for America. That is why I so strongly \nsupport Senator Warren's proposal that our students get the same low \ninterest rate on their student loans that our big banks get when they \nborrow money from the Federal Reserve.\n  Moreover, we should enable every American to refinance their student \nloans, taking advantage of today's low interest rates.\n  In my home State of Oregon, there are 500,000 folks with student \nloans, many of them at high interest rates. These students would \nbenefit enormously from being able to refinance. Just as you can \nrefinance a mortgage or refinance a car, they should be able to \nrefinance those loans, and not only would that help those individuals a \nlot--500,000 people in a State of about 3.7 million, which is a lot of \npeople--but the additional purchasing power they have would enable them \nto contribute to the economy and raise everyone up, making them more \nlikely to buy a house, for example.\n  Did you know that for the first time we have a situation where those \nyoung adults 25 through 30 who have gone to college and have graduated \nare less likely to own a home than are high\n\n[[Page S5539]]\n\nschool graduates? The reason is simple: They are burdened by massive \nstudent debt that doesn't give them the credit standing and income \nnecessary to buy a home. That shows how much is wrong.\n  So those individuals on this floor who are trapped in the few and \npowerful vision of America and have forgotten the first three words of \nthe Constitution--that we are fighting so we can enable every child to \nthrive--they need to rethink their position. They need to quit blocking \nthe bill that would allow every student to refinance their student \nloan.\n  Forty percent of graduates with student loans have delayed making a \nmajor purchase such as a car, 25 percent have put off continuing their \neducation or moved in with relatives to save money. In other words, \nthis is not an imaginary problem. This is extraordinary. It is real, \nand it is having a dramatic impact.\n  Let us give a fair shot for every child to thrive. Let us let every \nparent say to their children with confidence: If you go through the \ndoors of the schoolhouse and work hard, you can do just about anything \nhere in America.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n           Unanimous Consent Request--S.J. Res. 19 Amendment\n\n  Mr. VITTER. We have a significant proposal. It is a constitutional \namendment to rewrite the First Amendment to the Constitution, the first \nportion of the Bill of Rights, and it would fundamentally alter and \ntake away certain free speech rights of millions upon millions of \nAmericans--not a few, not a few ultrawealthy, but many Americans.\n  I have a real problem with that. I think it is misguided. Instead, I \nthink we should focus on other proposals and other provisions that can \naddress what we all see and feel and hear from our constituents. They \nsee a huge gap between Washington and the real world, Washington and \nMain Street U.S.A.\n  It is also unfortunate that this is, I believe, the first time in \nSenate history that we are debating a constitutional amendment on the \nfloor of the Senate with no opportunity so far--zero opportunity of \nfloor amendments. That is unheard of, and that is unfortunate.\n  That is why I wish to bring up two proposed floor amendments that I \nwill strongly support that go to the real problem in America--\nWashington placing itself up here, separate and apart, higher than the \nAmerican people in the real world.\n  The first idea was a floor amendment offered by my colleague Tom \nCoburn of Oklahoma. I strongly support it. I have the leading bill \nregarding this proposal in the Senate--term limits for Members of \nCongress. I believe this is a significant step, but it is one, \nunfortunately, necessary and long overdue because of the separation I \nhave described between Washington and the real world. Americans of all \npolitical parties, all backgrounds, all races think that Washington is \non a different planet and Members of Congress just don't get it because \nthey come here and ``go Washington.'' We need to get back to the best \ntraditions of our democracy, which include having true citizen \nlegislators, to come here, to serve, to represent their constituents, \nyes, but for a limited period of time, knowing absolutely they are \nreturning home after significant but limited service.\n\n  I strongly support Senator Coburn's amendment. I strongly support the \nsame provisions in my stand-alone bill. I urge Senator Reid to again \nopen the floor of the Senate. Let's have the process the Founders \nintended. Don't be the first U.S. Senate leader in history to shut down \nall amendments under a constitutional amendment under debate on the \nfloor.\n  The second proposal, which is a floor amendment I have at the desk, \nalso goes to the same concern of Washington living on a different \nplanet than real-world Americans, and it has to do with what I call the \nWashington exemption from ObamaCare. In the ObamaCare statute, we \nactually passed, through an amendment on the floor--through being able \nto pass a floor amendment--language that says every Member of Congress \nand all of our staff should be treated as all other Americans are \ntreated, who are forced to go to the so-called exchanges. We will go to \nthe exchanges for our health care--no special deal, no special \nexemption, no special subsidy, no special carve-out. Unfortunately, \nafter that floor amendment passed, after the overall bill passed, I \nguess some folks took Nancy Pelosi's advice that we have to pass the \nbill in order to read it.\n  So after the fact, some folks around here started to read it and they \ngot to that provision and they said, Oh, you-know-what; how are we \ngoing to deal with this? So a furious lobbying campaign began which \nresulted in President Obama issuing an Executive order--a special rule \nwhich is clearly illegal, in my opinion, because it is contrary to the \nstatute--to create special treatment, a special carve-out, a special \nsubsidy for Members of Congress and our staff. That is not right. We \nshould live by that original language passed right here on the Senate \nfloor in a floor amendment.\n  We should say, The first rule of American democracy should be that \nwhat Washington passes on America, it lives with itself, and we should \ntreat ourselves the same way as we treat other Americans who have to go \nto the exchanges under ObamaCare. That should be the first rule of \nAmerican democracy: What we pass for America, we live with ourselves, \nbecause that is the right thing to do. That is the right principle. \nAlso, for a very practical reason: Because sometimes the chefs in the \nkitchen should eat their own cooking, but sometimes that makes the \ncooking get a whole lot better. It is a very practical rule to follow.\n  I urge support for this proposal and I urge an open amendment process \nand a real debate which, unfortunately, heretofore has been completely \nshut down. I urge consideration of this amendment. I urge us to place \nourselves along with everyday Americans in how we are treated under \nObamaCare and everything else. I urge full debate and consideration of \nthe measure, and then passage of it.\n  To further that, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of S.J. Res. 19, that it be in order for my amendment No. \n3786 to be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Reserving the right to object, the Senate has heard the \nreasons for these objections before, but the fact is that staff and \nSenators are covered by the exact same plan that is offered under the \nexchange to millions of Americans. It works just as it has always \nworked before for employees here in the Senate, and, frankly, for \nmillions of employees in the private sector. Senate employees, House \nemployees pay their premiums and the employer picks up the employer \nshare--no different than it has always been before.\n  Specifically, the law doesn't allow for any employees here to take \nadvantage of the tax credits that are available to many other \nAmericans.\n  This is, of course, just another attempt to undermine the law that \nis, by every available metric, working. The uninsurance rate in this \ncountry is plummeting. Health care inflation is at a record low--\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I think there was an objection to my \nunanimous consent request, and I wish to reclaim the floor.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Outcomes are getting better, and for that reason, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, reclaiming the floor, as the Senator \nknows, it is simply not true that we are being treated on the exchange \nas other Americans are treated. That is flat out not true. No other \nAmerican at our income level is getting the huge subsidy that Members \nof Congress are getting--I am not accepting it--but that Members of \nCongress are getting under the President's illegal rule. No other \nAmerican in our country, no other American gets that deal, and that was \nnowhere mentioned and nowhere included in the amendment we passed on \nthis topic during the ObamaCare debate. So what the Senator says is \njust flat out misleading. If he wants to truly be treated as other \nAmericans are treated under the exchange, absolutely. That is what I am \nasking for. But don't pretend that\n\n[[Page S5540]]\n\npresent practice does that. It does exactly the opposite.\n  The American people are sick and tired of it. The American people are \nsick and tired of being put down as second class and Congress and \nWashington lifting itself up as above them. That is a fundamental thing \nthat is wrong with American democracy today. That is what my amendment \ngoes to with regard to treatment under ObamaCare. That is what Senator \nCoburn's amendment goes to with regard to term limits for Members of \nCongress.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Constitutional Amendment\n\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, September 11 should always be a day when we \nboth remember those who were tragically lost on this day in 2001 and \nsimultaneously reaffirm our solemn resolve to our country to keep \nAmerica free, to keep America strong.\n  I rise today for a third time in opposition to S.J. Res. 19, the \nmajority's Orwellian attempt to amend the Bill of Rights to permit the \ngovernment to decide who is allowed to speak about political matters.\n  Make no mistake, this is an attack on the First Amendment's single \nmost important protection. Under our Constitution, the government never \ngets to be the arbiter of permissible political debate--never, not \never. That is something we decided and we finally resolved back in \n1791. Of all the things the government might do, it should never, it \nmay never, it can never be the arbiter of what constitutes permissible \npolitical speech, of who gets to criticize the government, and how. \nThat can never happen--not in our land, not in this free land, not \never.\n  Yet, under this proposed constitutional amendment, the one that is \nbeing debated on the floor of the Senate right now, S.J. Res. 19, \nCongress and the States would be given the power not just to become \nthis kind of arbiter, not just to regulate this kind of speech, but to \npotentially prohibit churches, civic associations, labor unions, and \neven the ACLU from speaking about political matters. That is a shocking \nproposal, repugnant to our traditions, dangerous to our liberty, and \nutterly ineffective in combating corruption.\n  But what is even more shocking, quite frankly, is the manner in which \nan amendment to our Constitution has been debated on the floor of the \nSenate this week.\n  We have to remember our Founding Fathers painstakingly debated and \ndiscussed and crafted the text of the Constitution in Philadelphia for \nnearly 4 months. What we know today is the Bill of Rights was not even \nin James Madison's first draft. The first Congress extensively debated \nit. It eliminated objectionable parts, changed the language to better \nreflect Congress's consensus, and ultimately passed it and sent it out \nto the States for ratification. What we have seen this week, by \ncontrast, is nothing like that. The majority leader has refused to \npermit any amendments to be introduced or considered or voted upon by \nthis body--any amendments to S.J. Res. 19. Its language is not up for \ndiscussion, nor, in truth, is it really up for debate. In fact, \nironically, many of the same people who have signed their names to this \nlegislation, who have cosponsored it, who have supported it, have \nrefused even to come to the floor to speak about it. In fact, some of \nthose same people have been openly critical of the fact that the Senate \nis devoting time to debating this constitutional amendment, which would \nbe the first time we have ever made a change to the First Amendment, or \nto the Bill of Rights, since 1791.\n  The American people should be offended that the majority thinks this \nis how changes to the U.S. Constitution should be discussed by the \npeople's elected representatives in Washington. But watching the Senate \nthis week has been a useful lesson. The majority says Congress can be \ntrusted somehow to impose ``reasonable'' limits and ``reasonable'' \nrestrictions on political debate, on core political activity. Look no \nfurther than this debate occurring on the floor of this legislative \nbody to see what the majority thinks reasonable debate looks like. What \nit looks like here is a take-it-or-leave-it vote with no opportunity to \nprovide amendments, no opportunity for discussion about the intricate \ndetails of this proposal.\n  There was very little discussion. One of the reasons I find this \ndistressing in this particular circumstance is we are talking about \nwhat it is that enables the American people to remain in charge of \ntheir own form of government, of their own system of laws that affects \ntheir livelihood and will affect their day-to-day operations.\n  When we tinker with the processes that allow the American people to \nremain in control of their own government, we are playing with fire. \nUnder this proposed amendment, if it were somehow to pass by a two-\nthirds supermajority out of this body, if it were somehow to pass by a \ntwo-thirds supermajority out of the House of Representatives, if it \nwere somehow to be ratified by three-fourths of the States, and if it \nwere to become say the 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution, it \nwould dramatically change the balance of power, not between America's \ntwo leading political parties, not between one State versus another \nState but between Washington, DC, and the American people.\n  Under this amendment, if it were to become part of the U.S. \nConstitution, Congress could have the power to set up a system of rules \nthat would restrict many Americans and their ability to influence the \npolitical debate process. Under this proposed amendment, there is of \ncourse a carve-out that says it is there to protect freedom of the \npress. So presumably someone who owns a newspaper could still devote a \nlot of money, thousands of dollars, tens of thousands of dollars, maybe \nmillions or even tens of millions of dollars, to promoting the \ncandidate of her choice; that is, if she is fortunate to own a \nnewspaper company.\n  But if the owner of a newspaper company could do that, why not \nsomeone who chooses not to own a newspaper company or more likely \ncannot afford a newspaper company but wants to enter into a contract \nwith a newspaper company to run the political advertisement. Why should \nsomeone's ability to promote the candidate of her choice be restricted \nand limited on the basis of whether she owns a newspaper company? It \nshould not and nor should the American people be prohibited from \nentering into voluntary associations.\n  Most Americans are not wealthy enough to own a newspaper company or a \nradio broadcasting company or a television broadcasting company, but \nmany Americans, let's say thousands or tens of thousands at a time, \ncould pool their resources, each of them contributing what money they \nchoose to devote to political debate and discussion in order to promote \nthe candidates of their choice.\n  Why should they lack that opportunity, the same opportunity the owner \nof a newspaper company has, simply because they cannot afford to own a \nnewspaper company or a broadcast company? The fact is they should not.\n  The fact is there are many unanswered questions about this proposed \nconstitutional amendment, but all of those questions relate back to how \nwe debate issues. If the manner in which this proposed constitutional \namendment is presented is any indication about what this constitutional \namendment would do to debate in American society, it signals caution. \nIt signals to us that a chill wind blows if this is the direction in \nwhich we are looking.\n  You see, when the power of government expands, it does so at the \nexpense of individual freedom. When the power of government expands \nwithin the area of political speech, that is perhaps where the danger \nis at its greatest. That is perhaps where it comes at the greatest cost \nto the individual liberties of Americans because that affects not just \ntheir liberties but also their ability to control their own liberties \nin the future.\n  Because if they lack the capacity to decide who is in Washington \nrepresenting them, making decisions that will dictate the future of \ntheir government, then they lack the ability to\n\n[[Page S5541]]\n\nmake these changes. That is where the threat to liberty is at its \ngreatest. That is why we should be so concerned about S.J. Res. 19. It \nis important for us to remember we are creative Americans not because \nof who we are but because of what we do. We have set in motion a \nsequence of events. We have adopted a Constitution, a rule book that \nhas itself fostered the development of the greatest civilization and \nthe strongest economy the world has ever known.\n  This is not because we are great so much as it is because we have \nmade good choices. We have made good choices that delineate the proper \nboundaries of government. We decided what belongs to the people and \nwhat belongs to the government. Where there are appropriate actions to \nbe taken by the government, we also set out a series of rules that \ndecided which government may do which things. This transgresses those \nboundaries. This would undertake a critical breach into that realm \nwhich distinctively, unavoidably belongs to the people and not to the \ngovernment.\n  Speech is sacred. The freedom of the press is sacred. We must never \nallow them to be trifled with. We must never allow them to be tampered \nwith. We must never allow them to be weakened. This would weaken them. \nThis is what the majority would have political debate in America look \nlike. Here we are moments before casting a critical vote on a \nconstitutional amendment that could forever change the political \ndynamics of this country that have made us strong. Yet I find myself \nspeaking to an empty Chamber. The American people deserve better. The \nAmerican people can expect more out of their government. The American \npeople can expect freedom. This is incompatible with freedom. I would \nencourage each of my colleagues to oppose S.J. Res. 19, just as they \nwould oppose any other effort to intrude on the sacred rights of the \nAmerican people to express their political views, whether they be \nRepublicans or Democrats or belong to some other political party.\n  Whether they be liberals or conservatives or whether they would \ndescribe their political ideology in some other way, this is an issue \nthat is simply an American issue. This is an issue that is simply about \nfreedom. The American people today will choose freedom. I hope and I \npray they always will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I have heard from many Vermonters \nconcerned about the threat posed to our democracy by recent Supreme \nCourt decisions that have eviscerated our campaign finance laws. Just \nas opponents of campaign finance reform in the past described a parade \nof horribles that would occur if we strengthened campaign finance \nprotections, today we again hear those exaggerations from the other \nside of the aisle. Some Republicans have falsely asserted that this \nresolution would somehow repeal the First Amendment and would even \nresult in the banning of books. That is pure hyperbole.\n  Restoring the role that Congress and the States have traditionally \nhad to set reasonable limits on how much a corporation or a millionaire \ncan spend to influence an election is simply not the equivalent of \nprohibiting an individual from speaking out on a candidate. The \nconstitutional amendment before the Senate does not ban or proscribe \nanything. It restores the ability of future States or Congresses to set \nreasonable limits if they decide to act but of course those limits \nwould be guided by the American peoples' desire for such laws.\n  Over the course of this debate, we have heard Senators talking as if \nthe First Amendment is absolute. Most Americans can see right through \nthis. They know that the First Amendment does not protect child \npornography; or obscenity; or statements that incite imminent lawless \naction; or defamation or slander; or speech integral to criminal \nconduct; or fraudulent speech or perjury. And they know that the First \nAmendment is not violated when laws restrict even political speech by \nregulating the reasonable time, place, and manner of demonstrations or \nprotests. The idea that any future law on campaign contributions and \nexpenditures that has an incidental effect on speech somehow renders it \nthe equivalent of censorship is just not a serious argument.\n  The Framers of our fundamental charter anticipated that it would need \nto be amended from time to time. The story of our how our Constitution \nhas been amended over the years is a reflection on our democracy. It is \na story of inclusion and expansion of our representative democracy. The \n14th and 15th Amendments, for example, guaranteed equal protection of \nthe law for all Americans, and ensured that all Americans have the \nright to vote regardless of their race. The 17th Amendment gave \nAmericans the right to directly elect their representatives in Congress \nin the wake of concerns that corporations were corrupting state \nlegislatures to choose Senators beholden to them. The 19th Amendment's \nexpansion of the right to vote to women and the 26th Amendment's \nextension of the vote to young people made ours an even more \nrepresentative democracy.\n  Those who oppose the amendment before us have made some outlandish \nclaims. One of them was that we cannot consider this amendment because \nin their view it would be the first time that changes were made to the \nBill of Rights. What is interesting is that opponents to previous \nconstitutional amendments also claimed that they should not be adopted \nbecause they impacted the Bill of Rights. In the June hearing that I \nchaired before the Judiciary Committee, Professor Jamie Raskin \ntestified that ``the people have been forced to amend the Constitution \nmultiple times to reverse reactionary decisions of the Supreme Court \nthat freeze into place the constitutional property rights and political \nprivileges of the powerful against the powerless.'' The 13th Amendment \nabolished slavery, stripping the absolute individual ``property \nrights'' that white slave masters had enjoyed under the Fifth Amendment \nas found by the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott decision in 1857. \nSimilarly, Section 4 of the 14th Amendment completely blocked and made \nillegal any future compensation of slave masters for the confiscation \nof their vested ``property rights'' in their slaves. Not only did the \n14th Amendment strip slave masters of their ``property,'' it also made \nit impossible for them to seek restitution under the Fifth Amendment. \nOpponents to the 13th and 14th Amendments felt that their rights, \ngranted by the Bill of Rights, were being undermined but history showed \nthat those Amendments were necessary to move this great Nation toward a \nmore perfect union. The amendment before the Senate would restore the \nFirst Amendment. It would not repeal it. It would, however, overturn \nseveral Supreme Court decisions that have distorted the First \nAmendment. If we fail to do so, many of us are concerned that \ncorruption will flourish and our democracy will be distorted away from \nthe needs of hard working Americans.\n  Millions of Americans have called on Congress to restore the First \nAmendment so that our democracy will be protected against corruption \nand so that everyone's voices can be heard in our democratic process. I \nhave served in the Senate for almost 40 years and as chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee for nearly 10. It is a rare moment for this Senator \nto acknowledge that the threat to our democracy is so significant that \nit warrants an amendment to our Constitution. I applaud the Vermonters \nwho have taken action on this issue. I urge my fellow Senators to join \nme in voting for cloture and passage of this important constitutional \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, there is almost no measure Congress \nshould consider more carefully than a proposal to amend the \nConstitution of the United States. Such amendments are reserved only \nfor issues that relate to the foundations of our great American \nexperiment.\n  The value of each American vote is one such issue. Our system of \ngovernment depends on this basic principle, that every American, \nwhether they are rich or poor, weak or strong, whether they were born \nin Michigan or Mississippi, has an equal voice in the selection of \ntheir elected representatives. Time and again, Congress has amended our \nConstitution to protect this principle.\n  But recently, a succession of Supreme Court rulings has unleashed a \ntide of unlimited and secret special-interest money into our elections. \nThis\n\n[[Page S5542]]\n\nunregulated money drowns the voices of the public. It threatens to \ntransform our government of the people, by the people, and for the \npeople into one of campaign donors, by campaign donors, and for \ncampaign donors. That is not democracy, and it is not America.\n  That is why I support this amendment to the Constitution concerning \ncontributions and expenditures intended to affect elections. This \namendment would allow Congress to do what we have always done, and what \nour Founders intended us to do: take action to protect the integrity of \nour Nation's government and electoral processes.\n  Posterity vindicates the moments in our Nation's history when \nCongress simply did what was right. We honor those who voted to ensure \nthat the right to vote cannot be denied based on race, color, previous \ncondition of servitude or gender. We honor those who voted to ensure \nthat a poll tax could never again prohibit an American from voting for \ntheir own representatives. I urge my colleagues to act in this \ntradition, to simply do what is right, and to join me in supporting \nthis proposed amendment to the Constitution.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, we have had an important \ndebate this week. A debate about bringing sanity back to our elections. \nI want to thank all of my colleagues who have joined this fight. And I \nwant to thank the millions of Americans, regardless of party, who stand \nbehind us.\n  Over 150 years ago, Abraham Lincoln saw the danger of too much money \nin politics. Lincoln warned about ``corruption in high places . . . \nuntil the Republic is destroyed.''\n  Changing the Constitution is a big step. As James Madison said, it \nshould be amended only on ``great and extraordinary occasions.'' I \nagree; but I also believe we have reached one of those rare occasions. \nThe Supreme Court put up a ``for sale'' sign on our elections. On the \nfoundation of our democracy. It is wrong. It is dangerous. It cannot \nstand.\n  Amending the Constitution can take a long time. The 19th amendment \nwas first introduced in 1878. Opponents called it impractical, and \nimmoral, for daring to give women the right to vote. It took more than \n40 years to pass. But its proponents did not give up, and they \neventually prevailed.\n  Today's vote is a step forward in that long process. One more step \ntoward restoring our democracy. We will keep pushing until this \namendment is reality.\n  But that will take the support of my Republican colleagues. I was \ndisappointed that none of them voted in support of our amendment today, \nas it has a bipartisan history. Some of them have cosponsored and voted \nfor similar amendments in the past, before the Supreme Court's Citizens \nUnited and McCutcheon decisions destroyed many of the bipartisan \ncampaign finance laws that took years to pass.\n  Some of them said this was just an election-year stunt. But that \nignores reality. This movement started decades ago--by a Republican. \nMany of our predecessors from both parties understood the danger. They \nknew the corrosive effect that money from sources across the political \nspectrum has on our electoral system. They spent years championing the \ncause.\n  In 1983--the 98th Congress--Senator Ted Stevens, a Republican icon \nfrom Alaska, introduced a constitutional amendment to overturn Buckley \nv. Valeo, the 1976 Supreme Court decision that established the flawed \npremise that money and constitutionally protected speech were the same \nthing.\n  Senator Stevens already saw the deteriorating effect unlimited \ncampaign expenditures were having on Congress. In a speech on the \nSenate floor on the day he introduced the amendment, Senator Stevens \nsaid:\n\n       I, for one, would like to see the time come when there \n     would be a limitation on the expenditures and the upward \n     pressure on candidates, so that those who are seeking \n     reelection, those who are seeking to challenge incumbents, or \n     those who are seeking to fill a vacancy would not have this \n     pressure that is brought about by the necessity to raise \n     ever-increasing amounts to campaign for Federal office.\n\n  Senator Stevens recognized over 30 years ago that we were in an arms \nrace--that the drive for money would only get worse and Congress's \nability to function would suffer.\n  This was only the beginning of the movement to amend the \nConstitution. In every Congress from the 99th to the 108th, Senator \nFritz Hollings introduced bipartisan constitutional amendments similar \nto S.J. Res. 19. Senators Schumer and Cochran continued the effort in \nthe 109th Congress. Even Minority Leader McConnell once had his own \nconstitutional amendment to limit the influence of money on our \nelections.\n  That was all before the Citizens United and McCutcheon decisions, \nbefore things went from bad to worse. The out-of-control spending since \nthose decisions has further poisoned our elections.\n  But no matter how bad things get, an amendment can only succeed if \nRepublicans join us in this effort, as they have in the past. I know \nthe political climate of an election year makes it even more difficult, \nbut today's vote is not the end. I will reintroduce this amendment in \nthe next Congress, and I hope my Republican colleagues will join me. \nPoll after poll shows that our constituents--across the political \nspectrum--want this amendment. It's time we listened to them.\n  We had a great debate this week. It raised awareness of the issue \nacross the country. But we also heard a lot of hysteria on this floor \nfrom some of my colleagues across the aisle. Michael Keegan, president \nof People For the American Way, summed up the debate from the other \nside of the aisle quite well. He said, ``A good rule of thumb in \npolitics is that the scarier someone sounds, the more you should doubt \nwhat they're saying.''\n  So, we have been treated to a parade of imaginary horribles. Saturday \nNight Live creator Lorne Michaels is going to jail for writing \npolitical satire. So is the little old lady next door for putting up a \n$5 political yard sign. Books and movies will be banned. The NAACP and \nSierra Club will be muzzled. Pretty scary stuff. And complete nonsense.\n  Congress has a long history, since 1867, of campaign finance reform. \nAny reading of this history is very clear. The reforms were sensible \nand reasonable. If they were not, they would have little chance of \npassing both houses of Congress. Or being signed by the President. And \neven under our constitutional amendment, extreme legislation can still \nbe struck down by the Court. The other side knows this.\n  For over 150 years, Congress had a say in how money affects our \nelections. And it needed to. In the wake of scandals, it acted to curb \nexcess and corruption. Reform was bipartisan. It was responsible. And \nit did not shut down the New York Times or the Heritage Foundation. \nComedians and actors did not go to jail. It has not threatened free \nspeech.\n\n  Those who think that money is speech need to look at where that \nflawed premise has led our country. Historically low approval ratings \nfor Congress, polarization of the electorate, and a failure to \ncompromise on the most pressing issues facing the Nation. Senator \nHollings recognized the deterioration of our legislative branch due to \nthe increasing influence of money on our elections. In a Huffington \nPost piece titled ``Money is a Cancer in Politics,'' he wrote:\n\n       Money has not only destroyed bi-partisanship but corrupted \n     the Senate. Not the senators, but the system. In 1966 when I \n     came to the Senate, Mike Mansfield, the Leader, had a roll \n     call every Monday morning at 9:00 o'clock in order to be \n     assured of a quorum to do business. And he kept us in until \n     5:00 o'clock Friday so that we got a week's work in. . . \n     Today, there's no real work on Mondays and Fridays, but we \n     fly out to California early Friday morning for a luncheon \n     fundraiser, a Friday evening fundraiser, making individual \n     money appointments on Saturday and a fundraising breakfast on \n     Monday morning, flying back for perhaps a roll call Monday \n     evening.\n\n  I agree with his assessment, and also remember when fundraising was \nnot the priority it is today. My father was elected to Congress in \n1954, when I was in first grade. Back then, the legislative branch was \na Citizens' Congress. Members were in Washington for 6 months, and then \nthey went home for 6 months and worked at their profession. But during \nthose 6 months in session, Congress focused on legislating.\n  Unfortunately, our current campaign finance system has locked Members \nof Congress into an endless campaign cycle. Elected officials spend far \ntoo much time raising money for campaigns, and not enough time \ncarefully\n\n[[Page S5543]]\n\nconsidering legislation or listening to constituents. The drive to \nraise money is constant, and allowing vast new amounts of special \ninterest money into the system will only increase the pressure. This \ncauses a deterioration of Congress's ability to function, including its \nability to adequately represent and respond to its constituents.\n  As the money raised and spent on campaigns by special interests \ncontinues to climb, Members of Congress will have to devote more time \ntrying to keep up in the fundraising race. It is no wonder that, as the \npursuit of campaign money has come to dominate politics, the American \npeople have become increasingly dissatisfied with Congress' \nperformance.\n  That is the whole point. That is why we are here. Because our \nelections cannot be for sale to the highest bidder. The Supreme Court \nhas opened the floodgates. The American people are demanding that we \nclose them.\n  Because they know, and we know, that we have a broken system. Today's \nNew York Times editorial sums it up well. It states that, ``As long as \nmoney is officially categorized as protected speech, there will be no \nbrake on the ability of the rich and special interests to drown out \nother voices.''\n  The First Amendment has already been hijacked by billionaires and \nspecial interests. Our amendment rescues it.\n  Here's the bottom line. Billionaires want to stay at the head of the \ntable and our amendment will not let them. Let's be clear, they oppose \nany restriction. Any reform. Today's vote may have been along party \nlines, but I will leave it to the American people to judge why.\n  We will continue this fight. The momentum continues to grow, and we \nwill eventually win. The American people hate the influence of money on \nour elections. They want elections to be about the quality of ideas, \nnot the size of bank accounts. They want us to fight for the middle \nclass, not the moneyed class. They want us to spend our time raising \nhopes, instead of raising cash.\n  As I said in my remarks earlier this week at the beginning of this \ndebate, there is a well-known quote from the Watergate era. ``Follow \nthe money.'' Because we all know the truth: The road to corruption, to \nundue influence, is paved with money. We need to get off that road. For \nthe integrity of our electoral system. For the people who send us here. \nFor the future of our country.\n  As we wrap up this week's debate, and this historic vote, I want to \nthank several people. Senator Bennet joined me in this effort over 4 \nyears ago. Our amendment in the 111th Congress had four cosponsors. \nToday it has 49. I also want to express my appreciation for the efforts \nof Chairman Leahy and Senator Durbin, and thank their staff, \nparticularly Josh Hsu and Albert Sanders. The amendment received a \nhearing in the Judiciary Committee. It went through markups in Senator \nDurbin's subcommittee and in the full committee. It was debated, and \nrevised, and improved.\n  I want to thank the diverse coalition of groups who have worked \ntirelessly to build support for our amendment. Groups like People For \nthe American Way, Public Citizen, Common Cause, Free Speech For People, \nthe Sierra Club, the NAACP, and all the organizations working under the \nbanner of United For The People.\n  I ask unanimous consent that today's New York Times editorial, ``An \nAmendment to Cut Political Cash,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 11, 2014]\n\n                   An Amendment to Cut Political Cash\n\n                        (By the Editorial Board)\n\n       There are 48 Democratic senators sponsoring a \n     constitutional amendment to restore congressional control to \n     campaign spending that is expected to come up for a vote \n     later this week. They are not under the illusion that it will \n     become the 28th Amendment soon, if ever. But their \n     willingness to undertake a long and difficult effort shows \n     the importance they attach to restoring fairness to American \n     politics by reducing the influence of big money.\n       Hundreds of millions of dollars in outside spending--most \n     of it from big business and labor interests--continue to flow \n     into political races after being unleashed by the Supreme \n     Court and lower court decisions. Each year a record is set: \n     already, outside spending on this year's midterm elections \n     ($189 million so far) is more than three times what it was at \n     this point in 2010.\n       The Supreme Court has said that's fine. In several \n     misguided rulings, it has declared that spending money on \n     politics is a form of free speech, and is thus deserving of \n     constitutional protection. Beginning with the Buckley \n     decision in 1976, the court ended the limitations on \n     independent political spending in the name of speech, and \n     with the Citizens United decision in 2010, it opened the \n     spending floodgates to corporations and unions.\n       These decisions are the law of the land and cannot be \n     overturned by simple legislation. Congress can encourage \n     better behavior with public financing mechanisms, not that \n     Republicans will agree even to that. As long as money is \n     officially categorized as protected speech, there will be no \n     brake on the ability of the rich and special interests to \n     drown out other voices.\n       Barring a change in the makeup of the Supreme Court, it \n     would take an amendment to reduce the flow of cash. The one \n     under debate in the Senate declares that Congress and the \n     states have the ability to ``regulate and set reasonable \n     limits on the raising and spending of money by candidates and \n     others to influence elections.'' Addressing the Citizens \n     United decision, it says that governments can ``distinguish \n     between natural persons and corporations'' in setting those \n     regulations, thus allowing restrictions on corporate or union \n     spending that would not necessarily apply to individuals. To \n     protect the free flow of information in the news media, the \n     amendment adds the assurance that it will not abridge the \n     freedom of the press.\n       Republicans, fearful of deflating their cushion of cash, \n     are trying to portray the amendment as an assault on the Bill \n     of Rights. But writing unlimited checks on behalf of \n     politicians was never part of the American birthright. This \n     measure defines protected ``speech'' as it had been \n     understood in the First Amendment for 185 years until the \n     Buckley decision: actual words uttered or written by natural \n     persons, not money spent, and certainly not from corporate \n     treasuries.\n       The amendment would not be a cure-all. ``The press'' is an \n     amorphous term in the digital age, and political groups could \n     try to claim free-press status to get around regulation. And \n     amending the Constitution should not be taken lightly. It is \n     a last resort to fix a grave civic problem. But the backers \n     of this amendment recognize that the nature of American \n     democracy is at stake.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico.

The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                        Radzanowski Confirmation\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, first of all, I thank the Senate for \nconfirming the nominee for Chief Financial Officer of NASA, David \nRadzanowski. Now the team is fairly complete over there, and we can \nmove to the next phase.\n  As we move to the next phase, as we are getting ready to test the \ncapsule called Orion that will ultimately be part of the vehicle that \nwill take us to Mars in the decade of the 2030s, the rocket itself is \nbeing readied and its final design will be tested on a test stand in \nMississippi at the Stennis Center in the next couple of years. So we \nare well on the way for NASA being able to get out and explore the \ncosmos beyond low Earth orbit.\n  As you know, we have an International Space Station that is 120 yards \nlong. Think of a football field from one goalpost to the other, that is \nhow big it is. There are six humans up there. We rotate the crews out \nwith the Russians and with the Europeans and in some cases we have had \nJapanese astronauts, so it is an International Space Station with an \ninternational crew. I thank the Senate for the confirmation today.\n\n\n                                  ISIS\n\n  Madam President, I am here to speak about the threat to America by \nISIS. Every one of us has seen how brutal, how inhumane, how savage \nthis group is. It was certainly brought home by the killing--the \nbeheading--of the two journalists, one of them from my State of \nFlorida.\n  I would invite anyone to go on the Internet to see the images of what \nthis group has done to others, just because someone has a different \nreligious faith, in this particular case the Christians near Sinjar \nMountain. You should see the photographs. Maybe you don't want to see \nthe photographs of the infants they have beheaded because their parents \nare of a different faith.\n  You should see the photographs of the women whom they are slitting \ntheir throats and letting their lifeblood drain into a basin bowl as \nthey hold down the women. This is the savagery. That is why the \nPresident so appropriately, eloquently, very directly and very firmly \nlast night spoke about he is using his constitutional power as \nCommander in Chief to go after them. The President also said he wants \nthe support of Congress.\n\n  It is true the President--in this Senator's opinion--has the \nauthority to strike, but as he clearly reminded us last night, this is \nnot a short-term deal. This is going to be a long-term and involved \neffort. So the Congress should register its support of the \nauthorization to use military force. That is what we can do as we get \ninto the debate of should that force be limited.\n  I have filed one version. I have no pride of authorship. I want it to \nbe debated. I have suggested there would be the ability to use all the \ndefense force except rotational ground forces, which is the term of art \nin the Department of Defense meaning big ground armies. That is what \nthe President wants to avoid when he talks about boots on the ground, \nthat he doesn't want that. That is what the American people do not \nwant, and that is what this Senator does not want.\n  But we certainly don't want to handcuff the Department of Defense and \nour military in carrying out the successful objective of being able to \ngo after and help eliminate this savage beast called ISIS or ISIL or as \nthey characterize themselves, the Islamic State.\n  Today Secretary Kerry is in the Middle East. He is working on the \ncoalition. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel is making phone calls. Last \nweek at the summit--the NATO summit--along with the President, he was \nalready talking with his counterparts there. They are knitting together \nthe coalition that will be a coalition not only of NATO but a coalition \nof so many in the region, including, we hope, a lot in the Arab League.\n  So isn't it time we know this effort that is hugely supported by the \nAmerican people--isn't it time for the Congress to register our \napproval by exercising our constitutional duty? I would suggest it is.\n  I know some of the hearings are starting next week. Later this \nafternoon the Senate will have a classified briefing on the threat of \nISIS. Many of us have already had a number of those briefings and know \nthis is a threat like we have not faced before--not only because of the \nsavagery but also the fact that they are well organized, they have a \njihadist mission, and they are well funded.\n  Part of our effort as we reach out to our coalition is to get them to \nstop the avenues of funding that is going in to this organization.\n  I will close by saying that for the Congress to register our support, \nby the support of this type of legislation, is to show our allies and \nthe world--not only to show the unity of America behind this effort, \nboth clandestine and overtly military--but also to show our enemies the \nunity of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                        Constitutional Amendment\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise to speak to regret that the \nconstitutional amendment proposed by Senator Udall lost 54 to 42. Of \ncourse, a majority voted for it, but we need two-thirds for a \nconstitutional amendment. I first want to thank Senator Udall for his \ngreat leadership on this issue. As chairman of the rules committee and \na member of the Judiciary Committee, I have worked with him on this, \nand I know his passion and dedication to straightening our country out, \nstraightening our system of campaign finance out.\n  Second, I want to say this: We are going to keep fighting until we \nget this done. The only way really to cure the Supreme Court's \nmisguided ruling, whether it is in Citizens United or McCutcheon, is \nwith a constitutional amendment. Our day will come. We are not giving \nup.\n  When the Supreme Court issued its ruling in McCutcheon several months \nago, it was another step on the path towards destruction of our system \nof campaign finance laws. First in Citizens United and then in \nMcCutcheon, the Supreme Court has been chipping away at the actual \nfoundation of our democracy that everyone is equal in the political \narena. It just does not mean equal in terms of votes; it means that if \nyou are a multimillionaire, you should not be allowed to drown out the \nmessages of everybody else.\n  If Congress does not respond, our system is going to collapse. This \nyear, the amount of independent expenditures from a small number of \nindividuals will exceed the money spent by all the others. It is just \namazing. We cannot have it. That is why Democrats will continue to \nfight for a constitutional amendment that would finally allow us to \nfight back and regulate the dark\n\n[[Page S5546]]\n\nmoney that is flooding our elections and threatening to take us back to \nthe era of the robber barons. The Federal Government and the States \nshould be allowed to pass laws that prevent unregulated sums of \nundisclosed money from pervading our elections.\n  This constitutional amendment would do just that. Unfortunately, our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle do not see it that way. They \nhave argued that the amendment would curtail freedom of speech. The \nRepublican leader said in an op-ed earlier this week that Democrats are \ntrying to take an eraser to the First Amendment.\n  Well, he is dead wrong. All Democrats are trying to erase is the \nhundreds of millions dollars--undisclosed--that are tainting our \nelections, whether they are coming from the Koch brothers or George \nSoros or Tom Steyer. All of them should not be allowed to have such \nhuge influence.\n  Many other Republicans have portrayed this sensible amendment as an \nunparalleled attack on the First Amendment, which, they seem to argue, \nis absolute. I would say, for instance, to the Senator from Texas and \nmy Republican friends that no amendment is absolute.\n  You cannot yell ``fire'' in a crowded theater. Child pornography is \nillegal. We have libel laws. These are all sensible limits to the First \nAmendment.\n  This amendment is similarly a sensible amendment. It creates balance. \nEvery amendment--and the Founding Fathers, when they created the Bill \nof Rights, and the States, when they ratified them, realized that \n``balance'' is a watchword. We believe in the right to buy arms, but \npeople shouldn't be allowed to buy a tank and ride down the street in \nit. We believe in all of the amendments, but none should be stretched \nto ridiculous extremes, which any law can be.\n  This amendment would go a long way to restoring fairness and \ncredibility to a system of campaign laws that the Supreme Court has \nripped to shreds over the past years.\n  I don't know if these Supreme Court Justices know the harm they are \ndoing to our system in their abstract view that limiting many kinds of \ncampaign finance violates the First Amendment, but I wish they could be \non the ground and see the harm they are doing.\n  Simply put, unregulated dark money is poisoning our elections, and \nthis amendment is the antidote. The American people want us to change \nthe way elections are financed in this country not just for the sake of \nthe system itself but because the current system results in a Congress \nthat fails to do what average folks--the middle class--want it to do. \nDemocrats want to raise the minimum wage, but the Koch brothers spend \nmillions electing candidates who oppose it. Democrats want equal pay \nfor equal work, but shadowy billionaires and corporate interests funnel \nmillions to the campaigns of candidates who would block it.\n  We have to have fair elections in order to give the middle class a \nfair shot. And on the amendment the Presiding Officer has so valiantly \nsponsored, all we want to say is if you are a multimillionaire, you \nought to pay taxes at the same rate as everyone else and use the money \nwe gain to help make it easier for everyone to afford college and pay \ntheir college debts at a reasonable interest rate after they get out of \ncollege. But those who would be the small number who would be hurt by \nthis have a few clarion voices who have billions of dollars who spend \nthe money and prevent candidates who believe in this view--which most \nAmericans believe in--from getting elected.\n  We have to have fair elections in order to give the middle class a \nfair shot. We hope our Republican colleagues will drop their objections \nand work with us to restore some semblance of fairness to our electoral \nsystem.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Hamas\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, much has been said about the terrorist \ngroup ISIS in the past few days--and rightfully so. ISIS is a vile mob \nof fanatics whose butchery knows no bounds. I am confident President \nObama's targeted action will degrade and destroy this menace.\n  But there is another evil organization in the world today that, like \nISIS, has zero regard for humanity. They are kidnappers and \nexecutioners. They are violent extremists who murder innocent \ncivilians. They are terrorists who cower behind women and children, \neven using them as human shields. They are saboteurs of peace and \nprovocateurs of bloody conflict who will not stop their butchery. Once \nagain, I am not talking about the Islamic State of Iraq; I am talking \nabout Hamas.\n  Hamas and ISIS are both vicious, corrupt, hateful, evil groups. Both \nare extreme, outrageous, irrational, excessive, harsh, and radical. Yet \nfor some reason Hamas's brutality doesn't elicit the same horror in the \ninternational community as ISIS. How can that be?\n  One of the few differences between these two terrorist organizations \nis that Hamas has a narrow, ghastly focus: the destruction of the State \nof Israel. Consider its actions over the past few months.\n  Hamas raided its own limited supplies for housing and general \ninfrastructure, intended to repair the destruction that occurred during \nthe last conflict they initiated. Hamas instead used the stolen \nmaterials to build tunnels to hide and infiltrate Israel--infiltrating \nto kill, maim, kidnap, and murder the innocent.\n  These depraved agitators launched thousands of rockets into Israel, \nhoping to inflict death and destruction. Their rockets had no aiming \ndevices, no aiming capabilities. They fired indiscriminately, not \ncaring whether they hit a child, a family, a school, or a place of \nworship. It begs the question: Without specific targets, why fire the \nrockets into Israel? We know why--provocation. Hamas knew Israel would \nbe forced to defend itself, and, of course, that is what the Israelis \ndid. Israel responded as any nation would to such attacks against its \nnation--by trying to protect its people. And what did Hamas do? They \nhad such little regard for the people of Gaza that they used their own \nas human shields. Hamas used Palestinians as shields to carry out a \nsinister ploy, hoping they and their apologists could dupe the world \ninto blaming Israel.\n  David Brooks, a distinguished columnist, said 2 months ago on PBS's \n``NewsHour,'' referring to Hamas:\n  It's a rare moment in military history where a party rejects a cease-\nfire in order to get more of their own people killed. But that's part \nof the strategy.\n  When Hamas wasn't scheming for more Palestinian fatalities to blame \non Israel, it was carrying out more public executions of Gaza \nresidents. For example, this is an article from the Wall Street \nJournal: ``Alleged Collaborators With Israel Killed in Gaza. Deaths \nFollow Israel's Targeted Killing of Three Top Hamas Military \nCommanders.''\n\n       Hamas executed 18 people on Friday, some of them in the \n     streets of Gaza City in the middle of the day, after accusing \n     them of collaborating with Israel, according to media linked \n     to the Islamic group, which rules the Gaza Strip.\n       In one instance, about 20 militants dressed in black and \n     with their faces covered brought six of the condemned men, \n     their heads covered with cloth bags, to an alley near the \n     Great Omari Mosque in Gaza City after midday prayers, \n     witnesses said. A militant shot the men in the head one at a \n     time with a pistol, after which he sprayed them with \n     automatic rifle fire, the witnesses said. The bodies were \n     loaded into government ambulances and taken away.\n\n  These are the fanatics Israel faces every day, terrorist \norganizations as violent and extreme as any other on the face of the \nplanet, as indicated by this Wall Street Journal article I just read.\n  There are those who refuse to condemn Hamas as they would ISIS. The \nhypocrisy is stunning. Those who reject tyranny, corruption, and \nterrorism should denounce Hamas. All those who honor peace and \nsovereignty should stand for Israel.\n  I stand with Israel. The United States of America stands with Israel. \nPresident Barack Obama and Congress continue to affirm America's \nunshakeable bond with Israel and our strong support for the security \nand safety of its people.\n\n[[Page S5547]]\n\n  For my part, I will continue to do all I can to support Israel's \nright to self-defense. I know my colleagues join me in supporting the \nState of Israel and condemning Hamas for the depraved, horrid, \nrepugnant terrorist organization that it is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                                  ISIS\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I haven't watched the gruesome videos of \nthe beheadings of James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and I have no plans \nto do so. I don't think I need to do so in order to understand the \nbrutality of ISIS and the threat this radical movement poses to our \npartners in the Middle East and Europe--and ultimately to the United \nStates' national security interests.\n  As we stand here in the Capitol today with the flags at half-mast in \nremembrance of the 9/11 attacks, I think we all understand that we \ncan't just ignore this crisis and hope that it passes. The risks are \ntoo high. ISIS presents a new and unique threat to global stability, \nand it must be met with a robust global response. Whether we like it or \nnot, in today's world of decentralized power, it is still up to the \nUnited States to lead this effort.\n  Last night the President of the United States laid out a strong and \ncompelling case for taking the fight to ISIS. I wholeheartedly agree \nwith the imperative for action he outlined. ISIS represents a serious \nthreat, and we would betray our bond of trust with the world if we \nignored it simply because of a wariness here at home with protracted \nmilitary engagements abroad.\n  So for me the question is not if or whether we should confront ISIS. \nRather, it is about the most effective way to go about this important \ntask, and it is about making sure this debate happens in the proper \ncontext.\n  Americans today, more than ever, feel like they have lost control of \ntheir lives, of their ability to feel financially and economically and \neven physically secure. These videos and reports of ISIS's \nunconscionable brutality add to this feeling of insecurity, and they \ninvoke rage--justifiable, appropriate rage--about those who would carry \nout such acts.\n  In this case this fear and anger we feel about ISIS's actions is \ncomplemented by the legitimate threat this group poses. So we shouldn't \nhesitate to act simply because our desire to do so is fueled by the \nintense emotion this enemy engenders in us. But our response--the \ndetails of our strategy--cannot be dictated by these impulses.\n  Our plan of attack against ISIS needs to be well thought out, \nnuanced, not rushed into because we feel an emotional compulsion to do \nsomething--anything--right now. We made that mistake in the past as a \nnation, and we shouldn't misstep again. We certainly shouldn't allow \nelection-year politics to play into our calculations.\n  This is a debate about ISIS, but it is also a debate about how we are \ngoing to meet a potential plethora of anti-Western extremist groups \nthat are organized and will organize against us throughout the world. \nWe are creating a precedent for action, and we shouldn't rush into war \nsimply because we feel pressured to get something done before an \nelection.\n  As the President noted last night--and it is important to repeat--\nISIS today does not have imminent plans to attack the United States. \nThat doesn't diminish the necessity of taking them on. It simply means \nthat we don't need to engage in a panicked response.\n  So today I will lay out four principles that I believe should serve \nas the foundation for action against ISIS.\n  First, our strategy needs to be guided by the recognition that ISIS's \npower comes in the first instance from a political vacuum in Iraq and \nSyria, and, second, from a military vacuum. Any strategy must lead with \neconomic and political tactics to undermine ISIS's legitimacy, using \nmilitary power as a tool to create the space for those efforts.\n  We can't defeat an ideology of extremism with an air campaign. Bombs \nand drone strikes will not help win the hearts and minds of Sunnis who \ncurrently feel disenfranchised or ostracized by the Iraqi Government. \nAs with any conflict, the real solution has to come from the people of \nthe region. Elements of Iraq's Sunni population will continue to \nsupport radical Islamic insurgents--or, at best, just passively allow \nthem to operate--as long as they see no future for them in their \ncountry.\n  So I applaud President Obama for making the centerpiece of his speech \nlast night a call for continued efforts to create a truly inclusive \npolitical process in Iraq. The new Prime Minister has a difficult road \nahead, and both Congress and our regional partners should do our part \nto support this tough political work.\n  For instance, as a complement to new military funding for operations \nin the Middle East, we should be debating funding a surge for political \nand economic work in the region. If we are going to spend hundreds of \nmillions of dollars dropping bombs inside Iraq, we and our allies \nshould commit to double that amount to support political efforts to \nempower moderates in the region.\n  Second, we will fail if we do not unite Shiite and Sunni nations in \nthe region behind a military plan to confront ISIS.\n  I agree with the President that in the short term the United States \nis going to need to step up its military operations in Iraq, and I \ncannot disagree with the President that there may be limited \nimperatives to use the Air Force inside Syria should we have \nintelligence that ISIS there poses a threat to the United States. But \nany military campaign has to be fully cloaked in the legitimacy of a \ntrue regional coalition with Sunni partners front and center.\n  Further, it is clear that ISIS is getting funding and a flow of \nequipment and recruits from countries in the region. We need to turn \noff this spigot immediately. We need to hear from our partners in the \nregion that ISIS does not truly represent Islam, that they do not \ncondone the slaughter and rape of other innocent Muslims, Christians or \nYazidis, for that matter. The United States needs to lead the effort to \ncombat ISIS, but we must do so as part of a broad international \ncoalition.\n  Third, a strategy to confront ISIS does not require America to become \nfully and overtly enmeshed in the increasingly complicated civil war in \nSyria. Over the last 2 years I have consistently opposed arming and \ntraining the Syrian rebels. Since the last time Congress debated this \nsubject, the prospect that this intervention could be counterproductive \nto our national security interests has only increased. To begin with, \nit will be very difficult to thread the needle of supporting a Shiite \nregime against a Sunni insurgency in Iraq while at the same time \nsupporting a Sunni insurgency against a Shiite regime in Syria. That \ninconsistency is going to make it difficult to put together \nlasting regional coalitions.\n\n  More importantly, it is increasingly impossible to sort out the so-\ncalled vetted moderate rebels from the truly bad rebels. All of our \nfocus on ISIS over the past months has diverted our attention from the \nfact that, increasingly, some moderate Syrian rebels are openly \ncollaborating with Jabhat al-Nusra, a wing of Al Qaeda, inside Syria, \nand there are even reports that ISIS itself is working with elements of \nthe moderate rebels.\n  Our goal would be to support the rebels and simultaneously defeat \nISIS and Assad. But the very real possibility exists that the rebels \ncould align with ISIS to defeat Assad or our military campaign against \nISIS allows Assad to prevail. Both are plausible and unacceptable \noptions.\n  I want ISIS defeated in Syria. I want Bashar Al-Assad to pay for his \ncrimes against humanity. But too much can go wrong for not enough \npossible gain for the U.S. to increase our involvement in the Syrian \ncivil war--if necessary, using limited counterterrorism measures to \nattack ISIS in Syria, but leave the civil war inside Syria to parties \nthat, whether we like it or not, have much more at stake in the fight \nthan we do.\n  This brings me to my fourth point. All of this should be done with \ncongressional authorization. There is no viable excuse for Congress to \nabdicate its constitutional responsibility to authorize war.\n  President Obama finished his speech last night with a spectacular \ncharge to the American people, and few can disagree with it: America is \nexceptional.\n\n[[Page S5548]]\n\nWe continue to stand as a symbol and a beacon of freedom and democracy \nto the world. Because of that standard that we bear, we should respect \nthe version of democracy that our Founding Fathers granted to us by \nhaving a debate in Congress about the policy that the President has \nproposed.\n  Respectfully, I disagree that the authorization for military force \npassed in the days following September 11 grants the President the \npower to conduct an open-ended, long-term war against ISIS. If that \nwere to be the case, then there is absolutely no congressional check \nupon the Executive's power to open military fronts against extremist \ngroups anywhere in the world at any time.\n  The 9/11 AUMF was not intended to be perpetual, but it would \ntransform into a permanent, easily manipulated authorization if we \ninterpret it to cover ISIS, a group that specifically disavows an \nassociation with the only named group in the 9/11 AUMF.\n  Frankly, I believe a well-crafted, limited authorization of military \nforce against ISIS could pass the Congress. I also believe the \nConstitution requires us to find out if it can.\n  I commend the President for having the courage to refuse to rush to \nrash judgment. We need to build a strategy that uses military action as \na complement to political reform--not the other way around. We need to \nbuild a real sustainable regional coalition to support any military \naction, with Sunni nations as the lead. We need to recognize the limits \nof American power and stay out of the Syrian civil war. And we need to \nunite the Nation by a congressional authorization of a sound plan to \ntake on ISIS.\n  I am glad my Commander in Chief made his case last night, \nunderstanding the foreign policy mistakes of the past decade and with a \nwillingness to learn from them. I am confident that if we get this \nstrategy right, the American people will stand squarely with him as we \nfight back against an enemy like few we have ever faced before.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2199\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate resumes consideration of S. 2199 it be in order for my amendment \nNo. 3808 to be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Connecticut\n  Mr. MURPHY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I know that in just offering the \namendment I sought to offer on the Senate floor I have received an \nobjection. Let me briefly describe what I am trying to offer. The \nobjection that I just received from the other side of the aisle is a \ndemonstration of what is wrong in the Senate right now.\n  What is happening in the Senate right now is the majority leader \nkeeps bringing legislation to the floor, and people are not allowed to \noffer amendments that directly pertain to the legislation.\n  In fact, right now pending on the Senate floor is the so-called \nPaycheck Fairness Act. I have an amendment I want to offer on the \nSenate floor to that act that deals with addressing pay discrimination, \nbut I am not going to be allowed to offer that amendment.\n  I guess the first question we have to ask is: Why is that? Why is it \nthat when we have such an important issue, which I acknowledge is an \nimportant issue--that people in this country be treated fairly, that we \nbe paid solely based on our experience and qualifications, that we \neliminate discrimination in the workplace; something I would hope we \ncould work together on and about which we could have a real debate on \nthis Senate floor--if someone comes to the floor and offers an \namendment, what we get is an objection, because, really, what we are \ndoing right now on the floor--let's be clear about it--is a political \ncharade. It is trying to score political points on an issue that is \nvery important that we shouldn't be sitting here trying to score \npolitical points on.\n  Why can't both sides of the aisle offer their amendments on ideas on \nhow to eliminate discrimination in the workplace? It seems to me that \nif they are serious about the issue, the majority leader would allow \nindividuals like me and other Senators on both sides of the aisle to \ncome to the floor and offer their amendments. But we have just seen \nthat when I have done that, I got an objection instead of allowing my \namendment to be debated fully on this floor.\n  All Americans should be treated fairly and paid solely based on their \nexperience and qualifications, and discrimination has no place in the \nAmerican workforce.\n  There are important laws we have passed on a bipartisan basis in the \nCongress. Laws like the Equal Pay Act and title VII of the Civil Rights \nAct are there to combat workplace discrimination. Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964 became the first Federal law designed to \nprotect U.S. workers from employment discrimination based upon a \nperson's sex.\n  The Equal Pay Act of 1963 requires employers to pay female employees \nthe same wages that they pay male employees for equal work--very \nimportant laws.\n  Both title VII and the Equal Pay Act provide a way for those who are \ndiscriminated against to file complaints against their employers and \npursue financial remedies if they are discriminated against in the \nworkplace. Our focus, of course, always needs to be on enforcing those \nimportant laws that were passed by the Congress to ensure that both men \nand women in the workplace will be judged based on their performance \nand not based on their gender.\n  Unfortunately, despite these laws there are instances where pay \ndiscrimination still exists. With 60 percent of women serving as the \nprimary earners in their households, this disparity must be addressed, \nand this is an important issue. But the so-called Paycheck Fairness Act \nthat is pending on the floor, in my view, is not the answer. Instead of \nensuring that women are treated fairly, the Paycheck Fairness Act would \nlimit the ability of women in some instances to have flexible work \nschedules if that is what they need, and it would make it easier--much \neasier--to file frivolous lawsuits that, frankly, are a boon to trial \nlawyers. One concern I have about the bill pending on the floor--and I \nthink it is a legitimate concern--is that it could have an impact on \nreducing the ability of employers to award merit pay.\n  I had the privilege of serving as the first woman attorney general in \nNew Hampshire, and before that I worked in private practice in a law \nfirm. In my position and in the work I have done throughout my life, I \nhave had the opportunity to meet incredible women in all fields in New \nHampshire and throughout this country, whether it is leaders in the \nhealth sector, in the business sector--women working very hard every \nday in this country. There are many instances, I have to tell you, \nwhere women, based on merit, have outperformed their male colleagues. \nSo what we don't want to do is create a law and pass a law that \nactually reduces the opportunities for employers in the workplace to \nreward merit, because women--like men--want the opportunity to earn \nmore than their male counterparts when we do a better job.\n  We had this debate last April on the Senate floor, and when we had \nthis debate on the Senate floor we experienced what we are experiencing \nright now. Paycheck fairness was brought to the floor and, in fact, I \nworked on an amendment with some of my colleagues--Senator Fischer, \nSenator Collins, and Senator Murkowski. We offered an amendment that we \nthought would help address the discrimination that can occur in the \nworkplace and to address retaliation when employees discuss the \nsalaries they make so that they can become informed in the workplace. \nBut when we offered that amendment in April, we were denied a vote on \nit. We were in the same situation we are now.\n  So it is like ``Groundhog Day.'' The Senate rejected the bill pending \nin April, and we were denied all amendments and the ability to really \ndebate and amend it and have a real discussion about this important \nissue. Here we are again leading into the November elections, and again \nthe bill is on the floor, and again Senators like me who have offered \nan amendment that I hoped we could discuss and consider\n\n[[Page S5549]]\n\nare going to be denied the ability to do so.\n  When I came to this floor in April, when this bill was pending on the \nSenate floor before, I said then and I firmly believe it now: If the \nmajority leader believes this is an important issue, then we should \nhave a real debate and an open amendment process and not engage in a \npolitical charade. I think the American people deserve better.\n  In New Hampshire, Republicans and Democrats actually got together and \nthey were able to pass a bipartisan pay equity law which was signed \ninto law in July. It is a commonsense measure that helps address wage \ndisparities between men and women, and that law was the basis for the \nproposed amendment which I have just tried to offer on the Senate floor \nso that the Senate could consider some of the very good ideas that were \nworked through on a bipartisan basis in my State as a way to address \ndiscrimination in the workforce.\n  This amendment that I have filed--but that I am not being permitted \nto offer--is modeled on New Hampshire's law and, again, it was \nbipartisan. In fact, the amendment that I have offered is called the \nEnsuring Fairness in Pay Act. It would make clear that employers have \nto pay men and women equal wages for equal work. It ensures equal pay \nfor workers performing equal work under similar conditions regardless \nof sex. In fact, it also prohibits retaliation against employees who \ndiscuss their pay information and prohibits employers from requiring \nemployees to sign a contract or a waiver that prohibits the employees \nfrom disclosing their pay. This would allow employees to know what \ntheir situation is so they can ensure that they are being treated \nfairly.\n  What was passed in New Hampshire--my amendment here--also contains \nteeth. In fact, similar to New Hampshire's law, my amendment would \nimpose a $2,500 penalty for any violation of this law and for pay \ndiscrimination. So putting teeth in it is important as well. We did \nthat at the State level, and I thought we should consider doing this at \nthe Federal level if my amendment could be considered by this body.\n  It also requires employers to post a notice that sets forth excerpts \nor summaries of the pertinent provisions of what is the law--title VII \nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964--and information pertinent to how you \nfile a complaint if you feel you are subject to discrimination in the \nworkforce.\n  Finally, my amendment encourages States to provide pay disparity \nstatistics including historical analysis and any information that would \nhelp the public understand and address this issue.\n  I urge the majority leader to put politics aside so that we can work \ntogether on a bipartisan solution, just as New Hampshire was able to \ndo. In my home State of New Hampshire, when there is an amendment \noffered, you actually will get a vote on it. I think we are doing a \nreal disservice to the American people, regardless of what the issue \nis, that Senators on both sides of the aisle when they are offering an \namendment aren't permitted to have a vote on it on the Senate floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, over the past several months the world's \nattention has been focused on the Russian invasion of Crimea and \nfighting in the eastern Ukraine, the explosion of violence in Gaza, the \nflood of migrant children from Central America, and the horrific death \nand destruction in Iraq and Syria.\n  In each of these places vast numbers of innocent people have suffered \nterribly, and our own policies and capability to respond have been \nseverely tested.\n  Yet one of the most urgent, difficult, and frightening challenges \nfacing the world today is not the result of armed conflict or ethnic or \nreligious extremism. It is the world's first Ebola epidemic, and it \nposes a potentially devastating threat to Africa and people everywhere.\n  Before the August recess we were preparing to receive dozens of \nAfrican heads of state to Washington. At that time, Doctors Without \nBorders and other nongovernmental organizations had been ringing alarm \nbells for weeks about the worsening Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n  But the World Health Organization and governments, including our own, \nwere slow to respond to what was viewed as a manageable, localized \npublic health problem, rather than a crisis that could spin out of \ncontrol.\n  No longer. Infections and deaths in Liberia and Sierra Leone are \nincreasing rapidly, with exponential acceleration in these countries \nand potentially in neighboring Guinea. Official reports may be only a \npiece of the picture. The ability of these countries to locate, \ndiagnose, isolate and treat patients, trace and monitor contacts, and \nsafely bury the dead cannot possibly keep pace.\n  Unfortunately, the lack of urgency exhibited by much of the \ninternational community was exacerbated by budget cuts at the World \nHealth Organization, for which there is ample blame to go around. After \nthe 2009 global financial crisis, WHO's budget dropped by roughly 1 \nbillion dollars, nearly 25 percent of their budget today.\n  By the time of the current Ebola outbreak, staff levels at WHO had \nbeen cut by 35 percent, and their ability to prepare for and respond to \nhealth emergencies suffered accordingly.\n  Today, the Ebola crisis has the full attention of the World Health \nOrganization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USAID, \nPresident Sirleaf of Liberia, and other governments. They recognize \nthat unless aggressive, coordinated actions are taken immediately, \nthere will soon be tens of thousands of cases, the disease will spread \ninto much of Africa, and it will be an ongoing global threat for many \nyears to come.\n  The challenges are immense: weak government institutions; \ndysfunctional public health systems that cannot conduct reliable \ndisease surveillance and response; lack of roads and other basic \ninfrastructure; ethnic and political divisions in societies recovering \nfrom war; misconceptions about the disease and low levels of literacy; \nand inadequate and uncoordinated international aid.\n  While the epidemic is finally beginning to receive the attention it \ndeserves, it is spiraling out of control. Huge numbers of cases are \noverwhelming local capacity to isolate and treat patients, trace their \ncontacts, and safely bury the dead. The cost of personal protection \ngear is exorbitant and there is an acute shortage of trained people.\n  Also, the secondary effects of this crisis are increasingly apparent. \nFood insecurity is worsening and the economies of these countries, \nalready fragile, are facing collapse as imports and exports are \nplummeting.\n  We and others have the knowledge and tools to contain and control \nthis disease if cases are quickly isolated and contacts identified, but \nactions to date have not been well coordinated and have not always \naddressed the most urgent needs.\n  Just as for a raging wildfire, the focus should be on deploying all \navailable resources to provide immediate support for urgent needs \nidentified on the front lines to stop its spread, while there is time. \nIt will require mobilization of the type and complexity as occurred \nafter the Haiti earthquake.\n  In West Africa, that means immediately scaling up staff, transport, \nisolation and treatment capacity, infection control including personal \nprotective equipment for health workers, funding through rapid and \nflexible funding mechanisms, training and supervision, laboratory \nservices, communications resources, and management and logistics \nsupport.\n  There is nothing new about this approach. But it is required on a far \nlarger scale than was used to control Ebola outbreaks in the past.\n  The situation today is grave, but we can prevent many of these \ndeaths. And as we do so we need to help build stronger public health \nsystems that can contain future disease outbreaks.\n  Past efforts to build capacity have clearly been woefully inadequate. \nAs public health systems in these countries have been overwhelmed by \nEbola, patients suffering from malaria, TB, pneumonia, and other \nillnesses are unable to get treatment.\n  We should all pay tribute to the courageous public health workers who \nhave risked their lives--and in many cases, lost their lives--trying to \nsave others from this terrible disease. It is inspiring to read the \nstories of nurses and doctors, and those who dig the graves and bury \nthe dead, who have labored on as their colleagues have died, who live \nwith the daily reality that at any moment they could be next. They are \nas brave as any soldier on the front lines of battle.\n  I also want to commend President Sirleaf, her Minister of Defense, \nand others who have tried their best to deal with this unprecedented \nemergency in the face of woefully inadequate resources.\n  The United Nations says that $600 million is needed immediately to \nfight this disease. The United States has already provided tens of \nmillions of dollars. USAID announced another $75 million last week. The \nWhite House has requested additional funding for CDC, which would bring \nthe U.S. contribution to over $250 million.\n  The Department of Defense announced that it will provide logistical, \nlaboratory, and other support. The World Bank has pledged over $200 \nmillion. Other governments are also coming forward, as are private \ndonors. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently pledged $50 \nmillion to enhance response efforts and accelerate research on \npotential treatments and vaccines.\n  The Congress has a role to play, and I am hopeful that as additional \nfunds are needed we will act responsibly and provide them. I am a \ncosponsor of S. Res. 541, which recounts the history of this outbreak \nand the steps that are urgently needed to control it. I commend \nSenators Coons, Durbin, Menendez and others who introduced it. This is \nnot a partisan or political issue. It is a public health issue, a moral \nissue, and one that should unite us all to do what is necessary to \ndefeat this epidemic.\n\n[[Page S5551]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/11/senate-section/article/S5551-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5551-S5552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING JAMES M. JEFFORDS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this week, the Senate passed a \nresolution recognizing the life and career of Senator Jim Jeffords. \nThis Vermont icon passed away over the August recess, nearly 8 years \nafter concluding a decades-long career in public service. That career, \nmarked by historic moments on the national stage, was one in which \nVermont came first. I ask unanimous consent that an article from the \nBurlington Free Press, ``Tributes pour in for Vermont GOP giant \nJeffords,'' be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Jim and I came to Washington together in 1975, he to represent \nVermont as our lone Member in the House of Representatives, and I as \nVermont's first Democratic Senator. But our years working together go \nback further, to the days when I was a State's attorney in Chittenden \nCounty, and he the State's attorney general. Our families knew each \nother. Marcelle and Liz knew each other well, having both attended \nCathedral High School in Burlington. Both Jim and I would readily \nacknowledge that our wives were the hearts and souls of our families.\n  That longtime relationship served us and Vermont well when Jim came \nto the Senate in 1989. Together, we worked to protect Vermont's dairy \nfarmers, to preserve Vermont's celebrated natural landscape, and to \ngive Vermont a strong and powerful voice in Washington.\n  I joined many Vermonters in celebrating Jim's life last month in his \nhome town of Rutland. Our sympathies are with his children Laura and \nLeonard, and his grandchildren.\n  Jim was a humble man, a Vermonter through and through, and a true \nfriend. His legacy is that he held Vermont in his heart, and worked to \nadvance the best interests of his constituents on the national stage.\n  For that, this Vermonter will join many others in simply saying, \n``Thanks, Jim.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Aug. 19, 2014]\n\n            Tributes Pour In for Vermont GOP Giant Jeffords\n\n                           (By Sam Hemingway)\n\n       The Jim Jeffords For Governor campaign camper was headed up \n     U.S. 2 toward East Montpelier in the summer of 1972 with the \n     candidate behind the wheel.\n       ``He almost drove off the road,'' recalled Bruce Post of \n     Essex, who was aboard the camper as a just-out-of-college \n     campaign volunteer. ``He was the world's worst driver.''\n       What Post also remembers from that day is that Jeffords, \n     Vermont's attorney general at the time, telling him about a \n     decision Jeffords had made to give no special treatment to a \n     powerful Republican who had run afoul of Vermont's \n     environmental laws.\n       ``He told me that day, `It might cost me my political \n     career, but it's not going to cost me my political \n     conscience,' `` Post remembered Monday, the day Jeffords \n     died.\n       Jeffords did lose the primary, but he went on to serve \n     seven terms in the U.S. House and three in the Senate. In \n     2001, his conscience led him to leave the GOP, a stunning \n     move that shifted control of the chamber to the Democrats.\n       Monday, Jeffords died shortly after 7 a.m. at Knollwood, a \n     retirement home for military veterans in Washington, D.C. He \n     was 80 and the last Republican to hold federal office elected \n     from Vermont.\n       ``While we are saddened by our father's passing, we take \n     comfort in the knowledge that he lived a full life, from the \n     hills of Vermont to the halls of Congress,'' Laura and \n     Leonard Jeffords, the senator's son and daughter, said in a \n     statement. ``We will miss his kindness, his good humor, and \n     his generosity of spirit.''\n       Jeffords, afflicted with Alzheimer's disease, had been in \n     declining health and had lived at Knollwood since retiring \n     from his Senate seat in 2006. Jeffords was a veteran of the \n     Navy and the Navy Reserve, but never served in combat. \n     Jeffords' wife, Elizabeth Daley Jeffords, died in 2007.\n       News of Jeffords' death Monday morning, first reported by \n     the Burlington Free Press, quickly spread across the state \n     and the nation.\n       ``Jim never lost the fiercely independent spirit that made \n     Vermonters, and people across America, trust and respect \n     him,'' President Barack Obama said in a statement.\n       ``Whatever the issue--whether it was protecting the \n     environment, supporting Americans with disabilities, or \n     whether to authorize the war in Iraq--Jim voted his \n     principles, even if it sometimes meant taking a lonely or \n     unpopular stance.''\n       In Vermont, Gov. Peter Shumlin mourned Jeffords' death. \n     Flags at public buildings across the state were lowered at \n     half-staff and will remain so through Saturday.\n       ``The passing of Senator Jim Jeffords will be felt \n     throughout Vermont and our country,'' Shumlin said in a \n     statement. ``We need more like Senator Jeffords. My heart \n     goes out to his children and extended family.''\n\n\n                              The maverick\n\n       Jeffords's maverick political instincts served in him good \n     stead as he navigated Vermont's shifting political currents \n     over 40 years, emphasizing his moderate positions as the \n     state leaned increasingly toward more liberal, Democratic \n     positions.\n       As a House member, he was the only Republican to vote \n     against President Ronald Reagan's tax cuts in 1981. In 1991, \n     he voted against George H.W. Bush's nomination of Clarence \n     Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court. He supported President Bill \n     Clinton's health care reform and, in 1999, voted against his \n     impeachment.\n       ``He was a partner in our work for Vermont, and he was a \n     friend,'' Sen. Patrick Leahy said of Jeffords in a statement. \n     ``He was a Vermonter through and through, drawn to political \n     life to make a difference for our state and nation. Part of \n     his legacy will also stand as an enduring chapter of the \n     Senate's history.''\n       Leahy and Jeffords both won their first elections to \n     federal office in 1974 and were rivals for a time. They grew \n     closer over the years as they worked on dairy issues and \n     others important to Vermont.\n       Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who won the election to replace \n     Jeffords in 2006, said Jeffords was a common-sense Vermonter \n     who accomplished a lot.\n       Sanders toyed with running against Jeffords in 2000 but \n     decided against it and said Monday he would have passed on \n     challenging Jeffords had Jeffords run for re-election in \n     2006.\n       ``Vermonters admired him because of his low-key and down-\n     to-earth qualities, and because of his obvious and strong \n     love of the state and the Vermont way of life,'' Sanders \n     said. ``He was an effective champion of education, disability \n     rights, the environment and the arts--and millions of \n     Americans have benefited from his efforts.''\n       Rep. Peter Welch, in an interview, spoke of how Jeffords \n     and his wife helped him during his successful run for the \n     House in 2006, and then in Welch's early months as a freshman \n     congressman.\n       ``He spoke softly but got a lot done,'' Welch said of \n     Jeffords'' career. ``There are colleagues of his in the House \n     who still remember him with great respect.''\n       Former Republican Gov. Jim Douglas said Jeffords ``will be \n     long remembered as a Vermonter who gave his all and his best \n     in every season of his storied career. As a friend, I will \n     miss him dearly.''\n       Republican Lt. Gov. Phil Scott said he fashioned his career \n     after the example set by Jeffords. ``He did what he felt was \n     right, not what he felt would make him popular,'' Scott said.\n\n\n                               The switch\n\n       Jeffords' decision to become an independent in 2001 rocked \n     the nation. His move changed the balance of power in the \n     Senate, which had been 50 Republicans and 50 Democrats.\n       The move cost his GOP colleagues their committee \n     chairmanships and, for Jeffords, the loss of several lifelong \n     friendships.\n       ``I have changed my party label, but I have not changed my \n     beliefs,'' Jeffords said in his May 24, 2001, speech at a \n     jam-packed Radisson Hotel in Burlington where he announced \n     the switch.\n       ``Indeed, my decision is about affirming the principles \n     that have shaped my career. I hope that the people of Vermont \n     will understand it. I hope in time that my colleagues will as \n     well. I am confident that it is the right decision.''\n       The move catapulted Jeffords to rock-star national \n     prominence, praised by Democrats and vilified by Republicans.\n       He wrote later that even members of his family opposed his \n     decision. Sen. Trent Lott, R-La., and a member of the Singing \n     Senators quartet along with Jeffords, fumed that Jeffords had \n     carried out a ``coup of one.''\n       In the aftermath, Jeffords appeared on the covers of \n     Newsweek and Time magazines in the same week. He also was the \n     subject of several death threats, requiring required him to \n     receive Capital Hill police protection for a time.\n       Back home, he was treated as a flat-out hero. His decision \n     to leave the GOP spawned a popular ``Thanks, Jim'' bumper \n     sticker and a special-edition beer called ``Jeezum Jim,'' a \n     reference to his modest nature and Vermonty accent.\n       ``I have never been prouder of anything I've done in my \n     life than being with him at that time, the time preceding the \n     announcement and the time after that,'' said Eric Smulson, \n     Jeffords' spokesman for 15 years. ``How he handled himself, \n     how he stood for his principles. He was a great statesman, a \n     great Vermonter, but an even better person.''\n       Others, including close friends and some Vermont Republican \n     leaders, were distraught about the 2001 decision.\n       ``I was very upset over it,'' said James Johnston of \n     Montpelier, a former Jeffords campaign adviser and close \n     personal friend. ``But I know he had good reason to do it at \n     the time.''\n       Johnston became emotional describing the loss of his old \n     friend.\n\n[[Page S5552]]\n\n       ``I guess I knew this day was coming,'' he said, choking up \n     as he spoke. ``I'm not so sure I'm ready to deal with it.''\n       Jeffords later wrote two books reflecting on his \n     controversial move: a 2001 explanation of his decision titled \n     ``My Declaration of Independence'' and a 2003 memoir, ``An \n     Independent Man.''\n\n\n                            A political life\n\n       Jeffords, the son of a Vermont Supreme Court justice, grew \n     up in Rutland, studied at Yale University, received his law \n     degree from Harvard University and entered politics in 1966, \n     winning a race for state Senate from Rutland County.\n       Two years later, he was elected attorney general, and soon \n     he became embroiled in a fight with International Paper's \n     plant in Ticonderoga, N.Y., regarding the discharge of \n     mercury-laden sludge into Lake Champlain.\n       Jeffords ran for governor in 1972, but many in the party \n     resented his liberal positions on the environment and other \n     matters, and he lost a bitter primary battle to Luther \n     Hackett, a business-oriented Republican.\n       ``He took it fine,'' said Bruce Post, recalling his time as \n     a volunteer with the Jeffords for Governor campaign. ``I \n     don't think he was bitter or anything.''\n       Hackett lost to Democrat Tom Salmon in the general \n     election. Two years later, Jeffords won the state's lone U.S. \n     House seat when incumbent Rep. Richard Mallory ran for U.S. \n     Senate.\n       Jeffords initially lived in a camper in Washington after \n     taking the House seat. He went on to win six House re-\n     election contests, then won a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1988 \n     when Sen. Robert T. Stafford, R-Vt., another Republican \n     moderate, retired.\n       Jeffords was a consistent champion of education, helping to \n     pass the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act as a \n     freshman House member and becoming so immersed in efforts to \n     support dairy farmers that he was dubbed ``Mr. Dairy.''\n       He also worked behind the scenes to help Soviet dissidents \n     Alexander Solzhenitsyn by secretly arranging Solzhenitzyn's \n     move to Cavendish, where the author lived for 18 years before \n     returning Russia. Jefford also aided Soviet dissident \n     Alexander Ginzburg after he was expelled from Russia in 1979.\n       During the Reagan years, Jeffords fought the president's \n     plans to cut back on environmental regulations and lower \n     taxes. In 1987, he was the only Republican House member to \n     vote with Democrats to pass a $12 billion tax increase. The \n     measure passed the House by a single vote.\n       Surveys of his votes by liberal and conservative groups \n     determined he leaned slightly toward liberal positions, and \n     Jeffords continued to irritate GOP leaders.\n       He supported gay-rights legislation, voted for a gun-\n     control measure after saying he opposed it and introduced a \n     bill to force power producers to lower their emissions.\n       Opinions are divided on what caused him to finally decide \n     to leave the Republican Party. Shortly before he made the \n     decision, he voted against President George W. Bush's budget, \n     saying it was too big on tax cuts and undercut spending on \n     education, child care, veterans and the environment.\n       Jeffords also might have been irked that the White House \n     had not invited him to an event celebrating the Vermont \n     winner of the teacher of the year, even though Jeffords was \n     chairman of chairman of the Senate education committee.\n       ``Looking ahead, I can see more and more instances where \n     I'll disagree with the president on very fundamental issues--\n     the issues of choice, the direction of the judiciary, tax-\n     and-spending decisions, missile defense, energy and the \n     environment, and a host of other issues, large and small,'' \n     Jeffords said in the speech announcing his decision.\n       Jeffords, who had just been re-elected to the Senate in \n     2000, vowed to run for re-election in 2006 and repeated that \n     assertion until 2005, when he abruptly scheduled a news \n     conference at the Sheraton Hotel and Conference Center in \n     South Burlington to announce he would leave the Senate at the \n     end of 2006.\n       ``I am feeling the aches and pains that come when you reach \n     70,'' he said in his speech. ``My memory fails me on \n     occasion, but Liz would probably argue that this has been \n     going on the last 50 years.''\n       Uncharacteristically, he took no questions at the news \n     conference, and appeared tired and unsteady on his feet.\n       Jeffords' funeral is set for 11 a.m. Friday at Grace \n     Congregational United Church of Christ in Rutland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/11/senate-section/article/S5552-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5552-S5553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            REMEMBERING 9/11\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today we remember 9/11. The President, \nFirst Lady and Vice President led a moment of silence at the White \nHouse this morning. The anniversary was observed at the Pentagon, at \nGround Zero in New York, and in a field in Shanksville, PA. Across the \ncountry, we are connected by the sadness we all feel as we reflect on \nthe lives lost, some 3,000 Americans, to this blatant act of terrorism.\n  We can all recall that moment. I recall looking down the Mall toward \nthe Washington Monument and watching the black smoke billowing across \nthe Mall from the Pentagon, where that deadly crash took the lives of \npassengers on that plane and innocent people working in defense of \nAmerica. That was a moment that will never be forgotten.\n  There's a Hebrew word used in the Old Testament known as ``selah.'' \nIt doesn't have an easy translation but it is meant to serve as a \npause-and-consider moment between passages. At 8:46 a.m. this morning, \nwe observed a moment of silence to remember those souls lost on that \nday. We should all experience a ``selah'' moment today because we will \nnever forget 9/11. Pause and consider, pause and remember.\n  Thirteen years later, we still live in the shadow of the fallen \ntowers of the World Trade Center and the attack on the Pentagon. Al \nQaeda brought its darkness to our shores and took the lives of innocent \npeople. President John F. Kennedy said, ``We are not here to curse the \ndarkness, but to light the candle that can guide us through that \ndarkness to a safe and sane future.''\n  It was in our bleakest moments in those tragic days that we found the \nlight. Remember the outpouring of compassion and common purpose that \nunited us on 9/11 and for weeks after. The attacks were the worst \nhumanity could provide. Our response as a people was the best. The \nAmerican people are always the candle that guides us.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I rise today to remember the precious \nlives lost 13 years ago in New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania. Our \nperception of the world changed in very dramatic ways by sunset on that \nday of infamy and we awoke on September 12 to what we believed to be a \nmuch more dangerous reality. We have learned a number of lessons since \nthat day. Some were crystal clear almost immediately while others \nrequired us to walk a more difficult path to gain clarity. As we \nreflect on the 13th anniversary of \n9/11, I would like to remind my colleagues of the two principles that \ncan serve as our anchor amidst uncertainty and stormy circumstances.\n  First is that the followers of Osama bin Laden turned the openness \nand freedom of American society against us by savagely using civilian \npassenger jets as missiles to demolish the Twin Towers of the World \nTrade Center and destroy a large section of the Pentagon. They wield \nthe weapons of fear, chaos, and destruction. We must remember that our \nfoundation is built on freedom, justice, and equality. The greatest \nweapon in our arsenal is not a munition or aircraft but our light that \nremains shining upon the hill. Ours is the greatest democracy this \nplanet has ever known and that is why it is a threat to those who seek \ndarkness and destruction. We build, we progress, we encourage, we \nrespect, but we do not sink to the level of our adversaries even if \nthat means the fight is not fair. I am reminded of the words of \nPresident Kennedy, who said, ``In the long history of the world, only a \nfew generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its \nhour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from this responsibility--I \nwelcome it.''\n  The second principle that we must remember is that the United States \nof America remains an indispensable Nation and to those to whom much is \ngiven, much is expected in return. We have a unique role in the world \nto lead the international community in providing stability, \nhumanitarian relief, and defense of the innocent. Today we remain \nengaged in a war against elements of extremist terror organizations \nbent on the destruction of all people regardless of faith, nationality, \nor race who do not accept their tyrannical 9th century vision of the \nworld. They are unlike any enemy we have ever faced in that they \nrespect no boundaries, have no clear end, target civilians and \nservicemembers indiscriminately, and they are determined to make our \nhome front the front lines.\n  Thirteen years ago, as the attacks unfolded and we learned of the \nscope of the Al Qaeda network, we all questioned how our Nation would \nrespond and whether we could recover. But as the days rolled by and we \nsaw the determination, the compassion, and the commitment of so many \nindividuals giving freely of their time and their money to help those \naffected by the attacks, we laid that question to rest. The bravery, \nresourcefulness, and the shared sense of purpose we witnessed that day \nand every day since 9/11 have\n\n[[Page S5553]]\n\nshown the world the ``stuff'' of which Americans are made: an \nunquenchable love of freedom and an unwavering commitment to democracy. \nI have heard it said that 9/11 did not test America's character; it \nrevealed it.\n  For the better part of the 20th century the United States and our \nallies fought a successful battle against the genocidal forces of \nfascism and totalitarianism. We defeated the Nazis. We won the Cold \nWar. In the bloody struggle between ideologies, democratic governments \ntriumphed over repressive regimes.\n  Since that day, we have consecrated the time and place where these \nterrorist acts occurred. We have commemorated the brave and dedicated \nindividuals who faced 9/11 and its consequences head-on. We have \nhonored and laid to rest our fallen war heroes. We have rebuilt the \nmangled section of the Pentagon, honored Flight 77's bravery in the \nPennsylvania countryside and returned Ground Zero in New York City to \nthe world's vibrant center of economic activity. When I think of these \nlocations, I am reminded of the words President Lincoln delivered at \nGettysburg that ``we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot \nhallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, \nhave consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract''.\n  We have also made mistakes but we acknowledge and learn from those \nmistakes.\n  I believe we will prevail against this enemy for the same reason we \nhave been victorious in previous conflicts: the overwhelming majority \nof people in the world want freedom and justice and dignity and \nopportunity. I am confident because America remains a beacon of hope to \nthe oppressed everywhere. I am confident because I know this generation \nwill meet all challenges and threats we face as a Nation as \nsuccessfully as we met the challenges and threats of the last century. \nWe must remain clear-eyed as to identity and objectives of our enemy \nand the distinction between us. We cannot shrink when the oppressed cry \nfor freedom and the enslaved call for justice.\n  The 9/11 anniversary is especially poignant this year as it falls \njust 3 days short of the bicentennial of the Star-Spangled Banner, our \nNational Anthem. The greatest navy in the world bombarded Fort McHenry \nfor 25 hours, starting on September 13, 1814. British troops were \npoised to move into Baltimore after Fort McHenry fell. The Nation's \ncapital was in flames; the Nation's future was in grave doubt. And \nthen, an amazing thing happened: Fort McHenry did not fall to the \nBritish. A huge, glorious flag was flying over the fort as dawn broke \non September 14, 1814. The British forces retreated. One of the darkest \nhours in America's history turned into one of its brightest moments, \nand Maryland lawyer Francis Scott Key was inspired to write the Star-\nSpangled Banner.\n  We will have additional challenges in the months and years ahead. But \nwe must never forget the sacrifice previous generations of Americans \nhave made to safeguard our liberty. And we must never forget that our \nenemies fight because they have so little freedom while we Americans \nfight because we have so much freedom and that makes all the \ndifference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/11/senate-section/article/S5553-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING CANYONLANDS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, thank you for the opportunity today to \npay tribute to a timeless feature of Utah's beautiful geography: \nCanyonlands National Park. This week, citizens of Utah and friends \naround the United States join together in celebration of the 50th \nanniversary of the establishment of Canyonlands National Park. As one \nof the ``Mighty Five'' national parks in Utah, the Canyonlands \ncelebrate a landmark anniversary, and are a source of great pride for \nUtahns and the outdoors community nationwide.\n  Canyonlands National Park is located in the southeast of our State \nwhere the otherworldly cliffs, recesses, and red rock attract climbing, \nmountain biking, and rafting enthusiasts from across the globe. Anyone \nwho walks down Main Street in Moab can hear languages from German to \nJapanese to English, as well as accents from all over America. People \nplan and save for years to visit Utah to behold the invulnerable \nlandscapes of the Canyonlands. As one stands on the edge of a 1,000-\nfoot cliff, while seeing hundreds of miles in all directions, nature \nsomehow puts life in perspective.\n  This perspective gained should not be underestimated. There is a \nstory in common between those who visit the park and the land they \nexperience. It is a story told in rock layers that echo ancient seas, \ncoastal mud flats, braided streambeds, and wind-blown dunes hundreds of \nfeet thick. It is the story of time and change, to which all of God's \ncreation is subject. Clues to this past lie preserved in stone, along \nthe walls of deep gorges where great rivers once roared. The three main \nregions of Canyonlands: the Island in the Sky, Needles, and the Maze, \nwere once an environment quite different and more luscious. In what is \nnow desert, shallow seas once ebbed and flowed. In many ways the story \nof Canyonlands is a story of transformation, and this is something to \nwhich we can all relate. We are reminded of the hunter-gatherer peoples \nwho once flourished in Canyonlands by the Native American rock art, in \nthe ``Great Gallery'' region, that dates back as early as 2000 BC. When \nI consider those painted figures together with the mosaic of colors, \nshapes, and pinnacles of Canyonlands, I, like many others, recall the \nenduring relationship between man and nature. It is this continuing \nlegacy that we call our attention to today.\n  We owe a debt of gratitude to the people, both elected officials and \ncitizens, who possessed the foresight to recognize the value of \nCanyonlands and created the park 50 years ago. These efforts did not \ncome without controversy and today much controversy remains. The area \naround the park holds diverse importance to the local community and a \nvariety of stakeholders. Many spend their free time exploring over \n2,500 miles of roads around the park in four-wheel drive vehicles while \nothers find a special peace in the solitude of the Canyonlands desert. \nThese interests may seem in conflict, but the vast lands of Utah amply \naccommodate the equally vast spectrum of pursuits.\n  For several years now, the Utah congressional delegation has been \ndeveloping a public lands bill that will bring certainty and balance to \nthe areas around Canyonlands and other landscapes in Utah. The land \nsurrounding the national park would be protected with designations to \nensure that our grandchildren can stand on the same red rock cliffs to \nlook at the glorious sunsets that our pioneer ancestors saw and view \nvistas people from around the world come to see today. The bill will \nbenefit our children by exchanging State lands in areas that do not \nproduce revenues, with Federal lands that can be developed responsibly. \nThe revenues derived, as a result of the thoughtful development enabled \nby these exchanges, will benefit school children in Utah. Only Congress \ncan make these changes to the way our public lands are managed. At a \ntime of congressional dysfunction, this is one area of positive \nhappenings.\n  What better way to celebrate the anniversary of Canyonlands National \nPark than by bringing certainty to a region that has been denied \nstability for one-half century? I am proud to be a part of this ongoing \nprocess to protect the land surrounding Canyonlands National Park.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/11/senate-section/article/S5553-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5553-S5554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMERICORPS PROGRAM ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I wish to commemorate the 20th \nanniversary of the AmeriCorps program.\n  I want to take a moment to say thank you--thank you to all of the \nvolunteers and service workers out there. They are selflessly taking \ntime out of their lives to help their fellow Americans in times of \nneed. They are the ones out there building homes, clearing thousands of \nacres of forest burnt by wildfires, tutoring and mentoring our \nchildren, and assisting the elderly. They are unflagging, unflinching, \nand determined to make a difference.\n  National service has always been a passion of mine. When we started \nin the 1970s with the establishment of a domestic volunteer corps--\nsimilar to Peace Corps--I wanted to capture the fervor, the passion, \nand dynamic qualities of a social movement that would bring people to \narms wielding change. At some point, it seemed we lost sight of what \nAlexis de Tocqueville called\n\n[[Page S5554]]\n\n``habits of the heart''--neighbor helping neighbor. I wanted to help \nturn the ME generation into the WE generation.\n  That is why in 1989 I, along with Senators Kennedy and Nunn, \nintroduced the National and Community Service Act--a bill to establish \nthe Corporation for National and Community Service to oversee and \ncoordinate our national volunteer efforts. This important legislation \nalso created a demonstration program that has since evolved into what \nwe know today as AmeriCorps.\n  I believe that AmeriCorps is the embodiment of the spirit of \nvolunteerism and service to our country. When creating this program, I \ndid not just want to create another government program. I did not want \nthis to be another bureaucratic agency. What I wanted to do was capture \nthe fervor, passion, and dynamic qualities of a social movement that \nwould bring people to arms wielding change. I think we were successful \nin doing just that.\n  I am so proud of what AmeriCorps has accomplished and become. I never \ndreamt that I would be standing here 20 years later knowing that the \nAmeriCorps program would be the force that it is today. The data \ndoesn't lie--it is quite impressive. Over the past 20 years, more than \n820,000 AmeriCorps members have served our communities and country, \nproviding more than 1 billion hours of service.\n  My home State of Maryland is lucky. We have 1,600 AmeriCorps members, \nand 5,400 Senior Corps members. Their stories are poignant, whether it \nis a Teach for America Corps member helping a child with long division \nafter school, or a National Civilian Community Corps member helping \nrestore order to communities after a devastating storm or an AmeriCorps \nmember helping veteran families readjust to civilian life. Every day, \nnational service changes lives. They all meet compelling human needs by \nhelping out in our neighborhoods and communities across the country.\n  I used to be a social worker for Baltimore, but now I am a social \nworker for America, and I believe civic responsibility is worth \ninvesting in. I want to continue to make sure that we make this kind of \ninvestment in AmeriCorps because the next generation is carrying the \ntorch for national service. We must remember that it is not only young \npeople signing up to serve their country. It is seniors serving as a \nfoster grandparent to children who have been abused or neglected. It is \nveterans trading in their uniforms to work with Habitat for Humanity, \nbuilding homes for their fellow service members. It is seasoned \nprofessionals heading into the corps, trading in corporate cubicles for \nclassrooms and putting their real-world education to use. The next \ngeneration knows the importance of national service. Their dedication \nto its mission is inspiring.\n  Five years ago, I was at Mercy Hospital in Baltimore recovering from \nankle surgery. An aide was helping me get back in bed and asked me if I \nknew Senator Kennedy. She said, ``They tell me you had something to do \nwith National Service. I was in AmeriCorps.'' She was working in modest \nmeans--she had heard you could work parttime, earn a bachelor's degree \nfrom college, and that there wasn't an age limit. At the local health \ndepartment, she started to do some outreach. Her supervisor told her, \n``You have a real talent.'' This woman said, ``People like me are never \ntold they have a talent, but I found I had a talent by working for \nAmeriCorps.'' Through an AmeriCorps stipend, she completed her degree \nin social work and helped her grandson get into college. She is just \none of the many who have been touched by AmeriCorps, who have changed \nthe lives of others through service.\n  These stories and the work that AmeriCorps volunteers do give me \nprofound hope, because while one person can make a difference, together \nwe can make a change. I am so pleased to celebrate the 20th anniversary \nof the AmeriCorps program and look forward to the next 20 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/11/senate-section/article/S5554-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5554-S5555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I wish to recognize the bicentennial \nof our national anthem, the Star Spangled Banner, and of Defenders Day. \nI thank Senator Cardin, my partner in the Senate, for submitting a \nresolution to commemorate this occasion. Defenders Day, which inspired \nour national anthem, is momentous in the history of our Nation, the \nState of Maryland, and the City of Baltimore.\n  Two hundred years ago, the brave City of Baltimore led the way in the \nWar of 1812 defending our Nation and holding the American line. Our \ntroops stopped the British advance and claimed a much-needed victory \nfor Baltimore and for the Nation.\n  Some call the War of 1812 the forgotten war. I believe it was the war \nthat forged our Nation. As the United States entered the war, it was a \nloose collection of States. As we emerged from it, we were on the path \nto becoming a true Nation.\n  It was also during this war at the Battle of Baltimore that we gained \nan enduring icon of national patriotism in our National anthem, \ninspired by the naval battle at Fort McHenry. Fort McHenry is now a \nrevered National monument and a historic shrine.\n  The Battle of Baltimore was a rousing victory in the dark days \nfollowing the British attack on our Capitol. The British had just \nburned Washington, setting our Capitol and White House ablaze, and \nhurting America's morale.\n  Less than a month later, the British sent a fleet of ships toward \nBaltimore sailing up the Bay to break America at the war's frontline in \nwhat is known today as Patterson Park, but first they had to get past \nFort McHenry.\n  The British bombed the Fort for twenty-five consecutive hours. \nNearby, a young lawyer named Francis Scott Key watched from a ship \nwhere he was being held. When the smoke cleared on the morning of \nSeptember 14, 1814, he saw the fifteen stars and fifteen stripes of the \nAmerican flag streaming over the Fort. He was so thrilled that despite \nthe bombs bursting in the air, ``our flag was still there.'' He went on \nto write the lines of the song that later became our National anthem, \nthe Star Spangled Banner.\n  That day the line was held in Baltimore in our young country's war \nagainst the world's most powerful Nation. Fort McHenry has made \nhistory, and Fort McHenry has seen history. I am proud to represent \nFort McHenry and Baltimore, and I encourage the passage of this \nresolution commemorating Fort McHenry, Defenders Day, and the Star \nSpangled Banner.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I rise today to commemorate the \nbicentennial anniversary of the War of 1812's Battle of Baltimore. The \nState of Maryland is proud of its contributions to this ``Second War \nfor Independence,'' which reinforced United States sovereignty and gave \nbirth to our national anthem. While Star-Spangled 200 events are \nalready underway in my home State, I wish to spend a few minutes to \ndiscuss the War of 1812 and the story of Francis Scott Key's poem \n``Defense of Fort M'Henry.''\n  A generation after the United States declared its independence from \nGreat Britain, the mercantilist ties between the two countries were not \nfully severed. The British impressed American merchant seamen, enforced \nillegal and unfair trade regulations, colluded with certain Native \nAmerican tribes to attack frontier settlements, and attempted to block \nwestward expansion. The United States declared war to reassert autonomy \nover its own affairs, establish free trade, protect sailors' rights, \nand ensure that our Nation could prosper from sea to shining sea.\n  President James Madison eloquently outlined these justifications more \nthan 200 years ago when he called on ``all the good people of the \nUnited States, as they love their country, as they value the precious \nheritage derived from the virtue and valor of their fathers . . . . . \n[to] exert themselves in preserving order, in promoting concord, in \nmaintaining the authority and efficacy of the laws, and in supporting \nand invigorating all the measures which may be adopted by the \nconstituted authorities for obtaining a speedy, a just, and an \nhonorable peace.''\n  The contributions of the U.S. Navy were instrumental in repelling the \nBritish during the War of 1812. The U.S. Navy barely had a dozen \nwarships compared to the hundreds of ships comprising the British \nfleet. British ships were undermanned, however, while well-trained and \ntalented officers and seamen took command of American ships. These men \nwere largely from coastal States, like Maryland, and\n\n[[Page S5555]]\n\nwere accustomed to seafaring. Master Commandant Oliver Hazard Perry \ntook on the British Navy on Lake Erie in 1813 with a scrappy fleet of \nlight ships. Even though his force was seemingly decimated by the \nBritish, Master Commandant Perry resorted to paddling a rowboat with a \nbanner that read ``Don't Give up the Ship.'' He then boarded the USS \nNiagara, double-loaded the carronades, and sailed directly into the \nBritish line, ultimately claiming victory.\n  The following summer, in 1814, the British Navy sailed up the \nChesapeake Bay to attack our Nation's capital and seize the valuable \nport city of Baltimore. The British dealt heavy blows to Washington, \nDC, setting both the U.S. Capitol and the Executive Mansion--which we \nnow know as the White House--ablaze. British forces then moved toward \nBaltimore. Citizens of Baltimore, including free Blacks, quickly \nmobilized to protect their city. Barricades stretching more than one \nmile long were constructed to protect the harbor, hulls were sunk to \nimpede navigation, and a chain of masts was erected across the harbor \nentrance. When the British fleet approached Baltimore at North Point, \nMarylanders fought the British Army and helped repulse the British Navy \nfrom Fort McHenry during the Battle of Baltimore. It is important to \nnote that American forces during the Battle of North Point were \nvolunteer militia, heavily outnumbered by the highly trained British \ninfantry, but they managed to delay the British forces long enough for \n10,000 American reinforcements to arrive, preventing a land attack \nagainst Baltimore. Following 25 hours of intense British naval \nbombardment at Fort McHenry by more than 1,600 cannonballs, the \nAmerican defenders refused to yield, and the British were forced to end \nthe Chesapeake Campaign and withdraw.\n  During the British bombardment, American lawyer Francis Scott Key, \nwho was being held on board an American flag-of-truce vessel in \nBaltimore Harbor, took notice of the American flag still flying atop \nFort McHenry. Key realized then that the Americans had survived the \nbattle and had stopped the enemy advance. He was so moved by the sight \nof the American flag flying following the horrific bombardment, he \ncomposed a poem called ``The Defense of Fort M'Henry,'' which was \npublished in the Baltimore Patriot & Advertiser newspaper later that \nyear. This poem, and later the song, inspired love of country among the \nAmerican people and not only helped usher in the ``era of good \nfeelings'' immediately after the war, but became a timeless reminder of \nAmerican resolve. ``The Star Spangled Banner'' officially became our \nnational anthem in 1931. The flag that flew over Fort McHenry and \ninspired this anthem is now a national treasure on display at the \nSmithsonian Institution, a very short distance from where we are today.\n  The War of 1812 confirmed the legitimacy of the Revolution and served \nas a critical test for the U.S. Constitution and newly established \ndemocratic government. Our young Nation battled against the largest, \nmost powerful military on the Earth at that time and emerged with an \nenhanced standing among the countries of the world, both militarily and \ndiplomatically. The U.S. economy was freed of its dependence on British \ngoods, which unleashed domestic manufacturing and spawned the \nindustrial revolution. The U.S. Navy proved its worth and the U.S. \nCongress rewarded the Navy with funding for a permanent, more expansive \nfleet. A new generation of Americans too young to remember Lord \nCornwallis's surrender at Yorktown, which effectively ended the \nRevolutionary War, and an older generation proud of defending American \nindependence twice in their lifetimes, were inspired by Francis Scott \nKey's words, which embody our universal feelings of patriotism and \ncourage.\n  I am proud that Maryland will lead the Star-Spangled 200 celebration, \na 3-year celebration that began with Baltimore's ``Sailabration'' in \nJune 2012. The Navy's Blue Angels treated more than 1.5 million \nspectators to dazzling air shows; the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra \npremiered the ``Overture for 2012,''' composed by Philip Glass; and \nforty-six tall ships and naval warships from around the world anchored \nin the Inner Harbor, open for public tours. Through the course of 2014, \nMaryland will host numerous events along the Star-Spangled Banner \nNational Historic Trail to commemorate the Chesapeake Campaign, and at \nthe Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine to celebrate the \nbicentennial of the Battle of Baltimore. This weekend, the Star-\nSpangled Spectacular celebration will conclude with a fireworks display \nover Fort McHenry that Francis Scott Key would be proud of. These \nceremonies are an opportunity to showcase to the world that Maryland is \nan exceptional place with a rich, colorful, and important history.\n  I am also proud that the U.S. Senate unanimously adopted a resolution \nI sponsored in the 112th Congress--S. Res. 388--to mark the beginning \nof the bicentennial of the War, to celebrate the heroism of the \nAmerican people during the conflict, and to recognize the various \norganizations involved in the bicentennial celebration, including the \nU.S. Armed Forces, the National Park Service, and the Maryland War of \n1812 Bicentennial Commission.\n  The Senate may soon consider another resolution I have sponsored, \nalong with my colleagues, the senior Senator from Maryland (Ms. \nMikulski) and the junior Senator from Mississippi (Mr. Wicker), to \ncommemorate the bicentennial of the Battle of Baltimore and the \ncreation of the Star-Spangled Banner, which officially became our \nnational anthem in 1931. As we recognize all of these ongoing efforts \nduring this commemorative period, I encourage all Americans to remember \nthe sacrifice of those who gave their lives to defend our Nation's \nfreedom and democracy in its infancy, and to join in the bicentennial \ncelebration of our victory in the War of 1812.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/11/senate-section/article/S5555-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RECOGNIZING PAM HAZE\n\n  Mr. REED.

Haze, who retired from the U.S. Department of the Interior \nthis past August after 34 years of Federal service.\n  Ms. Haze served as the Department's Deputy Assistant Secretary for \nBudget, Finance, Performance and Acquisition for the past 5 years. Her \nmost recent position was the culmination of many years of experience \nworking in various capacities within the Department's budget office. \nHer career prior to that time was spent in other bureaus of the \nDepartment, where Pam worked as a biologist and hydrologist, and served \nin other management roles with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the \nU.S. Geological Survey, the Bureau of Land Management, and the Bureau \nof Outdoor Recreation.\n  As the primary liaison between the Department and the Senate and \nHouse Committees on Appropriations, Pam has been an indispensable and \ntrusted adviser. I have had the good fortune as chairman of the \nInterior Appropriations Subcommittee to both work and travel with Pam, \nmost notably on a trip to Alaska that included our subcommittee's \nranking member, Senator Lisa Murkowski, and former Secretary of the \nInterior Ken Salazar. I have witnessed firsthand Pam's dedication to \nthe Department's mission. She has worked tirelessly with me and my \nstaff during the annual appropriations process and we have steadily \nrelied on Pam's vast store of knowledge and keen insights to help \nresolve challenges that have arisen over the years.\n  The appropriations process simply would not be the same without her \nand the dedication, wisdom, and the good humor she brought to her work. \nI join with many in wishing her all the best as she begins a well-\ndeserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/11/senate-section/article/S5555-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5555-S5556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BETHEL MURDOCH CHURCH BICENTENNIAL\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN.

The Bethel \nMurdoch Presbyterian Church was founded in Warren County, OH, by a \nsmall group of faithful and passionate Christians.\n  In 1814, the Bethel Murdoch Presbyterian Church began when 12 pioneer \nsettlers to Warren County first met in a maple grove to worship. The \nlocation of their first meeting spot is the site of the Murdoch \nCemetery, where many of the early members are buried. The \ncongregation's current home is a 140-year-\n\n[[Page S5556]]\n\nold church building that was built with the financial assistance of \nJames Murdoch, a well-known Shakespearean actor at the time.\n  On September 14, 2014, the church will be holding a Service of \nCelebration, during which this small but strong congregation will \ncelebrate the anniversary of the church and all the good that it has \nbrought to the community.\n  I would like to personally extend my congratulations to the Bethel \nMurdoch Presbyterian Church on 200 years of faith, service and worship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/11/senate-section/article/S5556-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JACKIE MCKINSEY\n\n Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I wish to honor Mrs. Jackie \nMcKinsey of Springfield, MO, for her dedication and service to the \nOzarks Technical Community College, locally known as OTC. Twenty-four \nyears ago, McKinsey became a founding member of the board of trustees \nas the school began operations. McKinsey has been a guiding force in \nOTC's evolution into the dynamic school it is today, providing a wide \nrange of technical, highly sophisticated curricula for post-secondary \neducation for more than 14,000 students. Since 1990, OTC has \ntransitioned into a modern campus with a series of new facilities in \nSpringfield and the construction of a second campus with three \nadditional education centers.\n  McKinsey led the search committee that resulted in the hiring of the \ncurrent school president, Dr. Hal Higdon, in 2006. She has served in \nevery office on the board of trustees, including chairperson, and has \nbeen a tireless advocate for community colleges in Missouri.\n  In fact, Jackie McKinsey has dedicated her life to activism in \neducation. For 12 years she was a member of the Springfield School \nBoard and spent 2 years on the Missouri School Board Association. She \nalso served on the Missouri Special Education Advisory Board for 20 \nyears. In 1996, she was appointed by the Governor to the Missouri \nWomen's Council. Mrs. McKinsey is an experienced mediator and has \nserved as a trained hearing officer in cases between parents of special \neducation students and schools districts.\n  Jackie McKinsey announced her retirement last summer, and the board \nof trustees honored her with the title of trustee emeritus. McKinsey is \nthe fifth individual to receive this honor, joining other founding \ntrustees Dolores Brooks, Don Clinkenbeard, Frank Farmer, and Don \nWessel. This team of Springfieldians gave OTC the steady direction to \nbe a successful open admission, 2-year college dedicated to technical \neducation.

Madam President, Philadelphia, PA; Boston, MA; \nWashington, DC; San Diego, CA; Austin and Irving, TX; and Springfield, \nMO, are the seven cities represented by teams in the World Team Tennis, \nWTT, league. For the second year in a row, the Washington Kastles and \nthe Springfield Lasers met in the Mylan WTT finals. With similar \nresults as 2013, the Kastles prevailed at the Springfield home court, \nMediacom Stadium in the Cooper Tennis Complex. The Springfield Lasers \nwere the WTT Western Conference champions in 1999, 2001, and 2009. This \nyear's Springfield squad, led by head coach John-Laffnie de Jager, made \nthe finals with a changing roster of 12 different players rotating in \nand out of 4 spots on the team.\n  The Springfield Lasers are a remarkable story. The franchise was \npurchased and donated to the Springfield-Greene County Park Board in \n1996 by the Cooper family, who also donated funds for the municipal \ntennis complex. The complex includes 12 indoor tennis courts and 16 \noutdoor courts, including the center court stadium used for WTT events.\n  Now preparing for their 20th season, the Lasers are one of the oldest \nteams in the WTT league, and Springfield, by far, is the smallest \nmarket in the 40-year-old tennis league. However, the Lasers play in \nfront of big crowds--an average of more than 1,400 turned out for the \nfirst six home matches this season. The James Blake-Andy Roddick match \ndrew more than 2,400 spectators.\n  Harry and John Cooper and family continue to support the team as \ntheir biggest fans. The new Lasers' general manager, Paul Nahon, Jr., \nhas worked on building a fan base with a growing demand for season \ntickets. Nahon has hinted at more innovations to grow that base for the \nupcoming 2015 season.\n  The Springfield Lasers continue to make the State of Missouri proud \nwith their success, and I wish them many more years of great tennis, \ngrowing and building the fan base for tennis in my hometown.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/11/senate-section/article/S5556-3", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING ELVIRA CENOZ\n\n Mr. HELLER. Madam President, I wish to congratulate Elvira \nCenoz on her retirement from the Overland Hotel in Gardnerville, NV. \nDespite the name, the Overland is not actually a hotel, but one of the \nfinest places for a traditional Basque meal in Nevada.\n  Since its construction in 1908, the Overland Hotel has been a \nstopping point for many travelers making their way through Nevada. \nConveniently situated on America's First Transcontinental Highway, the \nLincoln Highway, the Overland Hotel has a long history of welcoming \nlocal ranchers, politicians, civic leaders, and weary travelers. The \nOverland Hotel has since become a place for the Basque culture to be \ncelebrated in Gardnerville. Nevada has a proud Basque history, and the \nOverland Hotel and Saloon embodies that long and rich tradition. The \nBasque people originally settled in Nevada due to our proud ranching \ntraditions. Their hearty cooking and family-centric meals quickly \nbecame a staple of Nevada's local cuisine.\n  The Overland Hotel is known throughout the State and to all of its \npatrons for its authentic Basque cuisine and charm, which is greatly \nattributed to Elvira and her late husband Eusebio Cenoz. Eusebio bought \nthe Overland Hotel in 1972 after many years as a sheep herder. He and \nElvira were married in 1980, and she joined her husband to run the \nrestaurant. She soon worked her way back to the kitchen, where she has \nremained until her retirement this year. Her love of cooking is \nexemplified in the menu of the Overland Hotel, which changes daily. The \nOverland Hotel is not just known for its great food, but also for its \nfriendly service, further embodying the spirit of the Silver State. \nPatrons are often pleasantly surprised when Elvira herself greets them \nwarmly at their table and takes their orders.\n  Throughout her years owning and operating the Overland Hotel, Elvira \nhas demonstrated a commitment to preserving and sharing the Basque \ntradition. I am both humbled and honored by her many years of hard work \nand am proud to call her a fellow Nevadan. Today, I ask my colleagues \nto join me in congratulating Mrs. Cenoz on her much deserved \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/11/senate-section/article/S5556-4", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5556-S5557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRATULATING JUAN GUZMAN\n\n Mr. HELLER. Madam President, I congratulate Juan Guzman on his \nretirement from his career as Carson City's open space manager. As a \nlongtime resident of Carson City, I have had the pleasure of getting to \nknow and work with Juan and have seen the impact his contributions have \nmade within the Carson community. It gives me great pleasure to \ncongratulate him on his retirement after 14 years of hard work and \ndedication to the Silver State.\n  Juan, a native of Puerto Rico, earned his degree in geography from \nthe University of Puerto Rico and then went on to complete his graduate \nstudies in the geography department with an emphasis on urban studies \nat the University of California. Upon the completion of his studies, \nJuan began his career as a planner in California. After a trip to\n\n[[Page S5557]]\n\nthe Sierra Nevadas, Juan decided to make the move to Nevada, where he \nbecame an associate planner in the community development department. He \nworked in Douglas County for 5 years before eventually settling in \nCarson City, where he began work in a similar capacity. His diligent \nwork and commitment to the betterment of the Carson community did not \ngo without public recognition, and when the position of open space \nmanager was created in 2000, he transitioned from the community \ndevelopment's planning division to open space within the parks and \nrecreation department.\n  During his tenure, Juan is credited with opening up 14 areas for \nrecreational purposes and for natural preservation as well as acquiring \nseveral land transfers from the Federal government. I had the privilege \nof working closely with Juan on the Carson City Community Vital Act, \npublic lands legislation I introduced while serving in the U.S. House \nof Representatives that enhanced open space opportunities, strengthened \nflood control measures, and ensured easy public access to Bureau of \nLand Management and Forest Service lands surrounding Carson City. That \nbill, which became law in 2009, still serves as an example in Congress \non how an intensive collaborative process between the public and \nofficials at the local and Federal levels can yield positive results \nfor an entire region. Without Juan, this legislation would have never \ncome together, let alone become law.\n  While we will all miss Juan, his impact in the Carson City community \nwill live on. He exemplifies the highest standards of leadership and \ncommunity service and should be proud of his long and meaningful \ncareer. Today, I ask that all of my colleagues join me in \ncongratulating Juan on his retirement, and I offer my deepest \nappreciation for all that Juan has done to make the great State of \nNevada an even better place. I offer my best wishes for many successful \nand fulfilling years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/11/senate-section/article/S5557-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5557-S5559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Sergeant John A.

After two Afghan soldiers in \nthe group were wounded, he left his position to provide medical \nassistance when he was shot and killed.\n  ``Sgt. Buddy Hughie was a great American,'' said LTC Bobby Yandell, \ncommander of the 1st Battalion, 180th Infantry. ``Sgt. Hughie was one \nof those soldiers that you did not have to worry about; he always did \nthe right thing. We mourn his loss, but celebrate the life of a great \nsoldier.'' Buddy, who previously deployed to Afghanistan in 2002-2003, \nvolunteered to return to the country, Yandell said.\n  More than 600 people filled Poteau High School's Sherman Floyd \nFieldhouse to honor Buddy's life.

Trevor felt \n``God is calling me to go work for these children in the foreign \nmission field,'' said his father, Chuck. While in Iraq, seeing the \nplight of the people solidified in his mind that he wanted to be a \nmissionary, Roberts' parents said. ``He saw some stuff he did not want \nto have to see,'' Chuck Roberts said. ``It hurt him. He could look at \nthe Iraqi people and see their hurt and their pain, and he could also \nsee their joy. He could look in their eyes and just see.''\n  Trevor was preceded in death by his grandfather Carl Roberts.

For \nsome reason, this is one such thing. How fast life can change on us. \nOver here, it might be a firefight or a roadside bomb that makes a \nnormal drive a stir of chaos. Things most definitely don't always work \nout the way we dream and hope, but we have to keep going, for you never \nknow what tomorrow might bring.''\n  Today we remember Marine Corps LCpl Trevor A.

Williams\n\n  Madam President, it is my honor also to pay tribute to the life and \nsacrifice of Army SGT Clint E. Williams, of Kingston, OK, who died on \nSeptember 14, 2006, of injuries sustained after an improvised explosive \ndevice detonated near his vehicle while serving his Nation in Baghdad, \nIraq.\n  Born August 6, 1982, in Durant, OK, Clint graduated from Kingston \nHigh School in 2001 where he was the senior class president and a \nmember of the baseball team.\n  He joined the Army in April 2003 and was assigned to the 1st \nSquadron, 10th Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, \nFort Hood, TX. He previously deployed to Iraq from October 2003 through \nNovember 2004 and returned in November 2005.\n  In June 2006, he was seriously wounded after a bomb exploded near him \noutside of Hawr Rajab south of Baghdad. Although the explosion killed a \nfellow soldier, Clint kept firing on enemy positions, held his ground \nand ran more than 300 meters to get additional fire support despite \nreceiving wounds to his legs and hand. A fearless man, his favorite \nquote was ``All one really needs in life is a few good pals and \ntogether they can take on anything in life.'' Even after being injured \nin that battle, he volunteered for dangerous duty on raids rather than \nsit and wait for battle.\n  A memorial service was held on September 23, 2006 at Jerald Barton \nMemorial Gymnasium in Kingston, OK.\n  At the memorial service, his friend B.J. Bush recalled Clint as ``a \ngood ol' boy with a knife in his front pocket and a can of snuff in the \nback. He was happiest with his gun and bow sighted in and his pole \nrigged with hook and line.'' He was laid to rest in Willis Cemetery, \noverlooking his beloved Lake Texoma.\n  Clint is survived by his father Lavoyed Williams; mother Marci \nSprouse; three brothers Duron Williams, Dalton Williams and Daniel \nWilliams; sister Jessica Williams; grandmothers Jean Williams and Nancy \nSprouse; grandfather Jack Sprouse; and two nephews Jarren Williams and \nDevin Williams.\n  Today we remember Army SGT Clint E. Williams, a young man who loved \nhis family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for \nfreedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/11/senate-section/article/S5559-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5559-S5560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRATULATING TASSO de CASTRO LUGON\n\n Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I wish to extend warm wishes and \ngratitude to my dear friend, Tasso de Castro Lugon, who is retiring \nafter a lifetime of outstanding public service as a southwestern \nBrazilian judge in his State of Espirito Santo and as a member and \nformer chairman of the Partners of the Americas.\n  I first met Tasso when I served as Secretary of State of West \nVirginia and have had the pleasure of working with him continuously as \nGovernor and now as a Senator. We immediately established a friendship \nover shared philosophies, including the importance of forging \nmeaningful relationships, working together for the common good, and \ncreating lasting connections with the people we represent--something I \nalso like to call retail government.\n  In West Virginia we value hard work, loyalty, and our cultural \npractice of neighbors helping neighbors. These values depict who we are \nas West Virginians and as Americans, which is why I am so very honored \nto congratulate Tasso on not only his countless achievements throughout \nhis professional career but also his devotion to always staying true to \nthose defining principles.\n  Always committed to the rule of law, Tasso served as a judge in the \nBrazilian court throughout his career. But true to his staunch \ndedication to building long-lasting relationships with local \ncommunities and those abroad, Tasso also became a member of the \nPartners of the Americas for 36 years before\n\n[[Page S5560]]\n\nreaching the pinnacle of his career serving as chairman of the board.\n  Throughout his tenure, Tasso has upheld an unfailing devotion to the \nfriendship between the sister States of Espirito Santo and West \nVirginia. From the shores and peaks of Espirito Santo to the mountains, \nvalleys, and rivers of the Mountain State, our friendship grew out of a \ncommon bond of respect to strengthening the relationship between our \nsister States. I cannot thank Tasso enough for cultivating that respect \nthrough a lifetime of unwavering service and dedication.\n  West Virginians will continue to advance in many endeavors based on \nthe new relationships and contacts that Tasso has formed, and our State \nwill continue to benefit from his promotion of cultural, economic, and \neducational development between North and South America.\n  I join my fellow West Virginians in sending our warmest regards to \nTasso and his family for a happy and healthy retirement. We are deeply \ngrateful for his loving and carefree spirit that he has dedicated to a \nlifetime of public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/11/senate-section/article/S5560-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO EDITH MESSINA\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, today I congratulate Judge \nEdith Messina on her retirement from the 16th Circuit Judicial Court of \nJackson County and to thank her for her many years of leadership and \nservice. For over 30 years, Judge Messina demonstrated exceptional \nlitigation skills, judicial integrity, and professionalism while \nserving the State of Missouri. I am pleased to recognize her \noutstanding career today.\n  Judge Messina, a native of Kansas City, MO, received her bachelor's \ndegree in English Literature and her master of science in counseling \npsychology from Avila University. Upon graduation, Judge Messina served \nin the Peace Corps in northern Nigeria where she taught and worked to \nadvance community development. She returned to Kansas City and obtained \nher juris doctor degree from the University of Missouri-Kansas City in \n1974.\n  Prior to her appointment by Governor Bond in 1984, Judge Messina \nworked in private practice and as an assistant public defender. She \nbecame the first female circuit judge in Jackson County, and in January \n1998 the first woman to serve as the 16th Circuit Court's presiding \njudge. As an administrative judge for the Criminal Court and Family \nCourt, she played an instrumental role in establishing the Family Court \nDivision, which remains in place today.\n  In 2008, Judge Messina was honored by the Kansas City Metropolitan \nBar Association, KCMBA, with the ``Dean of the Trial Bar'' award for \nher longstanding commitment to law, legal knowledge and \nprofessionalism. She is well-known and admired for guiding and helping \nyoung lawyers develop their skills and pursue their passions which has \nmade a positive impact in the legal community. Beyond the courtroom, \nJudge Messina is an adjunct instructor for Avila University's MBA \nprogram.\n  Judge Messina's dedication to Missouri's judiciary for over 30 years \nhas helped improve the way our courts function today. Judge Messina is \na much-loved member of the Kansas City community and has left a lasting \nlegacy of public service.\n  I ask that the Senate join me in congratulating and honoring Judge \nEdith Messina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/11/senate-section/article/S5560-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:30 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2678.

Commission, \n     holding that independent spending on elections by \n     corporations and other groups could not be limited by \n     government regulations; and\n       Whereas, This decision rolled back the legal restrictions \n     on corporate spending in the electoral process, allowing for \n     the unlimited corporate spending to influence elections, \n     candidate selection and policy decisions; and\n       Whereas, In reaching this decision, a narrow majority of \n     the Supreme Court, relying on and expanding prior decisions, \n     interpreted the First Amendment of the Constitution to afford \n     corporations the same free speech protections as natural \n     persons; and\n       Whereas, The Supreme Court relied on other prior decisions \n     which afforded the spending, of money to influence elections \n     the full protection of the .First Amendment and disregarded \n     the distorting and corrupting effects of unlimited money in \n     elections; and\n       Whereas, In his eloquent dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens \n     rightly recognized that, ``corporations have no consciences, \n     no beliefs, no feelings, no thoughts, no desires. \n     Corporations help structure and facilitate the activities of \n     human beings, to be sure, and their `personhood' often \n     observes as a useful legal fiction; But they are not \n     themselves members of `We the People' by whom and for whom \n     our Constitution was established''; and\n       Whereas, The court's decision in Citizens United severely \n     hampers the ability of federal, state and local governments \n     to enact reasonable campaign finance reforms and regulations \n     regarding corporate political activity; and\n       Whereas, Corporations should not be afforded the entirety \n     of protections or rights of natural persons, such that the \n     expenditure of corporate money to influence the electoral \n     process is a form of constitutionally protected speech; and\n       Whereas, In 2012 the same narrow majority of the Supreme \n     Court voted to strike down longstanding campaign finance laws \n     in the State of Montana without hearing any evidence or \n     argument on that state's own history and experience with \n     corporate spending and corruption; and\n       Whereas, Several proposed amendments to the Constitution \n     have been introduced in Congress that would allow government \n     to regulate the raising and spending of Money by corporations \n     to influence elections; and\n       Whereas, On Election Day, 2012, over six million voters \n     across the United States, including the states of Colorado \n     and Montana, had the opportunity to vote on state and local \n     ballot measures, calling for a constitutional amendment to \n     limit money in politics, and all proposed initiatives passed \n     overwhelmingly, averaging, seventy-five percent support: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That the Senate opposes the United \n     States Supreme Court is interpretation of the Constitution in \n     Citizens United v.

A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Florida applying to the United States Congress to \n     call a convention of the states, pursuant to Article V of the \n     United States Constitution, for the purpose of proposing \n     amendments to the United States Constitution to provide for a \n     balanced federal budget and limit the ability of Congress to \n     dictate to states requirements for the expenditure of federal \n     funds, and rescinding all previous applications of the State \n     of Florida for the calling of a federal constitutional \n     convention to amend the Constitution of the United States; to \n     the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 10\n\n       Whereas, fiscal discipline and economic integrity have been \n     core principles of American governance, and\n       Whereas, the American people have historically demanded the \n     same prudent, responsible, and intellectually honest \n     financial behavior from their elected representatives as \n     ultimately compels individual behavior, and\n       Whereas, it is the firm conviction of the Legislature of \n     the State of Florida that it is wrong to fund the prosperity \n     of the present generation by robbing future Americans of \n     their own, and\n       Whereas, mortgaging the birthright of our children and \n     grandchildren is a dangerous departure from traditional \n     American values which threatens to permanently undermine the \n     strength of our nation, and\n       Whereas, the national debt has nearly doubled over the past \n     8 years and Florida's share of that debt is $727 billion, \n     more than all Floridians make in wages and salaries in 2 \n     years, and\n       Whereas, for the nation to pay off the entire federal debt \n     by 2015, Congress would have to triple the federal income \n     taxes of every American and devote the increase exclusively \n     to debt payments, and\n       Whereas, our debt is increasingly owed to the governments \n     of foreign nations, not to the citizens of the United States; \n     therefore, our wealth is transferred to others and will not \n     be available to supply the means for America's future growth \n     and prosperity, and\n       Whereas, this generation will bequeath to its children one \n     of the world's most indebted industrial democracies, and\n       Whereas, high federal deficits cause increasingly high \n     payments for debt interest in the future, make future \n     borrowing more costly, reduce investment activity, and thus \n     reduce the size of the future economy, and\n       Whereas, the people of Florida recognized the wisdom of \n     fiscal discipline and enshrined in its State Constitution the \n     requirement for a balanced budget to place a prudent limit on \n     the tendencies of government, and\n       Whereas, the Florida Legislature has made fiscally \n     responsible decisions, maintaining a balanced budget and \n     saving the citizens of this State from crippling deficits, \n     massive debt burdens, and bankruptcy, and\n       Whereas, we the Legislature of the State of Florida call \n     for the Constitution of the United States to be amended to \n     require the Federal Government to operate with fiscal \n     responsibility, common sense, and the revenues granted to it \n     by the people, and\n       Whereas, the Federal Government has for too long relied on \n     revenue increases and borrowing against our future rather \n     than on prudent spending decisions within the limits of \n     current revenues, and\n       Whereas, lasting resolution of this nation's budget \n     deficit can be achieved only by addressing the spending \n     habits of our Federal Government, not by increasing the \n     tax burden under which our citizens already labor, and\n       Whereas, Article V of the Constitution of the United States \n     makes provision for amending the Constitution on the \n     application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the several \n     states, calling a convention for proposing amendments that \n     shall be valid to all intents and purposes if ratified by the \n     legislatures of three-fourths of the several states, or by \n     conventions in three-fourths thereof, as one or the other \n     mode of ratification may be proposed by Congress: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of Florida, the House \n     of Representatives Concurring:\n       That the Legislature of the State of Florida, with all due \n     respect and great reluctance, does hereby make application to \n     the Congress of the United States pursuant to Article V of \n     the Constitution of the United States to call an Article V \n     amendments convention for the sole purpose of proposing \n     amendments to the Constitution of the United States:\n       (1) To achieve and maintain a balanced budget by:\n       (a) Requiring that such balanced budget account for all \n     obligations of the Federal Government;\n       (b) Allowing flexibility in federal balanced budget \n     requirements by providing exceptions related to exigencies \n     such as national emergencies or threats to the nation's \n     security;\n       (c) Imposing spending limits on the Federal Government;\n       (d) Setting extraordinary vote requirements for new or \n     increased federal taxes and other revenues; and\n       (e) Prohibiting federal mandates on states to impose taxes \n     or fees.\n       (2) To control the ability of the Congress and the various \n     federal executive agencies to require states to expend funds \n     by:\n       (a) Limiting the ability of Congress and the various \n     federal executive agencies to pass legislation requiring \n     states to spend money or to take actions requiring the \n     expenditure of money unless federal funds are provided in \n     ongoing amounts sufficient to offset the full costs of such \n     requirements; and\n       (b) Limiting the ability of Congress to dictate to states \n     requirements for the expenditure of federal funds other than \n     such requirements as may be necessary to measure outcomes to \n     be achieved through the expenditure of the federal funds, \n     leaving to the several states the ability to decide how to \n     best accomplish those outcomes;

Res. 542\n\n       Whereas people in the United States are living longer, and \n     the cost of retirement is increasing significantly;\n       Whereas Social Security remains the bedrock of retirement \n     income for the great majority of the people of the United \n     States but was never intended by Congress to be the sole \n     source of retirement income for families;\n       Whereas recent data from the Employee Benefit Research \n     Institute indicates that, in the United States, only \n     approximately \\3/5\\ of workers or their spouses are saving \n     for retirement, and the amount that workers have saved for \n     retirement is much less than the amount they need to \n     adequately fund their retirement years;\n       Whereas the financial literacy of workers in the United \n     States is important to their understanding of the need to \n     save for retirement;\n       Whereas saving for retirement is a key component of overall \n     financial health and security during retirement years, and \n     the importance of financial literacy in planning for \n     retirement must be advocated;\n       Whereas many workers may not be aware of their options in \n     saving for retirement or may not have focused on the \n     importance of, and need for, saving for retirement;\n       Whereas, although many employees have access through their \n     employers to defined benefit and defined contribution plans \n     to assist them in preparing for retirement, many of those \n     employees may not be taking advantage of those plans at all \n     or to the full extent allowed by Federal law;\n       Whereas saving for retirement is necessary even during \n     economic downturns or market declines, which makes continued \n     contributions all the more important;\n       Whereas all workers, including public and private sector \n     employees, employees of tax-exempt organizations, and self-\n     employed individuals, can benefit from developing personal \n     budgets and financial plans that include retirement savings \n     strategies that take advantage of tax-preferred retirement \n     savings vehicles; and\n       Whereas the week of October 19 through October 25, 2014 has \n     been designated as ``National Save for Retirement Week'': \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Save for \n     Retirement Week, including raising public awareness of the \n     importance of saving adequately for retirement;\n       (2) acknowledges the need to raise public awareness of a \n     variety of ways to save for retirement that are favored under \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 which are utilized by many \n     people in the United States but could be utilized by more; \n     and\n\n[[Page S5566]]\n\n       (3) calls on States, localities, schools, universities, \n     nonprofit organizations, businesses, other entities, and the \n     people of the United States to observe National Save for \n     Retirement Week with appropriate programs and activities, \n     with the goal of increasing the retirement savings and \n     personal financial literacy of all people in the United \n     States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/11/senate-section/article/S5566-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 543--DESIGNATING NOVEMBER 1, 2014, AS NATIONAL BISON \n                                  DAY\n\n  Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, Mr. Portman, Mr. \nBennet, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Markey, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Hatch, \nMs. Heitkamp, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Donnelly, Ms. Baldwin, and \nMr. Johanns) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 543\n\n       Whereas bison are considered a historical symbol of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas bison were integrally linked with the economic and \n     spiritual lives of many Indian tribes through trade and \n     sacred ceremonies;\n       Whereas there are more than 60 Indian tribes participating \n     in the Intertribal Buffalo Council;\n       Whereas numerous members of Indian tribes are involved in \n     bison restoration on tribal land;\n       Whereas members of Indian tribes have a combined herd on \n     more than 1,000,000 acres of tribal land;\n       Whereas the Intertribal Buffalo Council is a tribal \n     organization incorporated pursuant to section 17 of the Act \n     of June 18, 1934 (commonly known as ``Indian Reorganization \n     Act'') (25 U.S.C. 477);\n       Whereas bison can play an important role in improving the \n     types of grasses found in landscapes to the benefit of \n     grasslands;\n       Whereas a bison has been depicted on the official seal of \n     the Department of the Interior since 1912;\n       Whereas bison hold significant economic value for private \n     producers and rural communities;\n       Whereas, as of 2012, the United States Department of \n     Agriculture estimates that 162,110 head of bison were under \n     the stewardship of private producers, creating jobs and \n     contributing to the food security of the United States by \n     providing a sustainable and healthy meat source;\n       Whereas a bison is portrayed on 2 State flags;\n       Whereas the bison has been adopted by 3 States as the \n     official mammal or animal of those States;\n       Whereas the buffalo nickel played an important role in \n     modernizing the currency of the United States;\n       Whereas several sports teams have the bison as a mascot, \n     which highlights the iconic significance of bison in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas on December 8, 1905, William Hornaday, Theodore \n     Roosevelt, and others formed the American Bison Society in \n     response to the near extinction of bison in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas on October 11, 1907, the American Bison Society \n     sent 15 bison to the first big game refuge in the United \n     States, which was known as the ``Wichita Reserve Bison \n     Refuge'';\n       Whereas in 2005, the American Bison Society was \n     reestablished, bringing together bison ranchers, managers \n     from Indian tribes, Federal and State agencies, conservation \n     organizations, and natural and social scientists from the \n     United States, Canada, and Mexico to create a vision for the \n     North American bison in the 21st century;\n       Whereas there are bison herds in National Wildlife Refuges \n     and National Parks;\n       Whereas there are bison in State-managed herds across 11 \n     States;\n       Whereas there is a growing effort to celebrate and \n     officially recognize the historical, cultural, and economic \n     significance of the North American bison to the heritage of \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas members of Indian tribes, bison producers, \n     conservationists, sportsmen, educators, and other public and \n     private partners have participated in the annual National \n     Bison Day since 2012 and are committed to continuing this \n     tradition annually on the first Saturday of November: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates November 1, 2014, the first Saturday of \n     November, as National Bison Day; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/11/senate-section/article/S5566-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3800.

I ask unanimous consent that the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 2258 and the \nSenate proceed to its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2258) to provide for an increase, effective \n     December 1, 2014, in the rates of compensation for veterans \n     with service-connected disabilities and the rates of \n     dependency and indemnity compensation for the survivors of \n     certain disabled veterans, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, today, as chairman of the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I applaud my colleagues for their support and Senate \npassage of S. 2258, the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living \nAdjustment Act of 2014.\n  All of my colleagues on the committee, including Ranking Member Burr \nand Senators Rockefeller, Murray, Brown, Tester, Blumenthal, Hirono, \nIsakson, Johanns, Moran, Boozman, and Heller, joined me in supporting \nthis important legislation, introduced by Senator Begich. I look \nforward to continuing our bipartisan efforts to improve the lives of \nour Nation's veterans.\n  This important measure directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nincrease the rates of veterans' compensation to keep pace with the \nincreasing cost-of-living in this country. The rate adjustment is equal \nto that provided on an annual basis to Social Security recipients and \nis based on the Consumer Price Index. Last year's cost-of-living \nadjustment of 1.5 percent affected so many important benefits, \nincluding veterans' disability compensation and dependency and \nindemnity compensation for surviving spouses and children. VA has \nprojected that more than 4.5\n\n[[Page S5571]]\n\nmillion veterans and survivors will receive these benefits in fiscal \nyear 2015.\n  I have been chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee for \nnearly 2 years, but during that period I have learned several very \nimportant lessons. First and foremost, the cost of war is much greater \nthan most Americans realize, and the cost of war does not end when the \nlast shots are fired or the last missiles are launched. The cost of war \ncontinues until the last veteran receives all of the care and all of \nthe benefits that he or she has earned. With this in mind, for those \nwho claim that taking care of veterans is too expensive, if you are not \nprepared to properly provide the health care and other benefits that \nveterans have earned, then do not send them to war in the first place. \nTaking care of veterans is a cost of war.\n  As part of Congress's important responsibility of ensuring veterans \nand survivors receive all of the benefits to which they are entitled, \nwe take steps to prevent these benefits from being diminished by the \neffects of inflation. Over the last several years there has been a lot \nof discussion about so-called entitlement reform. When people talk \nabout entitlement reform what they really mean, in English, is cutting \nSocial Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The cuts to Social Security \nbenefits were going to come in the form of a so-called chained CPI, \nwhich would have meant significant cuts in the cost-of-living \nadjustments that seniors received, that people with disabilities \nreceived, and, if you can believe it, that disabled veterans received.\n  The bottom line is that at a time when the wealthiest people in this \ncountry and the largest corporations are doing phenomenally well and \nenjoy many, many tax breaks, we should not balance the budget on the \nbacks of some of the most vulnerable people in this country--including \ndisabled veterans. I will continue to strongly oppose any proposal to \nadopt the chained CPI. Moving to a chained CPI would cut the benefits \nof more than 4 million disabled veterans and surviving spouses.\n  Congress's responsibility to ensure veterans and survivors receive \nall of the benefits to which they are entitled also requires that we \nensure they receive their complete cost-of-living adjustment. For a \nnumber of years, VA rounded down cost-of-living adjustments. The \nnegative impacts of the round-down were just one of the issues that \nwere brought to my attention by the veterans service organizations. I \nam proud to say that passage of last year's cost-of-living adjustment \nended this practice. This year's bill, sponsored by Senator Begich, \nwould continue to ensure veterans receive the full adjustment to which \nthey are entitled. To some, this is mere pennies, but I know these \nsmall amounts of money add up over time and make a significant \ncontribution to the financial stability of millions of veterans and \ntheir survivors.\n  We have an obligation to ensure the benefits we provide veterans and \ntheir survivors do not erode over time. As the debate over spending and \nthe national debt continues, we cannot forget the debt we owe to \nveterans and their families--after sacrificing for our well-being, the \nleast we can do is ensure theirs. I commend the Senate's passage of S. \n2258, the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2014. \nIt is another important step as we continue to work to honor our \nobligation to America's veterans and their surviving family members.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time \nand passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid \nupon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 2258) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2258\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
