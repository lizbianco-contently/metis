Mr. President, the great Albert Einstein defined insanity \nas follows: ``doing the same thing over and over again and expecting \ndifferent results.'' That is what Albert Einstein said. If his \ndefinition is true--and I am not going to argue with Einstein--the \nHouse Republicans have truly lost their minds. This week the House of \nRepresentatives will vote for the 37th time--the 37th time--on exactly \nthe same thing. What are they voting on? They are voting to repeal the \nlandmark constitutional health care reform bill known now as \nObamaCare--and I say that proudly.\n  After last year's election, Speaker Boehner conceded that ObamaCare \nis here to stay. Here is what he said:\n\n       It's pretty clear that the president was re-elected. \n     Obamacare is the law of the land.\n\n  I think that is a pretty fair statement. Again, the Speaker said it \nis pretty clear President Obama was reelected and ObamaCare is the law \nof the land. So no matter what he said then, this is now, and he has \nchanged his mind. The House will waste yet another week on another \ndead-end repeal vote. Perhaps Republicans think the 37th time is the \ncharm, but 37 times on the exact same thing?\n\n[[Page S3438]]\n\n  Tea party extremists bullied the Speaker into holding yet another \nvote to repeal the Affordable Care Act and roll back benefits for tens \nof millions of Americans.\n  This is what the Speaker said last week:\n\n       We've got 70 new Members who have not had an opportunity to \n     vote on the President's health care law. . . . Frankly, \n     they've been asking for an opportunity to vote on it.\n\n  This political kabuki has tied up the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives for weeks and cost the American taxpayers $52.4 million \nand counting. These are figures compiled by CBS News of the time wasted \non those 37 votes--all the House staff and all other personnel who have \nresponsibilities for making sure that place runs as well as it does. \nThat money--$52.4 million--is enough to restore funding for 19 million \nmeals for homebound seniors or 6,900 children dropped from the Head \nStart Program.\n  But while the vote may be political theater, it does have one \nbenefit: The American people will know where the freshman class of \nHouse Republicans stands. I think we know, but we will get another \nopportunity to see this. Do they stand with millions of Americans who \nare already benefiting from ObamaCare--we know that answer--or do they \nstand with insurance companies? We know that answer.\n  The insurance companies would like nothing better than to have things \nthe way they used to be and to once again deny coverage to sick \nchildren, impose lifetime caps on care, and discriminate against those \nwith preexisting conditions. Since President Obama signed the \nAffordable Care Act into law, insurance companies can no longer put \nprofits ahead of people.\n  One of the provisions in this bill says that, of premiums paid to \ninsurance companies for health care, 80 percent of those premiums must \ngo to patients. No longer, as once happened, will 50 percent of the \npremiums go for salaries and bonuses and other perks for insurance \nexecutives--no longer. Insurance companies can no longer discriminate \nagainst children with preexisting conditions. They can no longer raise \nrates for no reason. They can no longer drop coverage if someone gets \nsick. But that is what happened. Yet this week, for the 37th time, \nHouse Republicans will try to change all that.\n  Here are a few of the other benefits already in effect that House \nRepublicans would eliminate. In Nevada alone--and we are not a heavily \npopulated State such as Massachusetts or California or New York, but we \nare getting bigger, we have about 3 million people--tens of thousands \nof seniors have saved tens of millions of dollars on medicines because \nthe Affordable Care Act closed the gap on prescription drugs. That \nmeans millions of seniors across this country have more money in their \npockets for food, gas, and electric bills.\n  More than 3 million young people, because of ObamaCare, including \n33,000 young Nevadans, have benefited from a provision in the law that \nallows children to stay on their parents' health plans until they are \n26 years old. That means no person will have to worry about getting \nsick while looking for a job that offers insurance or while they go to \ncollege.\n  In my little town of Searchlight, NV, a boy made a decision. Was he \ngoing to join the military--he was from a patriotic family--or was he \ngoing to go to college? He made the decision that he was going to go to \ncollege. His family was not one of means. His mom worked part time in a \npost office, and his dad worked at a powerplant about 40 miles from \nSearchlight. They were so happy that this boy was going to go to \ncollege. He was the first person in their family to go to college, and \nhe did extremely well.\n  He finished his first year, and he was in his second year when he \nstarted feeling some discomfort. He had testicular cancer. At the time \nObamaCare passed, he was 23 years old and no longer could he be on his \nparents' insurance. So they had no insurance to cover this cancer their \nson had--their youngest boy. They begged and borrowed and literally--\nwell, I shouldn't say ``begged.'' They didn't do that. They had a very \ndifficult time of it. He needed two surgeries.\n  Now I guess the Republicans in the House want to go back to that. \nMaybe the Republicans here--they love voting against ObamaCare \nprovisions--want to go back to a time when that boy, Jeff, would no \nlonger have insurance. That is what they want for these young men and \nwomen who are trying to go to college, to get a job--they want to go \nback to that time. He has 3 extra years now. That means a lot.\n  Under ObamaCare, hundreds of thousands of businesses that already \noffer their employees health insurance are getting tax credits for \ndoing the right thing. That means small business owners can spend their \ncapital on growing their firms instead of growing insurance premiums.\n  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies can no longer \nset arbitrary lifetime caps on benefits, as they once did. What does \nthat mean? It means there was a provision hidden in that policy they \nsold you that stated that when your benefits reach $50,000, coverage \nstops. It didn't matter if you had been hurt in an automobile accident \nor you had cancer or some other dread disease; it used to stop. Not \nanymore. Because of the Affordable Care Act, millions of Americans are \nno longer one car accident or a heart attack away from bankruptcy.\n  Today, children can no longer be denied coverage because they are \nborn with a disease or a disability--a protection that will soon be \nextended to all Americans. Soon, being a woman will no longer be a \npreexisting condition. I said that right, Mr. President. No longer will \nbeing a woman be a preexisting condition. My daughter has a preexisting \ncondition. What is it? She is a woman. But no longer. In a few months, \n129 million Americans with preexisting conditions, such as high blood \npressure or epilepsy, can rest assured they will have access to \naffordable insurance and lifesaving care regardless of how much money \nthey make or don't make. And soon 25 million more Americans who can't \nafford health insurance will have access to reasonably priced insurance \nand quality care. But if Republicans get their way, these benefits and \nmore will disappear. There is going to be a vote in the House of \nRepresentatives to repeal everything I have talked about--not change it \nbut repeal it.\n  President Obama led the charge here, and we were able to pass the \nAffordable Care Act--the most significant change in our health care \ndelivery system since Medicare all those many, many years ago. It \nensures access to quality affordable health care for every American. \nBut Republicans would erase these gains and force millions of American \nfamilies to once again rely on expensive emergency room care or go \nwithout care at all.\n  Fortunately, the Republicans' latest exercise in insanity, as \ndescribed by Albert Einstein--that is, their latest repeal effort--is \ndoomed to fail just as it did the previous 36 times.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/15/senate-section/article/S3438-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it seems like, with each passing hour, \nthe facts get more and more inconvenient for senior folks over at the \nIRS.\n  Yesterday, it was reported that the agency may have gone after a \nministry founded by Billy Graham. We also learned that the very same \nIRS office that admitted to harassing conservative groups also released \nnine pending applications for tax-exempt status to the liberal \ninvestigative group ProPublica.\n  How did we find out? ProPublica revealed it.\n  Basically all we have gotten from the IRS, on the other hand, is an \nattempt to scapegoat some folks out in Cincinnati and a laughable \nattempt to move past this whole issue with a ridiculous op-ed claiming \n``mistakes were made.''\n  Well, most folks don't think that ignoring the Constitution is simply \na ``mistake.'' I like the fact that one group the IRS targeted, when \nasked by the agency to provide reading materials related to their \nmission, mailed them a copy of the Constitution.\n  Today, I would like to encourage every group that feels like it has \nbeen unjustly targeted to do the same. Maybe just underline the First \nAmendment before you put it in the envelope, because that is what this \nis all about.\n\n[[Page S3439]]\n\n  But getting back to the latest news--the leak to ProPublica--let's be \nclear about what this means: the IRS is forbidden from providing that \nkind of information about groups that have not been approved. It is a \nbright line prohibition that even the lowliest staffers at the IRS \nsurely should know about.\n  We intend to find out all the relevant details. Yesterday, I said the \nadministration needs to comply fully with all congressional inquiries \non the matter. This ProPublica leak will unquestionably be one of them. \nThe administration needs to make witnesses available to testify on this \nand on any other incident of targeting the administration's ideological \nopponents, and to resist the temptation to stonewall or obfuscate what \ntook place.\n  Today, other Senate Republicans are joining me in this call. More \nthan 40 members have signed a letter demanding as much of the \nPresident.\n  If the President is truly concerned about this issue, as he claims, \nhe will work openly and transparently with us to get to the bottom of \nwhat happened and people will be held accountable. These allegations \nare serious--that there was an effort to bring the power of the Federal \nGovernment to bear on those the administration disagreed with, in the \nmiddle of a heated national election. It actually could be criminal. \nAnd we are determined to get answers.\n  Again, let's not forget that we would not know any of this if \ncongressional Republicans had not demanded better answers than the ones \nwe were getting from the administration. When I and several of my \ncolleagues wrote to the IRS last year seeking clarification on \nallegations that they were harassing conservative groups, the response \nwe got was essentially: nothing to see here, move along.\n  When I pressed the issue in a speech last June, the left either \nridiculed the suggestion or ignored it. When IRS officials were asked \npoint blank in congressional hearings whether this was happening, they \nsaid point blank that it wasn't.\n  Of course it turns out it was.\n  By the way--you know who did not have trouble getting information out \nof the IRS? ProPublica, which was pushing an ideological agenda \nfriendly to the administration. When they asked the IRS for \ninformation, they got it--in 12 days. Some of it was not even supposed \nto be released.\n  When I asked the IRS for information, when did I get it? Only when it \nwas coming out anyway in an IG report.\n  So there are a lot--a lot--of unanswered questions that remain.\n  Which officials knew about this scandal?\n  When did they know about it?\n  What did they do about it when they found out?\n  Did they deliberately mislead Congress and the American people?\n  The number of officials involved continues to grow. And now, with \nthis revelation from ProPublica, it appears that the campaign against \nconservative groups was of a broader scope than originally admitted. So \nit is no surprise that the American people are demanding more than just \nsome half-hearted apology made under duress. As an activist from one of \nthe targeted groups in Kentucky said yesterday, ``Apology not \naccepted.''\n  ``There are many questions that still need to be asked,'' he said. \n``There are many that remain unanswered.''\n  My constituent was absolutely right.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter signed by my colleagues be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             United States Senate,\n     Washington, DC, May 14, 2013.\n     Hon. Barack Obama,\n     Pennsylvania Avenue, NW.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to express our grave \n     concerns and deep disappointment about the revelations in a \n     report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax \n     Administration (TIGTA) that the Internal Revenue Service \n     (IRS) had specifically targeted certain organizations for \n     extra scrutiny as part of their approval review of \n     applications for tax-exempt 501(c)(4) status. This appears to \n     be a wholly inappropriate action that threatens to silence \n     political dissent and brings partisan politics into what used \n     to be a nonpartisan, unbiased and fact-based review process. \n     The public's confidence in the IRS relies on fair and \n     apolitical application of the law. Actions such as these \n     undermine taxpayers' ability to trust its government to \n     fairly implement the law.\n       According to information given to Congress in a timeline \n     provided by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax \n     Administration (TIGTA), in early 2010 ``specialists had been \n     asked to be on the lookout for Tea Party applications, and \n     the IRS Determinations Unit had begun searching its database \n     for applications with `Tea Party,' `Patriots,' or `9/12' in \n     the organization's name.'' The report goes on to state that \n     ``By June 2011, some IRS specialists were probing \n     applications using the following criteria to identify tea-\n     party cases, according to the Treasury inspector general \n     findings: `` `Tea Party,' `Patriots' or `9/12 Project' is \n     referenced in the case file; issues include government \n     spending, government debt or taxes; education of the public \n     by advocacy/lobbying to `make America a better place to \n     live'; statements in the case file criticize how the country \n     is being run.''\n       We are deeply disturbed that agents of the government were \n     directed to give greater scrutiny to groups engaged in \n     conduct questioning the actions of their government. This \n     type of purely political scrutiny being conducted by an \n     Executive Branch Agency is yet another completely inexcusable \n     attempt to chill the speech of political opponents and those \n     who would question their government, consistent with a \n     broader pattern of intimidation by arms of your \n     administration to silence political dissent.\n       These disclosures are even more unsettling as they \n     contradict prior statements made by representatives of the \n     Administration on this matter. In response to questions \n     raised in 2012 on this issue by Republican Senators, Steven \n     T. Miller, the Deputy Commissioner for Services and \n     Enforcement at the IRS, specifically (and falsely) stated \n     that there was an unbiased, technical screening process used \n     to determine which applications for 501(c)(4) organizations \n     merited further review. In two separate letters to Finance \n     Committee Ranking Member Orrin Hatch, Mr. Miller failed to \n     note that explicitly political screens were used in reviewing \n     applications, despite the fact the practice was apparently \n     well known within the IRS as early as 2010.\n       Given these strong and clear statements by the \n     Administration in 2012 that no such targeted review or \n     specified politically motivated criteria existed, these \n     revelations raise serious questions about the entire \n     application review process, and the controls in place at the \n     IRS to stop this sort of political interference once and for \n     all. According to TIGTA these actions took place more than \n     two years ago, yet without this information becoming public, \n     there is no evidence that your administration would have done \n     anything to make sure these abuses were brought to light and \n     dealt with in a transparent way.\n       The American people deserve to know what actions will be \n     taken to ensure those who made these policy decisions at the \n     IRS are being held fully accountable and more importantly \n     what is being done to ensure that this kind of raw \n     partisanship is fully eliminated from these critically \n     important non-partisan government functions. As such, we \n     demand that your Administration comply with all requests \n     related to Congressional inquiries without any delay, \n     including making available all IRS employees involved in \n     designing and implementing these prohibited political \n     screenings, so that the public has a full accounting of these \n     actions.

Mr. President, this week we mark National Police Week \n2013 as a time to pay tribute to the service and sacrifice of the many \nmen and women in Federal, State, and local law enforcement across \nAmerica. It is an appropriate time for those of us who benefit from \ntheir efforts--and that is all of us--to express our gratitude.\n  The Nation's Capital welcomes thousands of police officers who are \ngathering to celebrate National Police Week. They will honor their \nfallen fellow officers and rededicate themselves to their duties of \ndefending the property, dignity, and lives of those who would fall prey \nto criminals outside the law.\n\n[[Page S3440]]\n\n  I want to especially recognize the many men and women who work to \nenforce the law in my home State of Kentucky. Many of them have \ntraveled to Washington this week, and today I will have the pleasure of \nmeeting with some of Kentucky's finest. I want to personally thank them \nfor bravely risking their lives in service of people across the \nCommonwealth.\n  Earlier this month in Richmond, Kentucky, a solemn ceremony was held \nat the Kentucky Law Enforcement Memorial on the campus of Eastern \nKentucky University. This memorial lists the names of every known \nfallen peace officer in Kentucky history. Along the bottom of it are \nthe words, ``Blessed Be the Peacekeepers.''\n  The ceremony was held to add the names of two law-enforcement \nofficers from Kentucky who were killed in the line of duty in 2012. \nHodgenville Police Officer Mark A. Taulbee was killed in a vehicle \npursuit on September 16. Marion County Sheriff's Deputy Anthony Rakes \nwas shot during a traffic stop on November 14.\n  I extend my sympathies to the families of Officer Taulbee and Deputy \nRakes for their tragic loss.\n  Their names will be added, along with 6 other Kentucky peace officers \nwhose names had not previously been on the memorial. There will be a \ntotal of 509 brave Kentuckians on that wall.\n  I know my colleagues in the U.S. Senate join me in holding the \ndeepest admiration and respect for the many brave law-enforcement \nofficers across Kentucky and the Nation. Theirs is both an honorable \nprofession, and a dangerous one. It is also a necessary one, as the \nmaintenance of peace and order in a civil society that we take for \ngranted could not exist without them.\n  Kentucky is grateful to our law-enforcement officers and their \nfamilies. And we are grateful for the sacrifice of Officer Mark A. \nTaulbee and Sheriff's Deputy Anthony Rakes to preserve the rule of law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the names of the Commonwealth of \nKentucky law-enforcement officers added to the Kentucky Law Enforcement \nMemorial this year be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mark A.

Mr. President, like millions of Americans, the events of \nthe last few days and the last few months have caused me to reflect on \nthe nature of our Federal Government and our special system of \nfederalism which delegates to the Federal Government certain powers but \nreserves to the States and the people those remaining powers. That is \nroughly what the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says.\n  I have also reflected a little bit on what some wise people have said \nover our history, and even before America was founded, about the nature \nof power, government power: Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts \nabsolutely.\n  Our Founders pointed out in the Federalist Papers and elsewhere that \nthe concentration of power in the hands of the few is the very \ndefinition of tyranny. We have learned from hard experience over the \ncourse of our Nation's history that when government thinks it knows \nbest, particularly here in Washington, in a country as big and diverse \nas ours, the natural tendency then in Washington is to try to suppress \nthe voices of those who see things differently, those who want to \nexercise their constitutional rights, particularly to free speech, \nfreedom of association, and, yes, even freedom of the press.\n  It is not true to say we have not been warned about the dangers of \nconcentration of power in the Federal Government, and big government, \nand the human frailties that follow. We have been warned time and time \nand time again. Now we have been reminded once again of the wisdom of \nour Founders and the wisdom of the structure of the U.S. Constitution.\n  Over the last week a series of events has highlighted the \nadministration's massive credibility gap. First, we learned more \ndetails about the coordinated attempt to misrepresent the September \n2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya. You may recall immediately \nafter that attack the President was at a press conference, and he said \nlater: Well, I said it was a terrorist attack then. That was reviewed \nby the Fact Checker in the Washington Post--hardly an unsympathetic \nnewspaper editorially to the administration's point of view--and the \nFact Checker gave the President of the United States four Pinocchios. \nSome ask why four Pinocchios? I think the true answer is because they \nnever give five Pinocchios--maybe they do--but you get the point.\n  Of course we cannot escape the fact and we should not ignore the fact \nthat this attack took four American lives.\n  Then we learned this last week that a senior IRS official had \nacknowledged that her agency deliberately targeted certain political \nspeech and activity for harassment, using the instruments of power \ngiven to the Internal Revenue Service. Perhaps the most awesome, \npervasive, and potentially intrusive power the Federal Government has \nis in the hands of that agency. Interestingly, the White House counsel \nsaid she learned about it in April. The President said he did not learn \nabout it until later. An investigation needs to be undertaken, and I am \nhappy Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and \nSenator Orrin Hatch, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, have \ncommitted themselves to doing an investigation of the IRS and how this \ncould possibly happen.\n  On top of all that, the top administrator of Health and Human \nServices, Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, has been soliciting funds from \nthe very industries she regulates to help implement ObamaCare. It does \nnot take a rocket scientist to imagine the potential for coercion by \nthe government of these private sector industries because of their fear \nof retribution if they do not contribute to this effort--a huge \nconflict of interest, and perhaps illegal. We need to get to the bottom \nof that as well.\n\n  So whether the issue is terrorist attacks in Libya, political and \npartisan abuses by the IRS, or efforts by the Department of Health and \nHuman Services to shake down the health insurance industry they \nregulate, it appears the birds the Founders warned us about have come \nhome to roost.\n  The concentration of government power invariably leads to abuse of \nthat power, and it is the same old story of human frailties over and \nover. It is no respecter of political parties; it has happened to both \npolitical parties. We should have been more careful, and we should have \nlistened. We should not have persistently engaged in this power grab in \nWashington, DC, at the expense of individual liberty on the part of the \nAmerican people.\n  What is the price to be paid by these scandals? The first price is a \nlack of credibility and public confidence in the most basic \ninstitutions that make up this government. The other damage is to the \ncredibility of folks at the highest level of the administration. After \nall, if the administration is willing to prevaricate, mislead, and \ndissemble\n\n[[Page S3441]]\n\nabout an al-Qaida-linked attack in Benghazi that cost the lives of four \nAmericans, what else are they willing to prevaricate, mislead, and \ndissemble about? Can the public trust this administration and its \ngovernment to provide accurate information about the war on terror or \nanything else?\n  Similarly, if IRS officials knew their agency was targeting certain \npolitical activity and failed then to hold anyone accountable, how can \nthe American people ever trust the Internal Revenue Service or the \nFederal Government to be neutral and law abiding?\n  I heard the junior Senator from Virginia, Senator Kaine, on the radio \nas I came in this morning. I thought he asked a pretty good question. \nHe said: What does it take to get fired in this town? What does it take \nto get fired in this administration for coverups and for misleading the \nAmerican people?\n  If Secretary Sebelius is willing to strong-arm the very industry she \nregulates to fund the implementation of ObamaCare, can the American \npeople trust her agency to be objective, evenhanded, and fair-minded as \na regulator?\n  All this boils down to a very sad statistic that demonstrates that \nthe public's confidence in the Federal Government--and particularly in \nCongress--is at an all-time low.\n  This is not the end of the story, and it should not be the end of the \nstory. That ought to be the beginning of a bipartisan effort to get to \nthe bottom of these abuses and also to restore ourselves to the \nconstitutional framework our Founding Fathers envisioned when this \ngreat experiment of democracy was created more than 200 years ago. It \nwasn't a national government that dictated to the rest of the country \nhow we should run our lives and what choices we should make; it was a \nFederal system of separated powers with checks and balances, with \nauthority given to the Federal Government to do things that individuals \nand the States could not do by themselves, such as national defense. We \nhave gotten far afield from the Framers' vision of how our country \nshould operate or from the constitutional system they created and which \nwe celebrate.\n  Now, more than ever, Washington needs credibility. If we don't have \nthe public's trust, how in the world will we gain their confidence that \nwe are going to address the many challenges our country faces? I am not \npessimistic about our future, I am optimistic about our future, but it \nwill take a change of attitude.\n  We will need a change of behavior so we can, in some sense, return to \nthe Founders' philosophy on the framework and the structure in which \nour government operates. The Federal Government has said for too long: \nWe know best; if you don't like it, it is because we have not given you \nenough information to convince you to like it. We take policies that \nare unpopular and merely shove them down the throat of the American \npeople and think we are doing our job.\n  We know we have huge challenges which call on us to work together on \na bipartisan basis to regain the public's confidence. I know we can do \nit. It is a matter of whether we have the political courage and the \nwill to do it.\n  Here are some of those challenges: The longest period of high \nunemployment since the Great Depression. We have the largest percentage \nof the American workforce that simply has given up and quit looking for \njobs because the economy is so weak.\n  The second challenge is a woefully unpopular health care law that \neven some of the architects of that law now say they see a train wreck \noccurring in its implementation.\n  We know our world continues to be dangerous, as Benghazi reminds us, \nand as we see from murderers, such as Bashar al-Asad in Syria, and \npeople who threaten the innocent. There are people who have chemical \nweapons. There are people who are fighting for their very lives in \nplaces like Syria. Iran is on the pathway to develop a nuclear weapon \nwhich will completely disrupt the balance of power in the Middle East \nand create an arms race, while other countries seek their own nuclear \nweapons.\n  Let's not forget Iran was the primary state sponsor of international \nterrorism with its support for Hezbollah, among others. We have seen in \nNorth Africa and elsewhere the proliferation of al-Qaida affiliates and \nallies. We also need to fix our broken immigration system.\n  None of these individually are easy things to do. All of them are \nhard, but they are not impossible if we will try to work hard to regain \nthe public's credibility. We simply need to do our work and respect the \nwisdom of the ages when it comes to concentration of power and its \nimpact on individual liberty.\n  We have to be aware of temptations. When power is absolute, we need \nto see that power is corrupt and be aware of the abuse of that power \nwhen it comes to dealing with the American people.\n  Unfortunately, so far, the Obama administration has valued its agenda \nmore than its credibility. Without regaining credibility, we will never \nregain the public's trust, and without that trust it will be much \nharder to solve America's biggest problems. That is the biggest single \nchallenge to President Obama's second-term agenda and to our ability as \nAmericans to show that this 200-plus-year experiment in self-government \nactually works.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am going to take a few minutes to talk \nabout why the events of the last 24 hours drive home how valuable it \nwould be to have a House-Senate budget conference begin to meet and to \ndeal with the extraordinary set of fiscal challenges our country has in \nfront of us.\n  As the President of the Senate knows, a number of Senators on our \nside have been trying to get a budget conference with the House. It has \nbeen several months since the budget resolutions in the respective \nbodies, in effect, have been set in motion. I want to talk about what \nhas happened in the last 24 hours because it again drives home how \nvaluable it would be for the Senate and the House to move to a budget \nconference at this time.\n  Yesterday the Congressional Budget Office--of course, our official \narbiter of official numbers and trends--made public a new report \nshowing there has been a significant reduction in the budget deficit. \nIn fact, their analysis shows there has been something like a 24-\npercent reduction from what was estimated a few months ago.\n  If we couple that new evidence from the Congressional Budget Office \nwith the fact that consumers continue to spend--which is certainly \nencouraging--the housing market coming back, employers adding 165,000 \njobs in April, all of this drives home that in the short term the \neconomy is picking up and we are making real progress.\n  The point of a budget resolution, on the other hand, is to give us a \nchance to look long term and look at the next 10 years how Democrats \nand Republicans can come together, for example, on the long-term \nchallenge of holding down health care costs. We have certainly seen \nprogress in the last few months on that.\n  There is a debate about why health costs have been moderating of \nlate. I happen to think it is because providers and others are \nbeginning to see what is ahead, but we can have that debate. Certainly \nthere is a lot more to do in terms of holding down health care costs \nfor the long term, and that is what I wish to see the Senate and House \ngo to in terms of the budget resolution.\n  For example--and I think I have talked about this with the President \nof the Senate before--chronic care is where most of the Medicare money \ngoes. Chronic care is for people with challenges with heart disease, \nstroke, and diabetes. We have some ideas we believe could be \nbipartisan, and would be exactly the kind of thing the House and Senate \nshould take up in a conference on the budget, which we have been \nseeking for some time.\n  I only come to the floor today by way of trying to lay out why the \nevents of the last few days dramatize how useful it would be for the \nSenate and the House to start thinking about what the country cares \nabout, which is our long-term trends.\n  In fact, this morning I was struck by the fact that some economic \ntheorists\n\n[[Page S3442]]\n\nsay the Congress has, over the last few months, had it backwards. We \nhave been consumed with everything short term when, in fact, we ought \nto say: Look at some of those positive developments I just cited--\nincluding the Congressional Budget Office numbers here recently--that \nwould indicate maybe a little bit less of the back and forth. That is \ncertainly what voters see as unduly partisan. We need to give way to \nsome thoughtful, long-term efforts in perhaps a 10-year window, which \nis what is reflected on the budget side.\n  Some of the leading Republicans and some of the archconservatives \nwith respect to economic analysis are all saying the same thing: We \nought to be talking about long-term trends. I, as well as my fellow \nDemocratic colleagues, have said that is one of the reasons for a \nbudget conference. Glenn Hubbard, for example, one of the most \nrespected of the conservatives, talks continually about the long-term \nchallenge and the dangers of waiting.\n\n  Well, on this side of the aisle, we are saying we don't want to wait \nanymore in terms of getting to a budget conference. We want to be in a \nposition to tackle some of these major kinds of questions: pro-growth \ntax reform--tax reform that can, again, generate revenue, and we have \nsome ideas we would like to raise in a budget conference that we think \nwould be attractive to the other side.\n  So I hope colleagues who have had questions about whether there ought \nto be a budget conference now--an actual budget conference between the \nSenate and the House--will look at these matters anew, given these \nkinds of trends. I would point out, to tell my colleagues the truth, I \nam encouraged on this point. We have heard colleagues over the last few \ndays on the other side of the aisle say they too think this is the time \nfor an actual budget conference between the House and the Senate. They \nhave called for it for a long time. We now have a chance to not just \ncall for it but actually do it. If anything, the economic news I have \ncited suggests some of the focus on these short-term trends ought to \ngive way to more emphasis on bipartisan concern for the long-term \ntrends, which are, in particular, going to revolve around health care, \nespecially Medicare, and taxes where we have an opportunity to look at \nbipartisan approaches for tax reform.\n  I commend particularly Senator Baucus and Senator Hatch, our \nleadership on the Finance Committee on which I serve, who have been \ntalking with Senators in weekly sessions they have pulled together on \nparticularly the tax reform issue.\n  So we couple the opportunity for the long term, looking at things \nsuch as chronic health care which is where most of the Medicare dollars \ngo. I think there are some good opportunities for protecting the rights \nof seniors while having quality care, holding costs down--those are the \nthings we can look at in the longer term, which is what a budget \nresolution is all about.\n  So it has been 2 months since the House and Senate adopted their \nrespective budget resolutions. I think, if anything, what we have \nlearned in the last few days is yet more evidence of why Senators and \nHouse Members of good will who want to tackle the long-term economic \nchallenge--which, if anything, becomes increasingly important day by \nday--ought to go to a budget conference and go forthwith to that effort \nin a bipartisan way.\n  Later on today I intend to propound a unanimous consent request to in \nfact go to that conference with the House on the budget, and I urge \ncolleagues to join me--I know Senator Coburn is here, and I commend him \nbecause he has been one who has been interested in tackling long-term \nfiscal challenges. Long-term fiscal challenges, in a debate between the \nHouse and the Senate over the next 10 years and the future trends we \nare looking at, are going to be front and center. We can tackle those \nquestions, particularly on health care and taxes, by going to a \nconference, as well as looking at the long term overall. We would also \nbe, in my view, picking up on what economists and leaders in the \nprivate sector of both political parties are saying now, which is there \nshould be a little bit less of a focus on short-term sparring about our \neconomy and more of a focus on the long-term economic challenges, which \nis what a House-Senate budget conference, looking at 10 years ahead, \ncould be all about.\n  With that, I yield the floor and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we are still in morning business, and I \nwill speak in morning business about two amendments I will call up when \nwe leave morning business. One is amendment No. 815 on this bill, which \nis aimed at lessening State dependence on the Federal Government.\n  We have now, over the period of 50 years, helped with beach \nnourishment. In this bill is a section that extends from 50 to 65 years \nof government subsidization of beach nourishment. Really, if we look at \nthe section, we see it is targeted toward a few States because they are \nrunning into the 50-year deadline. So all the amendment does is block \nit from going from 50 to 65 years.\n  The Clinton administration, the Bush administration, the Obama \nadministration, the Obama fiscal commission, all recommended \neliminating the Federal subsidization of beach nourishment projects. So \nwe have great bipartisan leadership on both sides of the aisle to bring \nthis back, put back to the States what is truly a State responsibility.\n  What we are doing in this bill is furthering the dependence of States \nfor beach nourishment projects on the Federal Government. So I will \ncall up that amendment.\n  The next amendment is amendment No. 816. This committee has done a \ngreat job in setting up a review board that can eliminate authorized \nprojects that no longer make sense, but they have limited what they can \nlook at. They are not letting them look at the whole of water resources \nprojects; therefore, they limit those projects. All we are saying with \nthis amendment is we ought to reopen it.\n  One of the criticisms of this amendment is that a project may be in \nthe midst of completion and the review board might say we should \neliminate it. It doesn't mean we will eliminate it because in the \nwisdom of the committee, they gave the opportunity for Congress to \ndisallow any of this.\n  So I think what the committee has done is a great step forward in \ngetting rid of projects that are no longer apropos to whatever the \nneeds are: But my question is, Why did they limit it to such a narrow \npackage when, in fact, they want this outside input to help guide us on \nwhat we should do?\n  So at the appropriate time, when we are out of morning business, I \nwill call up those amendments. I will not speak further on them; I will \njust call them up so we can move ahead with the bill.\n  I see the chairman of the committee is here. Good morning to her, and \nI yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, for the benefit of all Senators, we are \nmoving forward today. I thank all colleagues on both sides of the \naisle. Senator Vitter and I have tried to allow all kinds of \namendments.\n  Unfortunately, yesterday there was an objection to one contentious \namendment, and Senator Landrieu was--she took one for the team and \nwithdrew her amendment because she wanted to make sure this WRDA bill \nmoves forward. I appreciate that. It is a very important issue about \nflood issues and it is complicated and I know how strongly she feels \nabout it. I know she will be back. So we have a number of amendments, \nand we will be debating them for 1 minute on each side.\n  I wish to address my friend from Oklahoma. Let me tell my colleagues, \nwe have been on opposite sides on his amendments. I don't like that \nvery much. When we do work together we win big; when we don't, then it \ndoesn't work out well for either of us. So I am sorry to say I will \nhave to oppose the two amendments of my friend from Oklahoma, and I \nwant to lay out for the record in a little more than a minute why.\n\n[[Page S3443]]\n\n  We do something important in this bill. We create a new \ninfrastructure deauthorization commission to review the backlog of \ncorps projects and develop a list of projects that will be deauthorized \nunless Congress passes a joint resolution opposing the commission's \nrecommendation. It is kind of like the Base Closure Commission, where \nthe Base Closure Commission comes forward and says these are the bases \nthat will be closed.\n  It is a very cumbersome process to overturn the commission. We did \nthat on purpose because we know politics plays a part in a lot of these \nthings, and we want the commission to have power. I am sure my friend, \nthe Senator from Oklahoma, is grateful we have set up this commission \nbecause what he is trying to do is cut out even more projects.\n  I just want to make the case that when we did this in the committee, \nwe developed a careful balance and we give the infrastructure \ndeauthorization committee a lot of authority. But this amendment \nremoves the bill's limitations on what projects can be deauthorized. So \nthis is in our bill. This is what we say to the commission. We give \nguidance to the commission. We say: These are the projects that can be \ndeauthorized; in other words, stopped, because I share the view of my \nfriend from Oklahoma. We don't want to keep projects going that are \ndoomed and not going anywhere. It is a waste of taxpayer dollars and, \nfrankly, it makes it very confusing for people back home because they \ndon't understand why a project started in 1996 is still alive.\n  What we do is projects authorized or reauthorized after the enactment \nof the Water Resources Development Act of 1996, projects currently \nundergoing review by the corps, projects that have received \nappropriations in the last 10 years, projects that are more than 50 \npercent complete, and projects that have a viable, non-Federal sponsor \nwould not be deauthorized. They would not be deauthorized.\n  So let me say it again. Projects that would not be deauthorized are \nprojects authorized after 1996, projects currently undergoing review by \nthe corps, projects that received appropriations in the last 10 years, \nprojects that are more than 50 percent complete, projects that have a \nviable and non-Federal sponsor. So we do give guidance to the \ncommission. We say other than that, go for it and deauthorize.\n  The provision Senator Coburn wants to strike was included to focus \nthe attention of the commission on the older, truly inactive projects. \nThat is what we are about. The Coburn amendment would give unlimited \ndiscretion to the commission to deauthorize a project even if it is in \nthe middle of construction or it has an active non-Federal sponsor. \nImagine we have a city or a county or even a private sector participant \nwho is involved, and all of a sudden everything they have done is for \nnaught.\n  I think what the amendment does is create havoc. I know my friend has \nthe best of intentions. His point that we can overturn the commission \nis a valid point, but let's be clear. How many bills actually become a \nlaw around here these days? It is hard to even pass a resolution saying \nHappy Mother's Day. So we have a hard time. So to say the Congress \ncould actually overturn the commission--we have never done it in the \nBase Closure Commission, and we wouldn't do it here.\n  States and local communities have invested millions of dollars in \nlocal cost-shares from project feasibility studies. It isn't fair to \nthese communities that have committed significant resources to \ndeauthorize a project that remained active and is moving forward.\n  So, in essence, this amendment would disrupt the new deauthorization \nprocess created in WRDA 2013, and I urge my colleagues to oppose that \namendment.\n  Now I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter \nfrom the National Construction Alliance. It reads: ``The National \nConstruction Alliance strongly opposes the Coburn amendment.''\n  It says: ``Communities . . . cannot afford to have the rug pulled out \nfrom beneath them.''\n  I think it is important to note that they don't in any way chastise \nthe committee for our work.\n  We also have opposition from the Road Builders.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            National Construction Alliance II,\n\n                                                     May 15, 2013.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid: The National Construction \n     Alliance II (NCA II) strongly opposes the Coburn Amendment \n     #816 to the Water Resources Development Act of 2013, S. 601.\n       The NCA II--a partnership between two of the nation's \n     leading construction unions, the International Union of \n     Operating Engineers and the United Brotherhood of Carpenters \n     and Joiners of America--appreciates the hard work of the \n     Environment and Public Works Committee to establish the \n     Infrastructure Deauthorization Commission contained in S. \n     601. Senator Coburn's amendment threatens the bipartisan, \n     thoughtful process and criteria for reviewing the backlog of \n     projects in the underlying bill.\n       Communities (non-federal entities) simply cannot afford to \n     have the rug pulled out from underneath them when partnering \n     with the Army Corps of Engineers on critical port, harbor or \n     waterway projects. If the commission has broad authority to \n     shut down projects, as envisioned by the Coburn Amendment, \n     that is precisely what could occur.\n       The bipartisan EPW Committee-reported WRDA bill established \n     criteria to guide the Commission's work and ensure that it \n     focused on inactive and obsolete projects. The Coburn \n     amendment would undermine this careful balance, eliminating \n     important criteria for decommissioning projects and giving \n     the unelected Infrastructure Deauthorization Commission \n     simply too much power over the process of shutting down \n     projects, with too little Congressional guidance.\n       Please oppose the Coburn Amendment #816 to the Water \n     Resources Development Act of 2013. The amendment needlessly \n     threatens the bipartisan agreement forged in the Environment \n     and Public Works Committee on the issue of decommissioning of \n     projects.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Raymond J. Poupore,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. In my concluding moments, we also will have a Coburn \namendment on striking section 2030 on the beach nourishment extension. \nI think it is very important that this be defeated because many of \nthese existing projects provide critical storm damage protection for \ncoastal communities which require periodic nourishment to maintain this \nprotection. There are dozens of important shoreline protection projects \naround the country that it benefits that exceed the costs.\n  Hurricane Sandy demonstrated that Federal shoreline protection \nprojects fared better against the storm surge than other areas impacted \nby the storm. We have seen this. Where there was beach nourishment, \nthey had a lot less damage and people were spared.\n  So in our work on WRDA, the EPW Committee held hearings on the corps' \nflood and storm damage reduction projects. We received testimony from \nlocal communities such as Ocean City, MD, which highlighted the \nhundreds of millions of dollars in damages avoided by these projects.\n  Section 2030 in WRDA 2013 does not provide a blanket extension of all \nbeach nourishment and shore protections. The section simply allows the \ncorps to study projects and to make a recommendation to Congress. I \ndon't know why we would want to stop this since we know, after \nHurricane Sandy, some of these projects have cost-benefit for the \npeople--for the taxpayers.\n  Before receiving an extension, a project has to go through a \nfeasibility analysis to demonstrate that the project is in the national \ninterest, it has to have a positive cost-benefit ratio, is technically \nfeasible, and is environmentally acceptable.\n  The provision Senator Coburn is attempting to strike doesn't \nguarantee an extension, it just tells the corps to study the issue and \ncome back with a recommendation.\n  I honestly believe blocking Federal investment in these projects will \nharm coastal communities, so I urge my colleagues to oppose this Coburn \namendment. I know I speak for many, including Senator Lautenberg, who \nactually brought this issue to my attention years ago.\n  I yield the floor and note that the time has come to debate the \nCoburn amendment, 1 minute each side.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/15/senate-section/article/S3443-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3443-S3444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 601, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 601) to provide for the conservation and \n     development of water and related resources, to authorize the \n     Secretary of the Army to construct various projects for \n     improvements to rivers and harbors of the United States, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Hoeven amendment No. 909, to restrict charges for certain \n     surplus water.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 815\n\n  Mr. COBURN.

Mr. President, I ask to set aside the pending amendment \nand call up amendment No. 816.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn], for himself, Mrs. \n     McCaskill, and Mr. McCain, proposes an amendment numbered \n     816.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To remove restrictions on projects the Infrastructure \n                Deauthorization Commission may consider)\n\n       In section 2049(b)(5), strike subparagraph (C).\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have a question for the chairman through \nthe Chair, if I might.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. COBURN. My question on the deauthorizing commission would be why \nwould they not take into consideration all of the things the Senator \njust mentioned before they would recommend deauthorizing a program, if, \nin fact, the only reason they would not deauthorize it was because it \nwas spending money that is not going to have a positive purpose.\n  So my question is, you trust the deauthorizing committee for all \nthese other areas, but you do not trust their judgment to look at \nprojects that are ongoing. Why would we think they would not make a \npositive decision in the best interests of the country?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would answer my friend in this way. This is a new \ncommission. We set it up in the bill. It has never worked before. We do \nnot know how it will work. So we thought, for starters, let's go after \nthe older projects, see how it works, and any day we could come back \nand add more authority. But we think, if there are active projects, it \nsends a very confusing signal to the folks back home.\n  We think this is the way to start it. It is smart. We have never had \nthis commission before. I am very proud that we have it in here. I know \nmy colleague supports the commission. He is already wanting to expand \nit. But I think we start this way, and then if it looks like we can \ngive them more authority, we can. By the way, any day of the week \nCongress could deauthorize as well.\n  Mr. COBURN. The point I would make is the following: The big problem \nwith WRDA bills is they become parochial in nature. So what we have \nexcluded is everything since 1996 forward, which actually includes the \npresent Members of Congress in terms of projects, their parochial \nwishes. So what we have done is we have said: You may not be capable of \ndefunding or deauthorizing something else, but if it is new, you do not \nhave the opportunity to do that. So what we are doing is we are \nprotecting interests.\n  I yield back.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I very much respect my friend. I know his \nintention is the best. But I do have to say there is not one earmark in \nthis bill. He should be so proud of both sides of the aisle in this \ncommittee--not one earmark--and we do not tell the commission what they \ncan and cannot do. But we do set some parameters because we do believe, \nas we start this deauthorization commission, it ought to go after the \nolder projects. But projects that are active, let them get a chance to \nmove forward. There are no earmarks in this bill. I kind of resent it, \nin a nice way. I am not angry about it. But, believe me, there is no \nintention to protect earmarks here at all.\n  So I hope we will vote no. I think we are starting something new, \nsomething good. It is a huge reform. We have a deauthorization \ncommission, but let's start them with the older projects. Let's track \nit. If we feel we should move forward with more reform, I am certainly \nopen to it.\n  I yield the floor and hope for a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to Senator \nCoburn's amendment on beach renourishment. The Water Resources \nDevelopment Act extends Federal funding for beach renourishment \nprojects from 50 to 65 years. Senator Coburn's amendment would strike \nthe new 15-year extension.\n  In my state of Maryland, we have a very successful beach \nrenourishment project along the Atlantic coast in Ocean City. Ocean \nCity is the beach destination for many in the Mid-Atlantic region. The \npurpose of this Army Corps of Engineers project is not to protect a \nrecreational beach but to provide hurricane protection for citizens and \nfor the billions of dollars in public and private infrastructure.\n  Following severe storms in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Ocean \nCity's beach was severally eroded, threatening the homes and private \nbusinesses along the coastline and on the mainland. This is when the \nState of Maryland and the Army Corps of Engineers constructed the \nAtlantic Coast of Maryland Hurricane Shoreline Protection Project to \nprovide an essential buffer that saves lives and protects communities.\n  The Army Corps of Engineers built a steel sheet pile bulkhead along \nthe boardwalk. They placed sand along the coastline to widen and raise \nthe beach and constructed a vegetated sand dune. Every 4 years, the \nArmy Corps of Engineers must reinforce the beach barrier by \nreplenishing sand.\n  Since its completion, the project has repeatedly demonstrated its \nvalue by preventing more than $240 million in damages. Most recently, \nthis project successfully protected the residents of Ocean City and \nWorcester County from Superstorm Sandy. The project protected billions \nof dollars in public and private infrastructure and jobs.\n  Approximately $48 million of Federal funding has gone toward this \nproject. This is a small investment considering the billions it would \ntake to rebuild Ocean City's homes, businesses, and hotels along the \nAtlantic Ocean. I urge my colleagues to oppose Senator Coburn's \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 815.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Amendment No. 816 expands the review commission so that, \nin fact, it can look at everything. We have given them the \nresponsibility.\n  What the bill does is a great first step, but it protects all the \nearmarks from 1996 forward, so we are not going to look at any of \nthose. We are not going to allow the review commission, the \ndeauthorizing commission, to make recommendations on everything. We are \ngoing to select what they will look at.\n  If we trust them to look at the other things, we ought to trust them \nto look at all of it. We do have an opportunity to turn them down if, \nin fact, they are trying to deauthorize something the Congress thinks \nshouldn't be deauthorized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I urge a ``no'' vote. Colleagues, please \nhear me out. This amendment would expand the authority of a newly \ncreated infrastructure deauthorization commission and allow projects in \nyour State to be stopped midstream--active projects, projects that have \nlocal funds flowing into them and private funds flowing into them. This \nis a bridge too far.\n  I am very proud of the work Senator Vitter and I have done in setting \nup this commission. We have very clear rules about what the commission \ncould look at, and we protect projects that are active. We say to them: \nGo after the inactive projects, stop them, and save taxpayer dollars.\n  Please, let's have a good ``no'' vote on this one.\n  Mr. COBURN.

Again, ditto. This is a very commonsense amendment, and \nI think we can all agree to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mrs. BOXER. We yield back all of our time, and we ask for a voice \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 822) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to reconsider the vote and to lay that motion on \nthe table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 866\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 866, offered by the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Merkley.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I support the Merkley amendment. I hope \nwe will have an overwhelming vote on it, and I ask my colleague to take \nthe remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 866.\n\n[[Page S3446]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Merkley], for himself and Mr. \n     Brown, proposes an amendment numbered 866.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require the use of American iron, steel, and manufactured \n             good for innovative financing pilot projects)\n\n       At the end of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 100__. USE OF AMERICAN IRON, STEEL, AND MANUFACTURED \n                   GOODS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), none \n     of the amounts made available under this Act may be used for \n     the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of a \n     project eligible for assistance under this title unless all \n     of the iron, steel, and manufactured goods used in the \n     project are produced in the United States.\n       (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) shall not apply in any case \n     or category of cases in which the Secretary finds that--\n       (1) applying subsection (a) would be inconsistent with the \n     public interest;\n       (2) iron, steel, and the relevant manufactured goods are \n     not produced in the United States in sufficient and \n     reasonably available quantities and of a satisfactory \n     quality; or\n       (3) inclusion of iron, steel, and manufactured goods \n     produced in the United States will increase the cost of the \n     overall project by more than 25 percent.\n       (c) Public Notice.--If the Secretary determines that it is \n     necessary to waive the application of subsection (a) based on \n     a finding under subsection (b), the Secretary shall publish \n     in the Federal Register a detailed written justification as \n     to why the provision is being waived.\n       (d) International Agreements.--This section shall be \n     applied in a manner consistent with United States obligations \n     under international agreements.\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, we have long recognized the principle \nthat when taxpayers are paying for public infrastructure projects, it \nmakes sense for American business, for the American economy, for our \nworkers to do as much of the work as possible to create that supply \nchain in America.\n  The ``Buy American'' rules we already have on the books provide the \nfoundation for millions of miles of roads, bridges, light rail, and \nsubways and millions of good-paying jobs. This amendment extends that \nconcept with appropriate waivers for cost, for supply chain \ninadequacies, or for public interest.\n  With that, I turn this over to my colleague for this bipartisan \namendment, and I ask for my colleagues' support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I also strongly support the amendment. \nThis is a commonsense ``Buy American'' provision, which is completely \nconsistent with what we did on the recent highway bill in a bipartisan \nway which created no controversy, no debate at the time. I support the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I speak in opposition to this amendment.\n  While I understand the concern underlying it, I also have significant \nconcerns as to what this would do. In some circumstances, this could \nincrease the cost of materials in some Federal projects by close to 25 \npercent. So if we are talking about $1 billion worth of materials, we \nare talking almost $250 million of increased cost for certain materials \nthis could bring about.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 866.\n  Mr. WICKER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nLautenberg), the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray), and the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts (Mrs. Warren) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mrs. Warren) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Alaska (Ms. Murkowski).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 60, nays 36, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 123 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--60\n\n     Baldwin\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Blumenthal\n     Boozman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coons\n     Cowan\n     Donnelly\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Graham\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Heinrich\n     Heitkamp\n     Hirono\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kaine\n     King\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Manchin\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murphy\n     Nelson\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schatz\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Vitter\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--36\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Blunt\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Cruz\n     Enzi\n     Fischer\n     Flake\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Hoeven\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Lee\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moran\n     Paul\n     Portman\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rubio\n     Scott\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Warner\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Lautenberg\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Warren\n  The amendment (No. 866) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, my amendment would sunset \nthe so-called project acceleration provisions in 5 years. These \nprovisions are untested. They were not the subject of any hearings of \nour committee. They were added at the last minute, before the markup, \nand they changed what I think is the bedrock National Environmental \nPolicy Act. They set arbitrary deadlines. Rushed decisions lead to \ndelays later and mistakes in litigation. Haste makes waste, both for \ntaxpayer dollars and for natural resources.\n  The administration doesn't want these changes. Yesterday, the \nchairwoman heeded our call and changed the bill. The provisions will \nnow sunset in 10 years. I believe this is a step in the right \ndirection, but make no mistake, these provisions are still a very risky \nmove. If this gets worse, these provisions could risk a Presidential \nveto.\n  I know the chairwoman has committed to me that we could have a \nhearing on the provisions that are in the law, the MA-21 provisions; \nthat EPA--I ask for 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask the Senator have 30 seconds more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. The chairwoman committed the relevant \nFederal resource agencies on MAP-21 that have similar provisions here. \nThey are in the law. The resource agencies can come before our \ncommittee. We can have questioning. The chairwoman will be there. We \ncan have the CEQ or whomever be a part of that.\n  I very much appreciate the chairwoman working with me. Because she is \nworking with me, I am not going to move forward. I am not going to \noffer the amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I have a \nminute and a half.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank my colleague for not offering \nhis amendment. He and I see this very differently. But first I wish to \nsay I have committed to a hearing. I told my colleague he can get as \nmuch time as he wants, but I have to correct the record.\n  My colleague said this project delivery reform was a last minute \naddition. Project delivery reform was in the bill as it was voted out \nof committee, without a dissenting vote.\n  Let me reiterate: This is not a last minute issue. Project delivery \nreform was in the bill when it got voted out. Here is why--two reasons. \nOne is projects are being delayed--environmental projects, flood \ncontrol projects; they are being delayed. Some delay is necessary--when \nthere is new information--and they could still have a delay.\n  What we do in this bill--and it has been changed for the better, I \nthink my\n\n[[Page S3447]]\n\ncolleague is right on that--is we sunset the provision in 10 years.\n  For the first time in history, the resource agencies my friend and I \ncare so much about, such as Fish and Wildlife, EPA, and all the rest, \nwill be in the room with the corps setting the deadlines. It is very \nimportant that we get our job done. Bureaucratic agencies have to get \nthe work done as well.\n  I think this reform is one we will be proud of, and I look forward to \nthose hearings.\n  I thank my colleague. We will get on with this and make sure this \nreform works the way we anticipate it will.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 909, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 909, offered by the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I understand that my amendment has \nalready been handed in. I will point out that I have a modification at \nthe desk.\n  This is a very simple amendment. It provides that the Corps of \nEngineers cannot charge a State or a tribe or municipality--\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, the Senate is not in order. I believe \nthis is our last amendment, and this is an important amendment to my \nfriend. It is also important to many States. It would be nice if we \ncould show the Senator some courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from California.\n  I would also like to thank both Senator Boxer and Senator Vitter for \ntheir work on this amendment. I appreciate it very much.\n  This is a very simple amendment. It says that the Corps of Engineers \ncannot charge a State fees for water when it violates the State's water \nrights. It affects municipalities and tribes as well. We have made sure \nit does not score under the CBO rules.\n  This amendment has strong bipartisan support--Senator Thune, Senator \nHeitkamp, Senator Baucus, and Senator Johnson. This does not affect the \nmaster manual on the Missouri River or any of the authorized uses, and \nI wanted to emphasize that.\n  Again, this is a very simple amendment. It ensures that States rights \nare properly protected, and I encourage a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment has been \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 909), as modified, is as follows:\n\n        (Purpose: To restrict charges for certain surplus water)\n\n       On page 190, after line 23, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 2060. RESTRICTION ON CHARGES FOR CERTAIN SURPLUS WATER.\n\n       (a) In General. No fee for surplus water shall be charged \n     under a contract for surplus water if the contract is for \n     surplus water stored on the Missouri River.\n       (b) Offset.--Of the amounts previously made available for \n     Corps of Engineers--Civil, Department of the Army, Operations \n     and Maintenance'' that remain unobligated as of the effective \n     date of this Act, $5,000,000 is hereby rescinded.''\n       (c) None of the funds under subsection (b) may be rescinded \n     from amounts that were designated by the Congress as an \n     emergency requirement pursuant to the Concurrent Resolution \n     on the Budget or the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985, as amended.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, if I could be heard on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am supporting this amendment. It is \nimportant to the States that are affected, and there are several States \nthat are affected. The fact is that we don't want to see the corps \nstart a water war, and the Presiding Officer has discussed that with \nme. I am very grateful to her and Senator Hoeven for explaining this \nmatter. The tribes were involved as well. We don't want to see them get \nin trouble. I think the corps has to respect the fact that there are \nthese water rights in place.\n  I will be supporting this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, if I could ask unanimous consent to \nspeak for 10 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I also strongly support this amendment. \nI think it is a very reasonable, commonsense amendment.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam Chair, I ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on this amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 909), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, again, I thank both of the managers of \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the cloture motion \nis withdrawn and the clerk will read the title of the bill for the \nthird time.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n\n\n                              Water Supply\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I want to take this opportunity to \naddress one of the provisions of this bill relating to water supply. \nSection 2015, which originally had a much broader impact, now expresses \nthe sense of the committee related to a particular dispute between \nStates, and expresses a concern on the part of members of the Committee \non Environment and Public Works regarding the ongoing interstate water \ndisputes among the States of Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. I would \nlike to yield to the Committee's Ranking Republican, Senator Vitter, \nfor his remarks about this provision, but I would note that it is the \nstrong desire of the Committee that this dispute be resolved amicably \nthrough water compacts that ensure the availability of water to meet \nall necessary human and environmental needs. Senator Vitter, can you \nelaborate on the intent of Section 2015?\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the chairman for including this provision, and I \nwould note that the Corps of Engineers has long worked to ensure the \nApalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint, ACF, River Basin and Alabama-Coosa-\nTallapoosa, ACT, River Basins are able to meet the demands of users in \nGeorgia, Alabama and Florida through its operation of dams and \nreservoirs, and performs an important role in regulating the flow of \nsurface water in these basins. Further, it is the intent of WRDA \nSection 2015 to recognize that role and to assist the States' efforts \nto reach an end to their disputes. While the committee does not intend \nto express any opinion about reallocations under the existing authority \nof the Water Supply Act and its application to these basins, we do \nbelieve these States should work to come to an agreement. Additionally, \nthe Chairman and I intend to express these same sentiments to the Corps \nof Engineers through a letter that will be submitted into the Record \nsoon after passage of this bill.\n  Mrs BOXER. I thank the Senator. That's correct. And as this new \nlanguage clearly states, ``this subsection does not alter existing \nrights or obligations under law.'' So to reiterate, it is not the \nintention of Section 2015 to alter the Corps' existing legal authority \nto reallocate storage, to express any view on whether current or \nprojected future levels of storage for water supply exceed the Corps' \nexisting legal authority, or to prohibit or interfere with the Corps' \nongoing efforts to update its water control plans and manuals for the \nACF and ACT Basins. Further, it is not the intention to preclude the \nCorps from taking action consistent with its existing legal authority \nto study and implement reallocations of reservoir storage to meet \nmunicipal and industrial water supply needs.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the chairman for her assistance with this \nprovision.\n\n\n                        Harbor Maintenance Taxes\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, in fiscal year 2011, approximately \n$1.4 billion in harbor maintenance taxes, HMT, was collected \nnationally. Of this, over $430 million, nearly 32 percent, was \ncollected in California, with nearly $363 million generated by the \nports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Of the amounts collected, nearly \n$677 million was allocated to coastal operations and maintenance \nbudgets nationwide annually over the past 3 years. California's share \nof this funding is approximately $54 million, only 13 percent of what \nwas collected in its ports. Put another way,\n\n[[Page S3448]]\n\nCalifornia contributes 32 percent of the whole HMT but is receiving \nonly 8 percent of what is allocated nationwide.\n  Section 8004 of the bill establishes a path whereby HMT funds could \nbe used on expanded uses to address the critical maintenance needs of \nCalifornia's ports. I want to clarify that the amendment submitted by \nthe Senator from Michigan, No. 893, does not preclude or unnecessarily \ndelay the use of HMT funds in California's largest ports. Is it your \nunderstanding that this amendment, submitted by the Senator from \nMichigan, will not preclude or impact funding for expanded uses under \nSection 8004 (b) of the bill?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is my understanding. The additional uses authorized \nby WRDA 2013 are important for many parts of the country, including \nCalifornia, and are clearly an eligible use of the harbor maintenance \ntrust fund.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I would like to engage in a colloquy \nwith the Senator from California, the chair of the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works, as well as the Senators from New Jersey, \nSenators Lautenberg and Menendez, and my colleague from New York, \nSenator Gillibrand.\n  I thank the chair for her leadership in bringing the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act to the Senate floor to address the urgent need for \ninvestment in our Nation's waterways, port infrastructure, and for \ncoastal flood protection. It is my hope that this bill will be passed \nquickly. The Sandy relief bill provided over $5 billion for the Army \nCorps of Engineers to construct and repair authorized hurricane \nprotection projects in States devastated by Superstorm Sandy. A $20 \nmillion comprehensive study was included in order to analyze the flood \nrisks of the east coast with the congressional intent and authority for \nthe corps to move to specific feasibility studies. However, it is \ncurrently our understanding that the Corps of Engineers does not intend \nto provide specific project recommendations in this study that will \nresult in feasibility studies. I am pleased that I was able to work \nwith you, Chairman Boxer, and my colleagues from the affected States, \nto add language to this bill that addresses this issue. I would like to \nclarify the intent of the language.\n  Will the language in section 3004 of the water resources development \nbill result in specific project recommendations for the Corps study?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I appreciate the Senator from New York raising this \nissue. I also know that my good friend from New York and I agree on the \nneed to enhance the resiliency of the east coast in the wake of the \ndevastation caused by Superstorm Sandy. Section 3004 states that, with \nrespect to the corps study for flood and storm damage reduction which \nwas authorized by the Sandy relief bill, the Secretary shall include \nspecific project recommendations. The bill also includes a new \nprovision to prioritize hurricane protection studies, section 2044, \nthat would give the Secretary the authority to quickly move feasibility \nstudies developed through the comprehensive hurricane study.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the chairman for her remarks. If I may, I would \nlike to further clarify the language and purpose of section 3004. Post-\nSandy, there is an acute need for an assessment of the northeast \nregion's storm-protection infrastructure needs. Is it correct that \nsection 3004 gives the Corps of Engineers the power to conduct \nfeasibility studies on specific projects?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from New Jersey for raising this \nconcern. He is correct that the language of section 3004 authorizes and \ndirects the corps to conduct feasibility studies for the specific \nprojects it identifies in the regional study.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the chairman for making this clarification. I \nagree completely with my colleagues concerning the need for section \n3004. Could the language in section 3004 about inclusion of specific \nproject recommendations and feasibility studies somehow hurt or take \nmoney away from the comprehensive regional study?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from New Jersey for raising this \nconcern. While section 3004 does state that the Secretary shall include \nproject recommendations, it does not add funding, so such \nrecommendations or feasibility studies would only be possible if monies \nare available after the regional study is complete.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I agree completely with my colleagues' \ninterpretation of section 3004 and for the necessity of the section in \nquestion. When we added the provision in the Sandy relief bill for a \n$20 million comprehensive study to address flood risks on the east \ncoast, we intended for this study to produce specific and actionable \nrecommendations for hurricane protection. I thank my colleagues for \ntheir work and Chairman Boxer for her leadership.\n\n\n                     GREAT LAKES NAVIGATION FUNDING\n\n  Mr. LEVIN: Madam President, this water resources bill includes \nimportant provisions for our shipping infrastructure, including the \nGreat Lakes Navigation System, which carries over 160 million tons of \ncargo annually. I am pleased the bill would prioritize funding for the \nGreat Lakes Navigation System, which has suffered from historically low \nwater levels, closed harbors, and light loaded vessels. The bill \nallocates 20 percent of priority funds for the Great Lakes Navigation \nSystem, which is equal to the Great Lakes portion of high-use deep \ndraft projects nationwide. I am glad that the 20 percent of priority \nfunds for the Great Lakes is intended to be above and beyond what \nprojects in the Great Lakes Navigation System would receive under the \nbaseline funding. I also want to highlight the rationale for \nidentifying the Great Lakes as a single system. A freighter is \nrestricted to loading its vessel based on the shallowest segment of its \nroute. So a freighter that begins at a port that is adequately \nmaintained, then passes through a channel or proceeds to a harbor that \nis not adequately maintained, that freighter will not be able to fully \nload, reducing the efficiency of the navigation system and reducing our \neconomic competitiveness. The Army Corps of Engineers should manage all \nof the individual harbor projects in the Great Lakes Navigation System \nas a single system, recognizing the interconnectedness among the \nprojects. Chairman Boxer, is the interconnected nature of the Great \nLakes system one of the reasons the bill distinguishes Great Lakes \nprojects from the other harbor and port projects?\n  Mrs. BOXER. The unique nature of the Great Lakes Navigation System is \none of the reasons we do not include Great Lakes projects in the \ndefinition of high-use deep draft harbors and instead include the Great \nLakes in a separate group for the prioritized funding.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am pleased that this matter concerning the additional \nfunds for the Great Lakes has been clarified. The chairman has gone to \ngreat lengths to address important national priorities in this bill, \nincluding providing funding for our high-use, deep draft ports--like \nthose in New York, Los Angeles/Long Beach and Oakland--and supporting \nunique commercial navigation systems like the Great Lakes. I also want \nto make sure that these funds are distributed to harbors in the Great \nLakes that have been ignored by the corps over the years. Chairman \nBoxer, is that the intent of the language in section 8004 of the bill, \nthat additional priority funds could be used for any Great Lakes \nnavigation project, including those that handle lower levels of \nfreight, measured by tonnage?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, that is correct. The funding could be used for any \nproject in the Great Lakes Navigation System.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank the Senator for clarifying this matter, and I \nthank her for her work on this important legislation.\n  Mrs. KLOBUCHAR. I am also pleased to hear this discussion to clarify \nhow the additional funding for the Great Lakes is to be interpreted and \napplied. I want to ensure the entire Great Lakes system functions \neffectively, and that means properly dredging the harbors in Minnesota \nso ships carrying iron ore, coal, limestone, and other commodities can \nfully load their vessels. It is critical that high-use ports like \nDuluth and Two Harbors in Minnesota get dredged, but for ships to carry \ngoods at full capacity, it is also vital that their trading partners \nthroughout the Great Lakes system are fully dredged. This agreement \nwill go a long way toward increasing the efficiency of shipping across \nthe Great\n\n[[Page S3449]]\n\nLakes system, which will strengthen the economic standing of our \nagriculture, mining, manufacturing and other industries on which the \nGreat Lakes region depends. I would like to thank Chairman Boxer and \nSenator Vitter, for their work to address our concerns, and I would \nespecially like to acknowledge the leadership of Senator Levin on this \nissue and Great Lakes matters across the board.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank Senator Klobuchar for adding that important point \nregarding the interconnected nature of the Great Lakes Navigation \nSystem. And thank you, Chairman Boxer, for working us to begin to \nimprove the maintenance of the Great Lakes Navigation System, which is \ncritical to our economy and jobs and to our global competitiveness.\n\n\n        HARBOR MAINTENANCE TAX AND HARBOR MAINTENANCE TRUST FUND\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise to address the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act that we passed today.\n  This important legislation authorizes Army Corp of Engineers projects \nthat provide flood control, ensure navigation to get our goods to \nmarket, and help restore our ecosystems and environment. One component \nof this bill deals with the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund.\n  Shippers pay a Harbor Maintenance Tax, which goes into the Harbor \nMaintenance Trust Fund and is then appropriated for operations and \nmaintenance at ports throughout our country.\n  Now, although this legislation does not address the Harbor \nMaintenance Tax, I want to take a moment to talk about it. Because \nunfortunately, this policy is encouraging cargo diversion from our \nports.\n  A Federal Maritime Commission report released last year, which I \nrequested with Senator Cantwell, indicated that cargo coming into U.S. \nports cost, on average, an additional $109 due to the Harbor \nMaintenance Tax.\n  I find this report extremely troubling.\n  While this bill does not address the tax, it does address the Harbor \nMaintenance Trust Fund. The bill sets goals for additional expenditures \nfrom the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, and it includes a provision \nthat I worked on closely with Chairman Boxer and Senator Cantwell.\n  This provision will allow our ports to be more competitive \ninternationally by providing payments to shippers entering or \ntransporting cargo through an eligible donor port--one that takes in \nsignificantly more in Harbor Maintenance Taxes than it receives back \nfor operations and maintenance, like the Port of Seattle or the Port of \nTacoma.\n  It is meant to reduce cargo diversion from United States ports to \ninternational ports, but not to induce cargo diversion within the \nUnited States.\n  I appreciate the hard work by Chairman Boxer to include this \nprovision in the manager's amendment and to keep the provision intact \nthroughout consideration of the Water Resources Development Act.\n  This provision is a step in the right direction.\n  But we can do more, and we must.\n  That is why I'm working on legislation that will comprehensively \nreform the Harbor Maintenance Tax and the Harbor Maintenance Trust \nFund.\n  It will ensure full spend out of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund \nand ensure all cargo is treated equally as it moves through the supply \nchain.\n  My goals are to increase our international competitiveness, ensure we \nare getting our goods to market, and provide good, family-wage jobs.\n  I have been working with ports in Washington state and the Northwest, \nand I plan to introduce this legislation soon.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on these important \nissues.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter \ndated May 15, 2013, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Jo-Ellen Darcy,\n     Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, U.S. Army \n         Corps of Engineers, Army Pentagon, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Assistant Secretary Darcy: We are writing regarding \n     recent efforts in our committee to address concerns with the \n     Water Supply Act of 1958 (WSA), 43 U.S.C. 390b. These \n     concerns have arisen most prominently with respect to the \n     U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' management of federal \n     reservoirs in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) \n     River System and the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa (ACT) River \n     System, where the States of Alabama, Georgia, and Florida \n     have been engaged in a decades-long conflict over the use of \n     water resources in their region.\n       As committee leadership with jurisdiction over these \n     matters, we believe in the principle that water resources \n     conflicts of this nature should be resolved through \n     negotiated interstate water compacts whenever possible. \n     State-level agreements are better able to take into \n     consideration the concerns of all affected States and \n     stakeholders, including impacts to other authorized uses of \n     the projects (such as hydropower or navigation), water supply \n     for communities and major cities in the region, fisheries \n     management issues, water quality, freshwater flows to \n     communities, rivers, lakes, estuaries, and bays located \n     downstream of projects, agricultural uses, economic \n     development, and other appropriate concerns.\n       As you are aware, the Senate Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works unanimously reported the Water Resources \n     Development Act of 2013 (S. 601), as amended, on March 20, \n     2013. Section 2015 of this bill, as reported by our \n     committee, sought to clarify the authority of the Army Corps \n     under Section 301 of the WSA in at least two respects. First, \n     Section 2015 would have amended the WSA to reiterate that \n     federal agencies must consider new WSA allocations \n     ``cumulatively'' with all previous allocations at the \n     reservoir. This was intended to make clear that the Army \n     Corps cannot circumvent the intent of the WSA through gradual \n     allocations. Second, Section 2015, as reported, sought to \n     amend the WSA by setting a more specific threshold when \n     congressional approval is required. We worked in good faith \n     with our committee member, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, \n     to ensure that concerns he had. expressed in committee, both \n     last year and during the current Congress, were addressed.\n       Today, the Senate passed the WRDA bill and, after \n     significant discussions with several members of the Senate, \n     we have reached an agreement to modify Section 2015. The new \n     language for Section 2015 does not alter existing rights or \n     obligations under law, but it does seek to make clear that \n     the committee remains very concerned about the operation of \n     ACF and ACT projects, and that absent action by the states to \n     resolve these issues, the committee should consider \n     appropriate legislation including any necessary \n     clarifications to the Water Supply Act of 1958 or other law.\n       Accordingly, we strongly urge your personal and direct \n     involvement in fostering efforts to enable the States of \n     Alabama, Georgia, and Florida to reach an amicable and \n     reasonable water compact as soon as possible. We believe that \n     it is essential that the Army Corps not take actions that \n     favor the position of any of the three States, but rather the \n     Army Corps should serve as a neutral facilitator of a \n     negotiated solution.\n       Thank you for your kind attention to these matters. Our \n     committee will be following this issue closely.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Barbara Boxer,\n       Chairman.\n     David Vitter,\n       Ranking Member.\n\n\n                         Harbor Maintenance Tax\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I would like to thank Chairman Baucus \nand Senator Murray for their support and resolve to work to address the \nissue of cargo diversion posed by the harbor maintenance tax.\n  The Water Resources Development Act that we are discussing here today \nis an important bill that works to ensure the economic success of our \nNation's waterways. The language we were able to include in this bill \nis just the start of our effort to address the serious issue of cargo \ndiversion and international competition. It gives deep-water ports the \nability to more cost-effectively utilize the funds raised by the harbor \nmaintenance tax to keep competitive with their Canadian and Mexican \ncounterparts.\n  Over the past decade, we have seen increasing competition for the \nmarket share of U.S.-bound goods from ports beyond our border to the \nnorth and to the south. These diversions can be partially attributed to \nthe added cost of paying the harbor maintenance tax at U.S. ports. In \nfact, among the top 25 North American ports, the fastest growing in \n2012 were the Port of Prince Rupert in Canada and the Port of Lazaro \nCardenas in Mexico. Instead of U.S.-bound cargo creating growth of U.S. \nports, we are witnessing this cargo, previously shipped through our \nwest coast ports, contributing to the growth of Canadian and Mexican \nports. The loss of cargo shipments through American ports leads to \ndecreased port activity and export capacity, and it\n\n[[Page S3450]]\n\nerodes the harbor maintenance trust fund, which means fewer direct and \nindirect American jobs supporting U.S. international commerce. More \nthan 200,000 jobs are tied to the activities at the ports of Seattle \nand Tacoma, and with nearly 27 percent of international container cargo \npotentially at risk of moving to Canada from west voast ports, this \ncould result in significant job losses.\n  Cargo diversion is not my only concern with the harbor maintenance \ntax. I also am concerned by the poor utilization of the funds collected \nand the disparate distribution of the funds that are allocated. As of \n2011, the balance of the harbor maintenance trust fund has built up to \nmore than $6.4 billion. We should be investing this balance for its \ndesigned purpose of improving the ability of our ports to move goods. \nFurthermore, the harbor maintenance trust fund balance is rarely spent \non operations and maintenance at west coast ports, where a significant \namount of the tax revenue is generated. Our two largest ports in \nWashington Seattle and Tacoma generate, on average, close to 7 percent \nof the funding for the HMTF, but each received just over a penny for \nevery dollar collected from shippers who pay the HMT in Seattle and \nTacoma.\n  To remain competitive in an international marketplace, we need a \nlong-term plan for how to grow and support infrastructure development \nand that must include reform of the harbor maintenance tax. Essential \nto remaining competitive is the ability of our ports to shorten the \ntime it takes to get goods to consumers. This means we must invest in \nthe infrastructure of our ports and freight corridors something that I \nhave worked with Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood on to more quickly \ndeliver the goods from our ports to the rest of the Nation. If we don't \nmake these infrastructure investments, America will face major \nopportunity costs. We are seeing this already with the cargo diversion \nto Canada from the Pacific Northwest. But I must warn my colleagues \nthat the competition is only increasing and will spread throughout the \ncountry with major ports planned or coming online in Canada and Mexico \non both coasts, as well as the forthcoming expansion of the Panama \nCanal. Now is the time to address the harbor maintenance tax and \nreverse cargo diversion by reforming this tax and better utilizing the \nmoney it generates.\n  Today Chairman Baucus is proposing that we work together to address \nthe competitive imbalances created by the harbor maintenance tax. While \nwe acknowledge the work done to improve the spending out of the harbor \nmaintenance trust fund collections in the Water Resources Development \nAct, we believe the efforts are just a starting point. Many of the \nunderlying tax and trade issues cannot be addressed in this \nlegislation. We believe it is important to clarify our intent to move \non comprehensive reforms the harbor maintenance tax on the next \navailable and appropriate legislative vehicle.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Cantwell and Chairman \nBaucus for coming down here today to discuss port competitiveness, \ninfrastructure, and American jobs, issues which are close to my heart. \nI believe these are important issues to be addressed, which is why I \nhave been working on this issue throughout my Senate tenure and why \nSenator Cantwell and I introduced the U.S. Port Opportunity and \nRevitalizing Trade Act in 2002.\n  We appreciate that the legislation before us today, the Water \nResources Development Act, works to improve expenditures from the \nharbor maintenance trust fund and that it includes provisions we \nchampioned to begin to address the competitive issues our ports face. I \nwould like to say thank you to Chairwoman Boxer, who included a \nprovision in the managers' amendment that would authorize payments to \n``donor'' ports those ports that contribute a significant amount of \nfunds, but receive less than 25 percent of the benefit that can be used \nto offset the cost of the HMT being paid by shippers.\n  The language in the managers' amendment does not mean that the job is \ndone. We do not believe this language will fully correct the challenges \nU.S. ports face now and will continue to face in the future. Rather, we \nbelieve this is an interim solution that will help until we can work \ntogether to find a larger, more permanent solution addressing cargo \ndiversion. Senator Cantwell and I look forward to working with the \nChairman Baucus to address comprehensive reform of the harbor \nmaintenance tax.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Cantwell and Senator \nMurray for their work to reform the harbor maintenance tax in order to \nkeep our ports competitive. As chairman of the Finance Committee, I \nbelieve it is important that we work to improve our Nation's tax policy \nto make our Nation more globally competitive. I am committed to finding \nsolutions to ensure that the harbor maintenance tax is reformed, to \nensure U.S. tax policy does not disadvantage U.S. ports but also to \nimprove our nation's infrastructure. Port improvement is imperative to \nour ability to conduct both domestic and international commerce. Many \nof my home State goods are exported through west coast ports in the \nPuget Sound and on the Columbia River, so I understand the broad impact \nof the ports and the need for continued attention. If we want to \ncontinue to compete both now and in the future we must ensure that we \nhave the right policies in place, and that means reforming outdated \npolicies to address the evolving needs of both the market and our \nNation. I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Cantwell and \nSenator Murray to find an appropriate fix and find an appropriate \nlegislative vehicle for comprehensive reform.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of \nthe Water Resources Development Act, the main vehicle for authorizing \nvital water projects developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and \nfor setting Army Corps water resource policies. Water resource and \nflood control projects spur economic growth and create jobs. They \nfortify communities against storms and floods. They maintain our water \nand waste water systems. They help maintain our favorite outdoor \nrecreational destinations. And they can protect America's cherished and \neconomically important--fish and wildlife.\n  Unfortunately, in Rhode Island and across the country, aging water \ninfrastructure is rapidly approaching the end of its useful life, and \nfunding available for upgrades is far outpaced by the need. This bill \nwill increase the Army Corps' capacity to address the dismal state of \nour water infrastructure while improving the agency's operations.\n  I want to express my gratitude to our chairman on the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, Senator Boxer, as well as our ranking member, \nSenator Vitter, for their hard work in drafting a bill that addresses a \nnumber of national and regional priorities in a bipartisan fashion.\n  I particularly appreciate the inclusion of several provisions \ndesigned to clean up the process at the Army Corps, to clear the \nbacklog of construction and maintenance projects, to improve \ntransparency in developing and carrying out civil works projects, and \nto give local communities a better chance to understand what to expect.\n  According the Office of Management and Budget, ``The Corps' enormous \nbacklog of ongoing civil works construction represents a significant \nsource of unrealized economic and environmental benefits. . . . This \ngrowth trend in the construction backlog unfairly penalizes both \ntaxpayers and project sponsors.''\n  The bill before us establishes an independent commission to work \nthrough an estimated $62 billion backlog of projects and sets a \ntimetable for downsizing the corps' burdensome to-do list. My \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle should appreciate the responsible \nuse of corps resources and of taxpayer dollars.\n  This bill also makes the corps more responsive to communities and \nbusinesses, requiring the corps to make more information available to \nthe public about projects under its Continuing Authorities Program, \nincluding available funding, cost estimates, and the criteria used to \nprioritize projects. States like mine and our communities and companies \ncan't plan around water resource projects because they are so often \nleft in the dark.\n  For example, Hope Global has manufactured textiles in Rhode Island \nsince 1883. Today it makes fabrics that are\n\n[[Page S3451]]\n\nused in everything from cars to parachutes to construction. During the \nhistoric 2010 floods in our State that clobbered Hope Global, I \nliterally entered the building through the shipping bay in a boat. Hope \nGlobal survived, thanks to the dedication and quick thinking of its CEO \nand employees, but the risk of future flooding along the Blackstone \nRiver looms over this business and many others in the area.\n  The corps has partnered with the State of Rhode Island to conduct a \nfeasibility study for flooding mitigation on the Blackstone River. The \nState used its limited resources to fund the study, hoping to solve the \nflooding problems once and for all. Three years later, due to lack of \ntransparency in the corps budget, we still don't know where this \nproject stands. This bill will change that, so communities like those \nin my State can make informed decisions about their future.\n  Episodes like the 2010 floods and, more recently, Superstorm Sandy \nunderscore the need to keep communities safe in the face of a changing \nclimate. The Army Corps of Engineers helps communities prepare for \nextreme weather events and addresses flood control hazards. In many \nplaces, these twin objectives can be pursued through the restoration of \nnatural ecosystems. This reauthorization places greater emphasis on \nnatural defenses like the wetlands and dunes that have protected our \ncoastlines for millennia.\n  Coastal and freshwater wetlands act like sponges during floods, \nabsorbing water and dissipating the impact of wave energy and storm \nsurge. Shoreline vegetation, natural dune formations, and barrier \nislands do the same. This draft recognizes the benefits of natural \nresiliency.\n  This bill also reauthorizes the National Dam Safety Program, which is \nvitally important to my small State. Rhode Island has about 700 dams, \nsome dating back to the colonial era. One hundred seventy-nine are \nrated a ``high'' or ``significant risk.'' Nationally, America's dams \nreceived a grade of ``D'' on the American Society of Civil Engineers \n2013 Report Card. The Society cited more than 4,000 deficient dams, \nincluding more than 2,000 that would result in loss of life if they \nfailed. The Dam Safety Program helps States monitor for deteriorating \ndam conditions that put communities in danger.\n  This legislation is not without its detractors, but I think it is \nimportant to recognize that both sides have had to make compromises to \nget this bill to where it is today. That is the hallmark of our \nlegislative process.\n  For example, this reauthorization contains new measures to ensure the \ntimely completion of environmental impact studies and reviews required \nunder the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. While this has \nraised concerns from some, ensuring prompt environmental review of \nprojects does not mean we are disregarding these reviews entirely. \nComprehensive environmental review of federal projects remains critical \nto protecting the environment and public health from harm, and this \nbill includes provisions that will prevent harmful projects from being \nexpedited.\n  WRDA supports projects that protect communities and their water \nresources. I would have preferred to leave NEPA requirements unaltered; \nhowever, I believe the compromise the chair and ranking member \nnegotiated on this issue was worth the price of being able to implement \nlong-overdue improvements to our nation's water resources \ninfrastructure.\n  As we grapple with the mounting effects of a changing climate, our \ntowns, our rivers and ports, our beaches and bays rely on the safety \nand efficiency of modern and resilient water infrastructure. The Water \nResources Development Act of 2013 gives the Army Corps of Engineers and \nits public and private sector partners the tools to provide and \nmaintain that infrastructure. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant, bipartisan legislation.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, as we consider S. 601, the Water \nResources Development Act, specifically amendment No. 903, I want to \nhighlight critical emerging needs in our Nation's arctic.\n  The arctic is opening at an alarming rate, which creates a number of \neconomic opportunities for the Nation. This accessibility also creates \nnew requirements for the U.S. Coast Guard and the Navy. Multiple \nbipartisan Presidential directives call for increased arctic presence \nto meet national security and homeland security needs; to facilitate \nsafe, secure, and reliable navigation; to protect maritime commerce; \nand to protect the environment as resource development increases.\n  With new shipping lanes and opportunities to obtain and transport \nnatural resources, the arctic has become a new frontier. We need to \nhave arctic infrastructure ready to accommodate this increase in \ncommerce.\n  That is why I have worked closely with Senator Begich to fight for \nheavy-duty icebreakers and other arctic infrastructure. We need to make \nsure the Coast Guard acquires the tools they need to fulfill their \nmissions in the arctic.\n  In fact, the Army Corps of Engineers is in the final phase of a study \nwhich assesses feasibility of deep draft ports in the arctic. The corps \nassessed over 3,000 miles of Alaskan coastline and identified a \nshortlist of two possible deep draft ports in Nome and Port Clarence.\n  The U.S. Department of the Interior released a report on emerging \nFederal management needs in the arctic in March 2013. The report, \ntitled ``Managing for the Future in a Rapidly Changing Environment,'' \nfound that the U.S. arctic habitat encompasses St. Lawrence Island \nNorthward, based on physical oceanography, seasonal sea ice, and other \necosystem characteristics. These northern seas are vastly different and \nrequire unique infrastructure compared to the majority of the Bering \nSea, Alaska.\n  It is the intent of this bill that these arctic deep draft ports are \npresent in the arctic. And while there has been some dispute on how the \nU.S. arctic is defined, both the Army Corps study and the Department of \nthe Interior report indicate the importance of deep draft ports in \nclose proximity to the Arctic Circle, 66 degrees North. This is where \nports of refuge, natural resource shipping, oilspill response, \ncommercial shipping, and other commercial opportunities require a deep \ndraft port.\n  These key findings identify ports that must be prioritized when \nconsidering deep water draft port development in the arctic, where the \nFederal Government has a role including technical assistance outlined \nin amendment 903.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, Michigan is a water State. The State is \nsurrounded by water on three of its sides. We depend on our vital water \nresources for drinking water and commerce. Water provides opportunities \nfor recreation, rest, and reflection. Our waters define us. It has been \n6 years since the last Water Resources Development Act was passed. This \nbill includes several provisions that will improve the management of \nMichigan's water resources, such as critical harbor maintenance, \nupgrades to drinking and wastewater systems, flood control projects, \nand restoration of aquatic resources, and I will support its passage.\n  This bill makes some progress toward improving the Great Lakes \nNavigation System, and I am pleased that the Senate Environment and \nPublic Works Committee worked with us to address concerns with the \nreported bill. The bill would increase authorized appropriations for \nharbor maintenance, beginning with $1 billion in fiscal year 2014 and \nincreasing every year thereafter by $100 million through fiscal year \n2019. In fiscal year 2020 and beyond, the bill would require that total \nbudget resources for harbor maintenance equal the full amount of funds \ncollected for that purpose. Currently, only about half of the funds \ncollected from shippers for harbor maintenance are used for harbor \nmaintenance. The harbor maintenance trust fund, into which the fees \nfrom shippers are collected, has a balance of over $7 billion.\n  Great Lakes harbors and channels are in great need of dredging. A \nbacklog of dredging projects forces vessels to carry less than their \ncapacity, threatens to close harbors and increases the risk of vessel \ngroundings. These funds need to be used for harbor maintenance instead \nof for other purposes. I have been fighting to free these funds and \nworked with the EPW Committee to incorporate the text of the Harbor \nMaintenance Act of 2013, which I introduced earlier this year in \nFebruary, into the committee-reported\n\n[[Page S3452]]\n\nbill. While the point of order enforcement language of my bill that \nwould have required full funding immediately for harbor maintenance was \nnot included in the final version, the compromise language that would \nphase in the increased funding still represents progress. The next step \nin the dredging battle will be to work with appropriators so that \nfunding is provided at the authorized levels.\n  I am also pleased that the EPW Committee responded to my concerns \nregarding how harbor maintenance funding was prioritized. I had written \na letter to EPW that was signed by 10 other Great Lakes Senators \nexpressing our concerns, and EPW responded by including a provision in \nthe bill that would prioritize 20 percent of harbor maintenance funds \nin excess of fiscal year 2012 levels for the Great Lakes. This setaside \nrepresents real progress, and I hope appropriators will provide funding \nin accordance with this directive in the bill.\n  I am also pleased that my amendment concerning other uses of the \nharbor maintenance trust fund was agreed to by the full Senate. That \namendment, which was cosponsored by Senator Stabenow, makes clear that \nthe primary use of the harbor maintenance trust fund is for maintaining \nthe constructed widths and depths of ports and harbors and that those \nfunctions should be given first consideration in the budgeting of \nharbor maintenance trust fund allocations. I fought for this language \nbecause the bill includes a new authorization for other uses of the \ntrust fund, and I wanted to make sure that harbor maintenance, \nincluding that of the Great Lakes, has a higher claim for these funds \nthan the other new uses.\n  In addition to the beneficial harbor maintenance provisions, the bill \nalso includes a number of other provisions that could benefit Michigan. \nA new pilot program, called the Water Infrastructure Financing and \nInnovation Act, is included in the bill, and it would increase options \nfor financing our nation's water and wastewater infrastructure by \nproviding loan guarantees and low interest loans with flexible \nrepayment terms. WIFIA is a positive provision for Michigan and the \nNation that will help to address the ongoing problems we face with \naging and outdated infrastructure.\n  As Michigan and much of the Midwest recover from damaging flooding, I \nam pleased to see an authorization for the National Levee Safety \nProgram and the establishment of a National Levee Safety Advisory \nBoard. The board will provide technical assistance to States and tribes \non levee safety and facilitate the development of levee safety programs \nthrough a Federal grant program. Levees are an essential part of our \nflood protection infrastructure. This provision will hopefully ensure \nour levees are constructed and maintained using sound science and the \nbest available information.\n  The bill also includes a provision on dam safety that is critical to \nMichigan communities. The Dam Safety Program provides grant assistance \nto States for the training of dam safety staff and for the development \nof safety monitoring programs. This bill also helps us in the Asian \ncarp fight. I worked with Senator Gillibrand to include a provision \nthat would authorize the Army Corps of Engineers to implement emergency \nmeasures to prevent Asian carp and other invasive species from getting \ninto the Great Lakes. That language is based on a provision I was able \nto get included in an appropriations bill for fiscal year 2012, and \nincluding it in the WRDA bill would make the authority permanent.\n  I also want to mention the shadow that hangs over this legislation \nand all the other legislation before us. That shadow is sequestration, \nand until we lift that shadow, it will erode the good we seek to \naccomplish with this legislation and everything else we do.\n  The projects authorized in this bill will touch every State in our \nNation, put Americans to work, help American companies sell their goods \nhere and around the world, improve our navigation systems, and provide \nclean drinking water for our homes and businesses. But authorizing \nthese projects is not enough. We also need to appropriate the money to \nexecute these projects. And so long as sequestration remains in effect, \nso long as we continue to view our fiscal challenges as exclusively a \nmatter of cutting budgets, so long as we ignore the desires of the \nAmerican public and the realities of budget math and refuse to adopt a \nbalanced approach to deficit reduction--so long as all that continues, \nthose appropriations will be reduced. As a result, water projects will \nsuffer, health and education programs will suffer, law enforcement, \nborder security, food inspections and more will suffer. The Speaker of \nthe House said not long ago, ``We can't cut our way to prosperity.'' \nHe's right. We can't cut our way to clean water or operable harbors \neither. We need to keep that in mind as we consider budget solutions \ngoing forward.\n  Despite the challenge of sequestration and continued fiscal \npressures, the bill before us represents progress for America's \nwaterways and the people who depend on them and in particular for the \nprecious waters of my State of Michigan. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this much-needed legislation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, our inland waterways are a large and \ncrucial part of our Nation's transportation system and facilitate \nbillions of dollars of economic activity each year. In Iowa, \nagricultural producers as well as other shippers depend upon \ntransportation along the Mississippi River and Missouri River to gain \naccess to markets throughout the country and the world. The channels, \nlocks, and dams throughout our inland waterways system are the \ninfrastructural elements that allow the system to safely and \nefficiently support this activity. Without sustained financing through \nthe inland waterways trust fund, this infrastructure cannot be properly \nmaintained.\n  Today I want to bring my colleagues' attention to an amendment \noffered by Senator Casey to S. 601, the Water Resources Development \nAct. Senator Casey's amendment No. 854 takes an important step toward \nensuring that the inland waterways trust fund can meet current and \nfuture infrastructure needs. While demands on the trust fund have \ngreatly increased in recent years, the financing mechanism, a $0.20-\nper-gallon barge fuel tax, has not been raised since 1994. Senator \nCasey's amendment would strengthen the trust fund by raising the tax to \n$0.29. Many locks are already in such disrepair that catastrophic \nfailure could occur in the near future. A lock failure would cause a \nloss of navigation along the system above that point, incurring serious \neconomic losses. Not only is this fuel tax increase badly needed, it is \nwidely supported by industries dependent upon our inland waterways, \nincluding the barge operating industry, which is directly impacted by \nthe tax.\n  While it is unfortunate that Senator Casey's amendment could not be \nbrought up for consideration, I hope its substance can become law in \nthe coming months.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, today the Senate will pass a Water \nResources Development Act, or WRDA, for the first time since 2007. I \nthank my colleagues, chairman Barbara Boxer and ranking member David \nVitter of the Environment and Public Works Committee, for working \ntogether to move a bipartisan bill out of committee and to the floor.\n  I know it wasn't easy, and compromises were made. But water resources \ndevelopment bills are important to the commerce that moves by river and \nsea, to those communities and towns that rely on the Corps of Engineers \nto protect them from flooding and other storm damage, and to \nmaintaining the precious natural resources that our rivers, streams, \nand wetlands represent.\n  We have an infrastructure problem in this country. The American \nSociety of Civil Engineers estimates that we need $3.6 trillion \ninvestment in our failing infrastructure. I say failing not only \nbecause its literally crumbling but because the American Society of \nCivil Engineers 2013 Infrastructure Report Card gave America's \ninfrastructure a ``D-plus.'' But for our inland waterways, levees, and \nports that grade is a ``D-minus.''\n  As an example, consider the locks and dams on the Mississippi and \nIllinois Rivers. These two rivers are important economic arteries, \ntransporting millions of tons of product each year. The locks and dams \nthat allow barges to move these goods were built in the 1930s and \n1940s.\n  They are aging, and the risk of failure grows by the day. Back in \nMarch, a\n\n[[Page S3453]]\n\nmiter gate at the Marseilles Lock and Dam failed and was closed for 7 \ndays. During that time, more than 50,000 tons of petroleum products \ncame to a halt. That was a 7 day closure--can you imagine the economic \nimpact of a catastrophic failure of one of these locks?\n  But we also must face reality that we passed this bill in a time of \nbudget caps. This bill tries to update some of the funding mechanisms \nand processes we use to maintain and build locks dams, levees, and \nharbors.\n  With such great need and limited resources, my colleague Senator Mark \nKirk and I introduced the Water Infrastructure Now Public Private \nPartnership Act, or WIN P3. I am pleased that the Senate-passed WRDA \nincludes a major provision of our bill.\n  The provision adds a new element to a pilot program that allows for \npublic private agreements between the Corps of Engineers and private \nentities. The pilot would allow the corps to expedite construction by \nbringing in private entities that have enough of a stake in completing \ninfrastructure projects quickly that they could bring in private \nresources to help complete the work. The new language ensures that \nprojects that have not received Federal funds would qualify for the \nprogram--projects like lock and dam modernization on the Mississippi \nand Illinois Rivers.\n  Currently those upgrades aren't projected to be complete until 2090. \nWith this new program, I am hopeful new ways to fund and deliver big \nprojects like these will be developed and help Illinois upgrade our \nwater infrastructure more quickly.\n  This bill includes many provisions that could greatly benefit my home \nState of Illinois. It would keep up the fight against the spread of \nAsian carp. We must keep this invasive species from damaging the \necosystem of Lake Michigan.\n  The bill would also implement a National Levee Safety Program to \nestablish safety standards and provide assistance to locals whose \nlevees require rehabilitation. Many communities in Illinois find \nthemselves in the difficult situation of having their levees \ndecertified but without the funds to make the necessary repairs. I am \nhopeful that this bill could help at least some of them.\n  I am pleased that the bill addresses extreme weather. No matter why \nyou think it is happening, it is clear that extreme weather events are \nbecoming more severe and more frequent.\n  Consider the last year: The two costliest natural disasters in the \nworld occurred in the United States--the Midwest drought and Hurricane \nSandy, costing $100 billion. We can't ignore the reality that weather \nevents like these are the new normal.\n  This bill would initiate studies by the National Academy of Sciences \nand GAO to evaluate how we respond to and mitigate extreme weather \nevents. It would also give the corps greater authority to learn from \nand prepare for extreme weather events.\n  We have certainly seen our fair share of extreme weather in the \nMidwest and along the Mississippi River lately. Right now in Illinois \nand the Midwest, we are recovering from major floods. But it was only 5 \nmonths ago that the drought that sapped the Midwest caused record low \nwater levels on the Mississippi--levels not seen since World War II.\n  I traveled to see it. The corps and Coast Guard took me out on an \nobservation boat. When we got to the center of the channel, the corps \ncommander said, ``Imagine water ten feet over your head right now, \nthat's where the water levels should be.''\n  The water was so low it threatened to stop navigation on America's \ngreat commercial artery. Every few days barge operators and shippers \nwere faced with the difficult question of whether there would be enough \nwater for them to safely transit the Mississippi River. We are talking \nbillions of dollars in goods from nearly every sector imaginable--\nagriculture, energy, dry goods, bulk goods.\n  During the crisis, some recommended it could all be solved if we \nsimply allowed more water to flow from the Missouri River into the \nMississippi. Some even called on the President to declare a disaster \nand mandate the water be taken from the Missouri River.\n  I said, ``Let's hold on a minute, we are all in this together.'' What \nhappens on the Missouri affects the Mississippi, and the commerce on \nthe Mississippi clearly benefits the Missouri River States.\n  Instead of draining the Missouri River for the benefit of the \nMississippi, we pushed the corps to expedite removal of rock pinnacles \nthat obstructed navigation. With that, along with some needed rain and \ncreative management by the corps, we were able to maintain navigation \nwithout doing any harm to the Missouri River.\n  In my view, that was a fair and responsible outcome. Equally fair and \nresponsible, now that we are through the crisis, is doing everything we \ncan to learn from what happened and work to ensure we are better \nprepared if it happens again.\n  I introduced legislation to do that--the Mississippi River Navigation \nSustainment Act. I am pleased that legislation is part of the Senate-\npassed bill.\n  It will improve forecasting capabilities and technology on the \nMississippi River, give the corps greater flexibility to operate \noutside of the navigation channel, and create an environmental \nmanagement pilot program for the Middle Mississippi.\n  Also included from my bill is a provision that would create a greater \nMississippi River Basin severe flooding and drought management study. \nIt will for the first time look at the entire Mississippi River Basin, \nwhich covers 40 percent of the United States and is the third largest \nriver basin in the world. The study will help us better understand how \nthe basin functions as a system and how we can best manage it to \nmaintain safe and reliable navigation and protect lives and property--\nespecially during times of extreme flooding and drought.\n  This provision was added to the bill as an amendment that I \nintroduced with Senator Roy Blunt and others. That amendment was a \ncompromise between Missouri River Senators and Mississippi River \nSenators.\n  I thank my colleagues, including Senator Baucus, for working with me \nto come up with acceptable language. With this agreement, hopefully we \ncan start to get beyond the parochial wars of the past. It is clear \nthose of us on the Missouri River and the Mississippi River have a new \ncommon enemy that isn't going anywhere soon extreme weather.\n  I am encouraged that the Senate has come together in a bipartisan way \non this bill. I now hope the House will pass legislation that makes \nneeded investments in the waterways that are so important to the flow \nof commerce and upholds the environmental protections that keep \nAmerica's waterways healthy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, if I could be heard for less than a \nminute, I would like to thank every single Senator here. I think we \nhave literally worked with every one of the Senators on this bill.\n  Senator Vitter and I have our differences in a number of areas, but \nwhen it comes to the infrastructure of our country, we worked very well \ntogether, as I did with Senator Inhofe.\n  The committee voted this bill out unanimously, and we made it better \non this floor. Senators came to us with amendments that made this a \nbetter bill.\n  Also, I have to praise our staffs. They are unbelievable. I am not \ngoing to name names now, but later I will put them in the Record. \nSenator Vitter's and my chief of staff, as well as their teams, worked \nseamlessly in the most wonderful and cooperative fashion.\n  I want everyone to know that this bill is about 500,000 jobs, \nthousands of businesses, critical flood control, environmental \nrestoration projects, harbor maintenance, inland waterways, and we have \nadopted dozens and dozens of amendments.\n  We are very excited about this vote. We hope everyone will vote yea. \nIt would be a wonderful signal to the House so they can get on with \nthis work as well.\n  I yield to my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I join in all of the comments of the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, and I strongly support this \nbill as well.\n  This is a jobs bill as well as a water maritime infrastructure bill \nthat is\n\n[[Page S3454]]\n\ngood for the economy, and it does it in a way that doesn't increase the \ndeficit a penny. This bill contains no earmarks. It institutes \nimportant reforms to deauthorize projects that are not moving forward, \nso it should even be authorization net neutral. It provides reforms \nwhich are needed in terms of the Corps of Engineers.\n  This is a very strong bipartisan bill. I hope it is also some little \nsuggestion of how we can move forward in this body, work in a \nbipartisan way, and have real debate, amendments, and votes on the \nfloor, which is another whole aspect of this experience that has been \nvery positive.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Shall the bill pass?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nLautenberg) and the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Alaska (Ms. Murkowski).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin).

INLAND WATERWAYS SYSTEM REVENUES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n\n[[Page S3487]]\n\n       (1) there are approximately 12,000 miles of Federal \n     waterways, known as the inland waterways system, that are \n     supported by user fees and managed by the Corps of Engineers;\n       (2) the inland waterways system spans 38 States and handles \n     approximately one-half of all inland waterway freight;\n       (3) according to the final report of the Inland Marine \n     Transportation System Capital Projects Business Model, \n     freight traffic on the Federal fuel-taxed inland waterways \n     system accounts for 546,000,000 tons of freight each year;\n       (4) expenditures for construction and major rehabilitation \n     projects on the inland waterways system are equally cost-\n     shared between the Federal Government and the Inland \n     Waterways Trust Fund;\n       (5) the Inland Waterways Trust Fund is financed through a \n     fee of $0.20 per gallon on fuel used by commercial barges;\n       (6) the balance of the Inland Waterways Trust Fund has \n     declined significantly in recent years;\n       (7) according to the final report of the Inland Marine \n     Transportation System Capital Projects Business Model, the \n     estimated financial need for construction and major \n     rehabilitation projects on the inland waterways system for \n     fiscal years 2011 through 2030 is approximately \n     $18,000,000,000; and\n       (8) users of the inland waterways system are supportive of \n     an increase in the existing revenue sources for inland \n     waterways system construction and major rehabilitation \n     activities to expedite the most critical of those \n     construction and major rehabilitation projects.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the existing revenue sources for inland waterways \n     system construction and rehabilitation activities are \n     insufficient to cover the costs of non-Federal interests of \n     construction and major rehabilitation projects on the inland \n     waterways system; and\n       (2) the issue described in paragraph (1) should be \n     addressed.\n\n     SEC. 7006.

CON. RES. 25\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I appreciate Senator Reid yielding me \nthis time and Senator McConnell being on the floor for this, and I will \nbe brief.\n  As I discussed earlier this morning, yesterday's new report from the \nCongressional Budget Office highlights why it would be so important to \nhave a conference committee between the House and the Senate go to work \non the budget. What the Congressional Budget Office reported yesterday \nwas a 24-percent reduction in the budget deficit--quite a remarkable \nprojection. That, coupled with the improving jobs and housing numbers, \nwe now have economic experts across the political spectrum--for \nexample, people such as Glenn Hubbard, a leading Republican economist--\nsaying it is important for the Congress to look at these long-term \neconomic challenges. In fact, we have economic experts of both \npolitical parties saying Washington ought to be doing more about the \nlong-term economic challenges and not just have the day-to-day \nbattling.\n  Going to a budget conference will give us that opportunity. It will \ngive us the opportunity to look at the 10-year budget window and \nparticularly issues such as health care and taxes.\n  So in the name of dealing with the long-term economic challenges \nhighlighted by yesterday's projections, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 33, H. Con. \nRes. 25; that the amendment which is at the desk, the text of S. Con. \nRes. 8, the budget resolution passed by the Senate, be inserted in lieu \nthereof; that H. Con. Res. 25, as amended, be agreed to; the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that the Senate \ninsist on its amendment, request a conference with the House on the \ndisagreeing votes of the two Houses; and the Chair be authorized to \nappoint conferees on the part of the Senate; all with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senator modify his request that it not be in order for the \nSenate to consider a conference report that includes tax increases or \nreconciliation instructions to increase taxes or raise the debt limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I do not. The point I have tried to make is the \nCongressional Budget Office didn't talk about the Senate relitigating \npast discussions.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I have a parliamentary inquiry: Is \nthat an objection?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator object to the modification?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request of the Senator from \nOregon?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. If I could be recognized for another brief moment this \nhighlights how unfortunate it is that we don't look to the future as \nthe Congressional Budget Office projections laid out for us yesterday. \nThe Congressional Budget Office didn't talk about relitigating past \nvotes here in the Senate. They said specifically the deficit was \nsignificantly lower than earlier projected, and, on the basis of what I \nhave cited, economic experts of both political parties are saying it is \ntime to look to the long-term challenges, particularly Medicare and \ntaxes. I came today to say that a budget conference would provide that \nkind of window: the opportunity to look particularly at long-term \nhealth care challenges such as chronic care and Medicare.\n  I see my colleague from the Senate Finance Committee, who knows we \nhave been talking about tax reform, Democrats and Republicans; again, a \nbipartisan opportunity we could achieve through a conference. I \nproposed that today, based on the new evidence from yesterday. \nRegrettably, we can't go to conference because it seems the leader on \nthe other side will only go to conference if we can relitigate the \nstuff that happened in the Senate which he lost.\n  I hope colleagues will look at that new Congressional Budget Office \nreport. I hope they will look at the jobs picture, the housing starts, \nall of which seem to be improving in the short term. I hope they will \npay more attention to what economic experts of both political parties \nare saying, which is we ought to be looking to our long-term \nchallenges--particularly in health care and taxes--with the budget \nconference between the House and the Senate providing an opportunity to \nlook at that 10-year window. We could do exactly what economic experts \nof both political parties are talking about. I think it is unfortunate \nwe have not been given that opportunity today and I hope we will be \ngiven it in the days ahead.\n\n[[Page S3497]]\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, first, I thank my colleague from Oregon \nfor offering his proposal and am sorry it was rejected. We should be \ngoing to conference on the budget, there is no question about it. It is \nhard for us to understand how, on the other side, people have been \nrailing for 4 years: You do not have a budget. And now we have a budget \nand they do not want to move forward. But that is not what I rose to \nspeak about today.\n\n\n                            FLOOD INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, first, I also want to say to the \nSenator from California and the Senator from Louisiana, job well done. \nThe WRDA bill is a very good bill, and it will help both the port of \nNew York City--one of the great ports of the world--as well as our \nGreat Lakes ports, which are having their own troubles in terms of \ndredging.\n  But there was an extreme disappointment in the bill--no fault of my \ncolleague from California. I am extremely disappointed at the objection \nsome of my colleagues raised to even allowing a vote on the Landrieu \namendment to the WRDA bill, and I, along with Senator Landrieu and \nothers, will keep fighting until this commonsense amendment passes. I \nam speaking of amendment No. 888. I was proud to cosponsor it. Very \nsimply, it would delay for 5 years any premium increases resulting from \nrevised flood maps. The purpose of the amendment was to provide FEMA \nenough time to complete the study it was required to complete over a \nmonth ago on the affordability of increased premiums.\n  Senator Toomey is right that we passed a flood insurance \nreauthorization bill just 10 months ago, but it was always the intent--\nand many of us worked hard on that--under Biggert-Waters that FEMA \nwould conduct an affordability study before higher premiums would go \ninto effect. That way Congress could review the findings and \nrecommendations and address important issues relating to affordability \nand neighborhood sustainability.\n  Senator Landrieu's amendment was carefully crafted to give FEMA time \nto complete its study, then allow Congress 6 months to respond. For \ntechnical reasons, she amended it to a straight 5-year delay--I thought \nthat was better--but the purpose was the same. The logic is \nirrefutable: Why bother to do the study at all if we are going to allow \nFEMA to charge ahead and start raising premiums all over the country?\n  I say this to my colleagues--the Senator from Louisiana knows it \nwell, and we know it well in New York--you are going to be finding out \nacross the country that flood insurance premiums are going to rise so \nhigh that they will be unaffordable to average middle-class people.\n  What do you say to the homeowner who is forced into the choice of \neither paying crushing flood premiums or leaving their home and their \nneighborhood? Do we say to them: Sorry, we just couldn't get around to \nthinking about difficult cases like yours just yet.\n  That is not going to stand. That is not fair. It is not acceptable.\n  I note for my colleagues who might think this is just a Hurricane \nSandy-related issue, it is not. New Yorkers are facing this situation \nbecause our flood maps are being revised--a process that was well \nunderway before Sandy. So the increased premiums many New Yorkers could \nwell face will face all of your constituents. As FEMA starts revising \nflood maps--and they are increasing the number of homes included and \nincreasing the level at which homeowners have to pay--every one of you \nis going to be facing the same problem we are facing in New York.\n  Madam President, $9,500 for flood insurance for someone who makes \n$40,000 or $50,000 and lives in a modest home? Forget it. We cannot \nhave that, and I will tell FEMA right now that will not stand. \nSomething will give because the situation is untenable.\n  The original bill provided for a study, and then Congress could act \non that study and modify the bill. But now we are moving forward \nwithout even the study being done. In fact, people in some States are \nalready seeing their premiums rise up to 25 percent a year, and many \nmore States will be covered over the next 2 years.\n  If you think it is just coastal States, such as my State of New York \nand the State of Louisiana, it is not. In fact, according to FEMA, my \nfriend Senator Toomey's home State is one of the States that rely most \nheavily on flood insurance. Pennsylvania ranks seventh in the total \namount of NFIP payouts, seventh in the number of claims filed since the \nprogram began.\n  So we all have an interest to get this right, that we proceed with \neyes wide open in attempts to bring the Flood Insurance Program onto \nsounder financial footing; that we have the benefit of all the data and \nanalysis we need. My prediction: If we do not change this, there will \nbe no flood insurance or at the very minimum we will let it be optional \nfor everybody and let people decide because to force people between \npaying an amount they cannot afford and forcing people to leave their \nhomes is a choice this Congress will ultimately not abide for.\n  It is important to remember that if people cannot afford flood \ninsurance, they are going to drop out of the program. Their communities \nmight not adopt new flood maps when proposed because they know the cost \nis prohibitive. When future disasters hit, these families and \ncommunities will be entirely dependent on Federal aid to help them \nrebuild, and that will cost the taxpayers even more.\n  So it is important that we ensure the program is both financially \nsound and accessible to ordinary middle-class families. Something is \nvery wrong with a program that requires middle-class families to pay \nover $10,000 a year for a policy with coverage that is capped at \n$250,000.\n  You may ask why I am so passionate about this issue. Because I have \nvisited too many families, too many communities in New York City and in \nupstate New York where the prospect of higher premiums is causing \nresidents to rethink whether they can even afford to remain in the \nhomes in which they have lived, many of them, for their whole lives, \nwhether they can afford to live in the neighborhoods in which they grew \nup, where their families and friends live, where their children go to \nschool. Families are being forced to make this choice in neighborhoods \nfrom Staten Island to the Rockaways to Massapequa and east and upstate \nin places such as Schoharie County and in the southern tier counties \nsuch as Broome and Tioga and in north country counties such as Essex. \nIt would be a shame if we allowed this to happen--all because FEMA did \nnot get around to studying the impact of higher flood rates and \nCongress did not have a chance to respond.\n  So I hope that by the time New York's maps are completed and New \nYorkers have completed the process of rebuilding in the wake of Sandy, \nfears of $10,000 flood insurance premiums for middle-class homes will \nprove to have been incorrect. But right now those fears are very real, \nand they are putting the future of some of New York's most tightly knit \nmiddle-class neighborhoods at risk.\n  As I noted previously, New York's flood maps were in the process of \nbeing revised before Sandy hit. But in the wake of Sandy, it adds \ninsult to injury when families who are spending their entire savings to \nrepair their homes are told that in a year or two they may not be able \nto afford to live there.\n  In conclusion, I am disappointed that we did not get a vote on this \nissue, but I will keep pushing and pushing until this awful situation \nis rectified. I know Senator Landrieu will. I know Senator Vitter will. \nThe issue is too important to too many New Yorkers and too many \nAmericans, and I will not stop until we get a vote and until we \nultimately succeed.\n  I am confident many more of my colleagues will begin to hear from \ntheir constituents about the challenges they are facing as flood \npremiums are increased, and they will see the wisdom of Senator \nLandrieu's amendment and Congress will ultimately act to fix this \nproblem once and for all.\n  With that, I appreciate my colleagues giving me time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/15/senate-section/article/S3497-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3497-S3499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I think the Senator from New York is\n\n[[Page S3498]]\n\npointing out an issue Senator Vitter and I agree with, which is that we \nshould have had a vote on the Landrieu-Vitter amendment, which would \nhave definitely moved in the direction of ensuring that people's \ninsurance rates for flood protection do not go through the roof.\n  It was very disappointing that the Senator from Pennsylvania Mr. \nToomey opposed having even a vote on this. But you know what, we will \nhave other days in the Sun, I say to my friend, where we will deal with \nthis issue because it is too important to too many people across the \nNation.\n  But I do not want that to dim what just happened in the Senate. I do \nnot want the fact that there was one disappointment to take away from \nwhat just happened in the Senate. What just happened is that 83 \ncolleagues--83 strong--voted for the Water Resources Development Act \nthat came out of the Environment and Public Works Committee with a very \nstrong unanimous vote and that Senator Vitter and I, working together \nfor the first time on a big bill such as this, were able to put aside \nother differences and come together in an area where we both agree; \nthat is, it is essential to have a strong infrastructure in the \ngreatest Nation in the world and in our States. It is essential that \npeople not be worried that bridges will fall; that they will not have \ngood roads; that they will not have their ports deepened so they can \naccept these big ships that go in and out; that they will be vulnerable \nto flooding; and that they will not be able to restore wetlands, which \nare so critical to preventing floods.\n  This bill is so critical to the infrastructure and to the \nenvironment. Anyone who has been to the Everglades knows how critical \nit is to make sure the Everglades remain. It is a gift from God, and we \nhave the responsibility. Anyone who knows the Chesapeake Bay knows how \nimportant it is to ensure it is healthy. We do that in this bill. And \nwe do our best to ensure that the types of flooding we saw in Katrina \nwill be minimized. We made many, many reforms, and I feel good about \nthem.\n  I really have to say that without the staff, none of this would be \npossible. Senator Vitter and I are so blessed to have the kinds of \nstaffs we have. They are dedicated. The hours they work have no bounds. \nThe other night we were talking at 11 o'clock. My staff was there. This \ntype of a bill is not easy to get through because every State has its \nown needs, every State has its own challenges, every State has its own \nproblems. We were able, because of our staffs working endlessly, to \nmeet the needs, I believe, of the whole country, and that is why we \nhave votes from the entire country. We have votes from so many States \nbecause this bill is truly reflective of the needs of our communities.\n  I want to say to Bettina Poirier, my chief of staff and chief \ncounsel, you certainly know how to get a bill through. You certainly \nknow how to manage a staff. And you certainly have made wise decisions \nin terms of your staff. We have Jason Albritton and Ted Illston and \nTyler Rushforth and David Napoliello and Andrew Dohrmann.\n  These are only 1, 2, 3, 4, 5--6 names that I mentioned, and they \nhandled this bill from, essentially, 100 different Senators pounding on \ntheir doors, including this Senator, saying: What and why and how? And \nyou answered it.\n  I also want to close by thanking some other wonderful staffers of \nSenator Reid: Gary Myrick, Tim Mitchell, Bill Dauster, Alex McDonough, \nand, I have to say, Tyler Kruzich of the Budget Committee, who helped \nus, and Reema Dodin, who came in and really helped us make sure we had \nthe votes when we needed the votes.\n  And I am going to make one thank-you. I know Senator Vitter is going \nto name his staff. I am not going to mention their names, but he speaks \nfor me when he thanks them. But there is one person, and that is Neil \nChatterjee, and I hope I do not ruin his career by thanking him. He \nworks for Senator McConnell. He helped us greatly just to know the lay \nof the land. He said: This is where we have problems. This is where we \ncan come together.\n  And I will tell you something. Managing these bills, you just need to \nknow how you stand, and you need to know where you are. So having the \nsupport of both Senator Reid and Senator McConnell and their staffs has \nmade our world a lot easier.\n  So we say to the House: This is your chance. Step to the plate. I \nknow Chairman Shuster over there really wants a bill. We stand ready to \nwork with him. I think our bill provides a roadmap.\n  With that, I want to again say to Senator Vitter, it has been \nterrific to work with him, and I look forward to continuing our \ncollaboration anytime and anyplace we can come together.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I stand to echo all of those thoughts.\n  Let me start with a lot of overdue thanks. First of all, let me thank \na great partner in Chairman Boxer. As she said many times, we do not \nagree about a lot, including important issues within the jurisdiction \nof our committee, but we can come together constructively, really \nproductively, on the infrastructure side of our committee--both highway \ninfrastructure and water infrastructure. And that is what we wanted to \ndo from the very beginning on this bill.\n  The crucial element to any success is the will and the determination \nto do it. We both had that, but I really thank her for her leadership \nin that regard and being a great partner.\n  I certainly echo all of her thoughts about the staff work. I am \ndeeply indebted to all of the staff work, particularly on my side, that \nwent into this bill. The chair and I personally dealt with probably a \ncouple dozen issues and semicrises that would crop up over time.\n  But if we did that with a couple of dozen, our staffs did that with \nhundreds and solved those problems to the satisfaction of a huge number \nof Members. That was reflected in the vote. I thank both staffs, but I \nam particularly indebted to my staff for all of that hard work, \nparticularly Zak Baig, Charles Brittingham, Chris Tomassi, Sarah \nVeatch, Rebecca Louviere, Jill Landry, Luke Bolar, and Cheyenne Steel. \nThey all put in enormous hours--of course, Charles much more than \nanyone else, but they all put in enormous hours. I thank them for their \nexcellent work.\n  I also want to emphasize what a positive bill this is. I talked a few \nminutes ago, right before the vote, about the strengths of the bill \nfrom a national point of view: jobs, waterborne commerce, reform of the \nCorps of Engineers. This bill is also very important for my home State \nof Louisiana. I just want to underscore that in closing.\n  In three areas it is particularly important. First of all, we have a \nlot of important flood control, hurricane protection projects. This \nbill moves a number of those projects forward in a crucial way; \nprojects such as the Louisiana Coastal Area Ecosystem Project, Morganza \nto the Gulf, which is vitally important to the protection of Lafourche \nand Terrebonne Parishes and surrounding areas, also the West Shore \nHurricane Protection Project. That is right in the middle of where \nHurricane Isaac hit. We need to get that done. It is now moving \nforward, the Southwest Louisiana Coastal Hurricane Protection Study.\n  Finally, although it is not as far along, there is very important \nwork with regard to Saint Tammany and other coastal parishes achieving \nflood protection, including a barrier at the lake or near Lake \nPontchartrain for Saint Tammany. That concept will move forward because \nof this bill.\n  The second big category in the bill is Corps of Engineers reform and \naccountability. Those of us who lived through Hurricane Katrina saw \nsome of the best and, unfortunately, some of the worst of what the \nFederal Government has to offer. On the side that needs improvement, we \nneed streamlining and reform at certain agencies, including the Corps \nof Engineers.\n  This bill brings that reform to the Corps of Engineers in a number of \nimportant areas, such as the proposal Senator Nelson of Florida and I \nhave. It also streamlines and expedites the process, particularly with \nregard to environmental review. That is very important.\n  Third, and finally, this bill advances waterborne commerce by \ndredging our harbors and ports and rivers, and getting that work done, \nwhich is vital, which is necessary, if marathon commerce is going to \nmove forward and\n\n[[Page S3499]]\n\nhelp drive the engine of our economy. We have major reforms in this \nbill with regard to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, major reforms in \nthe bill with regard to the Inland Waterway Trust Fund, dredging what \nwe need to dredge, moving forward on key harbors and ports and \nwaterways. That is important for our Louisiana maritime sector, which \nis a big part of the national economy.\n  So there are a lot of positives to this bill. That is why I was proud \nto help develop it and support it. That is why I am very pleased today \nthat it got overwhelming bipartisan support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/15/senate-section/article/S3499-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3499-S3501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DISAPPEARING MIDDLE CLASS\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, yesterday the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office, the CBO, estimated that this year's budget deficit will \nbe 24 percent lower than it was projected just a few months ago. That \nis very good news for our country. Let's not forget that just 5 or so \nyears ago when President Obama came into office in January 2009, he \ninherited a $1.4 trillion deficit--$1.4 trillion. This was as a result \nof two unpaid-for wars, huge tax breaks for the wealthy and large \ncorporations, an unfunded Medicare Part D prescription drug program \nwritten by the drug and insurance companies and, of course, the \nterrible recession, which resulted in less revenue coming into the \nFederal Government.\n  We experienced 4 straight years of deficits above $1 trillion. This \nyear the CBO projects the deficit will just be $642 billion. Now, $642 \nbillion is a lot of money. It is a large deficit. We have to continue \nworking on that issue. But, clearly, for a variety of reasons we have \nmade substantial progress, and we should be proud of that.\n  By 2015, the CBO is projecting that Federal deficit will total just \n2.1 percent of GDP, exactly what those folks involved with Simpson and \nBowles told us we needed to achieve in order to be fiscally sustainable \nover the long term.\n  So the good news is that we have made significant progress on deficit \nreduction. We should be proud of that. However, we must be cognizant \nthat we do not place ourselves in a situation in which the operation \nwas a success but the patient died. The patient I am talking about, of \ncourse, is the disappearing middle class, the backbone of this great \ncountry.\n  In other words, while a lot of attention has been focused on deficit \nreduction, which is important, it is high time we started focusing on \nwhat is happening to tens of millions of working families, people who \nare unemployed, people who are working at very low wage jobs, elderly \npeople who cannot afford their prescription drugs, families who cannot \nafford to send their kids to college or provide childcare for their \nyoung ones.\n  My main point today is, let's start focusing on the issue of most \nimportance to the vast majority of the American people; that is, \ncreating the millions of jobs we desperately need and making sure \npeople have income they can afford to live on with dignity.\n  The sad reality is--and we need to focus on these issues--poverty is \nincreasing and in many ways the great middle class of this country, \nonce the envy of the world, is disappearing. Sadly, the gap between the \nvery, very wealthy and everyone else is growing wider and wider.\n  We must not have an economy where just the people on top, just the \nmultinational corporations do extremely well, while the vast majority \nof the people are struggling to make ends meet.\n  Since 1999 the average middle-class family has seen its income go \ndown by nearly $5,000 after adjusting for inflation. Median family \nincome today is lower than it was in 1996. So all over this country \npeople get up in the morning, often husbands and wives, work long \nhours, and they come back and they find out that they are worse off \nfinancially than they were 10 or 15 years ago.\n  When you ask people, why, what direction, how is the country doing, \nthey think the country is moving in the wrong direction. That is \nprecisely the reason: people are working long hard hours, and they are \nfalling further and further behind.\n  I understand when we pick up the newspapers they tell us unemployment \nis 7.5 percent. That is one way of looking at unemployment. But if we \nlook at it in a more accurate way, including those people who have \ngiven up looking for work, people who are working part time when they \nwant to work full time, real unemployment in this Nation today is 13.9 \npercent. It is high time this Congress began addressing that issue. In \nfact, more than 20 million Americans today do not have a full-time job \nwhen they want to be working full time.\n\n  Another issue that has not received the attention that it deserves is \nyouth unemployment. Youth unemployment is especially painful because we \nhave young people graduating high school, graduating college, wanting \nto go out and begin their careers, begin their adult lives, and they \ncannot find a job. In some cases if they graduate college, they are \nfinding a job which does not require a college degree.\n  The youth unemployment rate for 16- to 24-year-old workers is 16.2 \npercent--16.2 percent. For teenagers the overall unemployment rate is \n25.1 percent. For African-American teens, the number is 43.1 percent.\n  Believe it or not, the United States has now surpassed much of Europe \nin the percentage of young adults without jobs, according to a recent \narticle in the New York Times. We have done well for a variety of \nreasons in dealing with deficit reduction, but now it is time to turn \nto those young people throughout this country, kids who are looking \nforward to getting out on their own, earning a living, and help them \nget the kind of jobs they need to succeed in life and to start their \nadult life off in a good direction.\n  Each and every year when we talk about young people, we should \nunderstand that another real tragedy is taking place, and that is \nbecause of the disappearing middle class and the high cost of college \neducation. Some 400,000 high school graduates do not go to college, not \nbecause they are unqualified but because they cannot afford it. What a \ntragedy that is, to waste all of that intellectual capital. Who knows \nwhat those kids might do if they are able to get a college degree. But \nnow, because of declining incomes for their families and the high cost \nof college education, they are unable to do it. This is an issue on \nwhich we must also focus.\n  From 1969 to 2009, median earnings for male high school graduates \nplummeted by almost 50 percent after adjusting for inflation. Let me \nrepeat that. From 1969 to 2009, median earnings for male high school \ngraduates plummeted by almost 50 percent after adjusting for inflation. \nMen without a high school education have fared even worse. Their \ninflation-adjusted median earnings have shrunk by nearly two-thirds \nover the past four decades.\n  What is that about? Well, what that is about is at one time in this \ncountry, when people did not have even a high school degree or just a \nhigh school degree, they could go out and get a job. Maybe that job was \nin a factory. Maybe it was not the greatest job in the world, but if \nthey worked in a factory, and especially if they had a union job in \nthat factory, they could make a decent wage. They could make it into \nthe middle class. But, sadly, those jobs have, to a very significant \ndegree, disappeared. We have lost over 50,000 factories in this country \nin the last 10 years millions of decent-paying jobs.\n  What opportunities are there now available for young people who just \ngraduate high school or may not even graduate high school? At best, at \nbest, they are going to work at McDonald's or work at Wal-Mart for \ninadequate wages. But the truth is that many of those young people are \nfinding it difficult to obtain any kind of job.\n  There is another issue on which we must focus, and that is \ndistribution of wealth because at the end of the game, the end of the \ngame of economics, we want to know who wins and who loses. Clearly, \nwhat has been going on in this country in recent years is the people on \ntop are doing phenomenally well while the middle class is shrinking and \npoverty is at a very high rate.\n  According to a report that came out on April 23, 2013, a couple of \nweeks ago, from the Pew Research Center, all of the new wealth \ngenerated in this country from 2009 to 2011 went to the top 7 percent \nof American households, while\n\n[[Page S3500]]\n\nthe bottom 93 percent of Americans saw a net reduction in their wealth.\n  All of the new wealth, from 2009 to 2011, went to the top 7 percent. \nToday, the wealthiest 400 individuals in this country own more wealth \nthan the bottom half of America, 150 million people--400 people here, \n150 million there. That is not what this great country was supposed to \nbe about.\n  Today, one family, the Walton family, the owners of Walmart, is worth \n$100 billion. That is more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of the \nAmerican people. One family owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent \nof the American people.\n  Today the top 1 percent owns 38 percent of all financial wealth, \nwhile the bottom 60 percent owns 2.3 percent. In case people didn't \nhear that correctly--maybe they are scratching their heads--let me say \nit again. The top 1 percent owns 38 percent of all financial wealth in \nthis country, while the bottom 60 percent owns 2.3 percent. That gap \nbetween the billionaires and everybody else is getting wider and wider \nand wider. In fact, as Warren Buffett has pointed out, we are seeing a \nmassive shift of wealth from the middle class to the billionaire class.\n  Warren Buffett pointed out recently that the 400 wealthiest Americans \nare now worth a recordbreaking $1.7 trillion, more than five times what \nthey were worth two decades ago.\n  Meanwhile, according to a June 2012 study from the Federal Reserve, \nmedian net worth of middle-class families dropped by nearly 40 percent \nfrom 2007 to 2010. What we are seeing is a massive shifting of wealth \nfrom the middle class, from the working class of this country, to the \npeople on top. That gap between the very wealthy and everybody else is \nnow wider than it has been since the 1920s and wider than any major \ncountry on Earth.\n  What is my point? My point is that deficit reduction is important. We \nmust continue to focus on it. We cannot forget about the economic \nreality facing the men, women, and children of this country, facing \nsenior citizens of this country. It is high time we began to address \nsome of the major economic problems we face.\n  In terms of job creation, most economists will tell you the fastest \nway to create jobs is to put Americans back to work rebuilding our \ncrumbling infrastructure. In my State of Vermont and in States all over \nthis country, there is a desperate need to repair and rebuild our \nroads, bridges, dams, culverts, sewers, schools, and affordable \nhousing. If we do this, if we start investing in our infrastructure, \nmaking sure broadband is accessible in every area in this country, cell \nphone service is available in every area of this country, rebuilding \nour roads, bridges, rail, we will make this Nation more productive. At \nthe same time we can put millions of people back to work at all kinds \nof work.\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers has graded America's roads, \npublic transit, and aviation infrastructure with a D-plus. They say we \nmust invest $1.6 trillion more than we are currently planning to spend \non infrastructure over the next 7 years just to get a passable \ncondition. When we make that investment, we improve life in America. \nPeople do not have to go over potholes. Bridges do not have to be \nclosed. We can develop a first-rate rail system to compete with Europe, \nJapan, China, and we can create jobs doing that.\n  The second point, in terms of job creation, is we can create \nsignificant numbers of jobs transforming our energy system away from \nfossil fuel, into energy efficiency, and such sustainable energies as \nwind, solar, geothermal, and biomass. When we do that we begin to start \naddressing the planetary crisis of global warming, we begin to cut back \non greenhouse gas emissions, and we create good-paying jobs.\n  Thirdly, we have got to take a hard look at our disastrous trade \npolicy, which for many years has been corporate America's policy, and a \npolicy of Republicans and Democrats alike. Despite all of the evidence \nthat unfettered free trade has resulted in the loss of millions of \ndecent-paying jobs in this country, as corporations shut down here, \nmove to China, Vietnam, and other low-wage countries, we still have \nDemocrats and Republicans coming forward doing the bidding of corporate \nAmerica so these companies can get cheap labor abroad while increasing \nunemployment in this country. We have got to take a hard look at our \ntrade policies.\n  I know every election campaign, 2 weeks before the election, all the \ncandidates have ads on television bashing China and ads on television \ntalking about trade policy. Somehow the day after the election \neverybody forgets it. Whether it is a Democratic President, whether it \nis a Republican President, whether it is a Republican House or whether \nit is a Democratic Senate, we still continue moving down the road of \nthese disastrous trade policies. That means NAFTA, CAFTA, and permanent \nnormal trade relations with China. We have to take a hard look and \nrethink those policies.\n  The last point I want to make is that while making progress on \ndeficit reduction, we have got to be appreciative that some of the \npeople on whom we have balanced the budget are some of the most \nvulnerable people in this country. While one out of four major \ncorporations pays nothing in taxes, while corporations are stashing \ntheir money in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, and other tax havens, we \nhave made devastating cuts in programs that people can ill afford. As a \nresult of sequestration, this is what is happening in the real world. \nAt a time when over 20 million Americans are unemployed or \nunderemployed, unemployment insurance checks, which average about $300 \na week--try living on $300 a week--are being cut by 10.7 percent. In \nother words, those who are out of work, through no fault of their own, \nare having their unemployment benefits reduced by more than $32 a week \non average. Now $32 here is what people spend for lunch. If you are a \nworking family and you are unemployed, $32 is a question of whether you \nbuy food for the kids. We have got to replace that loss.\n  At a time when early childhood education is more important than ever, \nwhen we do an abysmal job in terms of childcare and preschool education \nalready, as a result of sequestration 70,000 kids are losing access to \nHead Start and Early Head Start Programs. That is unacceptable.\n  I am chairman of the subcommittee which deals with aging, and I can \ntell you that millions of seniors right now are struggling, figuring \nout how to pay their food bills, buy their prescription drugs, and keep \nwarm in the wintertime. At a time when food insecurity is skyrocketing \nas a result of sequestration, tens of thousands of senior citizens have \nbeen denied access to the Meals On Wheels Program. Meals On Wheels is a \nprogram that goes to the weakest, most fragile, most vulnerable people \nin this country, elderly people who cannot get out of their \nhomes. Meals are delivered to them. For these people, this is a \nquestion of life or death, whether they are going to live with a \nmodicum of dignity. Those programs have been cut as a result of \nsequestration.\n\n  At a time when millions of Americans cannot afford the cost of \nhousing, 140,000 low-income families, primarily seniors with \ndisabilities and families with kids, are losing rental assistance \nbecause of cuts to the section 202 elderly housing program, the section \n811 disabled housing program, and a number of other affordable housing \nprograms.\n  At a time when the cost of a college education is becoming \nincreasingly out of reach for working families, 70,000 college \nstudents, as a result of sequestration, are losing Federal work-study \ngrants. Some of them will not be able to stay in college.\n  At a time when 45,000 Americans will die this year because they don't \nhave access to health care, sequestration has forced doctors in cancer \nclinics to deny chemotherapy treatments to thousands of patients \nbecause of a 2-percent cut to Medicare providers.\n  LIHEAP, which is the Low Income Heating Energy Assistance Program, \nvery important to the State of Vermont, is being cut by $180 million, \nmeaning people will go cold next winter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Let me conclude by saying we have made progress on \ndeficit reduction, and that is good. Now it is time to pay attention to \nthe needs of working families all over this country and put people back \nto work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, Thomas Jefferson once said:\n\n       The majority, oppressing an individual, is guilty of a \n     crime, abuses its strength, and by acting on the law of the \n     strongest breaks up the foundations of society.\n\n  The foundation of this society, this great society based on \ndemocracy, is the principle of self-determination and the belief that \nevery American is equal under the law and guaranteed liberty. This \nprinciple is ingrained in the character of our Nation, and it is \nenshrined in our Constitution.\n  Of the many things that set us apart from other nations, there is \nnone greater than the First Amendment to the Constitution--the freedom \nof religion, the freedom of the press, freedom to assemble and to \npetition our government, and the freedom of speech.\n  Under the First Amendment, Americans have the right to organize \naround the issues and values they believe in, and they have the right \nto disagree with their government. This liberty is part of what \nenergizes our democracy, and it is essential if this democracy is to \nprevail.\n  That freedom has come under attack recently by our very own \ngovernment when the Internal Revenue Service targeted conservative \ngroups, including at least one in my home State of Indiana, for extra \nscrutiny based on their political leanings. The IRS must be \nnonpartisan. It has to be. It is not a partisan watchdog.\n  Why did the enforcers of our Tax Code target groups with applications \nthat included the words ``tea party,'' ``patriots,'' or ``9/12 \nProject''? Why did it single out applications of groups focusing on \nissues such as government spending, government debt and taxes, to \neducate the public by advocacy to ``make America a better place to \nlive,'' or those who sought to educate Americans about our \nConstitution? The IRS singled out a group formed to better educate \nAmericans about our Constitution. What, are they afraid they are going \nto read it? The IRS targeted a group that wants to make America a \nbetter place to live. They are afraid that these groups are going to \nsucceed by questioning the policies of this administration and perhaps \nsuggesting a different course.\n  This is outrageous, this targeting. The inspector general issued a \nreport yesterday saying these are very serious allegations, and they \nreveal an effort to misuse government power to unfairly scrutinize \nthose who simply disagree with the policies of this administration. \nRemember the timing. All of this took place during a national election.\n  I have met with tea party groups all across the State of Indiana. \nUnlike the characterization that is made by some, these are honest, \nlaw-abiding citizens who are deeply concerned about the future of their \ncountry. They are deeply concerned about our nation's plunge into \ndeficit spending and debt that may never be able to be repaid and may \nbe dumped in the laps of our children and our grandchildren. They want \nto do something about it, and they are deeply concerned about abuses of \nthe rights guaranteed under the Constitution. They said one of the \nfirst things they do is suggest why don't we read the Constitution and \nbetter understand the Constitution.\n  I think that is a good idea, because I think some of the things we \nare doing raise the question of whether they are constitutional. To \nform a group for the purpose of addressing concerns about the national \ndebt, which is running out of control, about a government that is \nspending like a drunken sailor, about a government that refuses to do \nwhat just about every business in America and every family in America \nhas had to do during this time of downturn and recession--that is to \ntighten their belts and spend more wisely--only the Federal Government \ndoesn't do this and hasn't done this successfully. So they get targeted \nby an agency that oversees their taxes and intimidates them or fails to \ngive a rational evaluation of their application for tax exempt status? \nThis targeting is not only inappropriate, it is outrageous and it is \ndisgraceful. It is a despicable abuse of power and a direct assault on \nour Constitution. It is exactly the type of thing that makes Americans \nfurther distrust their government.\n\n  Earlier this year, the Pew Research Center released a poll revealing \nthat 73 percent of Americans distrust their government. In other words, \nonly 3 out of every 10 Americans have faith in the Federal Government. \nThis trust deficit is something we should not ignore. It is an alarming \nindication of how the American people view their government--one that \ncontinues to overreach. Those of us who are trying to assure our \nconstituents that we are doing everything we can to keep this \ngovernment from overreaching, who know we need to restore this trust, \nwe are now hit with something like this.\n  The IRS is given the responsibility of carrying out the law. It \nshould never use its powers for partisan purposes--ever. Violating that \nstandard destroys the integrity of our government and further erodes \nthe trust of the American people. Neither those of us who make the laws \nnor those who enforce the laws can be above the law, but the IRS \nbelieved it was above the law when it targeted conservative groups for \nscrutiny. Make no mistake, it is the IRS that will be under scrutiny \nbecause of their own abuse, and so will every other agency of \ngovernment because we are beginning to discover a disturbing pattern of \npolitically motivated abuse.\n  Sometimes I think we are beginning to hear the echoes of Watergate \nwhispering through this town and through the residence at 1600 \nPennsylvania Avenue.\n  I have a hard time believing their apology and explanation that this \nwas simply a misguided effort by low-level bureaucrats attempting to \norganize applications for tax exempt status. Where have we heard that \nbefore? Oh, yes, Benghazi--these were some low-level bureaucrats who \nmade the wrong decision.\n  Where does the buck stop in this town? It doesn't stop at the \nPresident's desk or at the desk of the Secretary of State. It seems to \nbe pushed down to the ``low-level bureaucrats'' who should have been \nsupervised better. These people went off and did their own thing so \nlet's just dismiss it, push it to the side. So, yes, we lost an \nambassador--that was a tragic situation--and three others who were \nthere trying to protect him, but what is the big deal? It is over with. \nIt was a mistake, so let's move on.\n  It is just like this pathetically weak statement from our President \nwho said if this turns out to be the case, then, of course, we will \nneed to do something about it. It is real. It is there. It has to be \naddressed.\n  While an apology from the IRS is necessary, it is not enough to just \nsimply say it is an inappropriate act. The targeting of these groups, \nwhich was confirmed by, as I said, the inspector general, is a very \nserious allegation and reveals an effort to misuse government power to \nunfairly scrutinize those who disagree with the administration. The \nactions of the IRS to target groups based on political viewpoints is \noutrageous and disgraceful. It is an abuse of power and a direct \nassault on our Constitution.\n  Madam President, there must be accountability and responsibility from \ntop leadership, and that includes the White House. The American people \ndeserve answers. How could this clearly unconstitutional action have \noccurred? Who was involved and who else was aware of this deliberate \ntargeting? What steps will be taken to ensure this doesn't happen \nagain?\n  Today, I have joined all of my Senate Republican colleagues in \nsending the President a letter demanding the administration comply \nfully with all congressional inquiries on this matter. No more \navoiding, no more delaying, no more stonewalling, no more inappropriate \nresponses. It is time for the administration to start answering some \nquestions for the American people.\n  This scandal has left a stain on the IRS that I believe cannot be \nrepaired under current leadership. The head of the IRS, as well as \nevery supervisor involved, should be removed from their posts.\n  We will not tolerate the intimidation and silencing of Americans \nsimply for exercising their First Amendment rights.\n\n[[Page S3502]]\n\n  Let me conclude by repeating Thomas Jefferson's warning:\n\n       We must not allow this abuse of fundamental constitutional \n     rights to break up the very foundations of society.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/15/senate-section/article/S3502-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3502-S3503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, as I come to the floor today Americans \nall across the country are paying very close attention to the multiple \nscandals surrounding the Obama administration--one of the scandals my \ncolleague and friend from Indiana has just so eloquently discussed.\n  We are seeing headlines all across the country. Today my hometown \nnewspaper, the Casper Star Tribune, had the headline ``Trio of \nTroubles'' relating to the Obama administration.\n  What the American people are seeing from the Obama administration is \na high level of incompetence and a very low level of transparency.\n  Here are just a few of the headlines today in the Washington Post: \n``Criminal Probe of IRS launched.'' Criminal probe of IRS launched. \nJust below that, ``Leak Probe. Phone-records uproar ends Holder's \nrespite.'' That has to do with the Justice Department's secret \ngathering of records from the Associated Press.\n  Inside the paper, open it, and there is much more. ``Media outlets \ncondemn agency,'' ``Justice Department, IRS scandals challenge Obama's \ncivil liberties credibility.''\n  Other articles in today's paper note the ongoing scandal over the \nadministration's handling of the attack on our consulate in Benghazi. \nThe Washington Post Fact Checker recently gave the President four \nPinocchios for his attempt to mislead the public on the issue. The only \nreason they didn't give him five Pinocchios is you can't get five. Four \nis the highest rating you can get for misleading and inaccurate \ninformation.\n  Well, we need more details about the Benghazi coverup, the IRS \ntargeting of conservatives, and the Justice Department's decision to \nmonitor members of the media.\n  Today, though, I want to talk about another important story that \nraises serious questions about this administration's actions. Of \ncourse, I am referring to the abuse of power that I call ``the Sebelius \nshakedown.''\n  This scandal was first reported by the Washington Post on its front \npage last weekend. Here is the headline. ``HHS asking firms for money \nfor ObamaCare.'' The article goes on to say:\n\n       Health and Human Services Secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, has \n     gone hat in hand to health industry officials, asking them to \n     make large financial donations to help with the effort to \n     implement President Obama's landmark health care law.\n\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       Over the past 3 months, Sebelius has made multiple phone \n     calls to health industry executives, to community \n     organizations, and to church groups, and asked that they \n     contribute whatever they can to nonprofit groups that are \n     working to enroll uninsured Americans and increase awareness \n     of the law.\n\n  Madam President, these are very serious allegations against the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services. The President's health care law \nis a disaster that threatens American jobs, threatens American \npaychecks, and threatens Americans' health care. Instead of facing the \nreality, though, Secretary Sebelius has called on the exact same \ncompanies she regulates--the companies she regulates--to make financial \ndonations to organizations that are trying to make this awful law look \nbetter than it is.\n  Well, the Sebelius shakedown is outrageous. She is the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services for the country. She holds tremendous power \nand influence over these companies she regulates. Her words and her \nrequests matter. One industry official with direct knowledge of the \nSecretary's funding request was quoted in the Washington Post as saying \nthere was a clear insinuation by the administration that insurers \nshould give financially to this effort.\n  This would be like your boss coming in and standing by your desk and \nthen asking you how many boxes of Girl Scout cookies you plan to buy \nfrom the boss's daughter that year.\n  This kind of conflict of interest would be disturbing even if this \nwere just a minor agency with limited power, but Health and Human \nServices is not a minor agency. It is one of the most powerful and \ninfluential bureaucracies in all of Washington. President Obama's \nhealth care law gave Secretary Sebelius unprecedented power to regulate \na very large portion of the U.S. economy. She controls a budget of \nnearly $1 trillion and oversees health care industries ranging from \ninsurance companies to hospitals.\n  On top of that, Health and Human Services is currently negotiating \nwith health plans to set premium rates. It is also setting up the \ngovernment-run health care exchanges and confirming which companies \nwill get to participate in those. That raises the stakes dramatically \nfor these companies, and it puts a tremendous amount of pressure on \nthem to keep the Secretary happy.\n  Private companies and other organizations should never be put in a \nposition where they could fear for their future based upon their \nresponse to inappropriate requests from a member of the President's \nCabinet. The American people should never have to wonder if their \ngovernment is shaking down the very businesses they regulate.\n  At best, asking health care industry executives to donate money for \nthe administration's health care law enrollment efforts is a blatant \nconflict of interest. At worst, the Secretary may have violated the law \nby increasing Federal spending without congressional authorization. As \nCongress begins investigating Secretary Sebelius's actions, the \nAmerican people deserve answers to a number of important questions.\n  For starters, the American people would like to know who exactly the \nSecretary called. What did she ask? What specific legal authority \npermits the Secretary or any other HHS employee to solicit financial \ndonations to implement the health care law? Which HHS officials \nparticipated in the decision to ask for these donations? Did anyone \nelse at HHS ask for donations from outside groups and businesses? Did \nany other Obama administration officials make similar solicitations? \nWhat specific steps has Health and Human Services taken to ensure the \nObama administration will not favor businesses and organizations that \ngave money or punish those that did not donate?\n  Secretary Sebelius had a history of questionable decisions even prior \nto her latest efforts to shake down the health industry. Back in \nSeptember 2010, health insurance companies started informing their \ncustomers how much the President's health care law would increase the \npremiums of these individuals. So the Secretary responded by warning \ninsurers the administration would be keeping track of their actions, \nand that some companies might be ``excluded'' from health insurance \nexchanges in 2014.\n  That was not an idle threat. Medicare's Chief Actuary had predicted \nin the future that essentially all Americans would buy health insurance \nthrough the government exchange. So the Secretary seemed to be \nthreatening that any insurers telling customers the reason behind \npremium increases--which, of course, would be the President's health \ncare law--could be put out of business.\n  Most recently, last fall the U.S. Office of Special Counsel concluded \nthat Secretary Sebelius violated the Hatch Act. She did this when \ncampaigning for President Obama when traveling on official government \nbusiness. Federal workers who violate the Hatch Act are often fired, \nbut Secretary Sebelius was not punished at all.\n  There are already enough concerns about how the President's health \ncare law will harm the American people. We cannot afford unresolved \nquestions about whether a Cabinet Secretary pressured businesses that \nshe regulates to make donations.\n  A lot of media attention on these scandals has focused on the \npolitical fallout. The politics is not the real issue. The real issue \nis that the American people need to know their government is not a \nthug. The real interest of the American people is in knowing they have \nconfidence that their government will act in the people's best \ninterests, not just in President Obama's best interest.\n\n[[Page S3503]]\n\n  The American people need confidence that the administration is not \nfavoring or punishing the people it regulates based upon their support \nfor the administration's pet causes.\n  When it comes to these disturbing allegations about Secretary \nSebelius and all of the other recent scandals, the American people \ndeserve to know what happened. Yesterday Secretary Sebelius had an \nopportunity to answer questions. She did not. Today, again Secretary \nSebelius had an opportunity to answer questions. Again, according to \npress reports, she refused to do so.\n  The American people want answers. Members of the Congress want \nanswers. There are many more questions to be asked.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, once in a while you are lucky enough to \nmeet someone who is down to Earth but uncompromising in their idealism. \nI met someone just like that in the year 2007, and I hired her for my \nstaff. It was a great decision.\n  For the better part of 6 years, Sarah Neimeyer has been a senior \nmember of my staff, and this week she left my office for a new \nadventure which she started today, working with the new Secretary at \nthe Department of the Interior. I am sorry to lose her, but I wish her \nwell.\n  Sarah comes by her idealism honestly. She grew up in a family of \nprogressives in rural Minnesota. Her dad practiced law and her mom \nraised honey bees and grew her own vegetables.\n  From her parents Sarah inherited progressive ideals, practical \nMidwestern values and a deep love of the land.\n  During college, she spent her summers leading canoe trips through the \nBoundary Waters Wilderness in northern Minnesota and Ontario, Canada.\n  Her first boss in the Senate was a dear friend and one of my personal \nheroes, Paul Wellstone. Sarah worked for Paul for 10 years. After he \npassed away, she left Capitol Hill and worked as an advocate for land \nconservation and wilderness preservation.\n  Illinois has benefited from Sarah's passion, her practicality and her \nincredibly hard work.\n  Lake Michigan is one of Illinois' most beloved treasures. As a member \nof my staff, Sarah has fought many battles to protect the Lake from \nthreats from toxic dumping to invasive Asian carp.\n  She has worked alongside energy companies in Illinois that are \ncleaning up the way energy is produced.\n  Whenever safe water, clean air and healthy lands are at stake, you \ncan be pretty sure Sarah Neimeyer is close by. She is committed and \ntenacious. And she usually wins.\n  There is one cause which is even dearer to Sarah and that is her \nfamily--her husband, Joe Warren, and their teenage sons, Will and \nHarry. As accomplished as Sarah is in her professional life, if you ask \nher what she is proudest of, she will tell you in an instant: it's her \nboys.\n  Paul Wellstone had a great definition for politics. He used to say:\n\n       ``In the last analysis, politics is not predictions and \n     politics is not observations. Politics is what we do. \n     Politics is what we do, politics is what we create, by what \n     we work for, by what we hope for and what we dare to \n     imagine.''\n\n  Paul Wellstone was right. That is politics at its finest. That is the \nkind of public service Sarah Neimeyer has performed for me and for the \npeople of Illinois for the last nearly 6 years and I am grateful to \nher.\n  I want to thank Joe, Will and Harry, first of all, for sharing Sarah \nwith us. And I want to thank Sarah for helping to protect and preserve \nsome of my State and our Nation's greatest natural treasures.\n  I wish her continued joy and success as she gets back on the ``green \nbus'' to begin her next professional challenge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/15/senate-section/article/S3503-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3503-S3504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CONTINUING GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I rise to talk about the continuing toll of gun violence \non America and my home State of Illinois. For several months now, New \nYork Times columnist Joe Nocera has published what he calls ``The Gun \nReport.'' It is a daily compilation of stories about shootings across \nAmerica. This report, posted online on the New York Times Web site, is \nstartling.\n  It is one thing when you hear the dry numbers about 87 Americans \nkilled, 200 wounded every day by gun violence, but Joe Nocera's report \ngoes beyond the numbers. It shares some of the details from the news \nreports of these shootings.\n  For example, Mr. Nocera's report for Monday describes shootings that \ntook place over this last weekend. The tally of shootings in America \ngoes on to fill 19 paragraphs. Let me read just some of the \ndescriptions of the shootings that took place over this last weekend \nright here in our beloved country:\n\n       A 12-year-old boy was accidentally shot in the face by his \n     11-year-old friend Friday morning in Camden, NJ.\n       Two Minneapolis, Minn. police officers were shot and \n     wounded at a traffic stop in the Uptown district Friday \n     afternoon.\n       Avery Williams, 22, and Jamario Troutman, 24, died and a \n     third man is in serious condition after a Friday afternoon \n     shooting in West Palm Beach, Fla.\n       Tamara Logan, 44, teacher's aide was shot multiple times in \n     the head area outside McKinley Elementary School in east \n     Erie, Pa., Friday morning.\n       46-Year-old Bruce Byrd shot and killed his wife, 44-year-\n     old Stephanie Byrd, and then turned the gun on himself in a \n     Lawrenceville, Pa. home Friday.\n\n  Those are just a few of the shootings that were reported on Friday. \nThere are dozens more stories from Saturday and Sunday, including a \nfatal road rage shooting in Arkansas; a convicted felon who shot and \nkilled his son in Missouri; four people found shot to death in a home \nin Waynesville, NC; and at least 19 people shot during a Mother's Day \nparade in New Orleans.\n  Sadly, there were multiple shootings from my home State of Illinois \nin Mr. Nocera's report, including a Saturday night shooting in Rockford \nand at least nine people shot over the weekend in the Chicago area, \nthree of them fatally.\n  It is hard to read Mr. Nocera's report and not feel that something is \nterribly wrong with this level of gun violence. Have we heard it so \noften that we reach the point it has no impact? I think most Americans \nwill look at this report and agree that we should take steps to reduce \nthis massive toll of gun violence.\n  Several weeks ago, on April 17, on this floor of the Senate, we fell \nshort of the 60 votes needed to break a Republican filibuster. It was a \nfilibuster against commonsense gun reform and gun safety. We did not \nget 60 votes for commonsense steps such as closing gaps in the gun \nbackground check system and cracking down on straw purchasers who \nsupply criminals and gangs with guns.\n  Joe Manchin is a Senator from West Virginia. He is a Democrat. He may \nbe one of the most conservative Democrats on the floor of the Senate. \nPatrick Toomey is a Republican from Pennsylvania, arguably the most \nconservative Republican on the floor of the Senate. Joe Manchin and \nPatrick Toomey, a Democrat and Republican, sat down and said: Can we \nfind some way to reduce gun violence in America in a bipartisan way? \nTwo conservatives? Two gun owners? And they did.\n  They came up with a proposal that would call for universal background \nchecks. Today up to 40 percent of the guns sold in America are sold to \npeople not subject to a background check. How important is that? What \nif you got on an airplane and before it took off the flight attendant \nsaid: Welcome to this flight. We want you to know that 60 percent of \nyou have gone through TSA screening to see if you are carrying a weapon \nor bomb; 40 percent we did not check. Would you get on the airplane? \nWould you want your family on that airplane?\n  That is the situation in America today when it comes to the sale of \nfirearms. So Joe Manchin and Patrick Toomey said let's close the \nproblems we have, the gaps in the law, and make sure everyone, \nvirtually everyone is subject to a background check, particularly those \nwho buy guns through newspapers or over the Internet. Let's make sure \nthose who go to gun shows to buy guns, that at least we check their \nbackground.\n  Why do we want to check? The law says you have a right under the \nSecond\n\n[[Page S3504]]\n\nAmendment to legally own and responsibly use a firearm in America. I \nunderstand that, and I will fight to protect it. But the law also says \nif you are a convicted felon or someone so mentally unstable you should \nnot own a firearm, you cannot buy one, not legally, in this country.\n  There are a lot of sportsmen and hunters in my home State of \nIllinois. I know many of them. They are in my family. I have met them, \nI have talked to them. They get it. They want their Second Amendment \nrights protected, but they do not want to believe for a minute that a \nfirearm is going to be sold to someone who is going to use it in a \ncrime or to someone who is so mentally unstable that they cannot handle \nit. That is what the Manchin-Toomey amendment was all about. We needed \n60 votes, we got 55.\n  We lost four votes on this side of the aisle, the Democratic side. We \npicked up four votes on the other side of the aisle. Let me commend my \ncolleague, my Republican colleague, Mark Kirk, who joined me in voting \nfor this measure. It was truly a bipartisan effort from those Senators \nwho crafted the bill and voted for it, but we fell five votes short of \nbreaking a Republican filibuster.\n  The issue of gun violence is not going to go away. We are losing more \nAmericans every day to this gun violence. Just this morning, the \nChicago Tribune reported that 2 people were killed and 11 wounded in \nshootings last night in Chicago.\n  Chicago is a wonderful city; it is a great city. I am proud to \nrepresent it and proud to spend much of my time there. But I am \nsaddened by the gun violence that takes place there and in all the \nmajor cities across America.\n  Since 26 schoolchildren and 6 teachers were killed in Newtown, CT, on \nDecember 14, America has been fixed on gun violence. Just the images of \nthose beautiful little boys and girls from their first grade class, \nkilled in their school by a man firing away repeatedly with a weapon--\nit is just heartbreaking. I met some of those parents. They have come \nby my office. They showed me the pictures of their kids. There was not \na dry eye in the room--beautiful little boys and girls, gone.\n  We have to ask the question: Can we do anything about it? Should we \ndo anything about it? Will we do anything about it?\n  The sad reality is, since that day, that horrible day in Newtown, CT, \nwhen that massacre occurred, more than 4,000 Americans have been killed \nby guns. Think about that. More than 4,000 Americans have been killed \nby guns. If you read Mr. Nocera's report in the New York Times, you can \nsee the devastating loss our Nation suffers every single day.\n  Sadly, America just about leads the world when it comes to gun \nviolence and gun death. It does not have to be that way. This past \nweekend the Chicago Tribune published an article looking at the problem \nof straw purchasing. That is one of the main ways that convicted felons \nand gang members get their guns in Chicago.\n  The article said many straw purchasers see the opportunity as easy \nmoney and a victimless paperwork crime. In fact, straw purchases lead \nto serious crimes and killings. They are the primary factor behind gun \nviolence in the city of Chicago.\n  What is a straw purchase? That is when a person who can legally \npurchase a gun buys one to either give it or sell it to a person who is \ngoing to use it in the commission of a crime. It happens a lot. Almost \n10 percent of all the firearms confiscated in the commission of a crime \nin Chicago over the last 10 years--almost 10 percent of those guns came \nfrom the State of Mississippi. Mississippi. Why? It is because you can \nshow a driver's license in Mississippi and buy a gun. In fact, you can \nbuy a trunk full of guns and you can head out on the interstate, headed \nfor some alleyway or crackhouse in or near Chicago, make your sale that \nnight, and come away with a lot of money. That is what straw purchasing \nis all about.\n  One of the provisions in the law which I cosponsored, which was a \nbipartisan provision, along with Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of \nVermont; Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine; Senator Gillibrand \nof New York, and myself, as well as my colleague, Senator Mark Kirk, \nRepublican colleague--we made this a bipartisan effort to say if you \nare going to buy a gun to give it or sell it to someone who is going to \ncommit a crime, you are going to commit a Federal crime yourself if you \ndo it, with up to 15 years in prison, real hard time for a real \ncrime. It was defeated. The gun lobby opposed it. Why? Was it to sell \nmore guns? This doesn't help a sportsman or a hunter, for someone to \nbuy a gun so someone else can commit a crime with it, and yet they \ndefeated it. That is the reality of what we are up against, but it is a \nreality that can change.\n\n  Senator Kirk named this provision in the bill after a recent gun \nvictim in Chicago, 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton. She was a beautiful \nlittle girl who came out for the time of her life to be at President \nObama's inauguration in January. She went back to Chicago, and a couple \nof weeks later she was gunned down while standing at a bus stop outside \nof her school.\n  I cannot believe people voted against the measure to stop straw \npurchasing and to make these people who buy these guns and put them \ninto the flow of deadly crime across America accountable.\n  Well, people are speaking out now in a way they never have before. \nMothers, doctors, mayors, law enforcement, and family members of \nvictims are no longer going to sit down and be quiet; they are going to \nspeak up. This coalition has been turning up the heat on Members of \nCongress, and I know it has received a lot of publicity.\n  In a democracy, elections count. We have to make sure the people who \nare elected want to have gun safety in this Nation. We need real reform \nwhen it comes to gun violence and gun safety. We cannot just walk away \nfrom the daily toll of shootings across America. Instead, we need five \nmore votes on the floor of the Senate.\n  People say: Well, the House of Representatives will never consider \nthis measure.\n  Well, maybe they won't, and maybe the people who believe this is \nimportant for the future of their families and our country will \nremember that in the next election. That is what democracy is all \nabout.\n  Some Senators have claimed they voted for an alternative--the so-\ncalled Grassley alternative--and therefore they are really for gun \nsafety. Make no mistake about it--that Grassley amendment would have \nactually removed tens of thousands of mental illness records from \nbackground check databases, and it would have made it nearly impossible \nto convict straw purchasers. Only the gun lobby would call that an \nimprovement to the current system.\n  There is no piece of legislation, no bill or law that can end every \nact of violence. We are duty and morally bound to do everything in our \npower to keep America safe. When we think of the tragedy in Newtown and \nthe tragedy that affected 4,000 gun victims since Newtown, we have no \nchoice but to move forward as a nation in a sensible way. We need to \nprotect Second Amendment rights, but we also need to keep guns out of \nthe hands of convicted felons and mentally unstable people.\n  I want to close by extending my sympathies to the victims and family \nmembers in Illinois and across the Nation who suffered from gun \nviolence. I am sorry this continues. It is time for Congress to act and \nact quickly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/15/senate-section/article/S3504-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3504-S3505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SEXUAL ASSAULT IN THE MILITARY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, about an hour ago I was on the telephone \nwith Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel. It was a somber conversation. We \nwere talking about the most recent disclosure yesterday of sexual \nassault in the military. The Secretary said he was beside himself with \nthe knowledge that this continues and that he was going to do something \nabout it. I trust that he will.\n  Last night we learned of the latest and most reprehensible incident. \nThe Army is investigating a sexual assault prevention and response \ncoordinator at Fort Hood, TX, for being engaged in abusive sexual \ncontact and other abusive crimes.\n  Secretary Hagel has directed rescreening and retraining of all sexual \nassault prevention coordinators and military recruiters. I know he is \nupset\n\n[[Page S3505]]\n\nabout this; I could hear it in his voice. I join him in that response. \nHe understands this is a pervasive crisis that threatens the moral \nunderpinnings of our military. At risk are core values of trust, \ndiscipline, and respect that every one of our servicemembers expects \nand deserves to protect each other and ultimately to protect America.\n  Next Wednesday the Army will appear before my Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Defense. We will be asking some hard questions: What \nhas gone wrong? Why are so many men and women charged with stopping \nsexual assault being found guilty of it themselves? This is a serious \nissue.\n  According to the Pentagon survey, there were 26,000 sexual assaults \nin the U.S. military last year. That is a 35-percent increase since \n2010. That is more than 70 service women and men sexually assaulted \nevery single day in our military, and that is unacceptable. We also \nknow that only a fraction of those incidents are reported. Fewer than \n3,400 incidents a year, in fact, are reported to authorities. In nearly \n800 of those instances, the victim seeks help but declines to file a \nformal complaint.\n  I commend every one of those men and women who had the courage to \ncome forward and name their accused. It is an unimaginably tough thing \nto do, but it is the right thing for them and it is the right thing for \nour military. Nevertheless, we have very far to go before we can say \nwith confidence that the system is working to prevent these incidents, \nprotect the victims, and prosecute the perpetrators. For instance, last \nmonth a U.S. commanding general based in Italy overturned a military \njury's conviction of an officer charged with aggravated sexual \nassault--overturned it. That sent a chill through the ranks and caused \nincreasing fear among victims that when they had the courage to step \nforward, ultimately nothing would happen.\n  I appreciated that Secretary Hagel immediately called for a change in \nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice. I know that Senator Carl Levin, \nSenator Jim Inhofe, and the Armed Services Committee are working to act \nswiftly on those recommended reforms. They have my full support.\n  I also wish to commend some of my colleagues who have really stepped \nup on this issue. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, a member of \nthe Armed Services Committee, has shown real leadership, as have \nSenator Patty Murray, chairman of the Budget Committee, and Senator \nKelly Ayotte. They came together to introduce a bill I support, S. 871, \nthe Combating Military Sexual Assault Act. I also commend Senator \nClaire McCaskill, who has been outspoken in the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee on this issue.\n  The bill I am talking about would provide victims with a special \nvictims' counsel to assist them through the process, and it would \nstrengthen the military prosecution system and ensure that the Guard \nand Reserve have response coordinators available at all times \nregardless of their duty status. We also have to ensure that each \nservice has a robust investigative team with real expertise when it \ncomes to sexual assault.\n  These are just some of the many reforms the Pentagon must work on \nwith Congress to make a difference. I am committed to working with \nSecretary Hagel and the entire Pentagon leadership to ensure that every \nservicemember can serve free of incidents of violence and trauma like \nthe one that was reported this week. I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport these reforms for our servicemembers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nif in morning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I wish to thank the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois for his statement. We serve together on the \nJudiciary Committee. I hope that in that committee as well we can work \non ways to improve the prosecution--particularly of rape offenses--\nwithin the military by the Department of Justice.\n  We need to break through the agreement that now prevents the \nDepartment of Justice from prosecuting those crimes for the crimes they \nare simply because they take place in the military.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/15/senate-section/article/S3505-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3505-S3506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                THE IRS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am here to speak today because \nWashington, DC, and the rightwing outrage machine are all abuzz about \nthe scandal that the IRS appears to have targeted organizations for \ninquiry based on tea party affiliation. Obviously, that is wrong, but \nlet's not forget that is not the only IRS scandal--that is not the only \nscandal in town. There are two IRS scandals. The other is the IRS \nallowing big, shadowy forces to meddle in elections anonymously through \nfront groups that file false statements with the IRS.\n  Let's go through this. Let's begin with the principle that it is \npretty clear that Americans have a strong democratic interest in \nknowing who is trying to influence their vote in elections. That is \nkind of democracy 101.\n  Even the Supreme Court, which can hardly agree 8 to 1 on what time it \nis, agreed 8 to 1 that knowing who is trying to influence our votes is \nreally important. Here is what they said: ``Effective disclosure'' \nwould ``provide shareholders and citizens with the information needed \nto hold corporations and elected officials accountable for their \npositions and supporters.'' That is very much a part of the democratic \nprocess.\n  Some folks don't want us to know who they are when they meddle in our \npolitics, such as big companies taking positions that would annoy their \nshareholders or their customers and secretive billionaires who want \ninfluence without accountability. They want to pull the strings behind \nthe scenes. It also includes polluters, Wall Street, Big Oil, and other \nfolks the public is fed up with. They all have lots of reasons for \nwanting to stay secret.\n  The law in America requires lots of disclosure, and the Supreme Court \nhas emphasized the importance of lots of disclosure.\n  What is a company or a billionaire trying to hide their influence-\nseeking going to do? How does the secret money get in? Well, it is \neasy. They create a front organization, usually with a phony-baloney \nhappy name, and hide behind that--except it is not quite that easy. \nThere are not that many types of organizations that can hide their \ndonors that way. The most commonly used is called a 501(c)(4), which is \na tax-exempt, nonprofit form of corporation that is regulated by--guess \nwho--the IRS.\n  There is one big problem for people wanting that secret influence in \npolitics; that is, that kind of organization, the 501(c)(4), needs to \nbe set up under the law ``for the promotion of social welfare''--\nindeed, the law says ``exclusively'' for the promotion of social \nwelfare. According to the IRS's own regulations, ``The promotion of \nsocial welfare does not include direct or indirect participation or \nintervention in political campaigns on behalf of or in opposition to \nany candidate for public office.'' So that is a problem.\n  Well, the first kind of miniscandal is that the IRS has decided that \nan organization is organized exclusively for the promotion of social \nwelfare if it is primarily engaged in social welfare activities. By \n``primarily,'' they mean 51 percent, so the other 49 percent can be \npurely political. So ``does not include direct or indirect \nparticipation in political activity'' has been turned into ``actually \ndoes include but up to 49 percent,'' which is nonsensical. As I said, \nthat is a miniscandal of its own.\n  Let's go on. The IRS allowing a bunch of political operatives to form \nnonprofit groups that don't disclose their donors and then collect \nmillions of dollars and spend them on elections in contravention of a \nclear statute and seemingly in violation of their own rules also \nrequires that they usually make some false statements. That is where \nthe scandal really worsens.\n  There is a form called the 1024 form that is the application form for \n501(c)(4) status. If we go to that form, we will see question 15. \nQuestion 15 asks:\n\n       Has the organization spent or does it plan to spend any \n     money attempting to influence the selection, nomination, \n     election or appointment of any person to any Federal, state, \n     or local public office or to an office in a political \n     organization?\n\n\n[[Page S3506]]\n\n\n  That is the question on the form, and it has to be answered under \noath.\n  A considerable number of groups appear to have lied on their \napplications for nonprofit status as well as on their returns, and they \nhave lied with absolutely no consequences.\n  There is a Pulitzer Prize-winning, nonpartisan investigative group \ncalled ProPublica. ProPublica has investigated these 501(c)(4) filings. \nAs part of their investigation, they looked at 104 different \norganizations that had reported to the Federal Election Commission or \nto the State equivalent Federal elective bodies--104 organizations that \nreported electioneering activity, that they were involved in trying to \nelect candidates. In those filings to the Federal and State election \nboards, they said: Here is what we spent on influencing those \nelections.\n\n  ProPublica cross-checked those 104 that had filed statements saying \nhow much they had spent to influence elections and 32 of them--32 of \nthem--told the IRS they spent no money to influence elections, either \ndirectly or indirectly. Both statements cannot be true. An organization \ncannot tell one Federal agency how much they spent to influence \nelections and tell another Federal agency they spent no money to \ninfluence elections and have both statements be true.\n  Then we look at these organizations' behavior and the false \nstatements look even worse. One organization said it would spend 50 \npercent of its effort on a Web site and 30 percent on conferences. The \ninvestigation showed its Web site consisted of one photograph and one \nparagraph; no sign of any conference. The same group declared it would \ntake contributions ``from individuals only'' and then took $2 million \nfrom PhRMA, the pharmaceutical lobby.\n  Another declared to the IRS it had spent $5 million on political \nactivities, but it told the Federal Election Commission it had spent \n$19 million on political advertisements.\n  Another pledged its political spending would be ``limited in amount \nand will not constitute the organization's primary purpose.'' Then that \norganization went out and spent $70 million on ads and robocalls in one \nelection season. It is almost funny it is so bad.\n  But there is nothing funny about making a material false statement to \na Federal agency. That is not just bad behavior, it is a crime. It is a \nstatutory offense under 18 U.S. Code section 1001. The Department of \nJustice indicts and prosecutes violations of this statute all the time, \nbut they never do for this. Never. Why? It appears there is a bad \nagreement between the Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue \nService that the Department of Justice will not prosecute false \nstatements if they are made on this form unless the case has been \nreferred to them by the IRS.\n  So that is really scandal two right there. No matter how flagrant the \nfalse statement, no matter how great the discrepancy between the \nstatements filed with the IRS under oath and the statements also filed \nwith the Federal and State election agencies, no matter how baldly the \norganization in practice contradicts how it answered IRS questions \nabout political activity, the IRS never makes a referral to the \nDepartment of Justice. Thirty-two flagrantly false statements and, as \nfar as anyone knows, not one referral to the Department of Justice as a \nfalse statement. It is a mockery of the law and it is a mockery of the \ntruth.\n  There is an easy solution. The Department of Justice prosecutes these \nfalse statements in lots of other instances. Prosecute these. Juries \nare good at sorting out what is a lie and what is not.\n  Investigations, interviews, statements, and subpoenas can look behind \nwhat appears to be a false statement, and prosecutors can get a full \nsense of the case, in a grand jury, before any charges are finalized. \nBut they can't if they don't even look.\n  Right now, multiple organizations lie with impunity and in large \nnumbers. It is indeed a scandal that the IRS will not even make a \nreferral. Frankly, it is no great credit to the Department of Justice \nthat the Department will not act on its own with all of this so public \nand so plain. Hiding behind their agreement with the IRS, on these \nfacts, is not that great Department's finest hour.\n  So it is very wrong. It is very wrong that the IRS required \nadditional information from a number of organizations--mostly small \norganizations--based on a screen that incorporates those organizations' \ntea party orientation. But it is also very wrong that the IRS goes AWOL \nwhen wealthy and powerful forces want to break the law in order to hide \ntheir wrongful efforts at secret political influence. Picking on the \nlittle guy is a pretty lousy thing to do; rolling over for the powerful \nand letting them file false statements is pretty lousy too. Two \nscandals. Let's not let one drown out the other.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you. Madam President, I wanted to come to the floor \nto address the news of the last 4 days which I think has shocked the \nAmerican people in the wake of a series of revelations made across news \nagencies about the role our Federal Government has played and the way \nit has used its power to intimidate those who they believe are not \ndoing what they want them to do.\n  For example, we learned last week from testimony in the House of \nRepresentatives that there were employees of the State Department who \ndisagreed with the direction and the way the government was handling \nthe Benghazi situation and the word that was being put out by the State \nDepartment. They disagreed with it. They didn't like it. They testified \nlast week they were made to feel threatened, and the message was sent \nto them very clearly from the highest levels of the State Department \nthat they should not be talking or saying the things they were saying. \nThat concerned a lot of people.\n\n  Unfortunately, on Friday of last week, in what I think was an attempt \nto bury a story--and there was no way they were going to bury this \none--they put it out on Friday, which is notoriously known as the \nslowest news day of the week because it goes into the weekend and \npeople forget it and move on, but this one was not easy to forget. On \nFriday, we learned the Internal Revenue Service had specifically \ntargeted organizations in this country because of their political \nleanings and affiliation.\n  I understand this is not something new. People have been complaining \nabout this for a couple of years; anecdotally, from organizations \nacross the country, people coming to us and saying: We got this weird \nrequest from the IRS asking us for all sorts of things. We started to \nhear that everywhere. We still, I think to some level, have confidence \nand hope, have the best hopes of the Federal Government and the people \nwho work within it. As we started to hear that more and more, people \nbecame concerned.\n  So Members of this body wrote letters inquiring of the IRS: Is this \ngoing on? Are groups being targeted because they are a tea party member \nor because they are a 9/12 group? Of course, the answer they gave was: \nNo, that is just not true; that is absolutely false.\n  We know it wasn't false.\n  Then the IRS said: But it was just this group of employees in \nCincinnati. As it turns out, that is not true either. It was \nwidespread. It was an effort throughout the IRS to specifically target \ngroups because they were called tea party or liberty groups or groups \norganized to defend the scope of government, groups that are critical \nof decisions being made by the government. This is chilling. This was \ndiscovered last Friday and it has only gotten worse. Every day that \ngoes on we get more and more information in that regard.\n  Then the revelation on Monday that the Justice Department of the \nUnited States--think about that, the chief law enforcement agency of \nthe country--had issued this blanket search of the phone records of I \nthink the Nation's largest reporting group, the Associated Press. I \nunderstand if they were going after a leak that endangered America\n\n[[Page S3507]]\n\nand security; that is one thing. We can have a debate about that. But \nthey went much further than that. It was a blanket request of all of \nthese phone calls, including the switchboard. Pretty outrageous.\n  So in the span of 4 days, there were three major revelations about \nthe use of government power to intimidate those who are doing things \nthe government doesn't like.\n  These are the tactics of the Third World. These are the tactics of \nplaces that don't have the freedoms and the independence we have in \nthis country, and it is shocking to Americans that this would come to \nlight in the way it has.\n  I submit to my colleagues, however, that none of this is new; that \nwhat we see emerging is a pattern: a culture of intimidation, of \nhardball politics that we saw both on the campaign trail and now \nthrough the apparatus of government. I don't have enough time in 10 or \n15 minutes in morning business to cite them all, but I will cite a few \nthat have already been discussed.\n  Let me tell my colleagues about the case of a gentleman named Frank \nVanderSloot. He was a couple of things. Mr. VanderSloot was the \nnational cochair of Mitt Romney's Presidential campaign. He was also a \nmajor donor to a super-PAC that was supportive of Governor Romney's \ncampaign.\n  In April of 2012, President Obama's reelection campaign posted on the \nWeb a list of eight ``wealthy individuals'' with less than reputable \nrecords who were contributing to Mitt Romney. It was a series called \n``Behind the curtain: A brief history of Romney donors.'' It described \nMr. VanderSloot as litigious, combative, and a bitter foe for the gay \nrights movement. Curiously enough, within a few weeks, Mr. VanderSloot \nwas the subject of not just one but two IRS audits, one for his \npersonal life and one for his business. Coincidence? Maybe we should \nfind out through an investigation.\n  Then we get word of something else. This is even more--well, \nequally--outrageous. That is the case of this organization called \nProPublica, which was mentioned a moment ago in relation to another \ndiscussion. I wish to get the facts exactly right about this. \nBasically, as it turns out, the IRS--someone in the IRS--released nine \npending confidential applications of conservative groups to the so-\ncalled investigative reporting agency, this so-called not-for-profit, \nimpartial--we can have that debate later, but I don't want to be guilty \nof doing to the donors of that group what the Obama campaign did to the \ndonors of Mr. Romney. So let me just say in response, they sent out \ninformation that was confidential, that was not public, illegally. They \nleaked from the IRS information on nine of these groups that was then \nreported on by this organization, which admitted that it came from the \nIRS. Coincidence?\n  It doesn't end there, by the way. This is not just limited to the \nIRS. This is a culture of intimidation, a willingness to play hardball \npolitics against political opponents.\n  Let's not forget about the case of Boeing in South Carolina. Boeing \ndecided to relocate, as any business has a right to do. In the United \nStates of America, a business should have the right to locate its \noperations in any State it wants. When Boeing decided to relocate from \nWashington State to South Carolina, the NLRB came after them in a \ncomplaint which they claim was on the merits, but it was very \nstraightforward. They were going after them because the union in \nWashington State was upset about the move. In fact, the case was \ndropped, partially because of political pressure but, interestingly \nenough, the effort was only abandoned after they negotiated a contract \ndeal with the union.\n  I can be up here all day, and I intend to keep coming back to the \nfloor and citing examples. But the point is, we have going on now a \nculture of hard-ball politics and intimidation, which is unacceptable \nand should be chilling to every Member of this body, Republican and \nDemocrat.\n  This is unacceptable behavior. But this is what we get when an \nadministration is all about politics. This administration is a 365-day-\na-year, year-round political campaign. Every issue is a political \ncampaign. Leading up to the election, and even now, every issue is a \nwedge. Few times in the history of this country has anyone used this \noffice to drive more wedges among the American people than this \nPresident and this administration. So, yes, this is the culture that \nhas been created: They are bad and we are good. Our enemies are bad \npeople. The people who disagree with us on policy are bad people. If \nyou don't support us on gun, you don't care about children and \nfamilies. If you don't support some measure against religious liberty, \nyou are waging a war on women. On issue after issue--a deliberate \nattempt to divide the American people against each other for the \npurposes of winning an election.\n\n  That is the culture that has been created, and that culture leads to \nthis kind of behavior. Whether it was directed or not, we do not know \nthat. I am not saying someone picked up the phone in the White House \nand said: Do these audits. Leak this information. I am saying when you \ncreate a culture where what is rewarded is political advantage, when \nyou create a culture in your administration where everything is \npolitics 24 hours, 7 days a week, when you create a culture where every \nissue that comes before the Congress is used to divide people against \neach other to see who can get the 51 percent of the next election, when \nyou create a culture like that, it leads to this kind of behavior \nthroughout your administration.\n  In the days to come, we will hear more about this. We have a nominee \nright now to the Labor Department, who has an admirable personal story \nwhich I admire and applaud, but who has a history of using the \ngovernment and his position in government to intimidate people to do \nwhat he wants them to do. I would submit to you that Mr. Perez's \nnomination is bad for the country in any time, but in this \nadministration, in this political culture, after what we have learned \nin the last few days, even more so. I hate to single him out, but that \nis one of the pending nominations that is before us. The point is, my \nfriends, this is what we are dealing with and a cautionary tale about \nexpanding the scope and power of government. Because this same IRS that \nwas willing to do this--this same IRS that was willing to target groups \nbecause of their political leanings, this same IRS that audited Mr. \nVanderSloot after he happened to appear on the Obama enemy list--this \nsame IRS will now have unfettered power to come after every American \nand ensure that either you are buying insurance or you are paying them \na tax--every American business.\n  The front lines of enforcing ObamaCare fall to the IRS. That is what \nhappens when you expand the scope and power of government. It is always \nsold as a noble concept. It is always offered as we are going to give \ngovernment more power so they can do good things for us. But the \nhistory of mankind proves that every time government gets too much \npower, it almost always ends up using it in destructive ways against \nthe personal liberties of individuals.\n  That is why the Framers of our Constitution were so wise to impose \nreal constitutional limits on the power of our government, because they \nknew from history that this was the case. That is why our Constitution \nsays that unless government at the Federal level is specifically given \na power, it does not have it. That is why it says that. That is why you \nsee people stand up here on the floor and fight to protect the \nConstitution. That is why these groups were formed around the country--\neveryday Americans from all walks of life; people, some of whom had \nnever been involved in politics before, who joined the tea party \nmovement or a 9/12 movement--because they feared the direction our \ncountry was going, and so they stood up and said: This is wrong.\n  This is why this adherence to the Constitution. Because the \nConstitution was based on the simple truth that if government has too \nmuch power, it almost always ends up destructive.\n  Our Framers knew better than to rely on ``good people'' being in \ngovernment to take care of us. They understood that government's power, \nin order for us to have freedom and prosperity, necessarily had to be \nlimited--not because we are antigovernment. Of course we need a \ngovernment. Who provides for our national defense? Who is supposed to \nsecure our borders? We are\n\n[[Page S3508]]\n\nhaving this immigration debate. These are important things our \ngovernment needs to do. But if you give it too much power, it leads to \nthese abuses.\n  This is why the Constitution was so wise to limit the power of the \nFederal Government to its enumerated powers and leave to the government \nclosest to the people most of the powers.\n  I think we should re-examine all these decisions that have been made \nthat have expanded the scope and power of our government.\n  I do not know how many people are aware of this, but early next year \nevery single one of you is going to have to buy insurance, health \ninsurance that the government says is good enough--maybe not the \ninsurance you are getting today that you are happy with--and if you do \nnot buy that insurance, you are going to owe the IRS some money. That \nis a tax to me. The same IRS that has shown a propensity to target \npeople based on their political leanings--this is who we have empowered \nthrough ObamaCare.\n  This is what is going on here. It is not just one scandal at the IRS. \nIt is about a culture of hardball politics. I think in the days to come \nwe are going to learn a lot more about it, and we are not going to like \nwhat we learn.\n  For example, you think about some of our most precious freedoms--the \nFirst Amendment right to free speech. Think about if you are a reporter \nat the Associated Press. Think about if you are a source--unrelated to \nnational security--to the Associated Press. Think about if you are a \nwhistleblower, someone who is blowing the whistle on government \nactivity because you work in the government and you think what the \ngovernment is doing is wrong. Think about that for a second.\n  Now, all of a sudden, what are you afraid of? I am not calling that \nreporter back because their phone might be tapped, my number might show \nup on their records, because the Justice Department has just shown they \nare willing to do that. Think about the chilling effect that sends up \nand down the government.\n  If there is wrongdoing somewhere in the government right now, people \nare probably afraid to blow the whistle because they are afraid they \nare being surveilled by the Justice Department or that the person they \nare talking to is being surveilled. That is how outrageous this is.\n  Think about people who are thinking about getting involved in the \npolitical process, contributing to a group or speaking out, donating to \na campaign or a candidate, as they are allowed to do under the \nConstitution. They do not want to be the next VanderSloot. They do not \nwant to be the next guy being targeted. They do not want to be the next \nperson being smeared on a Web site.\n  This is unacceptable. This is outrage. And every single Member of \nthis body should be outraged by this behavior. This culture of \nintimidation, these hardball politics tactics we cannot stand for. I \nhope we will be united in condemning this and ensuring we get to the \nbottom of this with significant investigations and hearings from the \ncommittees in the Senate that have jurisdiction on the matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, what is the order in terms of the time for \nthe votes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is held until 4:30 and is equally \ndivided.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will there be a vote at 4:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much. There will be two votes, I \nunderstand.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I noted last week that Senate Republicans \nwho have taken such pride in the number of judicial nominees being \nconfirmed this year ignore how many were needlessly delayed from \nconfirmation last year. There were 11 nominees left pending on the \nSenate floor, and another four nominees who had had hearings and could \nhave been expedited, as we had done for many of President Bush's \nnominees, and all could and should have been confirmed before the end \nof last year. Instead, all had to be renominated, and we are still \nworking through the resulting backlog. We are halfway through May, and \nthe Senate has still not completed action on 4 of the 15 nominees who \ncould and should have been confirmed last year.\n  William Orrick, who the Senate will finally consider today, is one of \nthose nominees. He has now been reported twice with bipartisan support, \nand he has spent over 225 days waiting for his final, Senate \nconfirmation vote. He was first reported last August. There was no \nreason he could not have been confirmed last year, especially \nconsidering that he is nominated to fill a judicial emergency vacancy.\n  William Orrick is currently Special Counsel at the law firm Coblentz, \nPatch, Duffy & Bass, LLP, where he previously served as a partner for \nover two decades. From 2009 to 2012, he served in the Department of \nJustice's Civil Division, first as Counselor, and subsequently, as \nDeputy Assistant Attorney General. The ABA Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary unanimously rated William Orrick ``well qualified,'' \nits highest rating. He has the strong support of his home State \nSenators, Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer.\n  Regretably, Senate Republicans have broken from our traditions and \nhave taken to opposing judicial nominees based on those nominees' \nefforts on behalf of clients. They did this when opposing nominees like \nJeffrey Helmick, Paul Watford, and, most recently, Caitlin Halligan, \nand they are doing it, again, with William Orrick. They are opposing \nWilliam Orrick because he worked on behalf of his client--the United \nStates Government--on cases dealing with Federal preemption in \nimmigration.\n  The criticisms of his supervision and advocacy on these immigration \ncases on behalf of the United States are unwarranted and, again, \nreflect a fundamental misunderstanding of our legal system. I have \nrepeatedly noted that from John Adams to Chief Justice Roberts, that \nhas never before been the standard by which we consider judicial \nnominees. Senate Republicans have adopted another double standard when \nit comes to President Obama's nominees.\n  Further, having reviewed his responses, I believe that the nominee \nhas more than adequately responded to the questions presented to him. \nIt is time to vote on his nomination and allow him to work on behalf of \nthe American people in a judicial emergency district where the judges \nhave been overwhelmed with cases.\n  Because Senate Republicans have delayed the confirmations of well-\nqualified nominees like William Orrick, we remain 20 confirmations \nbehind the pace we set for President Bush's circuit and district \nnominees, and vacancies remain nearly twice as high as they were at \nthis point during President Bush's second term. For all their self-\ncongratulatory statements, they cannot refute the following: We are not \neven keeping up with attrition. Vacancies have increased, not \ndecreased, since the start of this year.\n\n[[Page S3509]]\n\n  President Obama's judicial nominees have faced unprecedented delays \nand obstruction by Senate Republicans. We have yet to finish the work \nthat could and should have been completed last year. There are still 10 \njudicial nominees with bipartisan support being denied confirmation.\n  It is true that some vacancies do not have nominees. I wish \nRepublican home State Senators would work with President Obama to fill \nthese vacancies. As I stated last week when this issue arose in the \nJudiciary Committee, I am more than willing to work with Republican \nSenators and the administration to consider nominees for these \nvacancies. But it is disingenuous of Republican Senators not to work \nwith President Obama to pick nominees and then blame the President for \nthe lack of nominees. If Senators want new judgeships in their States, \nthey should be working especially hard to ensure that all existing ones \nare filled. I take very seriously my responsibility to make \nrecommendations when we have vacancies in Vermont, whether the \nPresident is a Democrat or a Republican, and I would hope that other \nSenators would do the same. After all, if there are not enough judges \nin our home States, it is our own constituents who suffer.\n  It is not enough for Senators to say that they are working on getting \nrecommendations or they have appointed a commission to give them \nrecommendations. Senators have to lead this effort in their home \nStates, set firm deadlines, and get the President recommendations to \nfill these vacancies. In some places Federal judgeships have been \nvacant for 500 days or 1000 days or more without a recommendation.\n  I was interested to hear Senate Republicans argue that if Senators do \nnot get recommendations in ``expeditiously enough,'' the President \n``has the prerogative to nominate someone and then we have the \nresponsibility to act on it.'' Before President Obama had made a single \njudicial nomination, all Senate Republicans sent him a letter \nthreatening to filibuster his nominees if he did not consult Republican \nhome State Senators. So the recent statement was a either complete \nreversal in position, or baiting a trap to then filibuster any nominees \nthe President sends to us.\n  Moreover, the failure of some Republican Senators to help fill \nvacancies in their own States does not excuse their unwillingness to \ncomplete action on the consensus judicial nominees who are ready to be \nconfirmed but whose confirmations are being needlessly delayed. Mark \nBarnett, Claire Kelly, William Orrick, Sheri Chappell, Michael McShane, \nNitza Quinones Alejandro, Luis Restrepo, Jeffrey Schmehl, Kenneth \nGonzales, and Gregory Phillips are awaiting confirmation and Sri \nSrinivasan, Ray Chen, and Jennifer Dorsey could have been reported to \nthe Senate last week. So long as there is a backlog of nominees before \nthe Senate, the fault for failing to confirm these nominees lies with \nSenate Republicans.\n  The Judicial Conference recently released their judgeship \nrecommendations. Based upon the caseloads of our Federal courts, the \nConference recommended the creation of 91 new judgeships. That is in \naddition to the 85 judgeships that are currently vacant. This means \nthat the effective vacancy rate on the Federal bench is over 18 \npercent. A vacancy rate this high is harmful to the individuals and \nbusinesses that depend on our courts for speedy justice. The damage is \neven more acute in the busiest district courts, such as those in border \nstates that have heavy immigration-related caseloads. Unfortunately, \nseveral of those district courts also have significant numbers of \njudicial vacancies, and I hope that Senators are working to find good \nnominees to fill those vacancies.\n  Senate Republicans have a long way to go to match the record of \ncooperation on consensus nominees that Senate Democrats established \nduring the Bush administration. After today's votes, 9 more judicial \nnominees remain pending, and all were reported unanimously. All Senate \nDemocrats are ready to vote to allow them all to get to work for the \nAmerican people without further delay. We can make real progress if \nSenate Republicans would join us.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to strongly support the \nnomination of Bill Orrick to the Northern District of California.\n  Bill Orrick was raised in San Francisco, where his family has a long \nand distinguished pedigree in the legal community. I happen to have \nknown the nominee's father, William Orrick, Jr., who was a highly-\nrespected Federal judge in San Francisco. The firm Orrick, Herrington, \n& Sutcliffe--which his grandfather founded--is pristine in San \nFrancisco. I strongly urge my colleagues to support Bill Orrick's \nnomination. He has proven throughout his career that he has the \nintellect, skill, and temperament to do an outstanding job on the \nFederal bench in San Francisco.\n  Mr. Orrick earned his bachelor's degree from Yale and his law degree \nfrom Boston College. He then represented low-income clients in Georgia \nfor five years. After that, he came home to San Francisco, where he \npracticed commercial litigation for 25 years at Coblentz, Patch, Duffy, \n& Bass. He primarily practiced in the field of employment defense.\n  In 2009, he joined the Justice Department, where he worked in the \nCivil Division and oversaw the Office of Immigration Litigation. As an \nattorney at the Justice Department, Mr. Orrick's job has been to \nrepresent his client zealously and professionally--and he has done so.\n  The Office of Immigration Litigation is in the business of defending \nthe government's position in cases in which an alien is seeking to \nprevent removal from this country. The office also defends the \ngovernment in cases when an alien brings a challenge to the length or \nconditions of detention. That means that Orrick's primary task was to \nlitigate against aliens in Federal court.\n  Mr. Orrick has also been called upon to represent the Department of \nJustice in other cases, including those challenging state immigration \nlaws like those in Arizona and Alabama on Federal preemption grounds. \nIn these cases and others, Mr. Orrick dutifully and faithfully executed \nhis duty to advance the position of the United States Government.\n  Mr. Orrick's record speaks for itself. He is seasoned. He has over \nthree decades of experience in legal practice, faithfully representing \nhis private and governmental clients. He has been rated ``well \nqualified'' by the American Bar Association.\n  I will close with a few remarks on the confirmation process. Mr. \nOrrick's confirmation is a long time coming. He was first nominated \nnearly a year ago, and first approved by the Judiciary Committee on \nAugust 2, 2012 with the support of Senators Kyl and Graham.\n  When the 112th Congress recessed, other nominees who were reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee before the August recess were confirmed. Not \nMr. Orrick. He had to be renominated. His nomination had to be reported \nby the Judiciary Committee again. His nomination has only now come to \nthe floor--nearly a year after his first nomination.\n  This is a real shame. The Northern District of California is in a \njudicial emergency, as declared by the Judiciary Conference of the \nUnited States, as are all judicial districts in California. The \nNorthern District has 675 weighted filings per judgeship, making its \ncaseload 30 percent above the national average. A civil case takes \nnearly 3 years to get to trial--up nearly 50 percent from a year ago.\n  When well-qualified nominees like Bill Orrick are held up, judicial \nemergencies like those California continues to face year after year are \nonly exacerbated.\n  I am very pleased Bill Orrick will be confirmed, and I thank my \ncolleagues on the Republican side for agreeing to schedule a vote on \nhis nomination. I simply believe--strongly--that he could and should \nhave been confirmed sooner by this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. This is a very good day for me because we not only had a \ngreat vote on our water resources bill, which is so important to this \neconomy, to jobs, and businesses all across this great Nation, but \nfinally we are getting a vote on an excellent nominee to be the U.S. \ndistrict judge for the Northern District of California, William H. \nOrrick, III.\n  Mr. Orrick was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee with \nbipartisan support, and his appointment to\n\n[[Page S3510]]\n\nthe Northern District would fill a seat in an emergency district. We \nneed to move on this nomination, and I am most grateful for getting \nthis opportunity today.\n  The caseload in the Northern District is 24 percent above the \nnational average, at 631 weighted filings per judgeship. Civil cases \nthat go to trial in the Northern District now take over 34 months to \nget to trial, up from 21 months just a year ago. We know justice \ndelayed is justice denied, so this is justice delayed. It is not good \nfor our country. That is why I am so excited we are finally getting to \nthis vote.\n  This is such a good nominee. He brings a depth of legal experience in \nboth the public and private sectors, which will make him a tremendous \nasset to the Northern District Court.\n  Mr. Orrick received his bachelor's degree from Yale University, and \nhe earned his law degree from Boston College. He graduated cum laude \nfrom both schools. After law school, he spent 5 years providing pro \nbono legal services for low-income clients in the State of Georgia.\n  Then Mr. Orrick returned home to the Bay Area, and he joined a very \nprominent San Francisco firm--Coblentz, Patch, Duffy, and Bass, where \nhe spent 25 years as an associate partner and then the head of the \nfirm's employment litigation practice.\n  In 2009 Mr. Orrick joined the Department of Justice as Deputy \nAssistant Attorney General in the Civil Division. His primary duty at \nthe Justice Department was to oversee the Office of Immigration \nLitigation, representing the United States in all manners of \nimmigration law.\n  Last year he returned to private practice in San Francisco. Mr. \nOrrick considers service to the community to be a hallmark of his legal \ncareer. He spent 11 years as chancellor and legal advisor to the \nEpiscopal Diocese of California and 13 years working with the Good \nSamaritan Family Resource Center, a low-income housing nonprofit in San \nFrancisco. This is a man who has given back over and over again.\n  At his law firm he supervised much of the firm's pro bono work, for \nwhich he received the San Francisco Bar Association's ``Outstanding \nLawyer in Public Service'' Award.\n  The American Bar Association found that Mr. Orrick is ``unanimously \nwell-qualified'' to be a Federal judge. Today is Bill Orrick's 60th \nbirthday. I can think of no better gift than for us to finally act on \nthis nomination.\n  I urge my colleagues to cast an ``aye'' vote. I think it is a vote \nyou will be proud of in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a nomination as \nwell. One of the other votes we will be casting at 4 o'clock is on the \nnomination of Marilyn Tavenner of Virginia to be the head of the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS.\n  I am so excited that we are voting on this matter today. CMS is the \nlargest line item in the Federal budget. It is larger than the \nDepartment of Defense because both Medicare and Medicaid are such \nsignificant budgetary items.\n  We have not had a confirmed Administrator of CMS in the United States \nsince 2006. We have been operating this program on which tens of \nmillions of vulnerable Americans rely on a daily basis with a \nsuccession of part-time, acting, interim Administrators. It will be \ngood for the country and for the mission of CMS to confirm an \nAdministrator. I am excited that we are taking that vote today.\n  A few words about the nominee Marilyn Tavenner. First is her \nexperience: Marilyn is from a rural community in Southside, VA. She \ngrew up and wanted to be a nurse. She started her career as a nurse and \nserved at hospitals, first rural and then urban hospitals, in Virginia \nfor many years.\n  Her leadership skills and traits were recognized, and she became a \nnursing supervisor, obtaining greater education along the way. At one \npoint, she was working at a hospital in Virginia that lost their CEO, \nand as the board wrestled with who should be an interim CEO, whether \nthey should do a search or bring someone in from the outside, it was \nsuggested Marilyn might be the person to do it. She wasn't interim CEO \nfor long before the board decided she was, in fact, the person who \nshould run the hospital.\n\n  She then had a career of running that hospital, then multiple \nhospitals and eventually worked for the HCA hospital chain running an \nentire region of hospitals and eventually became a vice president for \nHCA running all of their outpatient surgery centers for all of the \nUnited States.\n  At that point, I reached out to Marilyn--I had been elected Governor \nof Virginia in 2005--and asked her to be my secretary of Health and \nHuman Services. Marilyn performed in an exemplary way as a cabinet \nsecretary in my administration from 2006 to 2010 and helped me tackle \nall manner of Health and Human Services challenges, some of which she \nhad significant background in--nursing education, for example--and \nothers that might have been new--cessation of youth smoking--and some \nthat were not even on the health side but were in the human services \nportfolio that had not been her work--foster care and mental health \nreform. In all those areas, Marilyn proved herself to be very able.\n  She has been essentially the chief operating deputy at CMS since \nearly 2010. She was the No. 2 at CMS to the Administrator nominee \nDonald Berwick--a nominee who was never confirmed by the Senate--and in \nthat role she worked closely with Donald Berwick and did wonderful work \nwithin CMS through the very challenging time of drafting, passing, and \nnow the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n  Marilyn is the right person for the job for three reasons: First, if \nyou care about patients, then Marilyn is your person. Marilyn, through \nall of her work, whether as a nurse, a hospital administrator, a \nregional health care executive, a cabinet secretary or a CMS \nadministrator, has never forgotten it is fundamentally about patients \nand that before we get to health care we have to care about health. \nMarilyn brings a nurse's attitude, and what a great thing it would be \nfor the nursing profession to have a nurse as the agency director of \nthe Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services. She brings a nurse's \nmentality, and she will do that every day on the job. That is her first \npriority.\n  The second reason Marilyn would be a strong CMS Administrator is that \nshe is an expert, frankly, at finding savings and finding ways to \nreduce and control costs. We all know in the country we spend too high \na percentage of GDP on health care--18 to 19 percent of our GDP on \nhealth care. Other nations in the world--Switzerland and others--spend \n11 or 12 percent. We have a system that produces some spectacular \nprofessionals and some procedures that are second to none in the world, \nbut we don't live as healthy as other nations and some of our outcomes \nare not quite as strong and we spend too much. So one of the subjects \nwe talk about on this floor all the time is budgetary issues and what \nare the right ways the Federal Government can find savings in our own \nprograms.\n  But also if we do innovative things in Medicaid and Medicare that \nwould save money, those also become examples that can be learned \nthroughout the health care industry to help us find appropriate \nsavings. When I was Governor and we were dealing with the national \nrecession and we were having to make cuts, there was no one in my \ncabinet or no other senior official whom I had who worked with me who \nwas more creative and compassionate about trying to find targeted ways \nto achieve savings as Marilyn Tavenner. She is a whiz at this and yet \nnever sacrifices her focus on patient care, which was the primary \nattribute of hers I mentioned. So as we wrestle with Medicaid and \nMedicare and the growth of those budgetary items, and we need to find \nways to try to deal with them, I couldn't think of a better person than \nMarilyn Tavenner to be in that position.\n  The last attribute of hers that I think is truly an amazing one and a \nreason I support her is that she is a creative person and is always \ndriven by finding true results. I could tell numerous stories from my \ntime as Governor of her efforts to successfully help us ban smoking in \nrestaurants and bars to improve our health, her efforts to help us \nimprove our foster care system outcomes, to train more nurses, and \nexpand the number of physicians in the State, but the story I will tell \nis one that was a shame for Virginia, but Marilyn helped us solve it by \nbeing creative and helping us focus on results,\n\n[[Page S3511]]\n\nwhich is what we need at the national level.\n  Here is a conundrum about Virginia. When I was elected Governor, we \nwere in the top 10 in the Nation in per capita income, but in infant \nmortality we were about 35th in the Nation. It just didn't seem like \nthose two things matched up; a high-income State with a successful \neconomy and a low unemployment rate should be doing better in infant \nmortality. That had occurred to Governors before me; that this just \ndidn't make sense. Why would we not be a better State when it comes to \nthe health of our newborns?\n  I gave Marilyn the challenge--because I didn't know the answer and I \ndidn't know what to do--as my Health and Human Services secretary, to \ndramatically reduce our infant mortality rate. You can do everything \nelse you want, but the No. 1 thing I want you to do during my single 4-\nyear term as Governor is help us figure out a way to dramatically \nreduce our infant mortality rate.\n  Others had made the effort, and the other efforts hadn't produced any \nresults. But largely through a creative and exhaustive analysis of \ndata--why did we have a problem--Marilyn approached the challenge and \nfigured out why we had the problem. She figured out the myths and the \nfacts and separated the myths and put them aside. She devised a very \ntargeted strategy for dealing with the particular reasons we had a \nproblem and, lo and behold, within a very few years, this intractable \nchallenge we had in Virginia of an unacceptably high infant mortality \nrate began to dramatically change, and the changes continue because the \nchanges Marilyn put into the system are what no one would ever want to \nundo.\n  Marilyn's experience, her focus on patients from her background as a \nnurse, her spectacular success at smart cost cutting but then \nespecially her proven capacity to be creative and innovative in \nreaching results merit our support for her. I am excited we will be \ncasting this vote today. I think the fact the United States will have a \nconfirmed CMS Administrator who can then take that confirmation and \nplow forward on important initiatives will be for the good of this \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring all quorums before the votes be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAINE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Mr. Orrick's \nnomination to be a District Judge for the Northern District of \nCalifornia and I would like to take a few moments to explain to my \ncolleagues why I will be voting no.\n  Before I discuss the nominee, however, I will update my colleagues on \nwhere we stand with judicial confirmations. Thus far, the Senate has \nconfirmed 187 District and Circuit nominees; we have defeated two. \nThat's 187-2, which is a .989 batting average. That is an outstanding \nrecord.\n  So far this year, the Senate has confirmed 16 nominees. Today, if Mr. \nOrrick is confirmed, we will have confirmed the 17th nominee. At this \nstage in President Bush's second term only four were confirmed. That's \na record of 17 to 4. This President is being treated exceptionally \nfairly.\n  The President has recently submitted a few new nominations. I know I \nhave been reminding him that we can't do anything about vacancies \nwithout him first sending up nominees. But again, even with the recent \nnominations 61 of 85 nominations still have no nominee. That's nearly \nthree out of four vacancies, and for judicial emergencies, only 8 of 35 \nvacancies have a nominee. So I just wanted to set the record straight \nbefore we vote on this nominee.\n  Again, I will be voting ``no'' on Mr. Orrick's nomination. I was \ntroubled by his intervention in Utah, Arizona, South Carolina, and \nAlabama. In those States he led the effort to strike down the statutes \nin those States addressing the Federal Government's failure to enforce \nimmigration laws. We are in the middle of marking up a comprehensive \nimmigration bill. It is clear that enforcement is a problem.\n  I, and some of my colleagues, would like to strengthen enforcement, \nbut Mr. Orrick was out there leading the effort to maintain the weak \nstatus quo. I don't know why that should lead to a lifetime appointment \non the Federal bench.\n  I was also disappointed by Mr. Orrick's responses to many of my \nquestions at his hearing and in follow-up questions for the record. At \nhis hearing, I asked him a number of questions that he said he could \nnot answer at the hearing, but that he would familiarize himself with \nthe issues. I offered to submit those questions in writing to provide \nMr. Orrick the opportunity to answer them--a courtesy this Committee \ncommonly extends to nominees in these circumstances.\n  After granting Mr. Orrick this courtesy, I was disappointed that he \nstill failed to answer many of my questions. So I extended the courtesy \na second time, offering Mr. Orrick the opportunity to provide a \nresponsive answer to my earlier questions. Unfortunately, the \n``answers'' he provided to my second set of questions were as non-\nresponsive as the first.\n  Now, I understand that it is not unusual for nominees to claim they \nare unable to answer a particular question, but I must say that the \ndegree of Mr. Orrick's non-responsiveness rose to a level well above \nwhat we typically see from nominees.\n  Moreover, just because a particular answer might be awkward for the \nadministration that does not justify refusing to provide that answer.\n  Now, although there were a host of questions Mr. Orrick would not \nanswer, I will provide just one example. In the hearing, I asked Mr. \nOrrick about a particular Ninth Circuit case and asked if it was \ncontrolling. This was in connection with a brief he filed opposing the \nDefense of Marriage Act. I thought he mischaracterized the precedent \nand wanted an explanation. At a minimum, I wanted to know if he had a \nbasic knowledge of the precedent and recognized it as current law. He \nanswered, ``I will follow controlling precedent wherever it exists.''\n  That is a clever answer, but of course, it doesn't answer the \nquestion. So in my written questions, I asked again if the Adams case \nwas controlling precedent. He responded that he was reluctant to answer \nbecause a similar case could come before him.\n  This struck me as odd for two reasons. First, if confirmed, he would \nlikely recuse himself from any case where he crafted a part of the \nJustice Department's policy or stance. And second, I wasn't asking for \nhis personal views on the Adams case. I was trying to assess his legal \nability. I want to know whether he will recognize that a particular \ncase is controlling--even if he, or the administration for that matter, \nmay not agree with it. That is what serving as a district court judge \nis all about: Applying controlling case law, whether or not you agree \nwith the holding.\n  So I sent him a second set of questions for the record, and asked him \nagain if Adams was controlling precedent. He still would not answer. \nThe second time, Mr. Orrick agreed that he should recuse himself from \nsuch cases, but then reserved the right not to recuse himself. And, I \nstill don't have an answer to my original question raised in the \nhearing: Does Mr. Orrick recognize Adams as controlling precedent in \nthe Ninth Circuit?\n  Unfortunately, based on this and other aspects of Mr. Orrick's record \nthat I find troubling, I cannot support his nomination.\n  Following graduation from Boston College Law School in 1979, Mr. \nOrrick began practicing law in Savannah, GA, at Georgia Legal Services, \na general legal practice representing low-income individuals in \nlitigation. In 1984, Mr.\n\n[[Page S3512]]\n\nOrrick moved to California to join the law firm of Coblentz, Patch, \nDuffy, & Bass, LLP. His practice with the firm initially focused on \ncomplex commercial litigation. After making partner in 1998, his \npractice broadened to include employment litigation. His clientele \nincluded both individuals and corporations.\n  During this same period, Mr. Orrick also served the Episcopal Bishop \nof California, essentially acting as outside general counsel. This \nincluded advising the Diocese on interpretation of church canons, the \nvarious rights of congregations leaving the Diocese, and clergy's \nduties to report child abuse. He received compensation for these \nservices.\n  In June 2009, Mr. Orrick joined the Department of Justice as a \ncounselor to the assistant attorney general for the Civil Division in \nWashington, DC. His responsibilities included ``matters related to the \nFreedom of Information Act, tobacco litigation, increasing affirmative \nconsumer litigation brought by the Civil Division, analysis of \namendments to the False Claims Act, litigation reports, national \nsecurity cases, and efforts to increase access to justice, including \nexpansion of the Civil Division's pro bono efforts.'' In September \n2009, he started supervising immigration litigation within the \nDivision.\n  In June 2010, Mr. Orrick was appointed deputy assistant attorney \ngeneral in the Civil Division, Department of Justice. In this role, he \noversees the Office of Immigration Litigation, which is comprised of \nover 300 lawyers. This office handles ``all federal appellate \nlitigation arising from petitions for review from the immigration \ncourts and roughly 50% of the civil United States District Court \nimmigration matters, primarily class actions, habeas and mandamus \npetitions, and certain Bivens actions.'' He also participates on \nseveral coordinating task forces that oversee immigration and national \nsecurity related issues.\n  Mr. Orrick reports that throughout his career he has represented \nprivate individuals, small businesses, and large corporations in \nlitigation matters before State and Federal courts. He estimates that \napproximately 97 percent of his practice has been in the area of \nlitigation and has tried 16 cases to verdict, judgment, or final \ndecision as either sole or lead counsel.\n  The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary gave him a Unanimous ``Well Qualified'' rating.\n\n\n                            Perez Nomination\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, at this time I would like to discuss the \nPresident's nominee for Secretary of Labor, Tom Perez.\n  Mr. Perez is not unknown to the Senate or even to the country as a \nwhole now that he has been Assistant Attorney General for a long time. \nHis tenure at the Civil Rights Commission has been marked with \ncontroversy, and that is putting it mildly. He was confirmed to his \ncurrent post as Civil Rights Division Assistant Attorney General by a \nvote of 72 to 22. I was among those who supported his nomination to \nlead the Civil Rights Division, but unfortunately, based on reasons I \nwill outline, I have come to regret that vote.\n  There are a number of issues regarding Mr. Perez's record that should \ngive my colleagues pause. Today I wish to focus on the investigation I \nhave been conducting with my colleague in the House Mr. Issa, chairman \nof the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, as well as Mr. \nGoodlatte, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues the role Mr. Perez played in \nthe quid pro quo between the City of St. Paul, MN, and the Department \nof Justice here in Washington where the Department agreed not to join \ntwo False Claims Act cases in exchange for the City of St. Paul \nwithdrawing its case from the Supreme Court in a case called Magner v. \nGallagher. Mr. Perez's actions in this case are extremely troubling for \na number of reasons. In other words, if an individual takes \nextraordinary action to get a city to withdraw a case that is already \non the docket of the Supreme Court, that is pretty serious \nintervention.\n  First and foremost, at this point no one disputes the fact that Mr. \nPerez orchestrated the entire arrangement. He manipulated the Supreme \nCourt docket so that his favored legal theory, called the disparate \nimpact theory, would evade review by the High Court. In the process, \nMr. Perez left a whistleblower twisting in the wind. Those are the \nfacts, and even Mr. Perez doesn't dispute those facts.\n  The fact that Mr. Perez struck a deal that potentially squandered up \nto $200 million from taxpayers in order to preserve the disparate \nimpact theory is, of course, extremely troubling in and of itself. In \naddition to the underlying quid pro quo, however, the evidence \nuncovered in our investigation revealed that Mr. Perez sought to cover \nup the fact that the exchange even took place.\n  Finally--and let me emphasize that this should concern all of my \ncolleagues--when Mr. Perez testified under oath about this case both to \ncongressional investigators and during his confirmation hearing, Mr. \nPerez told a different story.\n  The simple but unavoidable conclusion is that the story Mr. Perez \ntold is simply not supported by the evidence, so I will start by \nreviewing the underlying quid pro quo.\n  In the fall of 2011, the Department of Justice was poised to join a \nFalse Claims Act lawsuit against the city of St. Paul. The career \nlawyers--when I use the words ``career lawyers,'' I mean these folks \nwho are not political appointees. The career lawyers in the U.S. \nattorney's office of Minnesota were recommending the Department of \nJustice join this false claims case. The career lawyers, even in the \ncivil division at main Justice, were recommending that Justice join the \ncase. The career lawyers in the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment were also recommending the Department of Justice join in \nthis false claims case. Why is that important? Because the government \nparticipating in a false claims case makes it a much stronger case than \nwhen the individual pursues it by themselves.\n  What I just described to my colleagues was all before Mr. Perez got \ninvolved. At about the same time the Supreme Court agreed to hear a \ncase called Magner v. Gallagher. In Magner, the City of St. Paul was \nchallenging the use of the ``disparate impact'' theory under the FAIR \nHousing Act. The disparate impact theory is a mechanism Mr. Perez and \nthe civil rights division have been using in lawsuits against banks for \ntheir lending practices. If that theory were undermined by the Supreme \nCourt, it would likely spell trouble for Mr. Perez's lawsuits against \nthe banks.\n  So Mr. Perez approached the lawyers handling the Magner case and he \ncut a deal. The Department of Justice agreed not to join two false \nclaims cases in exchange for the City of St. Paul withdrawing Magner \nfrom the Supreme Court. In early February 2012, Mr. Perez even flew to \nSt. Paul to finalize the deal. The next week the Department of Justice \ndeclined the first false claims case, called the Newell case. The next \nday, the City of St. Paul withdrew the Magner case from the Supreme \nCourt.\n  Now, there are a couple of aspects about this deal I wish to \nemphasize. First, as I mentioned, the evidence makes clear Mr. Perez \ntook steps to cover up the fact that he had bartered away the false \nclaims cases. Cover-ups aren't good in government. On January 10, 2012, \nMr. Perez called the line attorney in the U.S. attorney's office \nregarding the declination memo in the Newell case. To remind my \ncolleagues, Newell was the case the same career attorneys were strongly \nrecommending the United States join before Mr. Perez got involved. By \nthe time of this phone call in January 2012, Mr. Perez was well on his \nway toward orchestrating this quid pro quo I have described.\n  Mr. Perez then called the line attorney, Mr. Greg Brooker, and \ninstructed him not to discuss the Magner case in the memo he prepared \noutlining the reasons for the decision not to join that false claims \ncase. Here is what he said. This is a quote:\n\n       Hey, Greg. This is Tom Perez calling you--excuse me, \n     calling you at 9 o'clock on Tuesday. I got your message. The \n     main thing I wanted to ask you, I spoke to some folks in the \n     Civil Division yesterday and wanted to make sure that the \n     declination memo that you sent to the Civil Division--and I \n     am sure it probably already does this--but it doesn't make \n     any mention of the Magner case. It is just a memo on the \n     merits of the two cases that are under review in the qui tam \n     context.\n\n\n[[Page S3513]]\n\n\n  End of that voicemail.\n  Approximately 1 hour later, Mr. Perez sent Mr. Brooker a follow-up e-\nmail, writing:\n\n       I left you a detailed voice message. Call me if you can \n     after you have a chance to review [the] voice mail.\n\n  Several hours later Mr. Perez sent another follow-up e-mail, writing:\n\n       Were you able to listen to my message?\n\n  Mr. Perez's voice mail was quite clear and obvious. He told Mr. \nBrooker:\n\n       Make sure that the declination memo . . . doesn't make any \n     mention of the Magner case. It is just a memo on the merits \n     of the two cases.\n\n  What could be more clear than that?\n  In fact, Mr. Perez himself sent an e-mail less than an hour later \nexplaining that he had left a detailed voice mail for Mr. Brooker. Yet \nwhen congressional investigators asked Mr. Perez why he left a voice \nmail, he told an entirely different story. Here is what he told the \ninvestigators:\n\n       What I meant to communicate was, it is time to bring this \n     to closure, and if the only issue that is standing in the way \n     is how you talk about Magner, then don't talk about it.\n\n  Well, I hope my colleagues are listening and they say to themselves: \nGive me a break. This is plainly not what he said in his voice mail. \nMr. Perez, I was born at night, but I wasn't born last night. He didn't \nsay anything about being concerned with the delay. He said:\n\n       Make sure you don't mention Magner. It is just a memo on \n     the merits.\n\n  His intent was crystal clear.\n  Mr. Perez also testified Mr. Brooker called him back the next day and \nrefused to omit the discussion of the Magner case that was being \nwithdrawn from the Supreme Court. According to Mr. Perez, he told Mr. \nBrooker during this call to ``follow the normal process.''\n  But, again, this story is not supported by the evidence.\n  One month later, after Mr. Perez flew to Minneapolis to personally \nseal the deal with the city, a line attorney in the civil division e-\nmailed his superior to outline ``additional facts'' about the deal.\n  Point 6 read:\n\n       USA-MN--\n\n  U.S. Attorney Minnesota. That is abbreviated here.\n\n       U.S. Attorney Minnesota considers it non-negotiable that \n     its office will include a discussion of the Supreme Court \n     case and the policy issues in its declination memo.\n\n  If Mr. Perez's story were true and the issue was resolved on January \n11, then why, 1 month later, would the U.S. attorney's office need to \nemphatically state it would not hide the fact that the exchange took \nplace? Thank God for honest line attorneys, career attorneys.\n  As I mentioned, Mr. Perez flew to Minneapolis to finalize the deal on \nFebruary 3, and one would think a deal of this magnitude would be \nmemorialized in a detailed written agreement. After all, you can't even \nrent a car without signing a detailed agreement. But was this agreement \nwritten? No, it wasn't.\n\n  After Mr. Perez finalized the deal, the career attorney asked if \nthere was going to be a written agreement. What was Mr. Perez's \nresponse? He said:\n\n       No, just oral discussions; word was your bond.\n\n  Once again, the people listening to this are saying to themselves: \nCan you believe that? Here is Mr. Perez. He has just orchestrated a \ndeal where the United States declined to join a case worth up to $200 \nmillion to the Federal Treasury in exchange for the City of St. Paul \nwithdrawing a case from the Supreme Court. And when the career lawyers \nasked if this deal will be written down, he says, No. Your word was \nyour bond.\n  As everyone knows, the reason we make arrangements such as this in \nwriting is so there is no disagreement down the road about what the \nparties agreed to. As it turns out, there was, in fact, a disagreement \nabout the terms of this unwritten deal. The lawyer for the City of St. \nPaul, Mr. Lillehaug, told congressional investigators on January 9, \napproximately 1 month before the deal was finalized, Mr. Perez assured \nhim that ``HUD would be helpful'' if the Newell case proceeded after \nthe Department of Justice declined to intervene. Mr. Lillehaug also \ntold investigators that on February 4, the day after they finalized the \ndeal, Mr. Perez told him HUD had begun assembling information to assist \nthe city in a motion to dismiss the Newell complaint on ``original \nsource'' grounds. But, according to Mr. Lillehaug, this assistance \ndisappeared after the lawyers in the civil division learned about it.\n  Let me tell my colleagues the significance of that. Mr. Perez \nrepresents the United States. Mr. Newell is bringing a case on behalf \nof the United States. Mr. Perez is talking to lawyers on the other side \nand he tells them, after the United States declines to join the case we \nwill give you information to help you defeat Mr. Newell, who is \nbringing the case on behalf of the United States. Mr. Newell, the \nwhistleblower, was left hanging out to dry by Mr. Perez. In effect, Mr. \nPerez is offering, in that statement, to give the other side \ninformation to help defeat his own client.\n  I recognize this is a significant allegation, and Mr. Perez was asked \nabout it under oath. His response? Mr. Perez said:\n\n       No, I don't recall ever suggesting that.\n\n  So on the one hand is Mr. Lillehaug, who says Mr. Perez made this \noffer first in January and then again on February 4, but the assistance \ndisappeared after the lawyers in the civil division caught wind of it.\n  On the other hand is Mr. Perez, who testified under oath: I don't \nrecall ever having made that offer. Who should we believe? Well, the \ndocuments support Mr. Lillehaug's version of events.\n  On February 7, a line attorney sent an e-mail to the director of the \ncivil fraud section and related a conversation the assistant U.S. \nattorney in Minnesota had with Mr. Lillehaug. According to Mr. \nLillehaug, the line attorney wrote that there were two additional items \nthat were part of the ``deal that is not a deal'' and one of those two \nitems was this:\n\n       HUD will provide material to the City in support of their \n     motion to dismiss the original source grounds.\n\n  Internal e-mails show that when the career lawyers learned of this \npromise, they strongly disagreed with it and they conveyed their \nconcerns to Tony West, head of the civil division. During his \ntranscribed interview, Mr. West testified that it would have been \ninappropriate to provide this material outside of the normal discovery \nchannels. Mr. West said:\n\n       I just know that wasn't going to happen and it didn't \n     happen.\n\n  In other words, this is simple: When lawyers at the civil division \nlearned of this offer, they shut down that offer. So, the documentary \nevidence shows the events transpired exactly as Mr. Lillehaug said they \ndid. Mr. Perez offered to provide the other side with information that \nwould help them defeat the whistleblower, Mr. Newell, in his case, and \nthat case was on behalf of the United States and the taxpayers, and \npossibly $200 million. Well, I imagine this is simply stunning, the \nlack of common sense exhibited, when the American taxpayers hear about \nthis.\n  Mr. Perez represents the United States. Any lawyer would tell you it \nis highly inappropriate to offer to help the other side defeat their \nown client.\n  This brings me to my final couple points I want to highlight for my \ncolleagues.\n  Even though the Department traded away Mr. Newell's case, Mr. Perez \nhas defended his decision, in part, by claiming that Mr. Newell still \nhad his ``day in court.'' What Mr. Perez omits from his story is that \nMr. Newell's case was dismissed precisely because the United States was \nno longer a party to it.\n  After the United States declined to join the case, the judge \ndismissed Mr. Newell's case based upon the legal language ``public \ndisclosure bar,'' finding he was not, again, the ``original source'' of \nthe information to the government. I want to remind my colleagues that \nwe recently amended the False Claims Act precisely to prevent an \noutcome like this. Specifically, that amendment made clear that the \nJustice Department can contest the ``original source'' dismissal even \nif it fails to intervene, as it did in this case.\n  So the Department did not merely decline to intervene, which is bad \nenough, but, in fact, it affirmatively chose to leave Mr. Newell all \nalone in this case that Mr. Newell filed for the benefit of the United \nStates. Of course, that is the whole point. That is why it was so \nimportant for the City of St.\n\n[[Page S3514]]\n\nPaul to make sure the United States did not join the case. That is why \nthe city was willing to trade away a strong case before the Supreme \nCourt. The city knew that if the United States joined the action, the \ncase would almost certainly go forward. Conversely, the city knew that \nif the United States did not join the case and chose not to contest the \noriginal source, it would likely get dismissed.\n  Think about that--$200 million possibly down the drain. The \nDepartment trades away a case worth millions of taxpayer dollars. They \ndid it precisely because of the impact the decision would have on the \nlitigation. They knew that as a result of their decision, the \nwhistleblower would get dismissed based upon ``original source'' \ngrounds, since they did not contest it. And not only that, Mr. Perez \nwent so far as to offer to provide documents to the other side that \nwould help them defeat Mr. Newell in his case on behalf of Mr. Perez's \nclient. Again, that client was the United States. Yet, when the \nCongress starts asking questions, they have the guts to say: We didn't \ndo anything improper because Mr. Newell still had his day in court. \nWell, the problem with that is that they cut the limbs out from under \nhim.\n  This brings me to my last point, and that has to do with the strength \nof the case. Throughout our investigation, the Department has tried to \ndefend Mr. Perez's actions by claiming the case was ``marginal'' or \n``weak.'' Once again, the documents tell a far different story.\n  Before Mr. Perez got involved, the career lawyers--again, not \npolitical appointees but career lawyers--at the Department wrote a memo \nrecommending intervention in the case. In that memo, they describe St. \nPaul's actions as ``a particularly egregious example of false \ncertifications.'' In fact, the career lawyers in Minnesota felt so \nstrongly about the case that they took the unusual step of flying here \nto Washington, DC, to meet with HUD officials. HUD, of course, agreed \nthat the United States should intervene, but that was before Mr. Perez \ngot involved in the case.\n  The documents make clear that career lawyers considered this a strong \ncase, but the Department has claimed that Mike Hertz, the Department's \nexpert on the False Claims Act, considered it a weak case. In fact, 2 \nweeks ago Mr. Perez testified before my colleagues in the Senate HELP \nCommittee that Mr. Hertz ``had a very immediate and visceral reaction \nthat it was a weak case.'' But what do the documents show? They tell a \ndifferent story. Mr. Hertz knew about the case in November 2011. Two \nmonths later a Department official took notes of a meeting where the \nquid pro quo was discussed. That official wrote down Mr. Hertz's \nreaction. This official wrote:\n\n       Mike--\n  Referring to Mr. Hertz--\n\n       Mike--Odd--Looks like buying off St. Paul. Should be \n     whether there are legit reasons to decline as to past \n     practice.\n\n  The next day that same official e-mailed the Associate Attorney \nGeneral here in town and said:\n\n       Mike Hertz brought up the St. Paul ``disparate impact'' \n     case in which the SG [Solicitor General] just filed an amicus \n     brief in the Supreme Court. He's concerned about the \n     recommendation that we decline to intervene in two qui tam \n     cases against St. Paul.\n\n  So you have these documents appearing to show that Mr. Hertz's \nprimary concern was not the strength of the case, as Mr. Perez led \nSenate colleagues to believe; Mr. Hertz was concerned that the quid pro \nquo Mr. Perez ultimately arranged was, in fact, improper. And, again, \nin his words, it ``looks like buying off St. Paul.''\n  Just last week the Justice Department sent my staff a critical 33-\npage slide show about the Department's case against St. Paul. In that \ndocument, the career lawyers made their strong case for intervention, \nfor the Justice Department to intervene with Newell to bring this case \nabout. The Department failed to provide this critical document to the \ncommittees, and we only learned about this document not from the \nDepartment of Justice but from a recent interview we had with a HUD \nemployee. Why do I say this is a critical document? Because this \ndocument makes abundantly clear that career lawyers did not view this \ncase as ``marginal,'' where Mr. Perez wants you to believe that other \npeople in the Department, experts on false claims, thought it was a \n``marginal'' or ``weak'' case. And obviously he did not view it as a \nweak case, as Mr. Perez testified before the HELP Committee--far from \nit.\n  Here is how the career lawyers summed up the case in one of the final \nslides of this document. These are quotes:\n\n       The City Repeatedly and Knowingly Misrepresented its \n     Compliance with Section 3 to Obtain Federal Funds.\n       Tentative conclusions:\n       The City has long been aware of its obligations under \n     section 3;\n       The City repeatedly told HUD and others that it was in \n     Compliance with Section 3;\n       The City has failed to substantially comply with Section 3.\n\n  Does that sound like career lawyers describing a ``marginal'' or a \n``weak'' case? Of course not. Yet that is what Mr. Perez told my \ncolleagues on the HELP Committee. My colleagues are well aware of how I \nfeel about the Whistleblower Protection Act, and my colleagues know how \nI feel about protecting whistleblowers who have the courage to step \nforward, often at great risk to their own careers. But this is about \nmuch more than the whistleblower who was left dangling by Mr. Perez. \nThis is about the fact that Mr. Perez manipulated the rule of law in \norder to get a case removed from the Supreme Court docket. But most \nimportantly, this is about the fact that when Congress started asking \nquestions about this case and when Mr. Perez was called upon to offer \nhis testimony under oath, he chose to tell an entirely different story. \nThe unavoidable conclusion is that the story he told is flatly not \nsupported by the facts.\n\n  We have to demand more. We have to demand that when individuals are \ncalled upon to answer questions before the Senate, that they shoot \nstraight regardless of the consequences.\n  I do not believe Mr. Perez gave us the straight story when he was \ncalled upon to answer questions about this case, and for that reason, I \nrecommend, first of all, that my colleagues study these issues. There \nis a lot in this that needs to be brought out about this nomination \nbefore we vote on it. This evidence I give is just part of the story.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nnomination of Marilyn Tavenner to serve as Administrator of the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services or CMS, one of the largest agencies \never in the history of the country. For a number of reasons, CMS has \nbeen without a confirmed Administrator since the fall of 2006.\n  CMS is the world's largest health insurer. It processes over a \nbillion Medicare and Medicaid claims a year. It has a budget of nearly \n$1 trillion. It also provides services to over 100 million of our \nNation's most vulnerable citizens receiving Medicare and Medicaid. So \nclearly this is a critical agency that needs a strong leader at the \nhelm.\n  Thus far, from what I have seen, Ms. Tavenner has the qualifications \nto be that kind of a leader I believe her to be. She has clinical \nexperience from being a nurse, executive experience from serving as a \nhospital administrator, and hands-on operational experience from her \ntime as the secretary of health and human resources for the State of \nVirginia. That rare combination of skills will be essential when \nheading an agency as diverse as CMS. There is a reason she was voted \nout of the Senate Finance Committee on a voice vote and had the House \nmajority leader come testify on her behalf.\n  Starting in 2010, she was appointed as the Deputy Administrator of \nCMS. Since November of 2011, she has served as the Acting \nAdministrator. So far, she has shown a willingness to work with Members \nof both parties, which is a welcome development, particularly under \nthis administration.\n  At a time when the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \nServices is engaging in activities that are less than transparent and \npotentially illegal, it is even more important that an agency as vital \nas CMS be headed by someone with strong ethics and integrity.\n  Make no mistake, this agency's greatest challenges lie ahead. One of \nthe biggest problems facing CMS in the near future is implementation of \nthe\n\n[[Page S3515]]\n\nFederal- and State-based health insurance exchanges established under \nObamaCare. These exchanges are supposed to be brought online later this \nyear, but there are numerous obstacles that will have to be addressed. \nBy most indications, it would take a miracle for the exchanges to be up \nand ready on time.\n  To date CMS has not been able to provide satisfactory answers to a \nnumber of questions posed by myself and other Members of Congress \nregarding the exchanges. For example, we have yet to see a breakdown of \nthe budget for the federally facilitated exchange. Furthermore, we \nstill know very little about the operational details of the exchanges \nand even less about how people will enroll. These are serious issues. \nWith this system, you are asking American families to entrust the fate \nof their health care services to the empty words and deeds of an \nadministration that has repeatedly shown a complete inability to be \nheld accountable.\n  More importantly, with the recent revelations of potentially criminal \nbehavior at the Internal Revenue Service, I am very concerned about \ntrusting that agency's ability to work with CMS and HHS to deliver \nbenefits for Americans through the exchanges.\n  Almost every day we see new indications that the health law is an \nunmitigated disaster. We are already seeing evidence that health \ninsurance premium costs are continuing to rise and are projected to be, \non average, 32 percent higher in the individual market. At the same \ntime, according to numbers released yesterday by the Congressional \nBudget Office, by 2019 almost 14 million Americans who would have had \nemployer-provided coverage will no longer have it.\n  Let me be very clear. ObamaCare is fundamentally flawed. The only \nreal way to fix it is to repeal it and then start again. But until we \ncan accomplish that goal, we need to make sure we are protecting our \nfellow citizens the best we can from all the negative effects of this \nlaw.\n  In addition to overseeing this massive new expansion of benefits, Ms. \nTavenner will also be charged with helping to ensure the longevity and \nsolvency of the existing Medicare trust fund, which is projected to go \nbankrupt in 2024. All told, between now and 2030, 76 million baby \nboomers will become eligible for Medicare. Even factoring in deaths \nover that period, the program will grow from approximately 47 million \nbeneficiaries today to roughly 80 million beneficiaries in 2030.\n  Maintaining the solvency of the Medicare Program while continuing to \nprovide care for our ever-increasing beneficiary base is going to \nrequire courageous solutions. I have had several conversations with Ms. \nTavenner about the need for structural entitlement reforms to ensure \nthat these programs are here for future generations. I sincerely hope \nwe will continue to make progress on these critical issues.\n  Overseeing a massive bureaucracy such as the one at CMS is not a job \nfor the faint of heart. I will be keeping a close eye on Ms. Tavenner \nas she takes the reins. If she is to be successful, she will have to \nrealize she cannot do it alone. She will have to work with Members of \nCongress from both parties. I hope she will do so. I believe she will. \nThus far I have reason to believe she will be one of the best leaders \nwe can possibly have in the government. However, if it is under her \nleadership that CMS continues what has become a disappointing pattern \nin this administration--not responding to legitimate congressional \ninquiries and throwing promises of transparency by the wayside--I will \nuse the full weight of my position as the ranking member on the Senate \nFinance Committee to hold her and others fully accountable. I do not \nthink I am going to have to do that. I actually think she is that good.\n  I appreciate Ms. Tavenner's willingness to serve in this difficult \nposition. While I still have many concerns about the policies of this \nadministration and the direction CMS is heading, I plan to vote in \nfavor of her confirmation because she has the ability and the potential \nto be a real leader and already has exemplified that in many ways. I \nencourage my colleagues to vote for her. I think Marilyn Tavenner is \nthe right prescription at the right time to help with HHS and also with \nCMS which, as I said, is one of the largest agencies ever in the \nhistory of the world. She is a good woman. She is dedicated. She has \nthe ability. I believe she will do a great job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to, first of all, commend the \nSenator from Utah for his comments. We all know the Senator from Utah, \nlike myself, has a real interest in making sure our government is more \nefficient and more effective in its operations, and know, as well, that \nthe Senator from Utah has not always been necessarily supportive of \nhealth care reform, the Affordable Care Act. But I appreciate the \ncomments of the Senator from Utah about Marilyn Tavenner.\n  I have known Marilyn Tavenner for 25 years. I think while we may \ndisagree about the effectiveness of the Affordable Care Act, we do know \none thing: We want CMS to be the most efficient, effective organization \npossible. I commend the Senator from Utah for his strong endorsement of \nMarilyn Tavenner. I think he spoke eloquently about her background. I \nam going to try to add a few comments, but I did not want to let him \nget away without my thanking him for his comments.\n  I rise today to join this bipartisan show of support for the \nPresident's nominee to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, Marilyn Tavenner. She comes to the floor this afternoon on a \nfairly unusual circumstance, considering some of the nominees we are \nconsidering. She came actually with a unanimous voice vote from the \nSenate Finance Committee. She is supported by a number of health care \norganizations, including the American Hospital Association, the SEIU, \nthe American Nurses Association, just to name a few.\n  As I mentioned already, I have known Marilyn Tavenner for 25 years. \nShe is the real deal. She will be a phenomenal choice to continue to \nlead CMS. Marilyn grew up in a small town in southside Virginia and \nworked her way through school. She began her health care career not as \na hospital administrator or an executive, but she began on the front \nlines as an emergency room nurse.\n  Then through her ability, and her ability to relate to people and \ncare, she rose to become CEO of a hospital and then a senior executive \nof a leading health care company. I know as Governor I called upon \nMarilyn on a repeated basis on health care issues that affected \nVirginia. Marilyn has always been committed to people and public \nservice. She took that private sector knowledge and experience into the \npublic sector even before her tenure with this administration when she \njoined my good friend, the junior Senator from Virginia Tim Kaine when \nhe became Governor and served with his administration as the Virginia \nSecretary of Health.\n  Today, Marilyn has already served at the highest levels of CMS, where \nshe has shown her ability to manage and operate one of the largest and \nmost complex agencies in our whole government. By spending most of her \ncareer in the private sector, she knows the impact that regulations and \nrules have on the real world and understands the importance of not just \nachieving a policy goal but ensuring that it works in practice.\n  As we all know, passing a law like the ACA is a complicated process, \nparticularly a law like this that has generated as much controversy. \nThat means the role of the Administrator of CMS to be evenhanded, fact-\nbased, effective, and efficient in implementing the dramatic \ntransformation of the health care market that the ACA is going to \nprovide will require a first class Administrator, somebody who \nunderstands how to get things done and somebody who is well-respected \nby both sides of the aisle. Marilyn Tavenner clearly fits that bill.\n  She is held in extraordinarily high esteem. We, again, heard the \nranking member on the Finance Committee already speak in her support. \nShe received unanimous support from the Finance Committee, but she is \nalso held in extraordinarily high esteem by her peers. In fact, in \nFebruary all of the previous living Senate-confirmed Administrators of \nthe CMS--Democrats, Republicans, Independents, all of them who have run \nthe agency in the past--sent a letter urging her confirmation,\n\n[[Page S3516]]\n\nnoting that it was ``hard to imagine a candidate more worthy of \nbipartisan support.''\n\n  I look forward to voting with what I hope will be an overwhelming \nmajority of my colleagues to confirm Marilyn for this very important \nrole a little bit later this afternoon. I know I am about to give up my \ntime and yield to the great new Senator from Massachusetts. I know she \nis going to be speaking about another nominee, someone with whom I have \nhad the opportunity to visit a couple of times, for a role that may be \nalmost as controversial as being head of CMS, being Administrator of \nEPA.\n  I want to say that in my conversations with Gina McCarthy she seems \nto bring a breadth of background of work at the State level, working \nunder both Democratic and Republican administrations. I know the \nSenator from Massachusetts is going to speak to her qualifications, but \nas long as I am here I want to add my voice as well that I think Ms. \nMcCarthy will be a great head of the EPA, and I look forward to joining \nmy friend and colleague, the Senator from Massachusetts, in supporting \nher.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                        Gina McCarthy Nomination\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I want to start by thanking the senior \nSenator from Virginia both for advancing a nomination that we will vote \non this afternoon and for his comments about Gina McCarthy. She is, as \nthe Senator says, a quite remarkable person, and she will be a \nwonderful director of the Environmental Protection Agency. I very much \nappreciate the Senator's comments about her, and I know Ms. McCarthy \ndoes as well, and the people of Massachusetts do as well.\n  I rise today to do something very simple. I ask my colleagues to give \na simple vote to the President's nominee to head the Environmental \nProtection Agency. This is not fancy or ambitious, it is just a basic \nprinciple of good government in our constitutional system.\n  When the Founders of our Republic came together to write the \nConstitution, they knew the President would need help in administering \nthis great and expansive Nation. Without help, without a government \nthat was staffed, justice would not be established, our common defense \nwould be threatened, and the blessings of liberty we hoped to secure \nthrough our laws would go unfulfilled.\n  The Founders of our Republic gave to the President the task of \nnominating individuals to serve and gave us the responsibility to \nadvise on and consent to these appointments. For more than 200 years \nthis process has worked. Presidents over the years have nominated \nthousands of qualified men and women who were willing to serve in key \nexecutive branch positions.\n  The Senate has considered nominations in a timely fashion and taken \nup-or-down votes. Of course, there have been bumps along the way, but \nwe have never seen anything like this. Time and again, Members of this \nbody have resorted to procedural technicalities and flatout \nobstructionism to block qualified nominees.\n  At the moment, there are 85 judicial vacancies in the U.S. courts, \nsome of which are classified as ``judicial emergencies.'' That is more \nthan double the number of judicial vacancies at the comparable point \nduring President George W. Bush's second term. Yet right now there are \n10 nominees awaiting a vote in the Senate, and they have not gotten \none.\n  But that is not all. The nomination of the Secretary of Defense was \nheld up for weeks and then filibustered. The nominee for the Secretary \nof Labor, Tom Perez, has been held up on an obscure technical maneuver. \nThen, of course, there is the determined effort to block Richard \nCordray to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau--not because \nhe is unqualified; in fact, he has received praise from industry and \nconsumer groups alike. Even the Republicans who blocked him have \npraised his fairness and his evenhandedness. No, Rich Cordray is \nblocked because some Members of this body do not like the agency he \nheads. They know they do not have the votes to get rid of it or to \nweaken it, so instead they are holding the Director's nomination \nhostage.\n  Now we get to Gina McCarthy. This past Thursday, the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee was scheduled to vote on Gina \nMcCarthy's nomination to head the Environmental Protection Agency. \nRight before the scheduled vote, all the Republicans decided not to \nshow up. Under Senate rules, that meant there was no quorum and thus \nthe vote could not take place.\n  The President has done his job. He named an outstanding nominee for \nthe Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Gina \nMcCarthy. Gina has dedicated her professional life to the protection of \nour public health and to the stewardship of our environment. She was \nconfirmed to her previous position at the EPA as Assistant \nAdministrator for Air and Radiation by voice vote without objection.\n  Just to be clear, this means most of the Members of this Chamber have \nalready voted to approve her once before.\n  Gina also has a long record of working effectively across party \nlines. She served under Republican and Democratic Governors alike, \nincluding working for Gov. Mitt Romney, the most recent Republican \nPresidential nominee. Her record in Massachusetts was stellar, and she \nhas done all of us in the Commonwealth proud through her service in \nWashington.\n  Gina herself has also done her job and more. She has answered a \nstaggering 1,120 questions from the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. That is the largest number of questions ever asked of a \nnominee facing a Senate confirmation. To put this in some perspective, \n4 years ago the last confirmed Administrator of the EPA, Lisa Jackson, \nwas asked 157 questions during her nomination process.\n  When Congress convened in January, many of us, both veterans and \nnewcomers, were concerned that this kind of obstructionism would \npersist in the new Congress. We pushed hard for changes to the \nfilibuster rules. We understood passions on both sides of the issue, \nand we listened to our colleagues. Ultimately, the two sides reached a \ncompromise, a compromise that many of us were concerned about, but it \nincluded a clear understanding that the Democrats would not make \nsubstantial changes to the filibuster and, in return, the Republicans \nwould not abuse its use. But in the past 3 months, abuse has been piled \non abuse. Republicans have prevented votes on judges, on agency heads, \nand on administration Secretaries.\n  This is wrong. Republicans can vote no on any nominee they choose, \nbut blocking a vote is nothing more than obstructionism. Blocking the \nbusiness of government, the business of protecting people from cheating \ncredit card companies, from mercury in the water or from unfair labor \npractices must stop.\n  The President has done his job. Gina McCarthy has done her job. Now \nit is time for the Senate to do its job. Gina McCarthy deserves a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I am here to join my colleague Senator Warren to also \nexpress my frustration about what is happening with the nominees to \nthese critical agencies that are being held up by our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle. As Senator Warren said very eloquently, last \nweek the Republican members of the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee chose not to appear for the important business of considering \nthe nomination of Gina McCarthy. They made this decision with only a \nfew minutes' notice. As a result, this action prevented an already \noverdue vote from taking place as scheduled.\n  The refusal to allow a vote on such fundamental business is \nunacceptable. The EPA conducts vital work to safeguard public health \nand protect our environment. Yet the agency has been without permanent \nleadership for months. It is the Senate's duty to act in a timely \nmanner on these kinds of vacancies, and it is clear from Ms. McCarthy's \nimpressive and expansive record that this nominee has earned and \ndeserves a vote.\n  I understand and I respect those Senators who feel they have to vote \nagainst a nominee for substantive reasons. However, this failure to \neven appear at last Thursday's meeting and take a vote shows an \nalarming level of disregard for the importance of permanent leadership \nat the EPA and for the\n\n[[Page S3517]]\n\nSenate's confirmation process. As Senator Warren said, committee \nRepublicans have already asked Ms. McCarthy to answer over 1,100 \nquestions for the record, more than three times what any previous \nnominee for this position has faced. She has provided 234 pages of \nanswers, and it is past time that the committee held a vote. We need to \nmove forward on filling the position of EPA Administrator so the agency \ncan resume addressing today's public health challenges in the most \neffective manner.\n  Simply put, the type of obstructionism we saw last week has no place \nin this Senate, no place in our government, particularly for a position \nas critical as this one. In addition to its work to reduce harmful \npollution at the national level, the EPA plays a vital role in \nsafeguarding public health in our local communities.\n  For example, in my State of New Hampshire, testing in 2009 revealed \nelevated levels of contaminants in the wells of homeowners living in \nthe town of Raymond because of their proximity to a Superfund site. \nFollowing this discovery, we worked with the EPA, with the State \nDepartment of Environmental Services, and with the town of Raymond to \nfind a solution that would address the health concerns because the \nfamilies didn't have safe drinking water. With the EPA's support, the \ntown has extended its water lines to ensure that these homeowners and \ntheir families can be provided access to safe clean drinking water.\n  I had the opportunity to view the progress of this construction \nproject in person last year. I applaud the EPA for working with \ncommunities on vital local priorities such as this.\n  Communities across our country face public health challenges, and the \nEPA plays an important role in addressing these challenges. Even now we \nare working in New Hampshire in a similar situation where wells have \nbeen contaminated in the town of Atkinson.\n  We can't continue to delay the Senate's responsibilities to provide \nagencies such as the EPA with the leadership they need to operate. With \n30 years of public service in a variety of roles, Ms. McCarthy has both \nthe experience and the expertise to do the critical job of leading the \nEPA. Her expansive and lengthy career is rooted in working at the \nforefront of pressing environmental issues for leading New England \nGovernors of both political parties.\n  Most recently, Gina McCarthy served in Connecticut's Department of \nEnvironmental Protection under former Republican Gov. Jodi Rell. Before \nthat, Ms. McCarthy served five different Massachusetts Governors, \nincluding Michael Dukakis and Mitt Romney--the Republican Party's own \nnominee for President in last year's election.\n  These diverse work experiences on a broad range of environmental \nissues have provided Ms. McCarthy with the first-hand knowledge of \nenvironmental and public health challenges we face. They are evidence \nof her ability to work with people on both sides of the aisle to \naddress the problems faced as we look at agencies such as the EPA.\n  Ms. McCarthy was confirmed by the Senate to her current EPA post with \noverwhelming bipartisan support in 2009. That makes the boycott last \nweek even more shocking. In her current role as the Assistant \nAdministrator for the Office of Air and Radiation, Ms. McCarthy has \nworked with environmental advocates and industry leaders to reduce \nharmful emissions that threaten clean air. These efforts are \nparticularly significant for downwind regions such as in New England, \nwhere we serve as the tailpipe to the rest of the Nation and suffer the \neffects of pollution from coal-fired powerplants in the middle part of \nthe country. I am sure the Chair understands this issue.\n  In recognition of her successful tenure, Ms. McCarthy has received \nwidespread praise from a diverse group of industry leaders who \nrecognize her ability to find common ground and compromise.\n  Coming from New Hampshire, which is the second most forested State in \nthe Nation, I know New Hampshire's forest products industry will \nbenefit from an EPA Administrator with a strong reputation for \nconstructive dialog. Following Ms. McCarthy's nomination, Donna Harman \nof the American Forest and Paper Association described her by saying: \n``She's very data- and fact-driven, and that's been helpful for us as \nwell as the entire business community.''\n\n  Leaders in an array of other sectors have voiced similar appreciation \nfor the way in which Ms. McCarthy values finding common ground. Heaven \nknows we can use some common ground here.\n  Robert Engel of the American Automotive Policy Council praised the \ncare she takes in listening to stakeholders, saying:\n\n       We look forward to continuing to work with Gina McCarthy. \n     She has demonstrated a willingness to consider the views of \n     those affected by the agency she has been nominated to lead, \n     and to find practical solutions to issues facing the \n     automobile industry.\n\n  These words describe a public servant who understands the importance \nof listening, understanding, and bringing stakeholders together.\n  I am confident Gina McCarthy will be an excellent leader of the EPA. \nShe deserves fair consideration. She deserves a timely vote.\n  I am pleased we received news that there will be a rescheduled vote \nlater this week. I urge my colleagues across the aisle to move forward \nin good faith and give fair consideration to this nominee. The EPA must \nhave a permanent Administrator who is an advocate for protecting public \nhealth and providing valuable support to our Nation's communities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary procedure?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering the Tavenner \nnomination en bloc and at 4:30 p.m. unanimous consent to move to a \nvote.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to speak on another matter, \nas well as on the Marilyn Tavenner matter. Frankly, my remarks will \ntake more than 4 minutes, so to what degree we can get the Senate to \npostpone votes, we will be working on that as I am speaking.\n\n\n                      The Internal Revenue Service\n\n  Mr. President, over the last 5 days, information that I can describe \nonly as very troubling has emerged about a systematic practice by the \nIRS to target conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status.\n  According to a report released last night by the Inspector General \nfor Tax Administration, the IRS developed and used inappropriate \ncriteria to identify applications from organizations applying for tax-\nexempt status based ``upon their names or policy positions instead of \nindications of potential political campaign intervention.''\n  In addition, the 48-page report finds that ineffective management of \nthe IRS allowed for this inappropriate practice to stay in place for \nmore than 18 months, resulted in substantial delays in processing \ncertain applications, and allowed unnecessary information requests to \nbe issued.\n  While the inspector general report does not say the IRS was \nintentionally partisan, it did find that the agency's narrow focus of \nthe criteria gives the appearance that the IRS was not impartial in \nconducting its mission.\n  These actions by the IRS, if true, are a clear breach of the public's \ntrust. Targeting groups based on their political views is not only \ninappropriate, but it is intolerable, unacceptable, and cannot be \nallowed.\n  I intend to get to the bottom of what happened. The inspector \ngeneral's report is just the beginning. There are still many unanswered \nquestions. The Senate Finance Committee, which has congressional \noversight over the IRS, has just begun what will be a thorough \ninvestigation.\n  Some are now using this issue to try to score political points. Some \nof my friends across the aisle are claiming the IRS was just doing what \nDemocrats wanted in examining these conservative groups.\n  Let me clear up this misperception. I, for one, have never advocated \ntargeting conservative groups. This is important, let me be clear. What \nI have called for in the past, especially in 2010, and continue to call \nfor today is closer examination of any and all groups already granted \nor applying for tax-exempt status--let me say that again, any and all \ngroups.\n  Since the Citizens United case decided by the Supreme Court, there \nhas been a dramatic increase in political\n\n[[Page S3518]]\n\norganizations masquerading as social welfare groups. We need to make \nsure these groups are complying with IRS political activity rules.\n  Any group claiming tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(4) of the \nInternal Revenue Code needs to prove it is following the letter of the \nlaw.\n  As the New York Times noted yesterday, ``No one has an automatic \nright to this tax exemption. Those seeking one should expect close \nscrutiny from the government to ensure it is not evading taxes.''\n  While I expect the scrutiny of the IRS to be thorough, I also expect \nit to be administered equally across the board, on conservative or \nliberal organizations and any in between.\n  Americans expect the IRS to do its job without passion or prejudice. \nThe IRS can't pick one group for closer examination and give the other \na free pass. But that is apparently what they did here. That was the \nagency's big mistake, and now they have to answer for it.\n  The Senate Finance Committee has launched a formal bipartisan \ninvestigation. A team of investigators from my staff and the staff of \nSenator Hatch has begun compiling questions and seeking additional \ndocuments from the IRS. There seems to be some inconsistencies in the \ntimeline regarding who knew what and when, and we will get to the \nbottom of it.\n  As part of the investigation, I went straight to the top and met with \nActing Commissioner Steve Miller yesterday. It was a tough talk. I told \nMr. Miller the actions of the IRS were inexcusable and warned he is in \nfor serious questioning from this committee and from others. I told Mr. \nMiller the committee demanded nothing less than his complete \ncooperation and total transparency.\n  The Finance Committee will hold a hearing on Tuesday to examine this \nissue. There needs to be a full accounting of what happened at the IRS \nand who knew what, when, how long did this practice go on, and what \nother groups were flagged for additional scrutiny.\n  There is another important question that needs to be asked: Is there \na fault in the Tax Code that may have contributed to the IRS taking \nsuch unacceptable steps? Do we need a better definition of what \norganizations qualify for tax exemption? Do we need to revisit the role \ntax-exempt organizations play in our political system? What part of the \nTax Code has to be changed for us to guarantee this overreach never \nhappens again? And there are many more questions.\n  This will be an issue we delve into in tax reform as well. Clearly, \nsomething is amiss for the IRS to behave the way it did. The actions of \nthe IRS are unacceptable and people will be held accountable.\n\n\n                               Tax Reform\n\n  Mr. President, let me take a moment to turn briefly to a related \ntopic. As some may know, the Senate Finance Committee has been working \non comprehensive tax reform for the last 2 years. We have held more \nthan 30 hearings and heard from hundreds of experts on how tax reform \ncan simplify the system for families, spark economic growth, create \njobs, and make U.S. businesses more competitive.\n  Last Thursday I teamed with House Ways and Means Committee Chairman \nDave Camp to launch a Web site to get even more input directly from the \nAmerican people. We launched taxreform.gov to give folks in Montana, in \nMichigan, and all across America an opportunity to weigh in on tax \nreform. Since the launch of the site less than a week ago, we have \nreceived thousands of ideas directly from the American people on how to \nimprove the Code.\n  I want to thank all those who have shared their ideas and opinions, \nand I encourage more people to log on to taxreform.gov to let us know \nwhat they think of the Nation's tax system and what it should look \nlike.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Marilyn Tavenner\n\n  Mr. President, if I might, one other issue I want to address is the \nnomination of Marilyn Tavenner.\n  Marilyn Tavenner has been nominated to be Administrator for the \nCenters of Medicare and Medicaid Services, otherwise known as CMS. As \nhead of CMS, Ms. Tavenner would be in charge of administering Medicare, \nMedicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program, among others.\n  Roughly one in three Americans relies on health coverage under the \njurisdictions of CMS--one in three. This includes 50 million Medicare \npatients, 56 million Medicaid patients, and more than 5.5 million \nchildren in the Children's Health Insurance Program. In my home State \nof Montana, 167,000 seniors and 8,300 military retirees rely on \nMedicare alone.\n  Marilyn Tavenner is an experienced health care professional. She has \nproven herself to be a strong leader, and I believe she is the right \nwoman to lead CMS, a view shared by my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle.\n  Ms. Tavenner is a proud native Virginian and her congressional \ndelegation, all of them, warmly introduced her--if they were all not \nthere, in spirit--at a confirmation hearing before the Finance \nCommittee last month. Democratic Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine and \nRepublican House majority leader Eric Cantor all spoke on her behalf. \nHere is what House majority leader Cantor said:\n\n       I don't think there is any secret that I differ with the \n     Obama administration in a lot of matters in health care \n     policy . . . but if there is anyone that I trust to try to \n     navigate [these] challenges, it is Marilyn Tavenner.\n\n  Two weeks ago, the Finance Committee approved Ms. Tavenner's \nnomination with a unanimous vote. She has earned this broad support \nfrom both sides of the aisle and the confidence of many of us because \nof her demonstrated abilities.\n  She started as a nurse, quickly rose through the ranks to become a \nhospital administrator, served 4 years as Virginia's Secretary of \nHealth and Human Resources before joining CMS in 2010, and she has \nserved as acting administrator for the last year and a half. I am \nconfident we will get a strong vote for this nomination because Marilyn \nTavenner has a reputation for being a pragmatist and a person who \ndoesn't give up.\n  One story I wish to share--and this is important--is of Marilyn \nworking the night shift in the intensive care unit at Johnston-Willis \nHospital in Richmond, VA, as a nurse. At 2 a.m. a rescue squad brought \nin a young woman to the emergency room. She had been in a terrible car \naccident and crashed through the windshield of her old Volkswagen \nbug. Badly injured and having suffered massive blood loss, she was \npronounced dead. But Ms. Tavenner and the doctors went to work to \nrevive her. The surgeon on call told reporters:\n\n       We came up with a game plan, and it was right on target. We \n     used about 60 units of blood. Marilyn was very supportive in \n     everything . . . The patient ultimately walked out of the \n     hospital.\n\n  That is Marilyn Tavenner. She doesn't give up. We need that type of \nleader at CMS, believe me. Her experience in health care is real, it is \nvaried, and it will serve us well in this position.\n  One final note. As someone pointed out, CMS has operated without a \nconfirmed administrator for several years, so I am glad we are moving \nforward with this nomination. We need a confirmed administrator, with \nall the work she has to do, especially implementing the Affordable Care \nAct. That was an essential bill that created good law. In a few months \nthe health care marketplaces will be open for enrollment, and tax \ncredits and subsidies will be available to help families and small \nbusinesses pay for health care. It is a critical time to have someone \nwith Ms. Tavenner's experience confirmed and in charge at CMS. She has \ndone a good job in the past, and she will do a good job in the future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support me in supporting her nomination.\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I support the nomination of Marilyn \nTavenner to be the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, CMS. I strongly support her nomination and was sorry \nto miss today's vote. I voted for her confirmation in the Finance \nCommittee and would have done so today as well.\n  It has been over 6 years since CMS has had a confirmed Administrator, \nand the agency will benefit from having someone with Ms. Tavenner's \nskills and expertise at the helm. Her experience as the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Resources in Virginia and with the Hospital \nCorporation of America as well as the time she has already served\n\n[[Page S3519]]\n\nas Acting Administrator and Principal Deputy Administrator of CMS have \nprepared her well for the challenges and opportunities she will \nconfront in this position.\n  I thank her for her willingness to serve at this important time, and \nI look forward to working with her in the months and years \nahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is: \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of William H. \nOrrick, III, of the District of Columbia, to be United States District \nJudge for the Northern District of California?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                          Disturbing Behavior\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise this evening to discuss a \ndisturbing pattern of behavior, a culture of intimidation that \ncontinues to emerge from the Obama administration.\n  For the past few days, headline after headline has revealed one new \ncontroversy after another. In every case Americans are right to wonder \nwhat kind of leadership led to this and just how far this culture of \nintimidation goes.\n  Americans need to learn the extent to which this misconduct has \noccurred by the heavy hand of the executive branch of government.\n  The first indication was on Friday of last week, and it involved the \nInternal Revenue Service issuing an apology for targeting conservative \ngroups seeking nonprofit status and treating conservative groups more \nharshly than other groups.\n  These groups were excessively scrutinized if they used the words \n``patriot'' or ``tea party.'' As we would later learn from the \ninspector general report, not only were these groups targeted, but \nsenior officials knew about it for at least a year and made no report \nto the Congress. It has also been confirmed that confidential \ninformation about some of these groups was leaked to the liberal \nnonprofit group ProPublica.\n  The whole situation disgraces the basic constitutional freedoms to \nwhich every American is entitled. It is appalling that Americans have \nbeen deliberately targeted for IRS scrutiny based on their political \nbeliefs or affiliations. No American should fear arbitrary government \nharassment simply because of the expression of his or her views.\n  The administration needs to be held accountable for its failure to \nprotect Americans. An apology is not sufficient in this instance. An \ninternal inspector general investigation talking about mismanagement \nerrors will not suffice in this instance. The acknowledgement that \nmistakes were made and that changes, indeed, need to be made will not, \nin and of itself, rebuild the public trust that has been broken.\n  Particularly troubling is that the IRS is not the only agency in \nwhich these types of abuses have occurred. Americans are also right to \nbe outraged by the news that Health and Human Services Secretary \nKathleen Sebelius has been fundraising among the industry people she \nregulates on behalf of the President's health care law.\n  As reported in the Washington Post on May 10, Secretary Sebelius \n``has gone, hat in hand, to health industry officials, asking them to \nmake large financial donations.''\n\n[[Page S3520]]\n\n  Presumably these donations are being collected in order to pay for an \nadvertising campaign in the media, including television. Further \ninvestigation is necessary to determine the extent to which these \nsolicitations constitute a conflict of interest. It is curious that the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services is seeking support from the \nhealth industry now when these affected parties were largely ignored or \nin many cases intimidated during the debate on the President's health \ncare law.\n  Meanwhile, questions remain about the administration's handling of \nthe September 11, 2012, terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in \nBenghazi that left four Americans dead, including Ambassador Chris \nStevens. During his recent news conference, the President tried to \ndeflect serious concerns about altered talking points by calling it a \npolitical ``sideshow.'' I do not think the American people are going to \nbe convinced that it is a sideshow. The real sideshow is the \nPresident's attempt to distract from an unraveling narrative that began \nwith the administration wrongly casting blame on an inflammatory \nYouTube video. Subsequent testimony from State Department \nwhistleblowers, who came forward despite administration pressure, has \nonly expanded the controversy surrounding the administration's apparent \nmisrepresentation of the terrorist attack to the American people.\n  Let's not forget that it was President Obama who promised, after he \ntook office, that his administration would be ``the most open and \ntransparent in history.'' It is increasingly clear that the President's \nrhetoric does not match this reality.\n  Whether these scandals continue to make mainstream news, our \nquestions and inquiries will not stop until we get answers. The \nadministration's conflicting storylines and blame games are inexcusable \nin the wake of serious allegations. In America, those in power are not \nabove the law, and those responsible must be held accountable. A Member \nof this body on the other side of the aisle asked publicly on the radio \nthis morning: What does it take to get fired in this town? A good \nquestion coming from the other side of the aisle.\n  What we are continuing to see is a culture of intimidation, a pattern \nof big-government heavyhandedness and overreach by the administration. \nWhat is lacking is credibility and integrity from those elected to \nserve.\n  Each scandal is distinct in its grievances but not isolated in its \nimpact. A New Yorker article published yesterday by Amy Davidson noted \n``the Obama Administration's strange belief that if it can just find \nthe right words, that reality will comply and bend to meet it--that its \nchallenges are so extraordinary that the use of any exceptions built \ninto normal processes should be regarded as unexceptional.''\n  Americans deserve direct, straightforward answers, and they deserve \nthe facts. They deserve to know why the IRS deliberately targeted \nconservative groups and gave liberal groups a pass, why Secretary \nSebelius solicited the health care industry to help implement \nObamaCare, and why the administration downplayed the atrocities in \nBenghazi and pressured fact witnesses to stay silent. It time for the \nPresident and his inner circle to provide a full explanation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, good evening.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  While I was waiting for a chance to say a few words on the floor, I \nwas on the phone and had a conversation with someone who has run a \ncouple of very successful companies in our country. I do not know if he \nis a Democrat or a Republican, but it was an interesting conversation. \nWe talked about how the economy is coming along, and we talked about \nhow the companies he is especially interested in are doing. We sort of \nlooked ahead.\n  One of the things I asked is, what do you think we could be doing \nhere, where we are working in our Nation's Capital in the U.S. Senate?\n  He pretty much said there are three things we need to do. He said: \nYou need to answer maybe three questions for us. One, can you govern in \na divided Washington, a divided Congress? He said: No. 2, can you be--\ncan we be as a nation--fiscally responsible? And the third thing he \nsaid was, can you provide some certainty with respect to the Tax Code \nto actually know what taxes are going to look like, not just this week \nor this month or just this year, but how about having some certainty \ngoing forward?\n  I think there is a lot of wisdom in what he said. As some other folks \nhave been talking about here on the floor today, when we were not \npassing the Water Resources Development Act, a good bipartisan bill, I \nthink a responsible bill, an encouraging step, if you will, but in \nbetween we have had other people speak and talking about one side or \nthe other moving forward on a budget. Someone talked about other issues \nthat are in the news these days.\n  I want to follow up on some of the earlier conversations today with \nrespect to demonstrating that we can govern, that we can be fiscally \nresponsible and we can provide some certainty with respect to the Tax \nCode. Folks who might be listening in to what is going on in the Senate \nthis afternoon may or may not know the way the budget process works. \nObviously this is budget 101.\n  In my old role as State treasurer and Governor of Delaware--in \nDelaware we have two budgets. Not one but two budgets. We have an \noperating budget and we have a capital budget, a brick-and-mortar \nbudget. The brick-and-mortar budget is for schools, K-12, sort of \npostsecondary education; infrastructure: roads, highways, bridges, \nprisons, that kind of thing. But we have an operating budget as well. \nHere we only have one. For, gosh, I want to say about 30--40 years, \nactually, the way we are supposed to run our finances as a country \nbasically called for the President to submit a budget, usually in \nFebruary, one budget not two but one budget. The Congress is expected \nto come in and sort of pivot off of that budget and create what we call \na budget resolution. The Senate passes a budget resolution, the House \ndoes. The idea is to be able to do that sometime in April, and \nhopefully by the end of April agree between the House and Senate on \nthat budget resolution.\n  People think a budget resolution is a budget. But it is not. It is a \nresolution, a framework for a budget. It is not actually signed by the \nPresident. It is something we work out. It provides a foundation on \nwhich to pass a number of maybe a dozen or so appropriations bills that \ncover everything from agriculture to transportation.\n  The budget resolution provides a framework for any revenue measures \nwe might need to pass as well in order to get us closer to a balanced \nbudget or to meet some kind of responsibilities for running our \ncountry. But the idea is for the Senate to pass a budget resolution, \nthe House to pass a budget resolution, and we create a conference \ncommittee and work out our differences.\n  For the last 4 years, our friends in the Republican Party delighted \nin accusing the Democrats of never passing a budget. What they meant \nwas we never passed a budget resolution, that framework. I think of the \nbudget resolution as a skeleton. The skeleton is the bones, if you \nwill. But we put the meat on the bones when we pass the dozen or so \nappropriations bills, and whatever revenue measures are needed. That is \nthe meat on the bones. Then eventually we have a full budget.\n  Right now, as our colleagues know, we passed in the Senate a budget \nresolution several weeks ago. It called for deficit reduction. It did \nnot balance the budget over the next 10 years, but it further reduced \nthe budget deficit and put us on a path to stabilize our debt, and to \nget us on a trajectory where debt as a percentage of gross domestic \nproduct is starting to come down--not as much as I would like, probably \nnot as much as the Presiding Officer would like, but to get us headed \nin the right direction. It was a 50/50 deal, 50 percent deficit \nreduction on the spending side, 50 percent on the revenue side.\n  Actually, ironically, the last time we had a budget--1998, 1999, \n2000, 2001 in the Clinton administration--Erskine Bowles, then the \nPresident's Chief of Staff and a woman named Sylvia Matthews, now \nSylvia Matthews Burwell who is our new OMB Director, worked along with \nthe Republican House, Republican Senate to come up with a deficit \nreduction plan in 1997 that led to four balanced budgets in a row.\n\n[[Page S3521]]\n\n  Their deal, worked out with Republicans, was a 50/50 deal. Fifty \npercent of the deficit reduction was on the spending side, 50 percent \nwas on the revenue side. Anyway, this year the Senate passed a budget \nresolution, passed with all Democratic votes, no Republicans. It is a \n50/50 deal, half of the deficit reduction on spending, half on the \nrevenue side.\n  Over in the House, they have a different approach. The Republicans in \nthe House argue, with some justification, that they get more deficit \nreduction accomplished. You might quibble with some of their \nassumptions. They assume the repeal of ObamaCare. They also assume that \neven though they are going to repeal it, the $1 trillion in deficit \nreduction that CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, says flows from \nObamaCare over the next 10 years in the Affordable Care Act--even \nthough they assume repealing ObamaCare, they still assume the $1 \ntrillion in deficit reduction. I do not know if that is entirely \nconsistent, but that is part of their assumption. So they end up with \ndeficit reduction that is dependent solely on the spending side. No \nrevenues, it is all on the spending side.\n  So they passed their budget resolution. We passed ours. They passed \ntheirs with almost all Republican votes, we passed ours with all \nDemocratic votes. When that happens, the idea is to say, here is the \nSenate budget resolution, here is the House budget resolution. Why \ndon't we create a conference committee--I used to think of it as a \ncompromise committee--where some of the Senators, Democrat and \nRepublican, gather together and work out the differences between the \ntwo budget resolutions. That is what people sent us here to do.\n  The Presiding Officer knows I like to sometimes ask people who have \nbeen married a long time, what is the secret for being married a long \ntime? I usually ask this to people who have been married 50, 60, or 70 \nyears. I get some real funny answers. I got a great answer about a week \nago. A couple has been married 55 years. I asked the wife and husband. \nI said to the wife: What is the secret to being married 55 years?\n  She looked at her husband, and she said, he will tell you that he can \neither be right or he can be happy, but he cannot be both. I thought \nthat was pretty funny. He said something to the effect of, when you \nknow you are wrong, admit it. When you know you are right, let it go. \nThat is pretty good advice.\n  I think the best answer I ever heard to that question of what is the \nsecret to being married a long time--I have heard this from a number of \npeople. The answer is the two Cs, communicate and compromise. Think \nabout that. The two Cs, communicate and compromise. I think that is not \nonly the secret to an enduring union between two people, but I think it \nis also the secret to a vibrant democracy, communicate and compromise.\n\n  It is kind of ironic that our Republican friends, after beating us \nover the head for 4 years for not supposedly passing a budget--although \nif you looked at what we put in place, some of the legislation was law; \nwe actually did have a budget. We had spending caps and directions to \nreduce spending in a lot of different categories. We saved in deficit \nreduction well over $1 trillion as a result.\n  But, ironically, the very people who criticized us for not passing a \nbudget have now, here in the Senate, made it impossible for us to \ncreate that conference committee, a compromise committee between the \nHouse and the Senate, and take the next logical step of reconciling the \ndifferences between the Senate-passed budget resolution and the \nHouse's.\n  It is not going to be easy to do that, but we need to get started. If \nyou think about the way we spend money--I want to commend the chair of \nthe Budget Committee. She has had some very sad losses in her family. \nWe extend our sympathy there. I want to commend the Senator and her \ncommittee for taking on a tough job, one of many tough jobs she has \ntaken on, and to give us a budget resolution that we can go to \nconference with. I want to have a chance to do that.\n  I want to mention this and I will yield. We had a bunch of Realtors \nin from Delaware. They wanted to talk about the budget and how we are \ndoing. I explained that if you think of the Federal budget, think of it \nas a pie, think of it like a pizza pie or a chocolate pie, but think of \nit as a pie. The way I explained this is, over half of that pie is \nentitlement program spending. That is things we are entitled to by \nvirtue of our age, our station in life, our service, Medicare, \nMedicaid, Social Security, some of our veterans' benefits. But over \nhalf of the budget of that pie for spending, over half of it is \nentitlement spending and it is growing.\n  Another roughly 10 to 15 percent of that pie is interest on the debt. \nWith the debt growing, interest on the debt--thank God the interest \nrates are low right now or that would go through the roof. Interest on \nthe debt continues to maybe creep up. If you add those two together, it \nis about 70 percent of the pie we are thinking about.\n  That leaves another 30 percent. What is in the remaining 30 percent? \nThe rest of the whole Federal Government. About half of that 30 percent \nis defense. About half of that 30 percent is everything else from \nagriculture to transportation and everything in between--law \nenforcement, courts, Federal prisons, the FBI, education, housing, \nenvironment. Everything else is in that 15 percent.\n  The difference between the Senate-passed budget resolution and the \nHouse-passed budget resolution is the House would make some changes in \nentitlement spending. We do some of that as well. We do more to try to \nreduce spending. But the real difference is what happens with that 15 \npercent of--we call it domestic discretionary spending. The other 15 \npercent in discretionary spending is defense.\n  But they would take, in their budget resolution in the House, that 15 \npercent over the next 10 years and take it down to roughly 5 percent--5 \npercent. That is everything in the Federal Government other than \ndefense and entitlements and interest. That is everything else. That \nincludes workforce development, starting with early childhood education \nprograms, Head Start, all the way from kindergarten up to high school; \nprograms especially promoting the education in STEM, science, \ntechnology, engineering and math, postsecondary education. It includes \ninfrastructure; roads, highways, bridges, everything broadly defined in \ninfrastructure. It includes investments in research and development \nthat can create products and technologies that can be commercialized \nand sold all over the world. All of that stuff is the rest of 15 \npercent and it goes down to about 5 percent.\n  I do not think that is smart. I do not think that is smart for \ngrowing the economic pie because of things--the areas we need to invest \nin or look for. We need a world-class workforce. No. 2, we need \nterrific infrastructure, much better than our decaying infrastructure. \nThe third thing we need is to invest in R that can be commercialized \nand turned into products.\n  In any event, we have a difference in priorities here. The Senate-\npassed budget resolution is not perfect, but I think it is a very good \ndocument and a good starting point. The Republicans have their ideas, \nsome with merit, some not. But the next thing we need to do is we need \nto meet. We need to create that conference committee and we need to go \nto work and let the chair of the committee and her counterpart over \nhere, Senator Sessions, do their job, along with their House \ncounterparts. But they cannot do their job until Republicans in the \nSenate agree to form a conference committee and go to conference. We \nneed that to happen. Rather than just talking about and pointing \nfingers at one another, we actually need to do that. We need to stop \npointing fingers, join hands, and see if we cannot work this out.\n  I yield the floor again, with my thanks to Senator Murray for the \nleadership she continues to provide for all of us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minute as in morning business, and following me, the Senator from \nRhode Island will speak for 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Delaware \nwho spoke about the fact that we are\n\n[[Page S3522]]\n\nnow 53 days since passing the Senate budget. We are pushing very hard \nas Democrats to keep this process moving and get our budget to a \nconference committee. I appreciate his coming out and explaining why \nthat is so important. I agree with him.\n  We believe with all the urgent challenges we face today, there is \nevery reason to get to work right away on a bipartisan budget deal. \nThere is no reason to delay this until the next crisis. But we have \ncome out here now seven times and asked for consent to go to conference \nto work on the budget with the House, and seven times the Senate \nRepublicans have stood and said, no, we do not want to go to work on \nthe budget.\n  Given how much Senate Republicans have talked about regular order \nover the last several years, we are rather surprised on this side that \nthey are now resisting this very important next step in this bipartisan \nnegotiation. By the way, it is not just Democrats who are saying they \nwant to go to conference. There are quite a few Senate Republicans who \nare surprised, as we are, that they are not allowing us to go.\n  My colleague Senator McCain said blocking conference is \n``incomprehensible'' and ``insane.'' Senator Corker said that to ``keep \nfrom appointing conferees is not consistent.'' Senator Flake said he \n``would like to see a conference now.''\n  I sincerely hope the Republican leaders in the Senate will listen to \nthe Members of their own party, because we have a lot of problems to \nsolve and we have to get started. Our children today, young adults, \nneed a world-class education to succeed in the global economy they are \nentering. Many of them are graduating in the next several weeks. Too \nmany Americans are out of work yet or still underemployed. Our national \ninfrastructure is quickly becoming an obstacle rather than an asset to \nour competitiveness.\n  We need to do more to responsibly tackle our long-term deficit and \ndebt challenges and make our Tax Code work better for our middle class. \nThe debate about all of those challenges couldn't be more important. We \nshould start working toward a bipartisan budget deal that works for our \nfamilies, our economy. We should do it as soon as possible and engage \nthe American people in a thorough and responsible debate.\n  That is why I, frankly, was very disappointed to see that today, \ninstead of meeting to discuss moving toward a bipartisan conference \nbetween the House and Senate, House Republicans are meeting to discuss \nwhat they will ask for in exchange for not tanking the economy a couple \nof months from now.\n  Instead of moving with us toward the middle and joining us at the \ntable ready to compromise, they spent their afternoon debating what to \nwrite on a ransom note and saying if they don't get what they want, \nthey are going to allow the United States to default. That is an \nunprecedented event that would devastate our entire economy.\n  I think a lot of families across our country are very concerned that \nHouse Republicans haven't learned any lessons at all from the past 2 \nyears, and that we are looking at more brinkmanship, more governing by \ncrisis, and more harm for our American families and our businesses.\n  House Republicans are even telling us they are willing to put foreign \ncreditors before our seniors, our veterans, and our businesses and \nclaiming that somehow this plan will protect the economy.\n  That is absurd. A default is a default. If the Federal Government \npays its foreign creditors--but defaults on its obligations to our \nfamilies and our communities--the results are going to be catastrophic. \nRating agencies would rightly see that as a serious abdication of our \nresponsibility. Our fragile economy would be seriously threatened, and \npeople across the country would lose their faith again in our \ngovernment's ability to function.\n  Fortunately, I hope and think it will not come to all of that. \nRepublicans have been saying default would be a ``financial disaster'' \nfor the global economy and ``you can't not raise the debt ceiling.'' A \nfew months ago, Republicans acknowledged how dangerous it would be to \nplay games with the debt limit and how politically damaging it would be \nto play politics with the potential economic calamity and dropped their \ndemands.\n  What has changed since then? Why are Republicans once again issuing \nthis empty threat that does nothing more than rattle the markets and \nincrease uncertainty across our country. Maybe the House Republicans \nthink since we won't hit the debt ceiling until later than we \noriginally expected, there could be less pressure to get a deal and \nmore opportunity for them to extract some kind of political concession.\n  That is exactly the wrong way to look at this because even if we know \nthey are going to reverse course eventually, the Republican strategy of \nholding our economy hostage and creating this uncertainty again and \ntrying to push us toward another crisis has terrible consequences. All \nof us remember the summer of 2011 when extreme elements in the \nRepublican Party demanded economically damaging policies, leading to a \ndowngrade of our Nation's credit.\n  Economic growth and job creation slowed to a halt, consumer \nconfidence plummeted, and out of that summer came sequestration. That \nwas a policy that was meant to serve only as a trigger and, in fact, \nwas only implemented because Republicans were focused on protecting the \nwealthiest Americans and biggest corporations from paying even a penny \nmore in taxes rather than working with us on a deal to prevent \nsequester.\n  Now what do we have? Sequestration. It is forcing families and \ncommunities across the country to cope with layoffs and cuts to \nservices they count on, things such as childcare and public safety. \nYesterday, we learned that DOD civilian employees, many of whom are \nveterans, by the way, are going to be furloughed.\n  We have to replace sequestration. We need to do it with a balanced \nand responsible deficit reduction plan, but we also have to stop \nlurching from crisis to crisis that allows those kinds of policies to \nbe enacted. There is absolutely no reason to double down on an approach \nthat has those kinds of effects on the families and communities we \nserve and on those who bravely served our country.\n  Contrary to what we are now, unfortunately, hearing from the House, I \nbelieve with more time to reach a fair and bipartisan agreement we have \nall the more reason for us to move to a conference quickly and get a \nbudget agreement. Let's get to work. Our country's challenges--rather \nthan a looming artificial deadline or crisis--should guide this debate, \nand it shouldn't be controversial. There are responsible Senate leaders \non both sides of the aisle who agree.\n  I hope Senate Republicans will listen to members of their own party \nwho are calling for a conference and bring us one step closer to \nnegotiating a bipartisan budget deal in a responsible way instead of \ninsisting that we run down the clock.\n  I know there are factions in our government that believe compromise \nis a dirty word and that getting a deal will not be easy, but I \ncontinue to believe it can and needs to be done because alongside those \nwho refuse to compromise there are responsible leaders who came here to \nshow Americans that their government works. It would be deeply \nirresponsible for the House to continue delaying a conference and for \nSenate Republicans to continue to cover for them, especially if they \nare doing it for political reasons or to keep the negotiations out of \nthe public eye or to, what I have heard, avoid taking a few tough \nvotes.\n  I urge Republican colleagues to reconsider their approach. Join us in \na budget conference ready to compromise and work with us toward a \nbipartisan deal the American people deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senator Reed \nis speaking next. I would like to ask that I be recognized as in \nmorning business at the conclusion of his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. First, Mr. President, let me rise to commend Senator Murray \nfor her extraordinary leadership on the Budget Committee and in so many \nother ways in the Senate. She did a remarkable job in bringing together \na\n\n[[Page S3523]]\n\nbudget that responds to the urgent need we see in the United States \ntoday to create jobs, to strengthen the economic recovery and, in fact, \nto provide more momentum to this recovery, much more.\n  In my State of Rhode Island, despite certain gains, we are still at \nroughly 9 percent unemployment. This is unacceptable. We have to do \nmore.\n  The first step on that path is to move this budget to conference. \nThat is what Senator Murray has spoken about, and that is what is so \ncritical. Fifty-three days ago, under her leadership, the Senate passed \na budget. The budget invested $100 billion in a targeted jobs and \ninfrastructure package that would start creating new jobs quickly. And \nthat is what my constituents need. Indeed, when I go back to Rhode \nIsland that is what people are asking about: Where are the jobs?\n  The budget would begin, in this jobs and infrastructure package, to \nrepair public roads, bridges, and help prepare workers for the 21st \ncentury. All of these things are essential to our present economic need \nfor job creation, our future productivity, and our future ability to \ncompete in an increasingly competitive global economy. Our budget path, \nas laid out by Senator Murray, would end the economically damaging \nsequester and make the tough and balanced choices we need for sound \nfiscal policies.\n  Now the House Republicans also passed a budget. The next step in \nregular order is to go to conference. Admittedly, the House Republican \nbudget stands in stark contrast to our budget, and it is clear we have \na lot of work to do to reach an agreement. For example, the House \nRepublican budget calls for a total of $4.6 trillion in cuts, it \nvoucherizes Medicare, it would leave the sequester in place, and it \ncalls for tax cuts that benefit the wealthiest Americans.\n  I believe these and other choices in the House Republican budget \nwould be a very bad deal for the people of Rhode Island. These are the \nkinds of differences that must be and can only be resolved effectively \nin conference. Again, the first step to do that is to appoint our \nconferees, to go to conference, and to begin the difficult discussions \nand negotiations to provide the American public the answers they are \nlooking for.\n  So it is past time we move to conference with the House. And I hope \nthere is a real chance that Senate and House Democrats can negotiate a \nbipartisan agreement with our Republican colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives, and with our Republican colleagues in the Senate that \nwill move the country forward.\n  Unfortunately, despite the insistence over months and months and \nmonths by Republicans in the House and in the Senate that we go to \nregular order, that we pass a budget--that was the biggest problem they \nwere talking about for many months, last year and the year before. Now \nhere we are looking for regular order, and they are looking the other \nway and block us from moving forward and conferencing the Senate and \nHouse budgets. That can't go on. We have to get to conference. We have \nto take the next step.\n  We can't delay. We have 11.7 million Americans out of work and \nlooking for jobs. We have to address the sequester.\n  As Senator Murray just said, yesterday the Secretary of Defense \nannounced hundreds of thousands of civilian personnel will be \nfurloughed, civilian personnel that support from our military forces. \nThat will not only disrupt their lives, which is the first great toll, \nbut it will also disrupt the efficiency and the ability of the \nDepartment of Defense to fully and capably carry out its mission. These \nare critical issues.\n  We have to make sure, again, that the full faith and credit of the \nUnited States is not jeopardized by another manufactured crisis over \nthe debt ceiling, which is once again on the horizon.\n  We have to deal very soon with all of these issues. The logical and \nappropriate step is to go to conference. We have a lot of work to do.\n  Let me also say I am encouraged that I have heard that Leader Reid is \nprepared to call up for a vote the nomination of Richard Cordray to \nhead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This is critical because \na well-regulated marketplace is not only good for consumers, it is good \nfor companies. That is something that could add to this economic \nrecovery, this certainty, this knowledge that consumers will have the \ninformation they need.\n  Also, I presume and hope that very soon we will have a vote with \nrespect to the pending doubling of the student loan interest rate. Last \nyear we avoided this by pushing it forward a year. We have another \ndeadline facing us July 1. We have to make sure students don't face \nanother crippling increase in interest rates they pay on student loans.\n  Student loans are a huge burden on the generations that are coming \nup. In fact, it could delay our economic progress by a decade or more \nas students can't buy homes and form households because they are \nsaddled with the debt. So we have to work on that too. We just can't \nlurch from crisis to crisis.\n  The first thing to do, the immediate thing we should do, is to invoke \nregular order. Let's go ahead, let's go to conference. Let's start \ndealing with the issues that affect the people of America. Let's start \nserving their primary concerns--creating jobs and a stable economy--and \ndoing that through regular order and the procedures that we have \nadopted and used for decades.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Agreement--S. 954\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Monday, May \n20, at a time to be determined by me, after consultation with Senator \nMcConnell, the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 73, \nS. 954.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                   Iran Sanctions Implementation Act\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is very rare that we have an \nopportunity to do something that is in the benefit of our country in \nterms of our protection. It doesn't cost anything. If anything, it \nmakes money, and it is something I am going to share. It is a bill I \nintroduced today, which is S. 965.\n  Let me give a little background to let you know why we are \nintroducing this bill and why the Iran Sanctions Implementation Act of \n2013 is significant.\n  First of all, it is imperative that we know, because most people \ndon't understand this, that Iran's source of revenue comes from oil \nexports. This is something that one of our fine Senators has had as one \nof his efforts, to come up with something that is going to effectively \nembargo the country of Iran.\n  We have a lot of countries, for example, that we don't import \nanything from, but they do have a very large supply of oil. To date, \nIran is exporting about 1.25 million barrels of oil. That amounts to \nsomewhere in the neighborhood of $100 million a day or about $3 billion \na month.\n  The influence of Iran is something throughout the Middle East, and it \nranges from Yemen all the way to Sudan, to Hamas, to Hezbollah, to \nLebanon, and, of course, to Syria. One of the concerns I have had for a \nlong period of time is that Iran--one of the things the President did \nthat I think we are going to live to regret is 4 years ago he did away \nwith our ground-based interceptor in Poland. And when this happened, \nthat was set up to knock down missiles that might be coming from the \neast into the United States.\n\n  We have 44 ground-based interceptors on the west coast, and I am \ncomfortable we can knock down anything coming from that way, but from \nthe east, we don't. It would take maybe one shot--it would have to be a \nfortunate one--from the west coast.\n  Anyway, the reason I bring this up and why it is pertinent to the \nlegislation we are introducing right now is that our intelligence has \nshown us since 2007 that Iran is going to have the bomb--the weapon, \nthe nuclear capability--and the delivery system to send something from \nIran by 2015.\n  If we had stayed with our effort to have the radar in the Czech \nRepublic and the ground-based interceptor in Poland, we would be well \nprepared to protect ourselves. However, that is not the case. So I look \nat Iran--and a lot of people don't agree with this; I may be the only \none who will say this--as the greatest threat we have in the Middle \nEast. We all talk about Syria and the problems taking place in Syria--\nthe 70,000 people who have been the victims\n\n[[Page S3524]]\n\nof Assad's barbaric slaughter of his own people--but we know that \nIran--the Iranian security and intelligence services--is propping up \nthe Assad regime by advising and assisting the Syrian military forces, \nproviding essential, lethal military supplies and progovernment \nmilitary.\n  I am going to read something now that I just received to quantify how \nmuch Iran is doing to assist Syria. This was in the Economist magazine. \nIt said:\n\n       Iran reportedly sent $9 billion to Assad to see it through \n     sanctions on Syria.\n\n  In other words, several countries, including us, had sanctions on \nSyria, and this is one reason we were sending money over there. That \ntells us our sanctions on Iran are not nearly as tight as they should \nbe. And that was in the Economist. So it is very serious.\n  Lebanese Hezbollah, Iran's proxy, is participating in a direct combat \nrole aligned with Iranian strategic interests in Syria, and we know \nSyria provides crucial access to Iranian proxies that include \nHezbollah, Hamas, and the Palestinian Islamic jihad. Iran is continuing \nan extensive, expensive, and integrated effort to maintain Syria as a \nbase for fomenting future regional instability.\n  Iran is all in in Syria, as evidenced by the frequent presence on the \nground in Syria of Iranian force commander Major General Qassem \nSuleimani. Suleimani is on the U.S. Treasury and U.S. Security \nCouncil's watch lists for alleged involvement in terrorist activity and \nproliferation of nuclear missile technology. So this is how serious \nthat situation is over there.\n  A subordinate of Suleimani, Brigadier General Hassan Shateri, was a \nsenior Iranian commander who was killed in the Damascus countryside. \nThe death of Iranian generals on Syrian soil is a strong indication of \nIran's commitment to the regime.\n  Further, we know Iran has supplied Syria with ballistic missiles and \nchemical weapons, and the Assad regime in Syria, which is presently the \ngreatest threat to stability in the Middle East, is being propped up by \nIran. Iran is able to do this because it earns $3 billion a month in \noil revenue. Now, if Iran--and this is a key point--did not have access \nto this money, its ability to influence the region would be \nsignificantly curtailed. In other words, they cannot pose a threat \nwithout their oil revenues.\n  So the reason we have the threat from and the problems we have in \nSyria is because of the money that is being sent to Syria, and the \nsource of that money is oil revenue, and it shows that the effort we \nhave made in Iran is not really enough because they have access to that \nmany resources.\n  Fortunately, the international community has generally recognized \nthis. Last year Senator Kirk of Illinois led the Senate in the \nconsideration of sanctions against Iran's oil trade. At that time Iran \nexported 2\\1/2\\ million barrels of oil a day, and Senator Kirk sought \nan outright global embargo against Iranian oil. During the debate, \nhowever, many members of the international community stated they would \nnot be able to wean themselves off of Iranian oil quickly enough to \ncomply with the sanctions without causing a significant shock to oil \nprices and, in turn, their economies. So these are countries that would \nlike to have complied with sanctions against Iran, but they felt it was \nnot in their best interests to do so. So the sanctions were amended to \nrequire the international community to significantly reduce its \nreliance on Iranian oil.\n  That legislation passed through the Senate, and Iran's oil exports \nhave since fallen by about half. So instead of the 2\\1/2\\ million \nbarrels a day going out, it is down to 1\\1/4\\ million--about half. This \nis a significant reduction, but with the Iranian regime intent on \nharming the United States and our allies, we have to do all we can to \ntighten sanctions and more fully isolate them.\n  Our Nation doesn't import oil from Iran, and we haven't for a number \nof years. We embargoed them a long time ago. But despite our abundant \nuntapped natural resources, we remain the largest oil importer in the \nworld, and so we have a strong role to play in making the Iran oil \nembargo as effective as possible.\n  Natural gas has always been a major U.S. energy resource, but it was \njust a few years ago that the energy industry believed the United \nStates was on the verge of becoming a major natural gas importer. \nPermits were issued and facilities were under construction to handle \nthe massive amounts of natural gas we were expecting to import to meet \nthe domestic energy demand. Then came the development of two critical \ntechnologies. One is horizontal drilling, and the other is, of course, \nsomething we have known about for a long time--hydraulic fracturing.\n  Hydraulic fracturing was actually developed in the State of \nOklahoma--in Duncan, OK, where I will actually be this coming weekend--\nway back in 1949. By the way, it is very safe. There has never been a \nconfirmed case of groundwater contamination using hydraulic fracturing. \nBut when all this came about, all of a sudden we had a huge boom here \nin the United States. This is all on private land. I want to make that \nvery clear. Because the oil and gas industry developed and perfected \nthese methods, which are environmentally safe, we are now able to \neconomically reach oil and natural gas in places we never thought would \nbe possible, and production has skyrocketed.\n  Harold Hamm, who I think arguably is the most successful independent \noil operator in America today, is from Oklahoma. He happens to be up in \nNorth Dakota right now, but he has been at the forefront of these \ntechnologies and has used them to unlock the Bakken shale formation in \nNorth Dakota. And that is where he is actually at this time.\n  Before these practices were used there, oil development was expected \nto remain just a memory of the past, but with these technologies, he \nhas turned North Dakota into one of the greatest economic success \nstories in the Nation. The change has been remarkable, and it occurred \nnearly overnight. North Dakota has grown its oil production by 300 \npercent, to 660,000 barrels of oil a day in just 4 years. The \nunemployment rate in North Dakota is 3.3 percent. Normally, we say 4 \npercent unemployment is full employment. Well, they are actually below \nfull employment. His biggest problem right now is finding people to \nwork. A driver in the oilfields makes $100,000 a year. This is what is \nhappening in North Dakota.\n\n  The promise of shale oil and gas development has spread well beyond \nNorth Dakota in recent years. It is happening in my State of Oklahoma, \nin Pennsylvania.\n  Let's put this chart up here. That is significant. I can remember \nuntil recently people were thinking everything has to be in the oil \nbelt. All the oil production has to be west of the Mississippi. But \nlook at it now. This is in the lower 48 States. The shale plays that \nare taking place now are in places, yes, of course, where we would \nexpect it, in Oklahoma, but look up here. That is in Pennsylvania. That \nis up there at Marcellus. And we have opportunities all over. So it is \ncompletely all over the country, not just in the western part of the \nUnited States. Where oil and gas activities have historically been \nisolated to just a few regions of the country, such as Oklahoma and \nTexas, they are now all over the country. Because of these great \ndomestic resources, I believe we can achieve domestic independence in a \nmatter of months.\n  The use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has caused \ndomestic energy production to soar over the last few years. Production \nis now over 7 million barrels a day--40 percent higher than it was in \n2008. But, as the Congressional Research Service recently confirmed, \nall of this production is on State and private land--none of it on \nFederal land. In fact, on Federal land, in spite of the boom that has \nbeen taking place, production has actually been reduced because of \nPresident Obama's war on fossil fuels. Production has actually been \nreduced on Federal lands, and that is kind of embarrassing because we \ncan see on the second chart that a significant amount of our Nation's \noil and gas resources are on Federal land, which are all but completely \noff limits.\n  This chart shows the Federal lands. They are not producing on any of \nthese Federal lands, but look at the potential that is there and what \nwe could do. It is incredible to look at. You can look at all of this \nland in the Montana west, in Alaska, offshore. The yellow land is\n\n[[Page S3525]]\n\nthe Bureau of Land Management land, the orange is the Fish and Wildlife \nland, the light green is the Forest Service land, the dark green is the \nNational Park Service, and the light blue is the Department of Defense. \nAll of the Outer Continental Shelf is managed by the Federal \nGovernment, and oil is under many of these places, but the vast \nmajority of it is locked up by the Obama administration and no one can \nget to it.\n  We know the resources are there. They are massive. Everyone has \nagreed it is there. The Institute of Energy Research recently issued a \nreport based on the most recent, though outdated, government data about \nthese off-limit lands and showed that if we enacted policies that \nallowed aggressive development of these Federal resources, the process \nwould generate $14.4 trillion in economic activity and would create \n2\\1/2\\ million jobs and reduce the deficit by $2.7 trillion, all over \nthe next 40 years.\n  Why is this land locked up? One answer is because of President Obama. \nHe has allowed his alliance with the environmental left to run \nroughshod over issues as important as encouraging stability in the \nMiddle East through a full isolation of Iran.\n  If the President would lead, the United States, acting independently, \nwithout any assistance from any other nation, could singlehandedly \noffset all of Iran's oil exports by simply expanding our own domestic \nproduction on Federal lands.\n  This is why I have introduced this Iran Sanctions Implementation Act \nof 2013. My bill would require the President to establish Iranian oil \nreplacement zones on Federal lands so that the production from these \nzones will reach the 1\\1/4\\ million barrels of oil a day. This amount, \n1.25 million barrels a day, is what Iran is exporting at the current \ntime.\n\n  Here is the point. The reason we are talking about coming up with a \nvery small amount is, if the President wants to continue his war on \nfossil fuels, that is fine, if he doesn't want to develop our potential \npublic lands. But if he could take a very small amount, such as 1.25 \nmillion barrels of oil a day--and do it anywhere, give him the \ndiscretion as to where he wants to do this--it could be here if he \nwants to do it out in the West, or ANWR up in Alaska, it could be over \nthere or offshore on the east coast. By the way, that is off the shore \nof Virginia, and Virginia wants to be able to develop that land.\n  This is enough oil to fully offset all current Iranian oil exports. \nIf the President unlocks our energy potential and allows the production \nof an additional 1.25 million barrels a day in the United States, we \nwould reduce our imports by the same amount. If we are not importing \nthis oil to the United States, then other nations--these are the \nnations that are currently importing it from Iran--would be able to \nimport it from those places where we no longer would have to.\n  There are friendly countries--Saudi Arabia, Kuwait--where we are \nactually importing oil. But they would be able to sell their oil to the \nother countries, our friends, such as Japan and other countries.\n  What we are saying is we have an opportunity here. When you look at \nthese areas, you can see why it should be pretty easy for the \nadministration to allow us to open one of these areas. The first one \nwould be ANWR, this right up in Alaska. You can see four potential \nareas, the first being ANWR. The U.S. Geological Survey reported, in a \n1998 study, the latest comprehensive study of its kind, that the oil \nreserves there are up to 16 million barrels of oil per day.\n  Imagine what we are talking about there. We are only talking about \ncoming with 1.25 million barrels to offset the amount other countries \nare importing from Iran, to stop them from doing it. It doesn't require \nthe President to make this area an Iranian oil replacement zone, but it \nwould allow him to do it. This would provide enough oil to offset \nIranian oil exports for about 12,000 days or about 35 years.\n  The second is the Rocky Mountain West--parts of Wyoming, parts of \nUtah, and parts of Colorado. In 2005 the RAND Corporation estimated \nthat oil shale reserves in this area could be as high as 1.8 trillion \nbarrels of oil.\n  The third is the Utica shale in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania--I hear a \nlot about the Marcellus up there. We are talking about oil now. We are \nnot talking about natural gas. We are talking about oil. But USGS \nestimated in 2011 that the reserves in this region are up to 940 \nmillion barrels of unconventional oil.\n  The fourth area is the Outer Continental Shelf. I mentioned North \nCarolina and Virginia. Their legislatures have all encouraged their \nproduction. They have a lot they can benefit from. Of course \nnationally--in national security we have a lot to benefit from, too.\n  With all those areas, if we stop the flow of oil from Iran, then we \ncan stop the machine that finances Iran's nuclear weapons program. Many \nsay that getting oil from the Rocky Mountains, Alaska, Outer \nContinental Shelf, will take years. By then Iran will not be a problem. \nBut it doesn't take years to get it out.\n  I mentioned a while ago Harold Hamm, the person who is the biggest \nindependent in the country. I called him up because I was going to be \non a major television show one night and I knew they were going to \nchallenge me. The President has always said it doesn't do any good to \nopen up public lands because if you do that it could take 10 years \nbefore that could reach the economy. I asked him, I said: Harold Hamm, \nmake sure you give me an accurate response to what I am going to ask \nyou because I am going to use your name on national TV. Make sure you \nare accurate. If you had a rig set up right now, off limits on public \nland, in New Mexico, how long would it take you to lift the first \nbarrel of oil and get it into the economy?\n  He said, without a flinch: Seventy days.\n  I said: Seventy days? We are talking about 10 weeks, not 10 years.\n  So he described what would happen each day. You could do it in 10 \nweeks. We are talking about all of this could take place in 10 weeks.\n  By the way, I have to say no one has challenged me on this ever since \nI used his name and his speculation a few weeks ago.\n  I know this is a little bit complicated, but there is another reason. \nThe reason I think the President would be willing to do something like \nthis is we are not asking him to lift the restrictions on all of the \npublic land. It would be great if he did that. Just think, we would be \ntotally independent of any other country for our ability to develop our \nown energy. But we are saying find a zone where we can actually pick up \nan additional 1.25 million barrels a day. We can take that away from \nwhere we are currently importing it from friendly countries and allow \nthem to export it to nations that are currently buying oil from Iran.\n  I think we have made it very clear that if you want to do something \nthat is going to have the effect of stability in the Middle East, you \nhave to get rid of Iran. As I said before, Iran is a direct threat to \nthe United States once they reach what our intelligence says is going \nto be a nuclear capability and a delivery capability by 2015.\n  Over and above that, today we could stop them because 70 percent of \ntheir revenue comes from oil exports. We could stop the exports \naltogether with this legislation. That is something I certainly hope \nthe President will look at. We are not asking for hundreds and hundreds \nof millions of barrels a day to be released from our Federal sources. \nWe are asking only for 1.5 million barrels a day. On top of that, we \ndon't have any obligation with this legislation to go any further. This \nwould be something he could do that would provide stability in the \nMiddle East and would keep Iran from funding the terrorist activity \nthat is currently taking place by Asad in Syria.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich).

Mr. President, Food Allergy Awareness Week recognizes how\n\n[[Page S3526]]\n\nserious and how wide spread food allergies are in this country. One in \nevery 13 children in the United States is affected by a life-\nthreatening food allergy. According to the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention, food allergy reactions send someone to the emergency \nroom every 3 minutes.\n  The rising prevalence of food allergies is an important public health \nissue that is already felt in schools, restaurants, and workplaces \nacross the country. According to the National Institutes of Allergy and \nInfectious Disease, food allergies cause 30,000 cases of anaphylaxis \nand more than 200 deaths every year. We need to support research to \ndevelop new therapies and understanding to ultimately prevent and cure \nfood allergies.\n  As the number of kids living with dangerous and in some cases deadly \nfood allergy attacks at school has increased, some States and cities \nhave responded by improving access to epinephrine auto-injectors as an \nimportant strategy to respond safely and quickly when students \nexperience anaphylaxis. While many children with known food allergies \nare permitted to bring their epinephrine auto-injectors to school, 25 \npercent of epinephrine administrations in schools involve individuals \nwithout a previously known allergy. Many students who will need \nepinephrine have no history of food allergies and therefore do not \ncarry epinephrine. Further, schools provide a setting where children \nare exposed to new foods that may trigger severe allergy attacks. \nTherefore, the decision for schools to stock their own epinephrine can \nbe lifesaving.\n  I commend the state of Illinois for being a leader in this fight and \npassing legislation in 2011 to allow schools to stock emergency \nepinephrine auto-injectors. Last Congress, I worked with my colleague, \nSenator Kirk, to introduce legislation that would encourage states to \nrequire schools to stock epinephrine and to allow trained designated \npersonnel to administer epinephrine in an emergency.\n  My hope is that Food Allergy Awareness Week can help the public to \nappreciate the extent of the problem and, importantly, the severity of \nthe disease. It is a health threat that affects every race, age, income \ngroup and geographic area, and is growing at a frightening pace. What \nthe public increasingly needs to understand is that this is not simply \nan inconvenient condition. As the tragic deaths of children each year \nshow, it is frequently a life-threatening disease. Food Allergy \nAwareness Week is a first step to a better understanding and a greater \ncommitment to our response.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/15/senate-section/article/S3526-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         BROTHERHOOD OF LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS 150TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a group of \nAmerican workers celebrating an impressive anniversary this month.\n  On July 1, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Pacific \nRailroad Act into law and set the Nation on a course to complete the \ntranscontinental railroad.\n  Less than a year later, in 1863, the Brotherhood of Locomotive \nEngineers and Trainmen was founded to represent the thousands of \nindividuals working to build one of the largest infrastructure projects \nin the history of this country.\n  In the century and a half since, the rail industry has served as the \nlifeblood of rural America, a critical player in our Nation's \ntransportation network, and as one of the largest private employers in \nthe United States.\n  My home State of Illinois, both then and now, has relied heavily on \nstrong rail infrastructure to propel us forward. From my hometown of \nEast St. Louis and across our State, railroads have written our \nhistory.\n  As one of the first States in the union to embrace freight rail and \nrail travel, we saw Chicago grow, spoke by spoke and mile after \nmagnificent mile, into the metropolis it is today. And with more lines \nof track radiating in more directions than anywhere else in the Nation, \nit's hard to imagine our great city without its railroads.\n  Even today, we are continuing our long tradition with the \nconstruction of a high-speed rail network that is both innovative and \nimportant to Illinois' economy and future competitiveness. But without \nthe workers who construct, operate and maintain it, that high-speed \nnetwork likely would not be possible.\n  One hundred-fifty years after its birth, the Brotherhood's 55,000 \nactive and retired members continue to devote their lives to the rail \nindustry and improving the American transportation system.\n  That's an impressive achievement, and I hope my colleagues will join \nme in recognizing their hard work as the Brotherhood of Locomotive \nEngineers and Trainmen's celebrates its 150th anniversary. Thank you \nand congratulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/15/senate-section/article/S3526-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Ms. WARREN.

Mr. President, today I honor an outstanding leader and \npublic servant. After over 30 years of service to our Nation both in \nand out of uniform, Secretary Michael Donley is retiring from his \ncurrent position as Secretary of the U.S. Air Force. On this occasion, \nI believe it is fitting to recognize Secretary Donley's years of \nservice to our great Nation.\n  Mr. Donley has over 30 years of experience in the national security \ncommunity, including service in the Senate, White House, and the \nPentagon, as well as in the private sector. Mr. Donley served in the \nU.S. Army from 1972 to 1975 with the XVIIIth Airborne Corps and 5th \nSpecial Forces Group, Airborne. He was also a professional staff member \non the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. Donley supported two Presidents and five National Security \nAdvisers during his service at the National Security Council from 1984 \nto 1989. He conceived and organized the President's Blue Ribbon \nCommission on Defense Management, coordinated White House policy on the \nGoldwater-Nichols DOD Reorganization Act of 1986, and wrote the \nnational security strategy for President Reagan's second term. Prior to \nassuming his current position, Mr. Donley served as the Director of \nAdministration and Management in the Office of the Secretary of \nDefense.\n  Air Force Secretary Michael Donley will retire from public service \nJune 21, after nearly 5 years in the position. Prior to his \nconfirmation as the Secretary of the Air Force, he served as Acting \nSecretary--making him the longest serving Secretary of the Air Force in \nthe service's history.\n  Secretary Michael Donley's leadership will be missed throughout the \ngovernment. I join many past and present members of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee in my gratitude to Secretary Donley for his \noutstanding leadership and his unwavering support of servicemembers. \nSecretary Donley's\n\n[[Page S3527]]\n\nservice has enabled the Air Force to continue to fly, fight, and win in \nair, space, and cyberspace. I wish him fair winds and following seas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/15/senate-section/article/S3527-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING THE 65TH INFANTRY REGIMENT\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr President, today I wish to recognize and honor the \nachievements of the 65th Infantry Regiment known as the \n``Borinqueneers'' for their contribution to the defense of our great \nNation.\n  The Borinqueneers were a segregated Puerto Rican Army unit which \nserved our Nation with great distinction during World War I, World War \nII, and the Korean war. The Borinqueneers served our Nation with valor \nduring a period of history in which their own nation's sovereignty was \ndependent upon the United States.\n  The Borinqueneers earned 10 Distinguished Service Crosses, 256 Silver \nStars, 606 Bronze Stars, and 2,771 Purple Hearts. Six hundred and \nseventy Borinqueneers gave the ultimate sacrifice for both Puerto Rico \nand the United States.\n  After watching the Borinqueneers in action during his visit to Tokyo, \nGeneral Douglas MacArthur wrote the following,\n  The Puerto Ricans forming the ranks of the gallant 65th Infantry \nRegiment give daily proof on the battlefields of Korea of their \ncourage, determination and resolute will to victory, their invincible \nloyalty to the United States and their fervent devotion to those \nimmutable principles of human relations which the Americans of the \nContinent and of Puerto Rico have in common. They are writing a \nbrilliant record of heroism in battle and I am indeed proud to have \nthem under my command. I wish that we could count on many more like \nthem.\n  I would also like to honor the men and women of Puerto Rico, who wear \nthe uniform of the United States military to this day and continue the \nlegacy of the Borinqueneers. The Borinqueneers have brought great \ncredit upon themselves, the U.S. Army, Puerto Rico, and the United \nStates of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/15/senate-section/article/S3527-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO PEGGY EVANS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ndedicated career and service to the Congress and the Nation of Ms. \nMargaret ``Peggy'' Evans, who is retiring at the end of this month \nafter over 22 years of service in both the executive and legislative \nbranches of our government. She has dedicated most of her life to \nhelping keep our Nation and its citizens secure, and we honor her for \nher service.\n  Peggy is leaving the Senate as the budget director of the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence. During her 4 years on the committee, \nPeggy has been integral to the development and passage of four annual \nintelligence authorizations bills, including three within a span of 15 \nmonths. She oversaw the committee's budget staff in drafting the \nclassified annexes to the bills, worked collaboratively with the \nintelligence community agencies and the Office of Management and \nBudget, and negotiated legislation with other Senate and House \ncommittees.\n  Through her time with the committee, Peggy brought new and creative \nproposals to the committee and was a fierce advocate for programs that \nshe believed would provide greater effectiveness or efficiency to the \nintelligence community. She also worked very closely with our \ncommittee's Technical Advisory Group, our science and technical \nadvisors, especially in the group's review of imagery satellites, which \nwill no doubt come to be seen as being ahead of its time.\n  Prior to coming to Capitol Hill, Ms. Evans had served 13 years at the \nCentral Intelligence Agency. Reflecting her many skills, she worked in \nboth the analysis and the operations side of the CIA and also led \ncovert action programs. Although we may not disclose the details, Peggy \nspent much of her CIA career countering terrorist groups and the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  Her next national security assignment was in the White House Office \nof Management and Budget. During her 5 years in that job, Peggy rose \nfrom a budget examiner to be Acting Deputy Associate Director for \nNational Security--the President's senior civil servant adviser on the \nnational security budget.\n  During her time in the private sector, Peggy has also founded and led \ntwo companies, one that builds environmentally sustainable homes and \none that provides environmental consulting services to homeowners, \nbuilders, and facilities managers. These companies earned numerous \nEnergy Star and Green Home Choice Awards.\n  She is a renaissance woman, skilled in public and private life, and \nthe committee wishes her continued success in her professional \nendeavors as she returns to private life.\n  But Peggy's devotion to the Nation's security is matched by her \ndedication to her family. Peggy and her husband Roger Ney have raised \nsix children and guided them through college and into the start of \ntheir careers. With her retirement, she will have more time to spend \nwith them and with her hobbies of reading, pottery, soccer, memorizing \narcana from the ``Lord of the Rings,'' designing homes, and spending \ntime at the beach.\n  I am pleased to have the opportunity to publicly thank Peggy and to \nnote my appreciation for her dedicated and dignified efforts. We will \nmiss your insight and experience and your commitment to pursuing the \nright policies to protect our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/15/senate-section/article/S3527-3", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3527-S3528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SALUTING OUR VETERANS\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I am filled with so much pride every time \nI meet our military veterans who come to the Nation's capital to visit \nthe memorials built to honor them and to commemorate the wars in which \nthey served so courageously.\n  Today, 31 veterans from West Virginia, representing three generations \nof warriors, are here to see the memorials that commemorate their \nsacrifice and valor and for a special ceremony honoring World War II \nveterans.\n  And on the occasion of their visit, I want to express my deepest \ngratitude to these special men who helped keep America free and made \nthe world safer for liberty-loving people across our country and beyond \nour borders.\n  I also want to say how much I appreciate the Honor Flight Network, \nwhich, since 2005, has arranged for World War II, Korea and Vietnam \nveterans from all over the country to visit the memorials in \nWashington--free of any cost to the veterans.\n  In West Virginia, the driving forces behind the Honor Flight Network \nare the Denver Foundation and Little Buddy Radio, located in Princeton. \nThese nonprofits were founded by Bob Denver--also known as ``Gilligan'' \nfrom the iconic television show ``Gilligan's Island''--and his wife, \nDreama, a West Virginia native.\n  But it was Charlie Thomas Richardson, the Operations Manager at \nLittle Buddy Radio, who got the ball rolling in West Virginia. He \nintroduced the Honor Flight Network to our State, building on the \norganization established in 2005 by Earl Morse, a physician assistant \nand retired Air Force Captain in Springfield, OH, to honor the veterans \nhe had cared for.\n  The 31 veterans from West Virginia visiting Washington today came \nfrom Pocahontas, Raleigh, Greenbrier, Mercer, Giles, Wyoming, Nicholas, \nFayette and Marion counties.\n  They range in age from 63 to 94. And while their step has slowed, \ntheir spirit is keen, their pride is undiminished, and their patriotism \nis unbridled.\n  Eleven served in World War II, one in World War II and Korea, 10 in \nKorea, one in Korea and Vietnam, four in Vietnam, and two in all three \nwars.\n  Two other veterans are serving as escorts for the group, along with \nthree high school ROTC cadets.\n  These brave West Virginians served this great country in a wide \nvariety of ways--as a B-24 pilot over Italy in World War II; in a heavy \nmortar company at ``Heartbreak Ridge'' in Korea; as a helicopter door \ngunner in Vietnam.\n  They stitched up wounds in hospitals; they assembled bombs; they \ninspected combat aircraft; they operated radios and radars; they \ncooked; and they built roads through jungles and bridges over rivers.\n  They won the Bronze Star, the Soldier's Medal, the Purple Heart and\n\n[[Page S3528]]\n\nPresidential Citations. Some were lieutenants, some sergeants, some \ncorporals. Some served abroad, some stateside.\n  But they all served this great country. No matter the war, no matter \nthe rank, no matter the duty, everyone of them answered America's call. \nIn our time of need, they stepped forward and said, ``I'll do it--I'll \nprotect this country.''\n  These heroic West Virginians came to Washington to tour our beautiful \nCapitol, the World War II Memorial, the Korean War Memorial and the \nVietnam War Memorial.\n  But the tour of the World War II Memorial is a little different than \nin the past. On the third Always Free Honor Flight in less than a year, \nthe visit will include a special ceremony called ``Flags of Our \nHeroes'' to honor World War II veterans who passed away before they \ncould ever see their memorial.\n  Sadly, we are losing World War II veterans at the rate of \napproximately 800 per day--members of what we have come to recognize, \nand rightly so, as the ``Greatest Generation.''\n  This generation of Americans was united by a common purpose and by \ncommon values--duty, honor, courage, service, integrity, love of family \nand country. And their triumph over tyranny will be remembered forever.\n  The ``Flags of Our Heroes'' ceremony involves taking a photograph of \nan American flag with a family photo of the deceased veteran in front \nof the Memorial. The photo and an Honor Flight certificate will then be \npresented to the family--a way to show this Nation's respect and regard \nfor their hero.\n  This is such a fitting gesture because, at the northern end of the \nWorld War II Memorial, the words of General George Marshall are \ninscribed, and they are well worth remembering every time we salute our \nveterans and every time this Nation prepares for war: ``Our flag will \nbe recognized throughout the world as a symbol of freedom on the one \nhand and overwhelming force on the other.''\n  May it ever be so, and may God bless the United States of America and \nall the men and women who keep us free.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/15/senate-section/article/S3528-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL POLICE WEEK\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, today, we honor the service of our brave \nmen and women in the law enforcement community. As we look around at \nAmerican flags flying at half-staff today, we remember those we have \nlost. In the years since President John F. Kennedy designated May 15th \nPeace Officers Memorial Day, and the week in which that date falls \nNational Police Week, tens of thousands of people from departments \nthroughout the United States and agencies around the world have come to \nWashington, DC., to mark this day.\n  As they say, there is no such thing as an off-duty police officer. \nOur men and women in law enforcement work tirelessly to protect our \ncommunities. While it is often in emergencies that we remark at their \ncourage and perseverance, we know that they remain vigilant every day. \nEspecially this year, as our community recovers from the cowardly and \ndespicable terrorist attack in Boston last month, we acknowledge the \nhazards that our police officers face and the sacrifices that they make \nin the service of their communities. We remember Sean Collier and pay \nrespect to his family, to his friends, and to his brothers and sisters \nin the police force.\n  The members of our law enforcement community have earned our respect, \ngratitude, and support. In Massachusetts, we honor Andrew J. Tufts, \nFrederick G. Mercer, John W. Powers, James A. Callahan Sr., Ryan \nTvelia, Kevin E. Ambrose, Jose Torres, John P. Gibbons III, and Peter \nJames Kneeland. They are among 321 law enforcement heroes who died in \nthe line of duty, whose names have been engraved this spring on the \nNational Law Enforcement Officers Memorial here in Washington, DC.\n  As we take this moment to thank our police officers for all that they \ndo every day, we are also reminded that we must continue to work in \nCongress to make sure that our agencies have the resources they need in \ntheir important work protecting our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/15/senate-section/article/S3528-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3528-S3529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     VETERANS' OUTREACH ACT OF 2013\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Senate Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, I have pledged to improve outreach activities to \nbetter inform our Nation's over 22 million veterans of the benefits to \nwhich they are entitled.\n  Legislation I introduced last week, the Veterans' Outreach Act of \n2013, would authorize the Department of Veterans Affairs to carry out a \n2-year demonstration project to award grants to State and local \ngovernment programs and nonprofit organizations to improve the \ncoordination and collaboration of veterans' health care and benefit \nservices across Federal, State, and local assets. By providing State \nand local government programs and nonprofit organizations the \nopportunity to submit a grant proposal with stated goals and \nobjectives, VA would be able to better leverage the countless services \nacross the Nation that support veterans and their family members. \nFinally and most importantly, my legislation would require recipients \nto submit outcomes data back to VA in order to document a recipient's \nability to increase awareness, efficiency, and effectiveness of \nFederal, State, and local outreach activities; enhance the availability \nof Federal, State, and local resources for veterans; and strengthen the \noverall culture of community-based support within a given community \nacross our great Nation. With this 2-year demonstration project, VA \nwill be able to examine what outreach activities work and reassess its \noutreach strategy accordingly.\n  Last month I was in Brooklyn, NY, where I met two combat veterans \nfrom the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. One was a U.S. Marine Corps \ncaptain and the other was a sergeant in the U.S. Army. Both were \nreceiving health care at VA and struggling to pay for their copays. \nSimilarly, both were unaware of their eligibility to receive 5 years of \nfree health care at VA following their most recent discharged from \nActive-Duty. Most displeasing was the lack of understanding of this \nvery same health care benefit by senior VA officials who accompanied me \nthat day. If senior VA officials are unaware of such a principal health \ncare benefit available to combat veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan \nwars, much more remains to be done inside and outside of VA to ensure \nveterans of all eras are informed and understand the benefits and \nservices they are entitled.\n  I urge my colleagues to ask veterans across their State and see how \nmany understand all of the benefits and services available to them. For \ninstance, countless veterans across this Nation remain unaware that \nsome of them may be entitled to one-time dental care if they apply at \nVA within 180 days of separation from Active Duty. Little known \nbenefits like this, can go a long way in placing our newest generation \nof veterans on sound footing following their exit from military \nservice. Other veterans may be eligible for no-cost or low-cost health \ncare and medications if they meet eligibility requirements for VA \nhealth care. To claim this coverage they must enroll at their local \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs medical center. These uncertainties \nsurrounding VA health care eligibility will most certainly be \ncompounded by the additional health care options that become available \nas we approach implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Veterans need \nto know and understand their options.\n  The men and women who have sacrificed so much in defense of this \ncountry deserve to know about the benefits and care to which they are \nentitled, and it is VA's job to make sure they know. Simply knowing \nabout benefits in certain instances is not enough. If VA is trying to \nreach rural veterans, knowing where and when a mobile vet center will \nvisit your community is critical. If VA is trying to reach more and \nmore veterans in the community, knowing when and where the local \nmedical center or community-based outpatient clinic will hold events \nand activities can drive up the number of veterans in attendance. \nFurthermore, VA needs to do more to proactively identify outreach \nefforts that work locally while leveraging the countless services \nsupporting veterans that are made available by organizations all across \nthe country.\n  Highly able and willing organizations and agencies are already \nproviding\n\n[[Page S3529]]\n\nquality social services and outreach into communities across the \nNation. Some of these organizations report a lack of coordination and \ncollaboration with local VA facilities. Additionally, many small \nnonprofits and local organizations sometimes lack the additional \nresources needed to strategically develop guidance and partnerships \nwith and across Federal, State, and local assets.

Mr. President, as the chairman of the Senate Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, I have pledged to improve outreach activities to \nbetter inform our Nation's over 22 million veterans of the benefits to \nwhich they are entitled.\n  Legislation I introduced last week, the Veterans' Outreach Act of \n2013, would authorize the Department of Veterans Affairs to carry out a \n2-year demonstration project to award grants to State and local \ngovernment programs and nonprofit organizations to improve the \ncoordination and collaboration of veterans' health care and benefit \nservices across Federal, State, and local assets. By providing State \nand local government programs and nonprofit organizations the \nopportunity to submit a grant proposal with stated goals and \nobjectives, VA would be able to better leverage the countless services \nacross the Nation that support veterans and their family members. \nFinally and most importantly, my legislation would require recipients \nto submit outcomes data back to VA in order to document a recipient's \nability to increase awareness, efficiency, and effectiveness of \nFederal, State, and local outreach activities; enhance the availability \nof Federal, State, and local resources for veterans; and strengthen the \noverall culture of community-based support within a given community \nacross our great Nation. With this 2-year demonstration project, VA \nwill be able to examine what outreach activities work and reassess its \noutreach strategy accordingly.\n  Last month I was in Brooklyn, NY, where I met two combat veterans \nfrom the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. One was a U.S. Marine Corps \ncaptain and the other was a sergeant in the U.S. Army. Both were \nreceiving health care at VA and struggling to pay for their copays. \nSimilarly, both were unaware of their eligibility to receive 5 years of \nfree health care at VA following their most recent discharged from \nActive-Duty. Most displeasing was the lack of understanding of this \nvery same health care benefit by senior VA officials who accompanied me \nthat day. If senior VA officials are unaware of such a principal health \ncare benefit available to combat veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan \nwars, much more remains to be done inside and outside of VA to ensure \nveterans of all eras are informed and understand the benefits and \nservices they are entitled.\n  I urge my colleagues to ask veterans across their State and see how \nmany understand all of the benefits and services available to them. For \ninstance, countless veterans across this Nation remain unaware that \nsome of them may be entitled to one-time dental care if they apply at \nVA within 180 days of separation from Active Duty. Little known \nbenefits like this, can go a long way in placing our newest generation \nof veterans on sound footing following their exit from military \nservice. Other veterans may be eligible for no-cost or low-cost health \ncare and medications if they meet eligibility requirements for VA \nhealth care. To claim this coverage they must enroll at their local \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs medical center. These uncertainties \nsurrounding VA health care eligibility will most certainly be \ncompounded by the additional health care options that become available \nas we approach implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Veterans need \nto know and understand their options.\n  The men and women who have sacrificed so much in defense of this \ncountry deserve to know about the benefits and care to which they are \nentitled, and it is VA's job to make sure they know. Simply knowing \nabout benefits in certain instances is not enough. If VA is trying to \nreach rural veterans, knowing where and when a mobile vet center will \nvisit your community is critical. If VA is trying to reach more and \nmore veterans in the community, knowing when and where the local \nmedical center or community-based outpatient clinic will hold events \nand activities can drive up the number of veterans in attendance. \nFurthermore, VA needs to do more to proactively identify outreach \nefforts that work locally while leveraging the countless services \nsupporting veterans that are made available by organizations all across \nthe country.\n  Highly able and willing organizations and agencies are already \nproviding\n\n[[Page S3529]]\n\nquality social services and outreach into communities across the \nNation. Some of these organizations report a lack of coordination and \ncollaboration with local VA facilities. Additionally, many small \nnonprofits and local organizations sometimes lack the additional \nresources needed to strategically develop guidance and partnerships \nwith and across Federal, State, and local assets. More effective and \nlocalized outreach will better address the community-based needs of \ntoday's veterans and do so in a cost-efficient way.\n  This legislation goes beyond authorizing VA to issue grants. This \nlegislation would also allow VA to enter into cooperative agreements \nand arrangements with various State agencies to carry out, improve, or \nenhance outreach activities for veterans.

After more than three decades of \ndedication to excellence in higher education, Dr. Harter is retiring. \nMy home State of Nevada has benefited tremendously from Dr. Harter's \ncontributions as a researcher, educator and advocate. As he enters \nretirement, Dr. Harter leaves an inspiring legacy of leadership that \nwill be long felt in the lives and careers of the countless medical \nprofessionals he helped to educate.\n  Since 2004, Dr. Michael Harter has shown exceptional commitment as \nthe administrative and academic head of Touro University's Western \nDivision, including its Nevada campus. He not only helped to establish \nTouro University Nevada, but his leadership and vision has also \ncontributed to Touro's development as one of the fastest growing \nmedical schools in the region. Despite significant challenges \nassociated with rising costs and a difficult economic climate, Dr. \nHarter has shown remarkable perseverance and commitment, and he has \nenhanced Touro University's reputation as an institution.\n  Prior to his tenure at Touro University, Dr. Harter served as vice \ndean of the University of Nevada School of Medicine, and he was also \nthe founding executive director of Family Development Programs, Inc. of \nOhio. In addition to his educational experience, Dr. Harter has served \nNevada's medical profession and health care community as a passionate \nand dedicated advocate, and has received numerous recognitions and \nawards for his service. The Nevada State legislature recently \nrecognized Dr. Harter for his ``dedication and contributions to the \nelevation of the educational system in Nevada to the highest caliber.''\n  I want to acknowledge and thank Dr. Michael Harter for his many years \nof dedicated service as an educator, researcher, administrator, and \ncommunity advocate. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating \nDr. Harter on his retirement, and in wishing him many successful and \nfulfilling years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/15/senate-section/article/S3529-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING DANIELLE DUNLAP\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to honor in the Record Miss \nDanielle Dunlap of Atlanta, GA. A few weeks ago, I was very saddened to \nlearn of the passing of this 25-year-old Peace Corps volunteer, who was \nknown as ``Dani'' by her overseas community. Danielle was stationed in \nGhana when her life was cut tragically short by illness. Like so many \nof our Peace Corps volunteers, she was a role model who dedicated her \nlife to serving others. During her time in Ghana, Danielle touched the \nlives of individuals and families in Ghana by working with them to \nimprove their lives in the areas of nutrition, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and \nsanitation. Her colleagues in Ghana said that she was proud of her role \nas a volunteer trainer, helping to mentor newly arriving volunteers in \nthe projects to which she was so devoted.\n  Born in Germany, Danielle's love for all things international began \nlong before her days as a Peace Corps volunteer. She studied abroad in \nSouth Korea and Haiti, where she learned Korean and Spanish.\n  Danielle was clearly a bright and gifted individual. She graduated \nfrom Brown University in 2010 with a bachelor's degree in neuroscience. \nShe tutored young students at the Academy at Harvard Square in \nCambridge, MA, and she was a swim instructor for students with asthma.\n  Danielle Dunlap was a model of service and character, and it is \nAmericans such as her who make this country great. The Nation mourns \nthe loss of an incredible individual at such a young age, and my heart \nand my prayers go out to Danielle's family and friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/15/senate-section/article/S3529-3", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3529-S3530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RECOGNIZING KELO-TV\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to \nhonor KELO-TV, a South Dakota institution, for 60 years of excellence \nin broadcasting. Since 1953, South Dakotans have turned to KELO for \nreliable news and information about their local communities.\n  Theater promoter Joe L. Floyd had a vision of providing all South \nDakotans, even those in the most isolated parts of our State, with \naccess to television programming. Volatile weather and vast distances \nmade this no easy feat. Tornadoes caused towers to collapse in the \nearly years, but the dedicated KELO team always restored service \npromptly.\n  On May 19, 1953, KELO-TV made its inaugural broadcast and South \nDakota's first television station was born. Dave Dedrick signed KELO on \nthe air for the first time. ``Serving the mighty Sioux Empire, this is \nKELO-TV Channel 11 Sioux Falls,'' he boomed. Dedrick became the face of \nthe network, not only as the station's longtime weatherman but as \nCaptain 11, a fictional character in KELO's hugely popular afterschool \nchildren's program. Captain 11 ran for nearly 42 years, making it \nAmerica's longest running children's program.\n  KELO has always grown with the times and strived to bring the latest \ntechnological innovations to their viewers. In 1955, KELO began to \nbroadcast the news live from the second floor of the Hollywood Theater \nbuilding. KELO aired the first live telecast of a sporting event in \nSouth Dakota in 1957. In 1968, KELO pushed the envelope yet again by \nbecoming the first station in the area to broadcast live and in color. \nEvery step of the way, KELO has gone to great lengths to provide the \nbest programming for all South Dakotans. In 1991, as soon as the \ntechnology became available, KELO began to closed-caption of many of \ntheir programs to better serve deaf and hearing-\n\n[[Page S3530]]\n\nimpaired viewers. In 1997, KELO installed the first live Doppler radar \nnetwork in South Dakota. This innovation was crucial in providing South \nDakotans with the most accurate storm forecasts so they could protect \nthemselves and their families. In 2003, HDTV came to KELOLAND and in \n2009, KELO made the transition to a digital-only signal.\n  KELO has garnered national recognition for superior news coverage and \ntheir commitment to the community. The National Association of \nBroadcasters, NAB, honored KELO with the ``Friend in Need'' Service to \nAmerica Award in 1999 for exceptional coverage of the devastating \ntornado that ripped through Spencer, SD. Not only did KELO's advance \ncoverage save lives, but money raised from their telethon helped \nvictims to rebuild the town. In 2000, KELO received a national Emmy \nAward for its ``Tradition of Caring'' public service campaign. \nEmployees at the station starred in public service announcements to \nraise awareness for local organizations in need. The program continues \nto highlight organizations across South Dakota to this day. In 2004, \nKELO was honored with the Edward R. Murrow Award, one of the most \nprestigious awards in the industry, for coverage of the 2003 tornado \noutbreak known as ``Tornado Tuesday.''\n  Over 60 years of broadcasting KELO has earned the public's trust \nthrough a dedication to journalistic excellence. South Dakotans rely on \nKELO to stay connected to their communities. Whether it be news, \nsports, or weather, KELO delivers the information that South Dakotans \nneed most. It is a great honor to recognize KELO-TV for 60 years of \ncommunity partnership, and I wish them many years of continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/15/senate-section/article/S3530-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:34 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 180.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nparticipation in medical flexible spending arrangements; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Medical FSA \nImprovement Act of 2013. I wish to thank my friend and colleague, \nSenator Enzi, for joining me in this effort. Our bill would amend the \nInternal Revenue Code to allow employees who use health flexible \nspending arrangements, FSAs, to cash out any remaining balance in their \naccount at the end of a plan year. This provision replaces current IRS \npolicy in which any unspent FSA funds revert to the employer at the end \nof the plan year for activities related to plan administration.\n  FSAs are an important benefit for all workers as they allow employees \nto set\n\n[[Page S3534]]\n\naside pre-tax dollars to pay for out-of-pocket health care \nexpenditures, including dental and vision services. Many families count \non their FSAs to help cover their monthly expenses for prescription \ndrugs, co-pays for doctors' visits, children's dental care, and medical \nequipment and supplies for disabled family members.\n  In an economy where every penny counts, it just does not make sense \nfor employees who may have overestimated their anticipated yearly out-\nof-pocket health care expenditures at the beginning of a plan year to \nbe penalized by having to forfeit unspent funds to their employer at \nthe end of a plan year. It also leads to wasteful spending when \nemployees try to avoid forfeiting their FSA balances by rushing at the \nend of a plan year to purchase unnecessary health-related items, such \nas multiple pairs of eyeglasses.\n  One-third of the Federal workforce currently use FSAs, as do millions \nof State, county and local public employees, and workers in private \nindustry. We should encourage employees to put money into FSAs to help \ndefray their out-of-pocket health care costs, to use these funds \nwisely, and not have them fear losing hard-earned money at the end of a \nplan year just because their health care expenditures may be less than \nanticipated.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation, which \nwill help America's working families better manage their personal \nfinances.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/15/senate-section/article/S3534-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 142--DESIGNATING MAY 15, 2013, AS ``NATIONAL MPS \n                            AWARENESS DAY''\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Hoeven, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Begich, Ms. \nHeitkamp, Ms. Murkowski, and Mrs. Boxer) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 142\n\n       Whereas mucopolysaccharidosis (referred to in this \n     resolution as ``MPS'') are a group of genetically determined \n     lysosomal storage diseases that render the human body \n     incapable of producing certain enzymes needed to break down \n     complex carbohydrates;\n       Whereas MPS diseases cause complex carbohydrates to be \n     stored in almost every cell in the body and progressively \n     cause cellular damage;\n       Whereas the cellular damage caused by MPS--\n       (1) adversely affects the human body by damaging the heart, \n     respiratory system, bones, internal organs, and central \n     nervous system; and\n       (2) often results in intellectual disabilities, short \n     stature, corneal damage, joint stiffness, loss of mobility, \n     speech and hearing impairment, heart disease, hyperactivity, \n     chronic respiratory problems, and, most importantly, a \n     drastically shortened life span;\n       Whereas symptoms of MPS are usually not apparent at birth;\n       Whereas, without treatment, the life expectancy of an \n     individual afflicted with MPS begins to decrease at a very \n     early stage in the life of the individual;\n       Whereas research has resulted in the development of limited \n     treatments for some MPS diseases;\n       Whereas promising advancements in the pursuit of treatments \n     for additional MPS diseases are underway as of the date of \n     agreement to this resolution;\n       Whereas, despite the creation of new remedies, the blood-\n     brain barrier continues to be a significant impediment to \n     effectively treating the brain, which prevents the treatment \n     of many of the symptoms of MPS;\n       Whereas the quality of life of the individuals afflicted \n     with MPS, and the treatments available to those individuals, \n     will be enhanced through the development of early detection \n     techniques and early intervention;\n       Whereas treatments and research advancements for MPS are \n     limited by a lack of awareness about MPS diseases;\n       Whereas the lack of awareness about MPS diseases extends to \n     individuals within the medical community;\n       Whereas the cellular damage that is caused by MPS makes MPS \n     a model for the study of many other degenerative genetic \n     diseases; and\n       Whereas the development of effective therapies and a \n     potential cure for MPS diseases can be accomplished by \n     increased awareness, research, data collection, and \n     information distribution: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 15, 2013, as ``National MPS Awareness \n     Day''; and\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of ``National MPS \n     Awareness Day''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/15/senate-section/article/S3534-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n                PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.
