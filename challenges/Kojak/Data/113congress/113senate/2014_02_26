Mr. President, over the last many months millions of \nAmericans have signed up for affordable health insurance, many for the \nfirst time ever, many for the first time in many years.\n  Millions of young people have stayed on their parents' insurance \nplans while they pursue higher education to start their first jobs.\n  Millions of senior citizens have saved money on prescriptions--these \nprescription bills, they average about $1,200 they have saved, each \nsenior--and tens of millions of women have access to free preventive \ncare.\n  Across the country, Americans who were once denied insurance because \nthey suffered from something like cancer or something as simple as acne \nwere able to buy affordable, quality health insurance they could afford \nand they could trust.\n  Despite all that good news, there are plenty of horror stories being \ntold. All of them are untrue, but they are being told all over America.\n  The leukemia patient whose insurance policy was canceled and would \ndie without her medication--Mr. President, that is an ad being paid for \nby two billionaire brothers that is absolutely false; or the woman \nwhose insurance policy went up $700 a month--ads paid for around \nAmerica by the multibillionaire Koch brothers, and the ad is false.\n  We heard about the evils of ObamaCare, about the lives it is ruining \nin the Republican stump speeches and in ads paid for by oil magnets, \nthe Koch brothers.\n  But those tales turned out to be just that--tales, stories made up \nfrom whole cloth, lies, distorted by the Republicans to grab headlines \nor make political advertisements.\n  Mr. President, these two brothers are trying to buy America. They not \nonly funnel money through their Americans for Prosperity, they funnel \nmoney into all kinds of organizations to do the same thing that they \nare doing. They are trying to buy America. I do not believe America is \nfor sale. But we will see. But do not take my word for all this. How \nabout taking the word of a Noble Prize-winning economist who wrote last \nweek in the New York Times:\n\n       What the right wants are struggling average Americans, \n     preferably women, facing financial devastation from health \n     reform. So those are the tales they're telling, even though \n     they haven't been able to come up with any real examples.\n\n  Paul Krugman writes, Republicans are ``just making [this] stuff up.'' \nIt is easy to do if you have billions of dollars to spend and you are \ntrying to buy America.\n\n[[Page S1134]]\n\n  But, Mr. President, we have our own stories to tell--true stories--\ntrue stories of average Americans whose lives have changed for the \nbetter because of the Affordable Care Act, true stories of families \nthat can rest easier knowing insurance companies can never again put \nprofits first and people second.\n  Take the story of a couple from Henderson, NV. I went to high school \nthere. Their names are Jane and Brett Thomas. These are real stories. \nThis story is true.\n  Jane wrote to me recently to say she is ``ecstatic''--that is her \nword--to be saving $1,200 every month on a top-of-the-line family \ninsurance plan thanks to ObamaCare.\n\n  For years Jane was locked into her job as a school teacher because \nshe, Brett, and their two teenage children needed guaranteed health \ninsurance, and it cost a lot.\n  But Jane was able to quit her teaching job to spend more time with \nher children and help her husband at the family small business. Jane \nsays the Affordable Care Act has literally changed her life and the \nlives of her loved ones. This is what she wrote:\n\n       Everyone on the news keeps talking of all the people the \n     law has hurt.\n\n  An editorial comment from me: Koch brothers' lies.\n  I will go back and start over:\n\n       Everyone on the news keeps talking of all the people the \n     law has hurt, but I thought I should share our joy. The best \n     part is our insurance covers so much more and pays better on \n     every front. . . . I can't thank you and your colleagues \n     enough for fighting for people like me and my family.\n\n  Republicans may need tall tales and outright lies to convince people \nthat ObamaCare is bad for them, but Democrats do not have to make \nthings up. We have the support of lots of people, including a Nobel \nPrize-winning economist, not ``OilCare'' magnets who are trying to \nbenefit their businesses by spreading lies about things that do not \nmatter to them.\n  Millions of real Americans, like Jane and Brett Thomas, are \nbenefiting from ObamaCare every day. Their premiums are lower. Their \nprescriptions are cheaper. They cannot be denied a policy or \ndiscriminated against. Their benefits cannot be cut off because they \nget sick or reach some arbitrary cap that some insurance executive \ndreamed up. They are no longer locked into jobs they do not love or do \nnot need because they cannot get insurance anywhere else.\n  The Koch brothers are spending hundreds of millions of dollars \ntelling Americans that ObamaCare is bad for them. It is easy to do if \nyou have no conscience and are willing to lie, like they are, through \nthe ads they are promoting. But the Koches should stick to what they \nknow--the oil business--the oil business--where they have made their \nmultibillions of dollars. The truth is simply more powerful than any \nmyth, any legend or any false political ad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/26/senate-section/article/S1134-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GROUNDHOG YEAR\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I said I would talk about what we are doing \nhere today. You talk about ``Groundhog Day.'' This is groundhog year. \nThe Republicans in the Senate refuse to allow anything to take place.\n  Prior to our noon break yesterday--every Tuesday Republicans meet and \nDemocrats meet--one of the senior Republicans came to me and said: \nHarry, are you going to have amendments? I said: Of course we are going \nto have amendments. We have talked about amendments on the veterans \nbill. I have had Republicans come to me and say: Let's try relevant \namendments. So I said: Fine. Come up with some. They said: How many? I \nsaid: I don't care.\n  The first amendment is what they have been doing all along. They \noffer an amendment that has nothing to do with this bill, the veterans \nbill. It is partisanship at its best. It is obstruction at its best.\n  We got cloture on this bill. Virtually everybody voted to allow us to \nstart debate on this bill. But that is only a subterfuge. The \nRepublicans obviously have no intent of doing anything for the veterans \nas outlined in this bill.\n  The chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee has worked for months \ncoming up with a bill that is good--a bipartisan proposal. Republican \nproposals are in this bill.\n  One of the Republican Senators here came and talked for some length \nyesterday about ways he would like to improve the bill. Offer \namendments. He is not going to be allowed to do that.\n  The bill advanced yesterday should be bipartisan--a measure that \nwould help the veterans who have given so much to defend our country. \nAs I indicated to my friend, the Republican Senator, before their \nlunch: Sure, let's look at relevant amendments. Why not? It is the \nright thing to do. But the first amendment the Republicans demand is an \nunrelated issue on Iran.\n  Everyone knows that there are negotiations taking place between the \nUnited States, the European Union, and others to prevent Iran from \nhaving a nuclear capacity. I have said many times--I will repeat it \nhere today--we will not let Iran have nuclear capabilities. The \nsanctions that we have put in place have brought them to the bargaining \ntable.\n  You would think that if there was any validity to what the \nRepublicans are trying to do, the organization that is more supportive \nof Israel than any organization I know--AIPAC--said publicly they do \nnot want a vote on this now--publicly. They do not always put stuff out \nin the press, but that is what they said.\n  The audacity of what they are doing is an effort to stall, obstruct, \nas they have done. This is, I repeat, not ``Groundhog Day,'' not \ngroundhog month--groundhog year. The Republicans have been doing this \non every issue. It does not matter if it is an issue that 90 percent of \nthe American people support.\n  Republicans say they want to help veterans--a strange way of showing \nit. We introduced a bill that would do just that. Republicans \nimmediately inject partisan politics into the mix, insisting on \namendments that have nothing to do with helping veterans.\n  So I am terribly disappointed again--not surprised. What are we doing \nhere today? Nothing, nothing.\n  Under the rules, they have 30 hours postcloture and they can sit \naround and do nothing. That is what they do all the time. We have spent \nmonths and months sitting around doing nothing because of procedural \nroadblocks put up by the Republicans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/26/senate-section/article/S1134-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, there is a broad bipartisan majority in \nthe Senate that would like to vote on Iran sanctions. The dilemma we \nhave here is that the majority leader does not want this vote to occur. \nSo I would like to start this morning with a few words about an issue \nthat should be of grave concern to all of us; that is, the threat of a \nnuclear-armed Iran.\n  It is no exaggeration to say that this is one of the significant \nforeign policy challenges of our time and one we simply have to get \nright. That is why a strong bipartisan majority has sought to pass \nlegislation in the Senate that puts teeth into the negotiations that \nhave followed November's interim agreement. The challenge we have had \nis the majority leader does not want us to vote on it. It could be that \nhe is afraid it will actually pass. Republican Senators--and hopefully \nsome Democratic Senators as well--are going to continue to press the \nmajority leader to allow a vote on this legislation before these \nnegotiations end.\n  The Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act is a perfectly reasonable bill. This \nis a Menendez-Kirk bill. It does not disrupt ongoing negotiations. It \nsimply provides an incentive for Iran to keep its commitment under the \ninterim agreement. It says that if Iran does not keep its word, then it \nwill face even tougher sanctions at the end of this 6-month period. In \nother words, it does not disrupt the negotiations at all, even though \nthe big--sort of the high leader, the Supreme Leader in Iran says he is \nnot paying any attention to these talks. Nevertheless, it does not \ndisrupt these talks, which seem to be going nowhere.\n  But it does say at the end of the 6-month period: You are going to \nget tougher sanctions if nothing comes of the discussions. It puts \nteeth into the talks that are already taking place. It is a recognition \nof the success we have already had as a result of prior sanctions. \nAfter all, there is a good reason\n\n[[Page S1135]]\n\nto believe sanctions are what brought the Iranians to the table in the \nfirst place. They were hurting. So it stands to reason that if the \nIranians break the interim deal, they should get tougher sanctions. If \nnothing happens, we should send a message: You cannot keep talking \nforever. Something will happen at the end of the interim period.\n  That is especially true given the fact that we are actually running \nout of tools here short of the use of force. This bill is the best \nmechanism we have to keep the Iranians at the table until we get the \nright outcome and to ensure they are sticking to their end of the \nagreement. We should not fall victim to Iran's efforts at public \ndiplomacy.\n  Let me repeat that a strong bipartisan majority in both Houses of \nCongress agrees with this approach, so there is simply no good reason \nfor the majority leader to prevent a vote on this crucial legislation. \nHe is gridlocking the Senate, preventing the Senate from working its \nwill on a bill that enjoys broad bipartisan support, makes elementary \ngood sense, and is the best hope we have to prevent a nuclear-armed \nIran. There is no excuse for muzzling the Congress on an issue of this \nimportance to our national security, to the security of Israel, our \nclosest ally in the Middle East, and to international stability more \nbroadly.\n  I know many active members of AIPAC--the majority leader mentioned \nAIPAC. They want to have this vote. They will be coming to Washington \nnext week from all over the country. I will bet this is a vote they \nwant to have.\n  This is a rare issue that should unite both parties in common \npurpose. There is no question that it would if the majority leader \nwould simply drop his reflexive deference to a President whose foreign \npolicy is focused on withdrawing from our overseas commitments, a \nforeign policy that at worst poses a serious threat to our own security \nand that of our allies.\n  So once again I call on the majority leader to allow the Congress, \nallow the Senate to serve its purpose and express itself in our \nNation's policy toward Iran. Let our constituents speak on this all-\nimportant issue on which so many of us in both parties actually agree.\n  In the Joint Plan of Action, the President made clear that he opposes \nadditional sanctions. Why don't we let Congress speak? Let Congress \nhave a voice. Let's stand together for a forward-deployed, ready, and \nlethal force that makes our commitments real in the eyes of friend and \nfoe alike. Let's hold Iran accountable--actually hold them accountable. \nLet's do the right thing--approve this legislation and send it to the \nPresident's desk. The clock is ticking. The time to act is now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/26/senate-section/article/S1135-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1135-S1136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CHANGE IN POLICY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Earlier this year I came to the floor to pose a simple \nquestion about President Obama's final years in office: Did he want to \nbe remembered as a hero to the left or as a champion for the middle \nclass? That is the question. I asked the question this way because for \nthe past several years the left has basically had its run of this White \nHouse. During that period the politically connected and the already \npowerful have clearly prospered. But what about the middle class? They \nfeel as though they have been shut out altogether as household income \nhas plummeted and families who were struggling to pay the bills have \ngotten left behind by a President and a party who claimed to act in \ntheir name.\n  So I wanted to know: Did the President plan to continue down the same \nideological road he has taken us on or would he change course and \nembrace effective proposals that would make a real difference in the \nlives of middle-class Americans? Would he reach across the aisle to \njump-start job creation and make the economy work for the middle class \nagain?\n  Well, over the last few months we appear to have gotten our answer. \nOnce more, the real concerns of ordinary Americans have been pushed \naside in favor of the preoccupation of the political left. Yet again we \nhave seen the truth of the old saying that a liberal never lets the \nfacts get in the way of a good theory. Once again we have seen how \nliberal policies end up hurting the very people they claim to help.\n  Nowhere is this more apparent than in the debate over the minimum \nwage. As a recent CBO report made clear, the President's bill basically \namounts to a terrible real-world tradeoff, helping one group of low-\nincome Americans by undercutting another group of low-income Americans. \nHow is that fair? Americans are crying out for jobs. Job creation is \nthe top issue in our country. Our unemployment and underemployment \nrates have remained abysmally high more than half a decade after this \nPresident took office. What is the White House's solution? A bill that \nmight sound good in theory but could cost as many as 1 million jobs, \naccording to CBO.\n  The Congressional Budget Office released another report, this one on \nObamaCare. There is a similar story: 2.5 million fewer Americans in \njobs thanks to ObamaCare; huge disincentives to work thanks to \nObamaCare. That is what CBO says.\n  Of course, Washington Democrats--the same folks who promised you \ncould keep your health plan if you liked it--told Americans not to \nbelieve their own eyes, that ObamaCare would simply liberate them from \njobs. ObamaCare would simply liberate them from jobs. It is just \nunbelievable, especially when we consider that the law's medical device \ntax alone is projected to kill as many as 33,000 jobs and that 60 \npercent of business owners and HR professionals recently surveyed said \nObamaCare will negatively impact jobs. As a member of that group \nrecently put it, ``Small businesses have an incentive to stay small'' \nunder ObamaCare. That is because ObamaCare can punish businesses that \nchoose to hire more workers.\n  In my home State of Kentucky, the tension between the priorities of \nthe left and the needs of real people is on full display. That is \nbecause the Obama administration has trained its sights on some of our \nmost vulnerable citizens. One administration adviser actually used the \nwords ``war on coal'' to essentially describe what the administration \nis doing or, in his view, probably should be doing to hard-working \nminers who just want to put food on the table.\n  Those were his words, not mine. Here is why: Because according to \nliberal elites in Washington, these folks are standing in the way of \ntheir theories. A practical approach that actually takes the concerns \nand anxieties of those people into account would promote clean energy \neven as it acknowledged the real-world benefits of traditional sources \nof energy.\n  My point is this: The administration has broken faith with the middle \nclass, and it has stirred up strong emotions, especially among those \nwho actually want to see a better life for those struggling to make it \nin our States. Almost everyone feels let down. A lot of folks are very \nangry.\n  It is a real tragedy, not only because of the missed opportunities \nand the human cost of these policies but also because when the \nPresident ran for office, he promised a very different approach.\n  It is tragic because the very folks he has talked about helping are \nthe ones who seem to suffer the most under his Presidency.\n  It is tragic because it appears as if he has answered the question I \nposed in January: that he is prepared to double down on the left and \nthrow in the towel on the middle class. How else can you explain the \nobsession with all of these peripheral ideological issues at a time \nwhen Americans are demanding good, stable, high-paying jobs and a new \ndirection, at a time when folks' wages are stagnant but their costs \nalways seem to be rising, at a time when younger Americans seem to be \nresigned to a harder life than their parents had? How else can you \nexplain why the President has refused to sign off on projects such as \nKeystone Pipeline that would create thousands of jobs or why he refuses \nto push his own party to join Republicans and support trade legislation \nthat could create even more jobs?\n  This cannot be the legacy the President really wants to leave, but it \nis the legacy he will be ensuring for himself if he does not change. \nThere is still time to alter the course. There is still time for the \nPresident to acknowledge that there is no reconciling the demands of \nhis base and the concerns of the middle class. It is one or the other.\n\n[[Page S1136]]\n\n  The real solution here is liberating the private sector. The real \nsolution is to implement policies that will increase wages for everyone \ninstead of pursuing policies that essentially seek to distribute slices \nof a smaller pie to some. Of course, making a turn toward authentic job \ncreation might make the left mad, but it is the only way to get the \ngears of our economy working again and college graduates off their \nparents' couches and onto a path of earned success.\n  Maybe the President will show some change of heart in Minnesota \ntoday. Maybe he will recognize, for instance, that killing thousands of \nhigh-tech jobs in the medical device industry is not worth the pain it \nis causing. Who knows? Who knows? I sure hope so because if you have \nentered the sixth year of trying to fix an economy and you are still \ntalking about emergency unemployment benefits, it is time to recognize \nthat your policies have not worked for the middle class. It is time for \na fresh start.\n  Before I go, I would like to highlight one more dividing line between \nthe dreams of the left and the well-being of our constituents. It is a \ntopic I spoke about yesterday; that is, Medicare Advantage.\n  As I asked then: Why would the administration want to raid a program \nthat is working, such as Medicare Advantage, to fund a program that \ndoes not work, such as ObamaCare? Why would Senate Democrats vote time \nand time again to do that? They must have known that taking $300 \nbillion from Medicare Advantage to fund ObamaCare would have real-world \nimpacts on seniors, such as losing choices and coverage and doctors \nthey now enjoy. It is not fair. It is not right.

Yesterday I had the opportunity to come to the floor of \nthe Senate and talk about ObamaCare's broken promises for our Nation's \nseniors.\n  The administration's most recent proposal to significantly cut \nMedicare Advantage is certainly not news to my colleagues on the floor \ntoday. During the health care debate, we warned over and over again \nthat cutting $\\1/2\\ trillion from Medicare to fund ObamaCare would have \ndisastrous consequences and that it certainly would not strengthen \nMedicare. The law drains $308 billion from a very well-received \nMedicare Advantage Program.\n  The stories from Nebraskans illustrate how these cuts are hurting \nsenior citizens. I heard from a couple in Carney, NE. They wrote to me \nsaying that the Medicare Advantage plan they had for several years was \nsomething they liked. It was a plan that worked for them, but that \nplan, because of ObamaCare, was cancelled. She went on to say to me \nthat another plan was going to cost more money and higher rates were \ncoming for them.\n  She said: ``I have not been shy about telling people that we lost our \ninsurance plan thanks to ObamaCare!''\n  I could add to that that she has lost her insurance plan--and \nthousands of others, tens of thousands of others across the United \nStates--because of the votes of the majority and the President.\n  A Nebraskan from Hastings shared that her Medicare Advantage plan was \ndiscontinued and her new Medicare Advantage plan option was, get this, \n357 percent more expensive. Is that fair treatment to that senior \ncitizen?\n  When ObamaCare was passed, we tried to get amendments done that if \nthere were any savings in Medicare, it would go back to Medicare to \nprotect the system. That was voted down by the majority.\n  What we ended with is a situation where those funds were pulled out \nof Medicare and used to finance ObamaCare. For millions of Americans \nand about 35,000 Nebraskans who rely upon Medicare Advantage, this law \nhas not delivered on its promises.\n  As I have said over and over since this debate began, I have been \ncommitted to ensuring that Medicare is sustainable for decades to come, \nnot only for the current generation but for our children and our \ngrandchildren. The health care law does not accomplish this goal, and I \nbelieve strongly it needs to be repealed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I come to the floor also to talk about a letter I got \nfrom Wyoming from a constituent, Traci, who lives in Rock Springs, WY. \nShe is very concerned about the health care law. It is interesting \nbecause she writes after hearing on the news last week a clip of \nSecretary Sebelius. It is a clip where Secretary Sebelius claims there \nis no indication that the ACA is responsible for any job loss.\n  Traci in Rock Springs, WY, sees Secretary Sebelius on television and \nwants to let the country know--and I am doing that for Traci today--\nthat the Secretary is wrong.\n  Traci says: ``My life is a prime example. Let me explain just how the \nACA has destroyed my life.''\n  The quote she is referencing is Secretary Sebelius last week said: \n``There is absolutely no evidence, and every economist will tell you \nthis, that there is any job loss related to the Affordable Care Act.''\n  It almost seems like a deliberate deception, an effort by the \nSecretary to mislead the American people, saying: Who are you going to \nbelieve, Secretary Sebelius or your own two eyes when you see what is \nhappening in your own communities?\n  That is why Traci wrote to me from Rock Springs, WY.\n  Traci said she works full time. She also maintains a number of part-\ntime jobs. She has a master's degree.\n  She says: ``Once the ACA was passed, I saw the writing on the wall, \nand so did the companies I work for.''\n  Isn't it interesting that Traci in Rock Springs, WY, could see the \nwriting on the wall, the companies she worked for could see the writing \non the wall, and yet the Democrats in this body who voted for this law \ncouldn't see the writing on the wall.\n  She said she had health insurance and that these companies wouldn't \nhave had to provide her with anything because she had insurance--\nwouldn't have had to provide her with anything. But they didn't know \nwho might and might not have insurance, and they weren't taking the \nchance that they would have to offer health care to a large number of \npeople. So what these companies basically did, she said, was hire a \nspecific number of individuals full time and thus those of us who \nremained part-time employees have been cut way back. This is obviously \nimpacting her wages, her take-home pay, the things that matter to her, \nand it seems that Democrats, including Secretary Sebelius, couldn't \ncare less.\n  It was interesting. I came to the floor yesterday with an article \nfrom the New York Times last week about all of these public jobs, \npeople working for public schools, people working for community \ncolleges, sanitation workers for communities, counties--all of these \npeople having their hours cut, their take-home pay cut, their wages \ncut, and it is because of the health care law, specifically because of \nthe health care law.\n  Traci continues:\n\n       I can't believe in a country my grandfather came to and \n     lived the American dream is actually actively trying to \n     prevent me from being able to do the work I want to do. The \n     kind of work I am good at. The kind of work that others \n     benefit from. What was the comment last week about how I am \n     being liberated from my job to do what I truly want.\n\n  It is astonishing. What she says is: I was doing what I truly wanted.\n  But yet, according to the Democrats, according to Nancy Pelosi, the \nformer Speaker of the House, she is now being\n\n[[Page S1137]]\n\nliberated from the job to do what she truly wants to do--when we have \nsomebody with a master's degree, someone who loves to teach, and not \nbeing able to do what she truly wants to do.\n  Continuing:\n\n       And now this government is actually preventing me from what \n     I want to do, doing what I like to do, doing what I am meant \n     to do.\n\n  This is a woman in Wyoming doing what she wants to do, what she likes \nto do, what she wants to do, and was meant to do as a teacher--because \nof this health care law.\n  It is not only in Wyoming. I read a story on the floor yesterday of a \nschool district in Connecticut, Meriden, CT, where the superintendent, \nwho is on a national board of school districts, said: What am I \nsupposed to do? If I am going to provide by law all of these part-time \nworkers--who are working over 31 hours--health insurance, what I am \ngoing to have to do is fire five reading teachers. How can I make that \ndecision and that tradeoff?\n  Instead, they cut their hours to less than 30 hours a week, but yet \nKathleen Sebelius says there is absolutely no evidence relating to job \nloss in the Affordable Care Act.\n  My friend Traci writes: ``So Obama care--has cost me a lot of jobs, \nhas cost me about half of my income.''\n  When the President of the United States is saying we need to raise \nthe minimum wage, why is the President of the United States ignoring \nTraci, her income, her wages, and her take-home pay? Why is his health \ncare law making her life worse?\n  She said: ``So Obama care--has cost me a lot of jobs, has cost me \nabout half of my income.''\n  She continues:\n\n       And by the way I was one of those taxpayers that don't have \n     any deductions generally to take other than my mortgage, so \n     when you used to get a lot of taxes from me, by decreasing my \n     income in half, your tax revenue is decreasing in half as \n     well. So next time Sec. Sebelius claims that there are no \n     indications of any job loss, you can tell her that I have \n     lost multiple jobs and I am not being ``liberated.''\n\n  That is what the American people are facing. That is what the \nPresident of the United States denies every day when he refuses to give \nvoice to the suffering that his health care law is causing all across \nthis country in all 50 States. It is time that we work together, get \nsolutions for the health care needs of this country, and not continue \nunder what is happening with the President's health care law--which, \ncase after case after case, is not yet giving the American people what \nhe promised them and is giving them a lot worse. It is hurting their \nlives, it is hurting their health, and it is hurting their take-home \npay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Senator from Wyoming, who is one of the most \nknowledgeable, eloquent Members of our side of the aisle or in this \nChamber on the subject of health care law. As a former practicing \northopedic surgeon, he knows the subject better than almost anyone I \nknow.\n  But we are on the floor today to talk about the cuts to the only real \nchoice that seniors have when it comes to their health care coverage \nunder Medicare. There are basically two choices. One is called Medicare \nAdvantage, which I will talk more about in a minute, and the other is \nMedicare, traditional Medicare, which is a fee-for-service program that \nmany people find is less advantageous to them than Medicare Advantage.\n  Close to 16 million people currently receive health care benefits \nthrough Medicare Advantage--about 1 million of them in Texas, the State \nI am honored to represent. Of course, they represent roughly 30 percent \nof all Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Why would somebody choose Medicare Advantage rather than traditional \nMedicare? Because it gives a lot more flexibility and greater patient \nchoice. It actually delivers better results than traditional Medicare. \nIt has been one of the main sources of innovation when it comes to \nhealth care, producing better outcomes for seniors under Medicare. \nMedicare Advantage is the primary driver.\n  Unfortunately, the President's health care law, known as the \nAffordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, slashed about $300 billion from \nMedicare Advantage. My constituents are already going to start to see \npremium increases to their Medicare Advantage policies. Many of them \nwill have to then question whether they can afford that, whether they \nwill drop Medicare Advantage, lose the choices, the flexibility, the \ninnovation that goes along with it, and end up basically turning to \ntraditional Medicare fee-for-service.\n  In Texas, about two out of every three doctors will see a new \nMedicare patient because it actually reimburses physicians at a lower \nrate than regular health insurance does, so many doctors have found \nthat they have to limit their practice, much as they have under \nMedicaid as well.\n  But we know that the $300 billion that has been taken from Medicare \nAdvantage, and these seniors--who rely on it to shore up the Affordable \nCare Act or ObamaCare--know that the news on ObamaCare continues to \nunwind and bring us bad news almost every day. Not only have millions \nof people lost their existing health care coverage, even though they \nwere promised by the President of the United States that if you like \nit, you can keep it--I lost count of how many times the President made \nthat statement, but I think it is somewhere in the high twenties. Of \ncourse, now we are finding out that more and more people are having to \npay higher premiums as a result of ObamaCare.\n  Another promise the President made is he said that a family of four \nwould see a reduction of $2,500 in their average premiums, but they are \nseeing their premiums go up. Indeed, on Friday, in a late-afternoon \nnews dump--that has become a new art form for the administration, they \ndump news on Friday afternoon and hope nobody notices, or it won't be \ncovered--we learned that roughly two-thirds of the people who work for \nsmall businesses will see an increase in their premiums as a result of \nObamaCare, some 11 million small business employees.\n  The people who are concerned about Medicare Advantage aren't only on \nthis side of the aisle. In fact, we have had bipartisan accolades for \nMedicare Advantage, called a great success by both Senators from New \nYork, for example, and the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial \nCampaign Committee from Colorado. They recently joined me, along with a \ncouple of dozen colleagues, to urge CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner \nto ``maintain payment levels that will allow [Medicare Advantage] \nbeneficiaries to be protected from disruptive changes in 2015.''\n  This bipartisan support for this important choice for seniors, known \nas Medicare Advantage, is in real jeopardy as they are going to see as \na result a $300 billion cut from Medicare Advantage in order to shore \nup this failing experiment in big government known as ObamaCare.\n  People's existing health care arrangements are in serious jeopardy \nand they are concerned and they are calling and writing us and \nwondering what we are going to do. Unfortunately, those calls and \nletters seem to fall on deaf ears, as far as the President and the \npeople who voted for this bill are concerned. The American people have \nseen they are whistling past the graveyard and hoping that what will \nlikely happen in November--which will finally be the day of electoral \naccountability--is that their voices will actually be heard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the 35,000 \nNebraska senior citizens who are enrolled in Medicare Advantage. These \nNebraskans are going to face fewer choices, increased premiums, and \ndecreased benefits because of ObamaCare's latest cuts. I am especially \nconcerned with how these cuts will impact rural Nebraskans who may be \nforced out of the program altogether due to the lack of available \nplans.\n  The administration has already taken over $700 billion from Medicare \nto prop up ObamaCare, and $308 billion of that is from the popular \nMedicare Advantage Program to fund this failed health care experiment. \nThese cuts to health services for seniors only hasten the demise of \nthis successful program, a program that has improved the lives of \nmillions of seniors across this great country. Medicare Advantage works \nfor them.\n\n[[Page S1138]]\n\n  Too many promises have already been made and broken, so let's not \nbreak another promise to America's seniors.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I think nearly every Member of this body \nshares the goal of increasing access to affordable health insurance and \nhelping American families receive the best coverage to meet their \nspecific needs. So the question before us today--and the question \nbefore us this entire Congress--is how are these goals being achieved. \nThis has been an issue we have been debating since 2010, when ObamaCare \nwas signed into law.\n  Based on the extraordinary feedback from Hoosiers, regardless of \nparty affiliation or ideology, the overwhelming number of messages that \nhave been sent to my office, and that I have heard while traveling \nacross the State of Indiana, suggest that the Affordable Care Act has \nturned out to be a dismal failure. It is hurting more families than it \nis helping.\n  To top it all off, the administration, late last Friday afternoon \nonce again cut one of the most popular programs available to seniors--\nMedicare Advantage. We have 230,000 Hoosiers enrolled in Medicare \nAdvantage plans who could be told major cuts will be made to their \nplans in order to pay for ObamaCare.\n  What an irony. We pass a program to provide health care coverage for \nsenior citizens. They sign up for the program. They make the choice on \ntheir own to pay higher costs for Medicare Advantage so they get better \ncoverage, and the administration simply says: We need to rebalance \nthings so we are going to do everything we possibly can to make it more \ndifficult and more expensive. This was their choice, but the \nadministration is saying: We are going to make it our choice that this \nprogram is going to be reduced and much harder to engage in.\n  Consider what is happening. This administration is cutting billions \nof dollars from Medicare Advantage--an extremely popular program not \njust in my State but across this country--to pay for ObamaCare, which \nis extremely unpopular. So the administration takes a plan that works, \na plan that people support, because it is their choice and they are \nwilling to pay for it, and the administration says: No, we are going to \ntake that away from you so we can cover the cost for a plan that is not \npopular. This is the irony of ironies, particularly in terms of meeting \nthe goal that I think all of us want to meet.\n  So we have yet another broken promise. The President so famously said \nover and over again: If you like your plan, you can keep it. If you \nmake a choice as to how you want to be covered, what benefits you want \nto have, what premium you want to pay, you can keep that--but now he is \nsaying, well, no, effectively, you can't keep it because we are going \nto take that away from you.\n  It is no wonder I receive tens of thousands of pieces of mail and \nphone calls from Hoosiers all across my State saying: I got duped here. \nI got lured into something that supposedly was going to make medical \ncare less costly; that I would be able to keep my doctor, I would be \nable to stay with my hospital, I would be able to keep the benefits in \nthe plan I chose, and now I am being told, no, none of that is going to \nwork.\n  As was just stated by Senator Cornyn of Texas, there is a bipartisan \neffort underway to send a message to the President. It urges the \nPresident to preserve Medicare Advantage and the incentives to join it. \nI know the President doesn't want to listen to Republicans and have \nthem tell him what is happening in their States, what their suggestions \nare as to what to do to fix this disaster of a health care plan, but \nmaybe he should listen to Members of his own party. There is a \nsignificant number of Democrats who have said: We don't want these cuts \nto be imposed on Medicare Advantage. We don't want to go home and tell \nour constituents they can no longer have their Medicare Advantage plan.\n  So if the President doesn't want to listen to us, I fully understand \nthat. He has made that very clear. But perhaps he should listen to \nMembers of his own party and listen to what they are saying. Let's give \npeople the ability to make choices and keep the plan they have chosen \nand not have it taken away by a bureaucracy that simply makes decisions \nfor them.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I compliment my colleagues who have been \ntalking about Medicare Advantage today. It is amazing to me that this \nadministration will take money from Medicare Advantage--a program \npeople love and that works well, where they can have their own doctors \nand their own health care providers--and put it into ObamaCare--a \nprogram that is not working and people are not happy with--and we wind \nup with a lot of dissatisfied people in this country and with good \nreason for their dissatisfaction.\n  So I rise to join my colleagues in speaking out against the harm \nObamaCare is already causing to seniors throughout the country who rely \non Medicare Advantage. I have heard from many seniors in my home State \nof Utah who are worried about the impact further cuts to the Medicare \nAdvantage Program could have on their personal health care.\n  For example, James and Maureen of Spanish Fork, UT, sent a letter \ndescribing how they have been personally affected by the hundreds of \nbillions of dollars taken from Medicare Advantage to pay for \nObamaCare--to take money from a program that works, that people are \nhappy with, that they pay for, and put it into ObamaCare where it \ndoesn't work, they are not happy with it, and it even costs the \ngovernment more money.\n  James and Maureen were informed some time ago that their current \ndoctors and most providers in their area will no longer be covered as a \npart of their plan's network. In Maureen's words:\n\n       If further funding is taken from the Advantage programs, \n     more and more providers will stop accepting these plans. \n     Where will we go to seek medical treatment?\n\n  Maureen also said that similar to many other seniors, she and her \nhusband ``worry about what will be next.''\n  These are common stories. Seniors throughout Utah and the Nation are \nseeing their health care options dwindle because President Obama and \nthe Democrats in Congress raided Medicare Advantage to pay for their \nmisguided ObamaCare and what they call their health care law.\n  We all remember when the President promised under ObamaCare if you \nlike your doctor, you can keep your doctor. Yet because of the law's \ncuts to Medicare Advantage, people such as James and Maureen are being \nforced to find new doctors and health care providers. As each day \npasses, fewer and fewer options are available to them. This is just \nanother example of broken promises that came part and parcel with \nObamaCare.\n  On top of the problems with Medicare Advantage, a new report issued \nlate last week from the Chief Actuary from the Centers for Medicare & \nMedicaid Services had even more troubling news. Buried in the report--\nwhich was 2 years late, by the way--is the confirmation that ObamaCare \nwill raise insurance premiums for 11 million employees of small \nbusinesses.\n  You heard that right. The Obama administration's own actuary found \nthat under the President's health care law 11 million workers will see \ntheir premiums rise. As I said, this report was 2 years late, and it is \nno wonder why the administration sat on it for as long as they did.\n  This is just the latest in a long line of bad data we have seen about \nthis misguided law. Yet the administration refuses to step away from \nits talking points and acknowledge the truth--that the health care law \nis fundamentally flawed and is not working as promised.\n  All of the problems we are seeing are confirming over and over that \nthe best path forward would be to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with \npatient-focused, commonsense reforms that will actually lower costs and \nexpand options for the American people. I hope eventually that is the \npath we take.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, in July of 2009, President Obama said: ``If \nyou like your doctor, you keep your doctor.\n\n[[Page S1139]]\n\nIf you like your current insurance, you keep that insurance. Period, \nend of story.'' Then later, in September of 2009, the President said: \n``Now these steps [ObamaCare] will ensure that you--America's seniors--\nget the benefits you've been promised.''\n  Well, Mr. President, last Friday we saw yet another group of \nAmericans fall victim to the Democrats' broken ObamaCare promises, and \nthis time it was America's seniors. ObamaCare cuts of over $300 billion \nto Medicare Advantage are already hurting seniors who rely on that \npopular program for their health care needs. More than 15 million \nseniors, close to about 30 percent of all Medicare recipients, are \nenrolled in Medicare Advantage plans.\n  The Wall Street Journal reports that approximately one out of every \ntwo new Medicare enrollees chooses Medicare Advantage. Seniors often \nchoose Medicare Advantage because it is a more comprehensive and \ncohesive way to get health care services and it offers seniors the \nchance to pick a plan that is right for them instead of a one-size-\nfits-all approach picked for them by Washington, DC.\n  The administration's additional cuts to Medicare Advantage announced \nlast week will make it even harder for America's seniors to keep their \nbenefits, plan, and preferred doctor. The Kaiser Family Foundation \nestimates that more than one-half million seniors will lose their \ncurrent plans in 2014, which is a direct violation of the President's \npromise.\n  This administration's cut to Medicare Advantage in order to try to \npay for ObamaCare is having real-world impacts on people throughout the \ncountry.\n  A constituent of mine, Cheryl from Box Elder, SD, wrote to me this \npast week and said:\n\n       My husband and I both pay for a Medicare Advantage Plan. . \n     . . We have already had our original policy cancelled because \n     of ObamaCare. And our prescription costs have increased for \n     the same reason. So I am practically begging you to do all \n     you can to keep our Advantage Plan from being cut.\n\n  Every Senator who voted for this train wreck owes America's seniors \nsuch as Cheryl an explanation for these Medicare cuts, which are \nalready resulting in canceled plans, higher costs, and reduced access \nto the doctors they had and liked.\n  When the ObamaCare legislation was being debated and these proposed \ncuts to Medicare were being advanced, many of us said this would be a \nbig mistake because what they were essentially doing was cutting \nMedicare--particularly Medicare Advantage, which is especially helpful \nto a lot of seniors across this country and which is working out \nthere--taking the savings and then using them to pay for a whole new \nentitlement program.\n  At the time we talked about this--and, of course, because of the \nweird conventions used in trust fund accounting here in Washington, the \nhundreds of billions of dollars that were cut from Medicare were not \nonly then used to pay for this new entitlement program, ObamaCare, but \nwere also credited to the Medicare trust fund. Their argument was that \nthey were preserving and extending the lifespan of Medicare, and at the \nsame time they were using these savings from the cuts coming in \nMedicare Advantage to pay for a whole new entitlement program. I think \nfor most Americans this would be spending the same money twice. It \nwould be double-counting revenue.\n  Essentially what they are saying is this: We are going to put an IOU \ninto the Medicare trust fund which at some point in the future we are \ngoing to have to redeem to pay benefits, and this is going to require \nus to borrow more money.\n  It is intergovernmental debt. We talk about publicly held debt, which \nis debt held by the public, but there is also intergovernmental debt, \nwhich adds to the total debt burden we place on American citizens and \nwhich is debt that we are going to have to pay back in the future.\n  Essentially, all they have done is put a promissory note--an IOU--\ninto the trust fund. At some point in the future when we need to be \nable to pay benefits to beneficiaries, we are going to have to borrow \nthe money to redeem that IOU.\n  Essentially, they were able to argue that we were somehow extending \nthe lifespan of Medicare at the very time these cuts were being made \nand also at the same time paying for a whole new entitlement program \nunder ObamaCare. It was spending the same money twice. It was double-\ncounting revenue--something which anywhere else in the country would \nprobably land most Americans in jail.\n  That being said, these Medicare Advantage cuts are now having real-\nworld impact--something we predicted all along.\n  The reason Medicare Advantage is a popular program and the reason one \nin two new beneficiaries is signing up is that it gives you options. It \ngives you choices. It provides competition, which is something we need \nto have more of, not less of, in health care today.\n  If you want to put downward pressure on prices, if you want to \nconstrain utilization in health care, then create competition out \nthere. Give people more ownership, more skin in the game. Give them \nsome personal investment in their own health care decisions.\n  As it is, with the traditional Medicare Program we have a fee-for-\nservice Medicare Program. Many seniors are enrolled in that. But \nMedicare Advantage gave them another option--an option that presented \nchoices and opportunity to cover things they want to see covered in \ntheir health care plans. And it has worked. It has been an effective \nprogram, one that I think most people point to as a success.\n  So we are going to cut the very program that is working perhaps the \nbest out there in terms of meeting the health care needs of America's \nseniors in order to fund a whole new entitlement program, ObamaCare, \nand in the meantime end up with these higher premiums, canceled \ncoverages, and all the dislocations that are coming as a result of \nthese Medicare Advantage cuts to seniors across this country. That is \nthe wrong way to approach this issue.\n  There is a much better way, one that relies more on the very things \non which Medicare Advantage is based--more competition, more choice, \nmore options--and wouldn't lead to canceled coverages, higher premiums, \nhigher deductibles, and fewer doctors and hospitals to choose from for \nAmerica's seniors. But that is exactly where we are, and American \nseniors are now experiencing the very thing a lot of other Americans \nhave already experienced. People who get their insurance on the \nindividual marketplace have seen a lot of these canceled coverages \nalready. They have seen these huge increases in premiums.\n  Many of us have been here on the floor reading constituent mail and \nemails from families and individuals who have been adversely impacted \nand harmed by ObamaCare because of canceled coverage, higher premiums, \nhigher deductibles, and loss of doctors and hospitals. We have seen \nthis in the individual marketplace. We are starting to see this--and we \nwill see more--in the small business, employer-provided marketplace.\n  But now, as of last week, the real impacts are being felt as well by \nseniors across this country who in big numbers have been signing up for \nMedicare Advantage. Close to 30 percent of all Medicare recipients--15 \nmillion seniors--as a result are going to see higher premiums and \nreduced access to health care because of the cuts that will occur to \nMedicare Advantage in order to pay for a new entitlement program, \nObamaCare, which, based on the number of delays the administration has \nmade, has already demonstrated it is not working. And I, as have many \nof my colleagues here, have argued for a long time that it can't work \nbecause it is built upon a faulty foundation.\n  There is a much better way to do this. We should do away with this \napproach, go back to the drawing board, and use a step-by-step approach \nto reforming health care in this country, realizing the status quo \ndoesn't work but realizing as well that the best way to get lower \ncosts, more affordable health care, and more accessible health care for \nmore American citizens is to create downward pressure on prices. That \nrequires giving people choices and creating competition in the \nmarketplace. Those are the things we ought to be advocating and \nadvancing rather than this top-down, government-knows-best, one-size-\nfits-all solution coming out of Washington, DC, which is hurting more \nand more Americans and most recently American citizens who are now \nexperiencing the adverse impacts of\n\n[[Page S1140]]\n\nObamaCare because of the cuts to their Medicare Advantage plans.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp).

Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk about \na grave threat to the United States of America, a grave threat to the \nworld, and a grave threat to our friend and ally, the State of Israel; \nthat is, the threat of Iran's nuclear weapons program.\n  As we stand here today, pending has been legislation filed by Senator \nRichard Burr which contains important sanctions which are essentially \nan insurance policy to make sure that Tehran does not play the United \nStates of America and that they are, in fact, serious about stopping \ntheir nuclear weapons program. Unfortunately, there is a long history \nwith Iran where we talk and they enrich. This is why it is so important \nright now that we have this insurance policy.\n  These sanctions pending would only go in place if Iran violates the \ninterim agreement that has been entered into between the administration \nand other countries in the world and Iran and if they fail to reach a \nfinal agreement that is acceptable to the security interests of the \nUnited States of America and to our allies in the region to make the \nworld a safer place.\n  We cannot accept a nuclear-capable Iran. Why is that? Iran is a \ncountry that has threatened to wipe the State of Israel off the face of \nthe Earth. Iran has called our country ``the Great Satan.'' Iran is the \nworld's worst state sponsor of terrorism. They have supported terrorist \ngroups such as Hezbollah and Hamas. They have, unfortunately, obviously \nworked against our strong ally Israel. They have supported the \nmurderous Assad regime, providing Assad arms so he can murder his own \npeople.\n  Unfortunately, there are so many examples of the danger of Iran \nhaving nuclear weapons capability. If Iran gets this capability, \nunfortunately we will also find ourselves in a position where we are in \na nuclear arms race in the Middle East, a Sunni-Shia arms race, which \nwould then also threaten the world and make that region even more of a \ntinderbox.\n  So we now find ourselves at a critical moment. I am deeply worried \nthat the sanctions regime this Congress has worked so hard to put in \nplace on a strong bipartisan basis is unraveling and we need an \ninsurance policy to make sure Iran knows they are not going to play us \nand unravel these sanctions. The way we can do that is by having \nsanctions legislation passed which is prospective.\n  If Iran is serious about a nuclear weapons agreement that takes away \ntheir capability of having a nuclear weapon, then they should not have \na problem with prospective sanctions by this Congress. Again, those \nsanctions would only go in place if they violate the interim agreement. \nIf their words mean anything, then they shouldn't have a problem with \nthe fact that we are just saying: If you violate it, we will impose \nadditional sanctions. We will not allow this sanctions regime to \nunravel.\n  What is the significance of this sanctions regime? The work done by \nthis Congress on a bipartisan basis and with our partners around the \nworld is what has brought Iran to the table. All of us want a \ndiplomatic resolution that stops Iran from having a nuclear weapon, but \nwe need to go into this with clear eyes, which is why having this \ninsurance policy is so important. A final agreement with Iran will only \nbe meaningful if it ensures they will not have the ability to enrich \nbecause their ability to enrich makes it easier for them to immediately \nramp up to nuclear weapons capability.\n  I recently attended a security conference in Munich and met with some \nrepresentatives of the Arab nations. They were asked in an open forum: \nIf an agreement is reached and Iran is allowed to enrich, what will the \nrest of you want to do? Their answer was that they will want the right \nto enrich too.\n\n  This final agreement must stop Iran's ability to enrich. If we do not \nstop them, we will not only face the risk of Iran being able to quickly \nramp up to a nuclear weapon and its capability to harm the world but \nalso the risk that the Arab nations themselves will also enrich. Even \nif they don't have a nuclear weapon capability, they are all right at \nthe point where they could break out to that capability, and that is \njust as dangerous for the world.\n  The amendment we have makes it clear that we are going to protect the \nUnited States of America and protect our allies and the world. It has \nto be clear. It should prevent Iran from that enrichment capability. \nThis agreement should stop their capability at the Arak facility to \nproduce plutonium. Our agreement should absolutely make sure we are \ngiven access to their military facilities so we can stop them from \ntheir programs where they are working on weaponization of nuclear \nmaterials.\n  I serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Director of \nNational Intelligence and others have told us that by 2015 Iran could \nhave ICBM capability. Can you imagine if they were to continue with \nthis nuclear program and have ICBM capability? This is a true risk to \nthe world.\n  An agreement is only meaningful if it is an agreement we can rely on, \nthat is open, transparent, verifiable, and absolutely stops them from \nhaving a nuclear program that could be a threat to the world. We need \nto make sure they stop enrichment and put a stop on the Arak plutonium \nreactor and weaponization program. We need full and open access.\n  We should be addressing Iran's acts of terrorism throughout the \nworld. One of the grave dangers I worry about is that if Iran has a \nnuclear weapon, they may not use it, but they may pass it on to the \nterrorist groups that Iran is associated with, and that is a grave \ndanger not only to our ally Israel but also to the United States of \nAmerica.\n  One of the reasons I believe the sanctions legislation that is \npending is so important is because some of the statements that have \nbeen made recently by the regime in Tehran are very troubling and \nharken back to their prior behavior of we talk, they enrich. We have to \nquestion how serious they are about a verifiable, transparent, and real \nagreement to stop their nuclear weapons program.\n  For example, on February 18--in talks between Iran and the P5+1 that \nwere held in Vienna--Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the \ntalks ``will not lead anywhere.'' In advance of the talks, President \nRuhani, whom Prime Minister Netanyahu has described as a wolf in \nsheep's clothing--and I would agree with him on that--has stated that \npeaceful atomic research would be pursued forever.\n  Iran's Foreign Minister recently clashed with a lead U.S. negotiator, \nWendy Sherman, over the Arak and Fordow facilities. Sherman stated that \nIran had no need for either facility. Make no mistake, if Iran is \nserious about giving up its nuclear weapons capability--or the pursuit \nof that capability--then she is absolutely right; there is no need for \nthe Arak facility that allows them to produce plutonium. There is no \nneed for these underground facilities such as Fordow, where they are \ntrying to hide their program from the rest of the world.\n  The Foreign Minister of Iran, in reaction to her comments, described \nher statement as ``worthless'' and reinforced Iran's position that \ntheir ability to produce atomic energy at the plutonium reactor at Arak \nis not negotiable.\n  This is deeply troubling, and it is one of the reasons we need to \nsend a clear message here and now. They came to the table because of \nsanctions. The sanctions were having a deteriorating effect on their \neconomy. Yet recently we have seen--and this has been my fear--the \nsanctions regime unraveling. They are actually using this negotiation \nwith the administration to further unravel those sanctions in order to \nget what they want without an insurance policy to ensure that we will \nget what we want, and that is what this sanction legislation does.\n  One of the issues that came up in February, a French trade \ndelegation--representing 116 French companies--\n\n[[Page S1141]]\n\ntraveled to Tehran. I recently met with one of the Arab nation's \nForeign Ministers, and he told me that the hotel rooms in Tehran are \nfilled with business men and women looking to line up to do business \nwith Tehran.\n  This is a real issue that the sanctions regime is starting to \nunravel, and the legislation we have pending with 59 cosponsors is an \ninsurance policy to say: If you are not serious about this agreement, \nwe will impose further sanctions to make sure we do everything we can \nto stop you from having nuclear weapons capability.\n  This is a critical moment in the history of this country. This is a \ncritical moment for the safety of the world. We want to stop Iran from \nusing diplomatic means as a way to have nuclear weapons capability \nbecause of the risk it presents to the world.\n  We cannot be naive. We have to understand the prior behavior of Iran \nbecause the prior behavior of Iran will allow us to go in with our eyes \nwide open rather than just taking their assurances that they are \nserious about a nuclear weapons agreement that will stop them from \nhaving this capability.\n  As we stand on the floor, I ask the majority leader to allow a vote \non this legislation so we can send a clear message to Iran and the rest \nof the world that they should not think they should do further business \nwith Iran unless Iran is serious about giving up its nuclear weapons \nprogram through a transparent, verifiable agreement that will ensure \nthey cannot threaten the State of Israel and the rest of the world with \na nuclear weapon. I ask the majority leader to allow a vote on this \nimportant legislation.\n  There are so few pieces of legislation that come through the Senate \nwhich actually have 59 cosponsors. This is one of them. It certainly \nhas strong bipartisan support.\n  I don't buy the argument that if we were to pass this legislation, \nsomehow Iran would walk away from the negotiations. If Iran walks away \nfrom the negotiations because we pass prospective legislation as an \ninsurance policy to make sure they are serious about a real, verifiable \nagreement that stops their nuclear weapons program, then, frankly, we \nknow they have been playing us. Because the reality is, if they are \nserious, they should not care if we put an insurance policy out there. \nIf they are serious, they will follow through and will do what the \ninterim agreement requires and will agree to a final agreement that \nstops their nuclear weapons program in a transparent, verifiable way \nonce and for all.\n  On the other hand, if they are just going to walk away with a threat \nof prospective sanctions, how serious can they be? We will still have \nthe sanctions in place that will continue to put pressure on them to \nsay the United States of America and our allies will not accept a \nnuclear-armed Iran because of the threat it presents to us.\n  We cannot allow the largest state sponsor--and most serious state \nsponsor--of terrorism around the world to have this capability. We \ncannot allow a race in the Middle East--a Sunni-Shia race--to see who \ncan have a nuclear weapon first because of the danger it presents to \nthe world.\n  Finally, we cannot allow Iran to continue to threaten our friend and \nally, the State of Israel. I understand and appreciate that when Iran \nand its leaders have made statements they want to annihilate Israel \nfrom the face of the Earth, our friends in Israel take that very \nseriously. They have vowed never again. We stand with them not only for \ntheir friendship but also for the safety of the world.\n  We have legislation pending on the floor that gives us an opportunity \nto make it clear what the United States of America stands for and that \nwe will not accept a nuclear-armed Iran. They must be serious or there \nwill be consequences in terms of economic sanctions.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/26/senate-section/article/S1141-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1141-S1144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, yesterday we received news that 4 \nmillion people have now signed up in private health care exchanges all \nacross the country. In addition, it was released that about 12 million \npeople have called the call centers in January alone, and 1.1 million \npeople signed up to receive health care through the Affordable Care Act \nduring that time. Young enrollment--the group of individuals for which \nthere has always been a question as to whether they are going to sign \nup for these exchanges--grew by 65 percent.\n  It is time for this body to recognize the Affordable Care Act is \nworking. It is working for people who have been desperate to get \ninsurance. It is working for people who have been getting the short end \nof the stick from insurance companies, and it is working for millions \nof seniors all across this country who have been paying far too much \nfor prescription drug costs and for preventive health care.\n  We have known this from the very beginning in Connecticut. Despite \nthe hiccups over enrollment in the fall period, States such as \nConnecticut that had made a commitment to making this law work, rather \nthan undermining it, have seen the success from day one. Connecticut, \nat the outset, said that we were going to try to enroll between October \n1 and March 31 about 80,000 people. That was our goal. We just \nannounced in Connecticut--a State that is working to implement the law, \nnot undermine the law--that we didn't just hit 80,000, we didn't just \nhit 100,000, but we have enrolled 126,000 Connecticut residents in our \nhealth care exchanges and in Medicaid. Our projection is that we are \ngoing to enroll 150,000 people by March 31. That is nearly double our \ninitial estimate. Last week, traffic on Connecticut's Web site rose 31 \npercent, and the daily enrollments rose by 67 percent.\n  The stories just keep on coming into our office about the lives that \nare being changed as people, for the first time in their lives, get \naccess to affordable health care. People such as Susie Clayton, who has \nbeen dealing with a cancer diagnosis for over a decade--a crippling, \npreexisting condition that for most of her adult life has kept her out \nof the ranks of the insured. I have known Susie for probably two \ndecades. Almost every single conversation I have had with Susie over \nthose 20 years has been about her daily struggle to try to deal with \nher illness and her preexisting condition. Every single day, every \nsingle week, she has thought about whether she is going to be able to \npay for her health care if she has a reoccurrence of her cancer and \nwhether during that time she is going to have a job that provides her \nwith insurance.\n  Susie had been paying about $1,700 a month at last count for an \ninsurance plan she could afford. Her life changed on January 1. She now \nis paying a couple hundred dollars a month in premiums. She finally \ngets to wake up every day not having to worry about whether she is \ngoing to be able to afford coverage, whether she is going to be able to \nsee a doctor to deal with her very difficult diagnosis. With 4 million \npeople now enrolled in these exchanges across the country, that story \ncan be replicated over and over.\n  A bunch of our Republican colleagues have come to the floor over the \nlast couple of days--I was in the presiding chair yesterday listening \nto some speeches--regarding some new information about Medicare \nAdvantage. Everybody knows by now that included in the health care bill \nwas an end to the subsidies given to Medicare Advantage plans. The \nprivate sector in health care and in other industries always tells us \nthey can do things more cheaply than the Federal Government--and a lot \nof times they are right about that--but it was exactly the opposite \nwhen it came to Medicare Advantage. We were paying private insurance \ncompanies 13 percent more than it costs the Federal Government to run \nMedicare. This was a source of enormous profit for the insurance \ncompanies. It didn't make sense to oversubsidize insurance companies to \nrun a program the Federal Government itself was running for 13 percent \nless money. So we ended those subsidies, and part of the elimination of \nthose subsidies has gone into effect.\n  But the story that is being told on the floor today isn't true. The \nfact is that since the Affordable Care Act was\n\n[[Page S1142]]\n\npassed, even as we have been implementing these cuts to these overly \ngenerous, unjustifiable subsidies to insurance companies, Medicare \nAdvantage enrollment has gone up by 30 percent. Thirty percent more \nseniors are now enrolled in Medicare Advantage, even as these cuts have \nbeen imposed. Premiums are down. Medicare Advantage premiums have been \nreduced by 10 percent.\n  Over the course of the debate on the Medicare Advantage cuts, I heard \nRepublican after Republican, when I was in the House of \nRepresentatives, come to the floor and tell us that the sky was going \nto fall when we ended these subsidies to insurance companies. I will be \nhonest. A lot of them are in my State of Connecticut. Not only has the \nsky not fallen, it has risen, with 30 percent more seniors in Medicare \nAdvantage with 10 percent less in premiums. To the argument I have \nheard on this floor that there will be less choices available to \nseniors because of these cuts going into effect, let's just be honest: \nThe average Medicare beneficiary has 18 different Medicare Advantage \nplans to choose from--18 different plans. That is a pretty robust \nmarket.\n  Let me just add that Republicans have voted for these cuts \nthemselves. The Ryan budget, which has essentially been the budget \nstandard for Republicans in both the House and in the Senate--endorsed \nby hundreds of Republican legislators--the Paul Ryan budget included \nthe cuts to Medicare Advantage subsidies because Republicans have \nagreed with Democrats that there is no reason to subsidize insurance \ncompanies instead of subsidizing beneficiaries.\n  So what happened when we decided to stop subsidizing Medicare \nAdvantage? Enrollment went up 30 percent. Premiums went down 10 \npercent. The average beneficiary still had the choice of 18 different \nplans. But we took that money we saved in padding the pockets of health \ncare insurance companies, and we told seniors that when they show up to \nget a preventive health care visit, they are not going to have to pay \nanything out-of-pocket. So since the ACA has been passed, here is how \nmuch a senior has to pay for their annual checkup: Nothing. So 25 \nmillion people have gotten free preventive care since the Affordable \nCare Act has been passed.\n  What else did we do? We decided that this doughnut hole in the \nprescription drug bill, whereby people got coverage up front and then \nthey had to pay for a certain amount of drugs themselves and then they \ngot catastrophic coverage, didn't make sense. So we eliminated the \nprescription drug doughnut hole. It will be gone by 2020. It has been \ncut by more than half already. Since the implementation of the \nAffordable Care Act, the average senior has saved $1,200 in \nprescription drug costs thanks to the Affordable Care Act.\n  So as I listen to my Republican colleagues come to the floor and \ncomplain about the cuts to Medicare Advantage--cuts, in fact, that many \nof them have supported--I think we have to ask ourselves: If we had a \nchoice to provide a 13-percent subsidy to for-profit insurance \ncompanies or pass along $1,200 in savings to American seniors and \neliminate the costs that many of these fixed-income seniors pay when \nthey go in to get preventive care, what would we choose? This is really \nall about choices in this body. It is about choices in terms of where \nwe put the money we spend on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries. To me, \nit is a no-brainer. To the American public, it is a no-brainer. Instead \nof subsidizing insurance companies, let's subsidize hard-working \nseniors, who have built this country, with $1,200 in drug savings and \n25 million people who have gotten free preventive health care.\n  For Republicans who have come down to the floor and said they want to \nrepeal the Affordable Care Act or that they want to repeal the cuts to \nMedicare Advantage plans, essentially they are saying they want to \nreturn billions of dollars to the insurance companies and take away \nthat money from seniors in this country. I do not think that is a \nchoice the American people are going to accept.\n  This week a group of us in the Senate are launching the ACAworks \ncampaign. Later today I will be joined by a number of my colleagues \naround the corner as we launch a new effort to make clear to the \nAmerican people that now, with 4 million people enrolled, and millions \nof people saving money--notwithstanding the legitimate difficulties \nthat were encountered in the first days of the Web site--the Affordable \nCare Act is working. It is working for millions and millions of people \nacross this country who are finally getting care.\n  We will be joined today, as well, by a couple of Medicare recipients \nwho are glad they now have the protection when they get into the \ndoughnut hole. They are glad they now get free preventive care. And \nthey will take the choice any day of this Congress and this government \ninvesting in them instead of investing in big for-profit insurance \ncompanies.\n  None of us deny there are bumps in the road as you rework one-sixth \nof the American economy, which represents our health care economy. None \nof us will deny there is no excuse for the fact that for the first few \nmonths there were a lot of people who were not able to enroll who \nwanted to. But now that the enrollment site is working, now that \noutreach efforts are up and running, record numbers of people are \nsigning up for health care because there is an almost insatiable demand \nfor quality, affordable health care that is now being met as the \nAffordable Care Act is working.\n  I yield back the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I want to begin by thanking my \ncolleague and friend from Connecticut, Senator Murphy, for the very \neloquent and powerful remarks he has just made, showing America the \nConnecticut experience with health care, which shows that the \nAffordable Care Act is working and is expanding opportunities for \nhealth care across the country. Once the myths are exploded, once the \ntruth is told, Americans will appreciate how fortunate we are to have \nthis reform in the way that health care is insured and delivered for \nthe American people.\n  There are bumps in the road, as Senator Murphy has just said. There \nwill continue to be issues to be overcome in achieving success. But the \nenormous potential to make America healthier, to eliminate the anxiety \nand anguish Americans experience in seeking a quality of life that \nhealth care affords, is an opportunity and obligation we cannot shirk. \nI am proud to join with him in speaking this truth and clarifying for \npeople across the country the great promise of this program.\n  A lot of the promise still has to be fulfilled. A lot of the \nrealization about that promise has to be educated. But we will succeed \nin that effort. I thank him and my other colleagues who are joining us \nin seeking to make America realize the great potential and promise that \nwe have, and already the great accomplishments that have been made.\n  Connecticut stands as a model for both the promise and the \naccomplishment in the 130,000 people who have already enrolled in the \nbenefits for young people now permitted to stay on their parents' \npolicies, and, indeed, the elimination of preexisting conditions as an \nobstacle to insurance.\n  I know about many of these issues and obstacles from my time as \nattorney general when I fought insurance companies that denied basic \nopportunities and failed to fulfill their obligation and impose these \nkinds of obstacles. Now, hopefully, insurers will be a partner in this \neffort, and so will the medical community and business community across \nthe country.\n  So I look forward to continuing this effort and thank him for the \nexposition he has given, and my other colleagues who will join us later \ntoday.\n  I want to focus on a group that particularly needs health care in \nthis country, and that is our veterans. We are here to talk about the \nComprehensive Veterans Health and Benefits and Military Retirement Pay \nRestoration Act of 2014--a measure that seeks to address \ncomprehensively the challenges our veterans face today.\n  There are more and more veterans. We are losing some of the \n``greatest generation.'' In fact, we are losing them tragically and \nunfortunately\n\n[[Page S1143]]\n\nevery day. But the next greatest generation needs the same benefits and \nservices we have given to the ``greatest generation.'' The next \ngreatest generation is serving right now and has served recently in the \nwars of Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  We must be unwavering in our commitment to our veterans. We must \ndetermine that this big and broad bill is necessary to keep faith with \nthem and to make sure we meet the diverse and urgent needs they \npresent.\n  We all talk in this body about our commitment to veterans. But all \ntoo often, our Nation has failed to keep faith. I have learned that we \nall have expressed here our admiration and commitment to our Nation's \nveterans. I have introduced, as have many of my colleagues, veterans \nbills based on input from my constituents. In fact, my very first piece \nof legislation as a Senator was the Honoring All Veterans Act.\n  But the reality is this comprehensive approach is necessary. I thank \nSenator Sanders as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee for \nrecognizing that the needs of our veterans are interlocking, \nmultifaceted, and manifold in the kinds of problems that are raised as \nthey leave the military and enter the civilian world.\n  Sometimes it is their medical records that cannot be transferred \nseamlessly from the Department of Defense to Veterans Affairs and \nVeterans' Administration facilities. Sometimes it is the failure to \nmake their military skills transferable in credentials and licensing. \nAnd sometimes it is medical conditions, health care needs for post-\ntraumatic stress and traumatic brain injury, that make their wounds \ninvisible, make them difficult to discern to the ordinary eye but are \nthere deeply and enduringly unless they are treated properly. That is \nwhy health care for them is so important and why this bill expands \nopportunity for health care so dramatically.\n  The health care needs of our veterans must be met through the \nprovisions of this bill that expand health care opportunities and \nservices. When I first came to the Senate, I thought--and I think \nreasonably--that a veteran needing health care could simply go to a VA \nhospital to receive it. But that is really not the case. On January 17, \n2003, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced that it would \n``temporarily'' suspend enrolling Priority Group 8 veterans. That \ntemporary restriction stands today. So under existing restrictions, a \nveteran making as little as $33,577 or a family of five making a \nhousehold income of $50,025 can be denied health benefits in \nConnecticut. There are an estimated 720,000 Priority Group 8 veterans \nwho are not enrolled in health care. Tens of thousands of veterans \napply each year for enrollment and are denied due to that means test.\n  Simply put, the VA should have the capacity and resources to serve \nevery veteran. That is why section 301 of this bill would allow \nveterans who lack that access, who do not have a service-connected \ndisability, and who do not have affordable health insurance, to enroll \nin the VA's health care system.\n  There are other health care provisions: section 305, which expands \nthe provision of chiropractic care; sections 331, 332, and 333, which \nexpand complementary and alternative medicine. Anybody who has not yet \nseen ``Escape Fire'' should view it to understand the stark ways that \nveterans have challenges in access to alternative treatments and why \ndrug addiction and abuse can become such a problem. And there is \nsection 334, expanding wellness programs. All of these programs are \nvital, as well as the expanded access to treatment for post-traumatic \nstress and traumatic brain injury, which, in my view, are at the core \nof the need for this legislation.\n  Section 342 would require the VA to contract with outside providers \nto establish a program of supportive services to family members and \ncaregivers of veterans suffering from mental illness. All of these \ninvisible conditions have such dramatic consequences in the \nemployability of veterans and their ability to give back and continue \nto contribute to this Nation, as so many of them wish to do.\n  The needs of our veterans are also pressing in disability claims. The \nneed to end the backlog is, again, one of the areas addressed directly \nin this bill. The backlog of disability claims at the Department of \nVeterans Affairs has become a chronic problem. The VA is making \nprogress. There is no question that the numbers are better today than \nthey were. But there are still veterans such as Army veteran Jordan \nMassa in Connecticut, who served in Afghanistan, and Marine veteran \nDavid Alexander, who was deployed in Iraq, who had to wait too long and \nsuffered as a result. We need to keep faith with those veterans.\n  I understand and I applaud Secretary Shinseki, who has committed to \ntackling this problem. But some 389,000 claims are still backlogged. In \nConnecticut, about 48 percent of the claims are backlogged, meaning \nthat 48 percent of claims made by our veterans take more than 125 days \nto be resolved. Each of these veterans has an individual story, a \nrecord of service, a record of suffering. Be it in today's wars or \nconflicts past, a record of service and sacrifice is exemplified by \nevery one of them. These individuals may now be looking for employment, \nperhaps, to support a family. We need to keep faith with them.\n  This legislation aims to decrease the backlog further through an \naccelerated appeals process and getting the VA the information it needs \nto decide these claims. It brings in local governments to help with the \nclaims. And it helps veterans who have misfiled documents in the claims \nprocess to seek a better route to what they need and deserve.\n  The bill also would require regular reports to Congress on efforts to \neliminate the backlog. Accountability is so critical--accountability on \nbacklogs, on all of the issues that underlie the failure to process \nthese claims as quickly as they should be. And the backlog must be \neliminated.\n  Employment programs are also addressed in this bill. So are the \ntraumatic effects of sexual assault. The bill is multifaceted and \ncomprehensive, as it should be. To address the diverse and urgent \nneeds, it must be big and broad because the needs and challenges of our \nveterans are big and broad.\n  The reality is that 1 million men and women will leave the military \nover the next 5 years. One million patriotic and brave men and women \nwill be separating from our Armed Forces. Becoming veterans, they will \nneed services and benefits that they have earned, and they will need \nthem at the time they leave, not at some distant point in the future. \nWe owe it to them now to keep faith.\n  I have submitted amendments that would address some of the other \nissues.\n  For example, the need to recognize that post-traumatic stress is not \nonly a condition that afflicts our current military men and women and \nveterans but also past veterans, even though it was undiagnosed and \nuntreated at the time. Changing their status so as to recognize post-\ntraumatic stress for the veterans of past wars is a need that we need \nto address.\n  I will make sure those veterans of past wars, whether it is Vietnam \nor Korea or any of those conflicts in our history, receive a second \nlook at their discharge. That is the purpose of the amendment. That is \nthe purpose of legal action that has been brought by the Yale veterans \nclinic. I will continue to support it.\n  We can go further as well to enhance our veterans' health by \nincluding the Toxic Exposure Research and Military Family Support Act \nin this measure. I have an amendment that will do so. Many veterans \nwere exposed to toxic chemicals such as Agent Orange and their needs \nare only beginning to be addressed.\n  In addition to the harmful effects to those individuals, there are \nalso impacts on their children. For many years those who were exposed \nto Agent Orange were told there was no evidence that their symptoms \nresulted from that. Now that we have evidence Agent Orange is toxic, we \nneed to include the longer term effects on their children and their \nfamilies. The amendment I have offered would address those issues.\n  Even if none of those amendments I have proposed are adopted during \nthis process, this measure stands on its own as a historic step \nforward. It is, indeed, a historic recognition of the obligation and \nopportunity we have at this point in our history to make sure we leave \nno veterans behind and keep faith with our veterans, address their \nneeds in a\n\n[[Page S1144]]\n\nbig and broad bill that reflects the urgent and diverse issues and \nchallenges they face. I am proud to support it.\n  I thank my colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs Committee who have \napproved many of the parts of this bill by unanimous vote or \noverwhelming bipartisan majorities. This cause should be truly \nbipartisan. Let's move forward and move America forward addressing the \nneeds and challenges of its veterans as we have an obligation to do. We \nmust keep faith with our veterans and leave no veterans behind.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me thank Senators Murray, Durbin, and \nBlumenthal for their very thoughtful and important remarks regarding \nthe needs of veterans and why it is absolutely imperative we pass this \ncomprehensive veterans legislation. Let me also begin by thanking all \nof the members of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs for their \nvery hard work in helping to craft what is not only an enormously \nimportant piece of legislation impacting the lives of millions of our \nveterans but is also, to a large degree, a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation.\n  It is no secret that Congress today is extraordinarily partisan and, \nin fact, is largely dysfunctional. On major issue after major issue the \nAmerican people are crying out to us and asking that we address the \nserious problems facing this country. Yet we are unable to do virtually \nanything. I hope--and I say this from the bottom of my heart, and as \nchairman of the Senate veterans committee--that at least on the issue \nof addressing their needs--the need to protect and defend those \nveterans who have protected and defended us, those men and women who \nhave put their lives on the line to protect this country--we can rise \nabove the partisan rancor that we see down here on the floor every \nsingle day.\n  That is what the American people want us to do. Not only has the \nveterans community been clear on the need to pass this bill, but that \nis what the American people want us to do. They understand the \nsacrifices made by veterans and their families, and they want us to \nrise above the partisan acrimony the American people see every single \nday.\n  Let me be very clear, and let there be no misunderstanding about \nthis. I have tried, as chairman of the committee, to do everything I \ncan to bring forth legislation which includes provisions from \nRepublicans and provisions from Democrats. My view is, and has been, \nthat if there is a good idea that improves the lives of veterans--I \ndon't care if there is an ``R'' attached to a Senator's name, a ``D'' \nor an ``I,'' as in my case--let's bring forth that legislation.\n  The reality is, to the best of my knowledge, there are 26 separate \nprovisions that Republican Members have authored or cosponsored--that \nis a lot--and some of them are very significant provisions. Further, \nperhaps most importantly, two of the most important parts of this \ncomprehensive legislation are omnibus bills that were passed \nunanimously by the committee. So what we have done is brought ideas \ntogether in two of the most important provisions in this bill, with two \nseparate omnibus bills passed unanimously by the committee. There are \nother provisions in the bill that were not passed unanimously but also \npassed with bipartisan support.\n  I also want to point out the two provisions that were not discussed \nat the committee level but have been passed almost unanimously by the \nRepublican-controlled House of Representatives, and I believe have \nstrong bipartisan support in the Senate. With almost unanimous votes, \nthe House passed a provision that would solve a long-standing problem \nand enable the VA to enter into 27 major medical facility leases in 18 \nStates and Puerto Rico. We have virtually that same language in our \nbill, and that was passed almost unanimously in the House. So I think \nthat is a nonpartisan, bipartisan provision.\n  A second provision passed by the House with very broad support deals \nwith ensuring that veterans can take full advantage of the post 9/11 GI \nbill and get in-State tuition in the State in which they currently \nlive. That language I believe is identical in our bill.\n  So we have major provisions passed in the Republican House with \nalmost unanimous support that are in this bill, and there are two \nomnibus provisions passed with unanimous support out of our committee, \nand we have other provisions passed with bipartisan support.\n  So while I am not here to say this is 100-percent bipartisan, because \nit is not, we have gone a very long way to do what has not been done \nvery often here in the Senate, and that is to bring everybody's ideas \ntogether to pass something that is terribly important for our veterans.\n  The point I am trying to make here is that I happen to believe that \nvirtually every Member of the Senate, regardless of their political \npoint of view, does care about veterans. I say this especially about \nthe members of the committee--the Veterans' Affairs Committee--who \nwould not be on the committee if they didn't care about veterans. I \nbelieve that virtually every Member of the Senate wants to do the best \nthey can for veterans. That is why I have worked so hard to do my best \nto make sure this bill is as bipartisan as it can be.\n  In my view, this is, in fact, a very good bill. But like any other \npiece of legislation, it can be made better. We have 50 States, we have \nNative American tribes, and we have all kinds of issues out there. \nThere are 100 Senators here in this body who know their States, who \nknow their issues. So let me be very clear in echoing what the majority \nleader said this morning, and that is he and I want to encourage every \nMember of the Senate--Democrat, Republican, and Independent--who has \ngermane amendments dealing with veterans issues to please offer those \namendments. Bring them to the floor.\n\n  My understanding is a number of amendments have already been offered \nby Democratic Senators and we have some amendments now that have been \noffered by Republican Senators. I understand Senator Rubio and Senator \nCollins have offered amendments, as well as a number of Democrats. We \nlook forward to more amendments coming to the floor so that we can have \na serious discussion about those amendments.\n  I hope the one thing that will not happen is that, as we discuss this \nlegislation, instead of having an honest debate about the needs of \nveterans, that this legislation becomes another forum for the same old \npartisan politics we have seen for years--the sort of partisan politics \nthe American people are increasingly disgusted with. The American \npeople understand that honest people have differences of opinion on the \nissues, but they do not want to see serious legislation being sabotaged \nbecause of political partisanship.\n  In my view, with regard to this veterans bill and the fact we have \nlanguage in this bill which can improve the lives of millions of \nveterans and their families, I believe it would be extremely \ndisrespectful to the men and women who have put their lives on the line \nto defend this country to use this piece of legislation dealing with \nveterans issues as nothing more than a political pawn for other issues \nthat are totally extraneous to their needs.\n\n[[Page S1145]]\n\n  I fully understand--no great secret here--that my Republican \ncolleagues do not like the Affordable Care Act. They are entitled to \ntheir opinion. We have discussed this issue and this law over and over. \nI ask my Republican colleagues: Please, do not inject ObamaCare into \nthe veterans debate. It has nothing to do with the needs of veterans.\n  I understand some of my Republican colleagues have strong feelings \nabout sanctions in Iran. Clearly, this is an important issue. But it \nhas nothing to do with the needs of veterans in this country. Please, \ndo not inject the Iran sanctions issue into a debate on how we can \nimprove the lives of veterans and their families.\n  I know there are strong feelings and disagreements about the wisdom \nor lack of wisdom of the Keystone Pipeline. I have my views on the \nissue. Other people have their views on the issue. But, frankly, the \nKeystone Pipeline has nothing to do with the needs of our veterans. And \nthere are many other issues out there.\n  Let me at this point quote from a tweet that came out last night from \nthe Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America association, and this is \nwhat they say. This is the organization that represents the men and \nwomen who have fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is what they said \nlast night:\n\n       The Senate should not get distracted while debating and \n     voting on the vets bill. Iran sanctions, ObamaCare, et \n     cetera, aren't relevant to S. 1982.\n\n  That is the issue we are debating today, and I absolutely agree with \nthe IAVA on this issue. They also say in another tweet:\n\n       In 2013, veterans were not immune from gridlock in \n     Washington. This year has to be different. We urge the Senate \n     to pass this legislation.\n\n  As I mentioned yesterday, this legislation, in fact, has the support \nof virtually every veterans organization in the country, representing \nmillions and millions of veterans, from the American Legion to the VFW, \nthe DAV to the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the Vietnam \nVeterans of America to the Disabled American Veterans and the Paralyzed \nVeterans of America. We have dozens of organizations that know how \nimportant this legislation is to their members.\n\n  So my plea to my colleagues is let's debate veterans' issues. If you \nhave an idea to improve this bill, I welcome it. Let's have that \ndebate. I do not believe this legislation is immune to improvement. We \ncan improve it, but please do not inject extraneous issues in here for \ntotally political reasons. I think that is unfair to the veterans of \nthis country.\n  As the Presiding Officer well knows, on Veterans Day and Memorial \nDay, I--and I suspect every Member of the Senate--go out and speak to \nveterans. We express our deep respect for them and their families and \nthe appreciation for all they have done for our country. Today I hope \nwe can keep faith with those promises. Let us focus on veterans' \nissues. Let us get the best bill we can. Let's not kill this bill \nbecause of the same old same old partisan situation we face.\n  I will take a few minutes to discuss why we have brought forth this \nlegislation, which has been described as the most comprehensive piece \nof veterans legislation to have come before Congress in decades.\n  While in recent years the President and Congress have made good \nprogress--I think the President's budgets have been good; I think \nCongress, in a bipartisan way, has done a good job in addressing many \nof the problems facing the veterans community--the truth is, and I hope \neverybody knows, we still have a very long way to go. Now I will \ndiscuss some of the outstanding issues this bill addresses.\n  I think anybody who has nursed a child or a parent who is ill or \ninjured knows how difficult and stressful this is; how sometimes you \nhave to stay up all night, how sometimes you have to stay with your \npatient 24 hours a day. I would like people to be thinking about what \nit means day after day, week after week, month after month, year after \nyear, to be taking care of those veterans who are severely disabled in \nwar.\n  Think about, for a moment, what the stress is and how much of your \nown life you have given up to your loved ones, and there are tens of \nthousands of spouses who are now doing nursing and caring for veterans \nfrom World War II, from Korea, from Vietnam, from Iraq, from \nAfghanistan. That is what they are doing right now, and they are doing \nit because they love their husbands or their wives or their sons or \ndaughters.\n  The very good news is in 2010 Congress passed legislation to develop \na caregivers program for post-9/11 disabled vets. This was a huge step \nforward. What it said is for those men and women who came back from \nIraq and Afghanistan, perhaps without legs, perhaps blind, perhaps \nwithout arms, perhaps ill in one way or another through PTSD or TBI, we \nwere going to make sure their wives, their mothers, their sisters, \ntheir brothers, their children had the support they need to provide the \nkind of inhome nursing care those veterans need. This legislation has \nbeen very successful for post-9/11 veterans. I will give one example \nand there are obviously many.\n  One family who benefited from the VA's caregiver program is Ed and \nKaren Matayka. They live in my home State of Vermont. In 2010, Ed and \nKaren were deployed together as medics to Afghanistan with the Vermont \nArmy National Guard, a National Guard of which many of us in Vermont \nare very proud. Just 2 days before Independence Day, the vehicle Ed was \nriding in was hit by an IED. The driver, Vermont's Ryan Grady, was \nkilled. We remember that loss very well. Ed and three others were \nseverely injured. Ed lost one leg immediately, suffered a stroke and a \nsevere spinal cord injury. Soon thereafter his other leg was amputated \nabove the knee and he suffered yet another stroke.\n  After 3 years of rehabilitation, Ed was medically retired from the \nArmy. Because of VA's caregiver program--a program we established in \n2010 for post-9/11 veterans and their families--his wife Karen was able \nto separate from the Army as well as become her husband's full-time \ncaregiver. Karen spends a significant amount of time every day caring \nfor Ed. She helps Ed with personal care, fixing his meals, and all of \nhis transportation, including to and from medical appointments. Karen \nhas gone through the training program and receives a monthly stipend to \nhelp compensate for her loss of income.\n  I think that is the right thing to do. I am not sure there are too \nmany Members in the Senate who don't think that is the right thing to \ndo. Here is a guy who suffered terrible wounds. His wife is now giving \nup her career to care for him. Should we not help that family? I think \nwe should. Thanks to this program Ed and Karen are able to continue \ntheir lives together in their home.\n  Another important point: What might the alternative be? Send Ed to a \nnursing home where he would be uncomfortable, not get the care of a \nloved one, and at great expense to the VA? So this saves us money and \nprovides better care for our veterans. This is what we did in the post-\n9/11 caregiver bill. The problem is the bill only applies to post-9/11 \nveterans.\n  What I think should happen, what the veterans community thinks should \nhappen, and what I believe the American people think should happen is \nwe should expand that program to all veterans of all wars and their \nfamilies. There are tens of thousands of family members today who are \ncaring 24/7 for veterans wounded in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and \nother wars. They deserve the same benefits the post-9/11 veterans \nfamilies are now receiving. That important provision is in this \nlegislation, and I hope my colleagues support it.\n  There is another important provision in this legislation. This is a \nvery important and sensitive issue. There are some 2,300 veterans who \nserved in Iraq and Afghanistan who, because of a variety of injuries, \nare unable to start the families they have wanted to start. Some \ninjuries are spinal cord, some may be genital injuries, some just \naffect the reproductive organs, and they are no longer able to have \nbabies. Many of these young men and women want to have babies, to raise \ntheir children, and, as much as they can, to have a normal family.\n  Right now the VA does not offer reproductive treatments to veterans, \nmeaning the most seriously injured among them cannot access the \ntreatment or care needed to start a family.\n\n[[Page S1146]]\n\nSenator Murray, former chair of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, was \non the floor yesterday speaking at great length about this important \nissue. I believe that if we send young people off to war and they \nbecome injured and if they want to start a family, we have to assist \nthem in being able to do so. That provision is included in this \nlegislation.\n  I will talk about another issue we deal with in this bill. \nUnfortunately, yesterday in discussion this provision was \nmischaracterized by some who spoke against it. This provision deals \nwith expanding VA health care and making sure some, including some very \nvulnerable veterans who are today not eligible for VA health care, in \nfact become eligible.\n  Currently, VA uses an extremely complicated system to determine \neligibility based on income for veterans without service-connected \ninjuries, often what we call priority 8 veterans. The VA now determines \nincome eligibility by looking at the income of an individual and his or \nher family county by county in each State. I don't know how many \nthousands of counties we have in the United States of America, but I \nwill discuss what this means in the real world in terms of how the VA \ncurrently determines income eligibility.\n  My own State of Vermont is a small State--620,000 people. We are a \nrural State. There are just 14 counties. In Vermont, as throughout the \ncountry, each county has its own threshold for determining eligibility \nfor priority group 8 veterans.\n  For a veteran living in Chittenden County, where I live, the \nthreshold to enroll in the VA health care is less than $48,000, but for \na veteran living in Windham County, in the southern part of the State, \nthe threshold is less than $39,000. That is a difference of nearly \n$9,000.\n  In the State of Georgia, there are 159 counties and nearly as many \nincome thresholds. Imagine that. For a veteran living in Walton County, \nGA, the threshold is less than $41,000. But if a veteran lives in \nCoffee County, the threshold is just over $28,000. It may make sense to \nsome people. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.\n  In the State of Texas, there are 254 counties. For a veteran living \nin Brazoria County near Houston, the threshold is less than $48,000. \nFor a veteran living in Bee County, the threshold is less than $31,000. \nThat is a difference of over $17,000. Frankly, this whole process does \nnot make a lot of sense, and I know from personal experience it is \ntotally confusing to veterans: Am I eligible for VA health care? It \ndepends on which county you live in. It depends on which side of the \nroad you live. This makes no sense at all.\n  This legislation simplifies the system. We establish a single income \nthreshold for an entire State. So instead of having thousands of income \nthresholds, we have 50. It is true that the threshold we use would be \nthe highest in each State, therefore, making more veterans eligible for \nVA health care. In my view, this is exactly what we should be doing.\n  There may be some in the Senate who believe a veteran in a given \nState who earns all of $28,000 a year should not be eligible for VA \nhealth care because he or she is ``too rich.'' I respectfully disagree. \nVA provides high-quality, cost-effective health care. There are many \nveterans in this country struggling economically who want and need VA \nhealth care.\n  I should also add that these newly eligible veterans will pay a \ncopayment just like all other currently eligible priority 8 veterans. \nFrankly, I would prefer those veterans receive high-quality care at the \nVA, rather than going into an emergency room at 10 times the cost when \nthey become ill.\n  Let me reiterate. Unlike what some of my colleagues said yesterday, \nthis important provision does not open VA health care to every veteran \nin America--and there are 22 million of them--nor does it open the \nfloodgates, bringing in millions and millions of veterans.\n  I cannot give an estimate, nor can anybody else, how many will take \nadvantage of this provision, but it will be a manageable number, \nlargely because we make very clear--and this is an important point some \nof my colleagues apparently did not understand. We make it very clear \nin this legislation that the VA has 5 full years to fully implement \nthis provision in a way that will not negatively impact current patient \nneeds. So anyone who says it is going to open the floodgates for every \nveteran is not accurate, and that because all of these veterans are \ncoming in we are going to diminish the quality of care for current \nveterans is not accurate. Let me reiterate this point, which is also in \nthe bill. We understand that the highest priority--and we have talked \nto disabled American veterans about this issue--for VA health care is \nto take care of those veterans with service-connected problems. That is \nthe case today and that will remain the case after this bill is passed \ntomorrow. Those with disabilities and those with service-connected \nproblems will remain the highest priority.\n\n  This is a long discussion, and we could go on and on for hours about \nthis. I am also on the health committee and I have studied this issue a \nlittle bit. There were some very harsh criticisms made yesterday about \nVA health care. The truth is that the Veterans' Administration runs 151 \nmedical centers. They run some 900 community-based outreach clinics. \nThey have hundreds of vet centers.\n  The VA is the largest integrated health care system in the United \nStates of America. It employs hundreds of thousands of workers, \ndoctors, nurses, technicians, you name it. Obviously no one has ever \nsuggested that VA health care is perfect or that there aren't problems \nwithin the system. I have talked to veterans in Vermont, and I have \ntalked to veterans all over the country, and by and large there is very \nstrong support for VA health care. These veterans understand that when \nthey walk into a VA facility, the people who are there to treat them \nunderstand their problems, and many of the workers are veterans.\n  I think if you talk to the veterans community, they will tell you not \nthat the VA does not have its share of problems, it certainly does, and \nnot that we should not focus vigorously on improving the care at VA, \nbut they will tell you by and large the care they are getting is good \ncare.\n  The point I want to make is that before we eviscerate, as was the \ncase yesterday, the Veterans Health Administration's health care \nsystem, let us remember today about what is going on in terms of health \ncare in America. Let us understand that the VA is not the only health \ncare system in this country which has problems.\n  Today, as a nation, we are the only major country on Earth that \ndoesn't guarantee health care to all of its people as a right. Today \nthere are tens of millions of people--even after the Affordable Care \nAct--who lack any health insurance.\n  Let's remember that 45,000 people--according to a Harvard study--die \neach year because they don't get to a doctor on time because they lack \nhealth insurance. Let us not forget that in the midst of high premiums, \nhigh copayments, and lack of insurance, the United States of America \nspends almost twice as much per person on health care as do the people \nof any other nation. Many of those other nations that spend a fraction \nof what we spend have better health care outcomes than we did in terms \nof life expectancy, infant mortality, and many other important \noutcomes.\n  I will also add that before we go about attacking, in a rather \nvicious way, the Veterans Health Administration's health care system, \nwe should understand that according to a recent study that appeared in \nthe Journal of Patient Study that between 210,000 and 400,040 people \neach year who go to the hospital for care suffer some type of \npreventable harm that contributes to their death. According to that \nstudy, that number would make medical errors the third leading cause of \ndeath in America behind heart disease and cancer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used the hour of postcloture \ndebate time.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. My point in saying that is not to say that the VA health \ncare system doesn't have its problems.\n\n[[Page S1147]]\n\nIt is to say that we have problems in every health institution in \nAmerica. That is what we have.\n  When you look at the VA--and I can go on and on--they are doing some \ncutting-edge work. If you look at health care technology and health \ncare records, the VA has led the country in that direction.\n  There was a discussion yesterday--an absolutely correct discussion--\nabout our concerns within the VA and outside of the VA and about \novermedication of people who are dealing with pain problems. To the \nbest of my knowledge, the VA is leading the country and doing cutting-\nedge work in complementary and alternative medicine with good results. \nThey are saying that maybe we don't have to use all of this medication. \nMaybe we can use acupuncture, maybe we can use yoga, and maybe we can \nuse meditation. They are doing that aggressively. By the way, this \nlegislation expands those programs.\n  One of the crises in American health care today is our failure in \nterms of developing a strong primary health care system. Guess what. \nThe VA has 900 primary health care facilities all over this country. \nThe VA has women's health centers which deal with the specific needs of \nchildren.\n  I could go on and on about it. It is not fair to pick on the VA. They \nare vulnerable. Every problem they have is on the front pages of the \nnewspapers.\n  I will never forget that a good friend of mine went into a hospital \nand died of an infection. It didn't make the front pages of the paper. \nThat is happening all over America.\n  Yes, of course, we want to improve the VA health care system, but let \nus thank the hundreds of thousands of highly qualified and dedicated \nworkers who are providing quality care to their patients.\n  Lastly, I want to say a word on something I feel very strongly about. \nI have always believed that dental care should be an integral part of \nhealth care as a nation and within the VA, and what this bill does for \na first time, through a pilot project, is begin the process of opening \ndental care for nonservice-connected veterans.\n  There are a number of other provisions I will talk about later. Here \nis the bottom line: We owe more than we can ever pay back to people who \nsacrifice so much for this country. I think it is important that we \npass this comprehensive legislation. I think it is terribly important \nthat we have a serious debate about the serious issues facing the \nveterans community.\n  I look forward to my colleagues--Republican, Democrat, and \nIndependent--bringing forth their ideas and amendments, but please do \nnot disrespect those people who have sacrificed so much by killing this \nbill because of the same old politics we have struggled with for years. \nThis is a veterans bill. Let's discuss veterans issues.\n  I yield the floor and thank my colleague for allowing me the extra 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, as Paul Harvey used to say on the radio: Now \nthe rest of the story. We just heard a very glamorous description of \nbipartisanship and benefits that have been not provided equitably to \nveterans. What I would like to do is try and focus on reality and \ndiscuss what is actually in the bill, what is not in the bill, and what \nwas the intent of Congress. What is the shape of the Veterans \nAdministration?\n  I will start with one very important thing. My colleague pointed out \nthat most of the veterans organizations support this bill. He is, in \nfact, correct. I will read from an editorial written by the CEO of \nConcerned Veterans of America. I won't read the whole thing and bore \nthe President or those who listen, but he says:\n\n       But given the vast scope of this bill, we should be \n     skeptical. In recent years, the VA, which will take on a wide \n     range of expanded responsibilities should this bill become \n     law, has come under fire for dysfunctional management and \n     poor service to veterans. If the VA is already failing to \n     meet its obligations to veterans, is it wise to extend its \n     mission even further? Of course not. And while we need to \n     restore the shortsighted cuts to the military pensions, there \n     are more narrow ways to address these cuts, such as Sen. \n     Kelly Ayotte's (R-N.H.) military pensions bill, S. 1977.\n       It's troubling that under this bill, VA services would be \n     expanded far beyond veterans with combat injuries and \n     service-connected disabilities, fundamentally changing the \n     founding mission of VA. This will only flood the VA system \n     with new claimants, many of whom would be better served by \n     health coverage in the private insurance market.\n       Veterans seeking VA care already face wait times of months \n     and even years; further expanding eligibility to veterans who \n     would be better served by other healthcare options will only \n     stretch the VA to its breaking point. There is also currently \n     no cost estimate of this massive expansion.\n       Meanwhile, there is another compelling question of costs. \n     Sanders has proposed shifting funding from the Pentagon's \n     Overseas Contingency Operations to pay for these expanded \n     veterans priorities. But taking funding from the men and \n     women serving in Afghanistan and elsewhere is shortsighted \n     and could otherwise endanger their lives. That approach will \n     likely meet a chilly reception in the House of \n     Representatives, and justifiably so.\n       This means that Sanders' $30 billion bill would be paid for \n     through the accumulation of additional debt. The CVA has been \n     clear that Washington needs to ``cut debt, not vets.'' With \n     $17 trillion in debt and massive annual deficits, our country \n     faces a fiscal crisis of unparalleled scope. Now is not the \n     time, in any federal department, to spend money we don't \n     have.\n       To be sure, there's much to like in the Sanders bill. And \n     if those components were presented as separate, smaller \n     bills, as part of a carefully considered long-term strategy \n     to reform the VA, hold leadership accountable and improve \n     services to veterans, we would have no problem extending \n     enthusiastic support.\n       As with so many bloated legislative projects in today's \n     Washington, the overreaching and overpromising in this bill \n     will only lead to disappointment and recriminations as the \n     high costs and unanticipated consequences are revealed. That \n     will be followed by demands for an entirely new round of \n     ``comprehensive'' reform, and the cycle will begin anew.\n       Congress should go back to the drawing board, assume a more \n     modest approach and take up these proposals on an individual \n     basis. That's the better path to achieving enduring and \n     effective reform of, and accountability for, the services we \n     provide to our veterans.\n\n  I point that out because he is a CEO of a veterans organization. Not \nall veterans organizations agree that more is necessarily better and \nthat to blindly add to the system is not necessarily good.\n  My colleague mentioned that there was a 5-year implementation. I have \nthe legislation right here. It is title 3, subtitle A. Expansion and \nimprovements of benefits generally, requirements for enrollment in the \npatient enrollment system of the Department of Veterans Affairs of \ncertain veterans eligible for enrollment by law but not currently \npermitted to enroll.\n  It goes through all the subsections and basically says the Secretary \nshall provide for the enrollment in the patient enrollment system of \nveterans specified in paragraph 2 by no later than December 31, 2014.\n  Well, in section 2, veterans with noncompensible service-connected \ndisabilities rated as zero percent disabled who are not otherwise \npermitted to enroll in a system as of the date of enactment of the \nComprehensive Veterans Health and Benefit Military Retirement Pay \nRestoration Act of 2014--under this section they do not have access to \nhealth insurance except through a health exchange.\n  My colleague sat on the floor and begged me not to talk about the \nAffordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act is in his bill. It is \nreferenced in his bill.\n\n  Now, get this: The Affordable Care Act has been portrayed as the \nsolution to the health care problem in America. Forget for a minute the \nfact that premiums have increased for practically everybody in \nAmerica--90 percent have seen increases. The $2,500 savings per family \nis a wish, a hope, and a dream.\n  My colleagues think so much of the Affordable Care Act that if the \nonly choice for a veteran is the Affordable Care Act, then they can opt \nto go into the VA. If the Affordable Care Act and the exchange are so \ngood, why would we want to shift them from something good into \nsomething that is questionable, based upon what the editorial said.\n  My colleague said the VA has the best health care system in the \nworld. It does. The hospital system has been rated high practically \nevery year it has been rated. I made the statement yesterday: Why would \nwe take a system that is broken and stuff more people into it? Why \nwouldn't we focus the debate on how to reform the system?\n\n[[Page S1148]]\n\n  This is one year's worth of inspector general reports on health care \nfacilities, over 40 healthcare inspections reports that have been \nreleased by the inspector general. I can tell my colleagues what is in \nfront of the VA. They can't even get their hands around their own \ninspector general's report. These are deaths of veterans. These are \nindividuals who used somebody else's insulin pen. This is legionnaires \ndisease. This is a system that drastically needs reform. This is not a \nMember of the Senate making an accusation, it is the inspector general \nof the Veterans' Administration and all of these reports from 12 \nmonths. Yet we are talking about a massive expansion of the Veterans' \nAdministration, where the chairman says: Oh, they have 5 years to do \nit.\n  I am reading the legislation. There is no 5 years. There is a \nspecified expansion of who is included in it, and it says the Secretary \nwill do it by December 31, 2014. If the phase-in is there, then the \nchairman can come down and read me the language where it says 5 years. \nI am certainly not trying to mislead anybody, although I am trying to \nmake sure we get the facts on the floor of what this legislation \nactually does.\n  The chairman talked about bipartisanship. He is correct. Quite a few \nof the bills in his package are my bills, and they passed out of \ncommittee with unanimous support. Incorporated in his bill are 143 \nprovisions, 26 of which are Republican. I have never judged whether I \nliked the bill based upon how many of my proposals were in it or how \nmany proposals from my side of the aisle were in it; I base it on what \nis in the bill. What are the policies? What is our intent? Do we \naccomplish that in the language of the legislation?\n  Let's look at it for just a minute. There are no reforms--zero. Zero \nreforms are in the bill. It is a massive expansion of individuals in \nthe system. As a matter of fact, under this piece of legislation, the \nVA doesn't even support it. Let me read what the Principal Deputy Under \nSecretary for Health, Dr. Robert Jesse, said. He indicated that \nexpanding enrollment of Priority 8 veterans ``presents many potential \ncomplications and uncertain effects on VA's enrollment system.'' This \nis the individual in charge of health at the VA who says: I don't think \nthis is a good idea.\n  So I guess the only mistake the chairman made was--he suggested that \nI was opposed to it, and he was accurate, but he didn't ever say the VA \nis opposed to this massive expansion.\n  He talked about the caregiver bill. I know something about it because \nI wrote it. We implemented it as a demonstration project. Why? Because \nSenator Akaka and I believed the VA was not in a position to absorb \nthis massive program and to administer and implement it in an effective \nway. As a matter of fact, Senator Akaka said at the time--he was then \nthe chair of the veterans' committee--he said there were three reasons \nhe was reluctant to--well, let me just say that when the caregivers \nprogram came up in debate on the Senate floor, Senator Akaka, then \nchair, noted that these benefits and services were not made available \nfor all veterans for three reasons:\n\n       [O]ne, the needs and circumstances of the newest veterans \n     in terms of injuries are different--different--from those of \n     veterans from other eras; two, the family situation of the \n     younger veterans is different from that of older veterans; \n     and three, by targeting this initiative on a specific group \n     of veterans, the likelihood of successful undertaking is \n     enhanced.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, would the author of the caregivers program \nnot be the first one to come to the floor and lobby for an expansion? I \nthink the answer is yes. But would the author of the caregivers \nlegislation want to wait until the system can handle it?\n  Do my colleagues realize that in two States in America, a veteran can \nfile for caregiver status in one State and be denied and file the same \napplication in another and be granted caregiver status? It happened in \nColorado and Florida. How, in a system that is created to equally treat \nveterans, is that possible? Now we want to extend it to veterans of all \neras. I would suggest to my colleagues that this is almost ludicrous to \neven think about.\n  I see quite a few Members here, and I am not going to take up but a \ncouple more minutes. I want to make sure my colleagues understand that \nmy opposition is not to veterans. My opposition is to proceeding with \nlegislation that could hurt veterans, not help them. In this particular \ncase, more is not necessarily better. As the CEO of Concerned Veterans \nof America stated, the right congressional action would be to stop, \ntake a breath, and focus what is broken. Fix the system. Then have a \ndebate about which veterans, if any, should be included in the VA \ndelivery of care.\n  The chairman highlighted yesterday that incorporated in both his bill \nand my bill is a House provision that provides leases for 27 new VA \noutpatient facilities. He said: That is proof we have in the system \nenough facilities to handle the population. No, Mr. Chairman, that is \nnot proof. Those 27 leases are for trying to make sure we have \nfacilities to handle our current population within the VA. Those \nveterans who are driving over 2 hours for a primary care visit, those \nindividuals whose transportation is their No. 1 issue--27 doesn't even \nget us up to taking care of today's population.\n  As I said yesterday, we have I know $14 billion worth of construction \nthat is currently underway in the VA; yet we appropriate $1 billion a \nyear. It will take us 14 years to build out the inventory we have \ntoday. But the legislation calls for an incredible increase in the size \nof the veterans population by December of 2014. We won't have any of \nthose 27 facilities that would be legislated in this bill done by \nDecember 2014.\n  So I am going to urge my colleagues, as we move forward, let's not do \nanything to damage veterans. Let's not do anything to overwhelm the \nVeterans' Administration. Let's commit to work with them to reform the \nsystem. Let's listen to what they want and not put them in a situation \nwhere they are telling us: We don't want what you are proposing. Let's \nlisten and let's apply common sense to legislation versus to just be \nfocused on the cheers we receive from a few who are paid to represent \nfolks in Washington.\n  The chairman said a number of times that this is about veterans. I \ncan tell my colleagues it is a little bit more. It is about the \nAmerican people. It is about my kids, our kids, our grandchildren. It \nis about what they inherit from us. They are going to inherit from us \nprobably the most important thing: the obligation to keep our promise \nto veterans of all eras.\n  I think the decision we have to make as we debate this legislation is \nwhether we are going to commit to a promise that is bigger than what \nour kids can fulfill, that costs more than our kids can afford, and \nthat doesn't necessarily enhance the health care delivered to our \nveterans. If anything, today it would probably be detrimental to those \nwho need it the most.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his patience. I thank my colleagues \nfor their indulgence as they have patiently waited. This is way too big \nan issue to rush forward with. I look forward over the next several \ndays to a real debate about the specifics in this bill and, more \nimportantly, about what we should do as a Congress to help veterans and \nto help the Veterans' Administration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I did not come to speak on this bill, \nalthough I certainly appreciate the remarks of my colleague from North \nCarolina I also see the chairman is here. I say to the chairman of the \ncommittee, I am only prepared to speak on a separate subject probably \nfor 5 to 7 minutes.\n  As I said, I appreciate the comments of my colleague, particularly \nwhen we are dealing with veterans, their benefits, and health care in \nparticular. We need to be very careful in terms of what we are doing so \nwe do it the right way because we owe them all our Nation's gratitude \nfor the sacrifices they have made. As veteran myself, I have some \nappreciation of that. My daughter married into a military family. \nNevertheless, we need to be very careful how we go forward in making \nsure the care they get through the VA system is the very best care \npossible. My colleague has outlined a number of issues that need to be \ndebated, and I dearly hope the majority leader will allow us the \nopportunity to not only debate but vote on the alternative which, in my \nopinion, addresses the issue in the very best way.\n\n[[Page S1149]]\n\n                          Medical Device Taxes\n\n  Today I come to speak about the President's visit to Minnesota. I \nwish it were Indiana. He is going there for the purpose, as stated, of \ndiscussing a new initiative--I think it is a transportation \ninitiative--that he hopes will create jobs and stimulate economic \ngrowth. Clearly, that has been an ongoing challenge for this \nadministration.\n  How ironic. How ironic to go to Minnesota, a State like my home State \nof Indiana, which has been one of the most negatively impacted by the \nexcise taxes imposed upon one of its most dynamic job creators--the \nmedical device industry. How ironic it is to go to Minnesota and talk \nabout creating jobs and economic growth while at the same time \npromoting a provision that was incorporated in the Affordable Care Act \nthat imposes an egregious excise tax on not the profits but on the \nsales receipts of medical device companies. It is simply an ObamaCare \npay-for.\n  As I said, Indiana and Minnesota are homes to many of the country's \nlargest medical device manufacturers. In fact, my State of Indiana \nexported more than $9.7 billion in life science products in 2012, which \nincludes medical devices. It is second in the country only to \nCalifornia in terms of exports of life science products. So it is very \nimportant to our State.\n  We have over 300 FDA-registered medical device manufacturers--some of \nthem large, some of them small. They employ 20,000 Hoosiers directly, \nwith an indirect support of nearly 30,000 more. So it is not a small \nthing for our State. It is one of the--and pardon the pun--cutting-edge \nindustries, producing devices that improve the health of Americans and \nextend the life of Americans through some remarkable innovations. These \ncompanies have revolutionized the medical field with life-enhancing, as \nwell as lifesaving, technology.\n  So what is the effect of this excise tax that has been imposed on \nthese companies and this thriving industry?\n  Well, let me respond in a way that reflects what some Hoosiers have \ntold me, as I travel across the State talking to these device employees \nand CEOs and manufacturers, learning what the impact of this tax is on \ntheir industry, which is so important to our country's economic growth.\n  One device manufacturer located in Warsaw, IN, develops and sells \northopedic implants for children but recently had to shelve two \nimportant projects simply because they had to get the money to pay the \ntax, so they could not put it into the research and development and \ninnovation of their next products. I quote an employee of this company, \nwho told my office: ``The medical device excise tax inhibits us from \ndeveloping more products that can reduce a wheelchair-bound child's \ndiscomfort or that can allow a kid to walk for the first time.''\n  So there are real consequences here. Companies, many of which are \ninnovative, struggling to design that new product that can be life \nenhancing and life saving, have simply had to defer their product to \npay the tax. They may not have made a penny in net profits. Many of \nthese are startup companies, hoping to develop and get FDA approval \nfor, the next new life-enhancing innovation. Yet they are not taxed on \ntheir net profits--and many are losing money initially in order to go \nthrough the tortuous and time-consuming process of getting FDA \napproval, which denies them getting their products out to the market \nfor a long period of time; so most of them early on are not making any \nprofit. But on the devices they are selling, every dollar that comes in \nis taxed, even though they have no net profits and, therefore, they \nhave to take money out of research and development, out of capital \nequipment, out of employee compensation, in order to send the check to \nthe government.\n  Cook Medical, which is located in Bloomington, IN, another Hoosier \ndevice manufacturer, was forced to table plans for a major expansion \nbecause of the device tax. In testimony before the Senate Budget \nCommittee last year, Cook's medical chairman, Steve Ferguson, said \nthis:\n\n       Cook has made the difficult decision that without repeal \n     [of the medical device tax], we will move important new \n     product lines outside of the U.S. Our previous plans to open \n     up five new manufacturing facilities in American towns are \n     now on hold as we use capital intended for these projects to \n     pay the excise tax.\n\n  There are very real consequences here in terms of job creation and \neconomic growth that are being inhibited. We are getting just the \nopposite. We are getting job-killing and deflated economic results as a \nresult of this tax. And it is an egregious tax.\n  The Advanced Medical Technology Association recently conducted a \nsurvey of its members--they shared that with me earlier today--and \nfound that the device tax forced manufacturers to let go of or avoid \nhiring 33,000 workers last year. Mr. President, that is 33,000 people \nwho could have joined the workforce at wages which in my State are 56 \npercent higher than the average State wage. So these are good-paying \njobs. They require good skills, but they are good-paying jobs. And it \nis an emerging series of products that can be exported around the \nworld.\n  The survey also found that one-third of the respondents had to reduce \ntheir research and development as a result of the medical device tax.\n  In terms of investment dollars, three-quarters of the respondents \nsaid they had taken one or more of the following actions in response to \nthe tax: They have either deferred or canceled capital investments; \ndeferred or cancelled plans to open new facilities; reduced investment \nin startup companies; found it more difficult to raise capital, \nparticularly among startup companies; and reduced or deferred increases \nin employee compensation.\n  There are negative results that come from taxing anything. But when \nyou tax sales, when you tax on an excise basis, it has a compounding \neffect for startup companies, and even for established companies, in \nterms of what they are able to do in terms of hiring, in terms of plant \nexpansion, in terms of research and development, in terms of \ninnovation.\n  This is happening across the country. Minnesota and Indiana just \nhappen to be two States that have been particularly hard hit. We ought \nto be encouraging these companies to continue their research and \ndevelopment. We should not be punishing them with an egregious tax \nwhich is simply a byproduct and the administration says: We have to \nfind a pay-for for ObamaCare. Here is a prospering industry, so let's \ntake some money from them--not on their profits--but let's just take \nmoney from them from their sales--an excise tax--so that we can apply \nit to ObamaCare.\n  Essentially, what they are doing is taking money from a program that \nworks and puts people back to work and generates taxes the right way \nand transferring that money to a program that is in distress, has \nturned out to be a job killer, according to studies and a number of \nagencies that have looked at this, and is very much in a state of \nconfusion and disarray right now among the American people.\n  So you take some money from something that works and you give it to \nsomething that does not work. What kind of rationale is that? And how \ncan the President go to Minnesota and say: I am here to stimulate \ngrowth and create jobs, while his very own policy has done just the \nopposite?\n  The senior Senator from Minnesota, Ms. Klobuchar, and I chair the \nSenate Medical Technology Caucus. We have been able to pull together a \nbipartisan effort to increase awareness of these unique issues but also \nto achieve a vote, which is hard to do around here. During the budget \nwe had the so-called vote-arama. Republicans and Democrats got to offer \nany amendment we wanted. It is not binding law, but it sets the stage \nand illustrates the Senate's stance on particular topics.\n  On this one 79 out of 100 U.S. Senators--Republicans and Democrats; \nthat is 45 Republicans and 34 Democrats--voted for repeal of the \nmedical device tax. So this is not a Republican standing here \nchallenging the President of another party or Members across the aisle \nsaying: We are asking you to support this Republican issue. This is a \nbipartisan issue. Almost as many Democrats as Republicans support this. \nBut yet the majority leader has refused to allow this to come to an \nactual vote, which would put it into passage--because the House has \nalready supported and passed this--and be sent to the President for his \nsignature.\n  So I guess what I am asking here today is that the majority leader at\n\n[[Page S1150]]\n\nleast allow us the opportunity to go forward with a vote, where it \nwould then, I suspect it would pass, be sent to the President. If he \nreally wants to create jobs and stimulate the economy, we have living \nproof of something that will do it.\n  I do not know how the President today can go to a State and say: I am \nhere to stimulate the economy and provide for new jobs and at the same \ntime have in place a majority leader who will not allow us a vote on \nit. We all want to enact measures here that will get our country \ngrowing again and will get people back to work. In an area where we are \nproviding life-enhancing and lifesaving medical technology, it is \nparticularly important.\n  So my plea, as I finish here, is I urge the majority leader and I \nurge the President--if they are serious about encouraging economic \ngrowth, spurring job creation, and improving health care--to support \nthe repeal of this unfair and destructive tax of medical devices.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I yield 45 minutes of my hour under \ncloture to Senator Sanders, chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is so yielded.\n  Mr. COONS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, earlier this afternoon I spoke about \nthe many important provisions in this veterans bill that came out of \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee: the fact that we worked as hard as we \ncould to make it bipartisan, the fact that there are many provisions in \nthis bill that came from Republican Members, and the fact that some \nother provisions in this bill were passed unanimously by the House of \nRepresentatives, indicating very strong bipartisan support.\n  But what I also said is that while I believe the American people \nunderstand the full cost of war and understand the sacrifices made by \nveterans and their families, what they also believe is that when we \nhave a piece of legislation--an important piece of legislation--on the \nfloor dealing with the needs of millions and millions of veterans and \ntheir families--whether it is health care; whether it is dental care; \nwhether it is sexual assault and how we address that issue; whether it \nis the fact that over 2,000 veterans have lost their ability to have \nkids and what we can do to make it possible for them to have children; \nwhether it is the fact that we have tens of thousands of families in \nthis country where loved ones are taking care of disabled vets, need \nsome support, and we have a need to expand the caregivers act; whether \nit is the fact that we have some young people who are eligible to use \nthe post-9/11 GI bill but are unable to do it because they cannot get \nin-State tuition; whether it is the issue of advanced appropriations \nand making sure we never again find ourselves in the position that we \ndid a few months ago, where the government was shut down and where \ndisabled veterans were 1 week or 10 days away from losing the checks \nthey are dependent upon, I think there is widespread support in America \nfor that bill, for the understanding that we do owe the men and women \nwho put their lives on the line to defend us a debt of gratitude that \ncan never be fully paid.\n  But we have to do our best. We have to make life as good as we can \nfor those who were injured in war. We have to protect the hundreds of \nthousands who came back from Iraq and Afghanistan with PTSD or \ntraumatic brain injury. But whatever one may think of the bill--whether \nyou like the bill, don't like the bill, think it is too expensive or \nthink we should have done more--the one thing most Americans understand \nis that it is totally absurd to be bringing forth extraneous issues \ninto a debate on veterans needs in order to kill the bill.\n  I say to my colleagues exactly what the majority leader said this \nmorning. If you have amendments dealing with veterans issues, we \nwelcome them. We have a number of Democrats who have come forward with \namendments. We have some Republicans who have come forward with \namendments. We welcome amendments that are relevant and germane to the \nneeds of veterans. What we do not welcome are extraneous amendments \nthat are designed only--only--for partisan, political reasons, exactly \nthe process that the American people are disgusted with today.\n  Interestingly enough, that is my view. I mentioned earlier today that \nthe Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America sent out a tweet \nyesterday, and the folks who served us in Iraq and Afghanistan said: \nThe Senate should not get distracted while debating and voting on the \nveterans bill. Iran sanctions, ObamaCare, et cetera, aren't relevant to \nS. 1982--which is the veterans bill we are dealing with today.\n  The Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America said: Focus on veterans' \nissues, which is a very simple request and the one that should be \nheeded.\n  But today, a little while ago, we heard from the largest veterans' \nassociation in America; that is, the American Legion, which represents \n2.4 million members. The American Legion is the largest veterans' \norganization in this country. I suspect they have chapters. I know they \nare strong in Vermont. I suspect they are strong in Hawaii and strong \nall over this country.\n  American Legion National Commander Daniel M. Dellinger said today:\n\n       Iran is a serious issue that Congress needs to address, but \n     it cannot be tied to S. 1982, which is extremely important as \n     our Nation prepares to welcome millions of U.S. military \n     service men and women home from war. This comprehensive bill \n     aims to help veterans find good jobs, get the health care \n     they need, and make in-State tuition rates applicable to all \n     who use their GI bill benefits. This legislation is about \n     supporting veterans, pure and simple. The Senate can debate \n     various aspects of it, and that is understandable, but it \n     cannot lose focus on the matter at hand: helping military \n     personnel make their transition to veteran life and ensuring \n     that those who served their Nation in uniform receive the \n     benefits they earned and deserve. We can deal with Iran--or \n     any other issue unrelated specifically to veterans--with \n     separate legislation.\n\n  I think Commander Dellinger hit the nail right on the head. What he \nis saying is, fine, we can debate Iran at some point; we can debate \nObamaCare, which has been going on day after day after day. We can do \nanything we want to do, but this is a bill that deals with veterans' \nissues.\n\n  I thank the American Legion not only for their support--they along \nwith virtually every other veterans organization in this country \nsupports this legislation: the VFW, DAV, Vietnam Vets, Iraq-Afghanistan \nVeterans of America, and dozens of organizations--but I thank the \nAmerican Legion in particular for their statement in making it clear \nthat our job is to debate a veterans bill, not kill this bill because \nof an extraneous issue such as Iran sanctions.\n  I wish to say one other word before I proceed to my main remarks. My \ncolleague from North Carolina quoted from a group called the Concerned \nVeterans of America. In support of our legislation, we have the largest \nveterans organization in America, the second largest, third largest, \nfourth largest, the fifth largest, the sixth largest, and all the way \ndown the line--many millions of Americans. Apparently supporting his \nposition is a group called the Concerned Veterans for America. I don't \nmean to be personal, but this is just a simple fact that people should \nunderstand. This organization, according to the Washington Post, is \nsignificantly supported by Charles and David Koch--the Koch brothers. \nWe are going to be running into the Koch brothers on every piece of \nlegislation where there is some group out there that they fund, and in \nthis case it is the Concerned Veterans of America.\n  I talked earlier about the many important provisions in the bill \ndealing with reproductive issues, the belief the Federal Government and \nthe VA should assist those men and women who have lost their ability to \nhave kids. We have talked about caregivers and all that, and I want to \njust touch on a couple more issues at this moment.\n  I have believed for a very long time that dental care should be \nregarded as a part of health care. I think we make a mistake as a \nnation saying this is\n\n[[Page S1151]]\n\nhealth care and this is dental care. Our legislation, for the first \ntime, begins the process of providing dental care to nonservice-\nconnected members through a significant pilot project. I have the \nfeeling once we do this we will see veterans from all over the country \nwho are dealing with long-term dental problems availing themselves of \nthis service. It is the right thing to do and something I think we \nshould be doing.\n  Another provision in this bill deals with the COLA issue for military \nretirees. I think everybody here is familiar with the fact that in the \nBipartisan Budget Act of 2013 it reduced by 1 percent annually the \ncost-of-living adjustments for military retirees until age 62.\n  The good news is the House and Senate recently passed legislation \ncompletely rescinding those cuts and the President has signed that \nbill. That is the good news. The bad news is those cuts continue to \nexist for those who join the military after January 2014, and I know \nthe veterans organizations are concerned about that. I am concerned \nabout that. I think that is wrong, and our legislation corrects that. \nSo if one is talking about cuts to military retiree COLAs, we end it, \npure and simple. Those COLA cuts will no longer exist if this bill is \npassed.\n  As I mentioned earlier, this legislation addresses the issue of the \nbenefits backlog. There is great concern among all Members of the \nSenate that veterans are forced to wait much too long to get their \nclaims processed. What this legislation does is support VA's ongoing \nefforts to end the backlog and would make needed improvements to the \nclaims system. Again, this is the result of some bipartisan efforts.\n  Secretary Eric Shinseki of the VA, as he moves the claims system from \npaper into an electronic system, has advanced the very ambitious goal \nof making sure that every claim filed by a veteran will be processed in \n125 days at 98 percent accuracy. That is a very ambitious goal, and the \nlanguage we have is going to hold the VA accountable and make sure we \nreach this very ambitious goal.\n  I gather there may be differences of opinion on this view, but \nanother provision in our bill deals with the educational needs of \nservicemembers and making sure they get a fair shot at attaining their \neducational goals without incurring an additional financial burden, \nwhich is what the post-9/11 GI bill was all about. That bill has been \nenormously successful. There are certain problems remaining in it and \nwe address these problems.\n  Given the nature of our Armed Forces, servicemembers have little to \nno say as to where they serve and where they reside during military \nservice. Thus, when transitioning servicemembers consider what \neducational institution they want to attend, many of them choose a \nschool in a State other than their home State or the State where they \npreviously served. I have heard from too many veterans that many of \nthese public educational institutions consider them out-of-State \nstudents. Given that the post-9/11 GI bill only covers in-State tuition \nand fees for public educational institutions, these veterans are left \nto cover the differences in cost between the in-State tuition rate and \nthe out-of-State tuition rate. In some States that difference can be \nmore than $20,000 a year.\n  That is certainly not what the purpose of the 9/11 GI bill was about. \nAs a result, many of our Nation's veterans must use loans to cover this \ndifference and, in the process, become indebted with large school loans \nthat will take them years to pay off.\n  My office has heard from a number of veterans and veterans \norganizations about this problem. We heard from Skye Barclay, who lived \nin Florida prior to joining the U.S. Marine Corps in 2006. After \nserving her country, Skye decided to remain with her family in North \nCarolina so her husband could finish serving his military obligations. \nLess than 1 year later, they moved to Skye's hometown in Florida to \ntransition back to civilian life and finish their college education.\n  Skye and her husband changed their residency, immediately started \nrenting a home, and ensured her car registration was up-to-date. \nHowever, the school she chose to attend could not consider either of \nthese veterans as in-State students. As a result, they were forced to \npay an additional $2,000 out-of-pocket each semester. Due to the \nadditional financial burden, Skye and her husband were unable to afford \ndaycare for their daughter and instead have to juggle two demanding \nschedules, with one of them attending school in the morning and the \nother late afternoon.\n  The bottom line is that we passed a post-9/11 GI bill which is \nworking incredibly well. Over 1 million veterans and their family \nmembers have used this program. It is very important for higher \neducation in America, and I think we should support our veterans who \nmove to another State and make sure they get in-State tuition.\n  Let me conclude my remarks at this point, though I will be back later \nto reiterate the major point I wish to make. We can play the same old \npolitics. My Republican colleagues can defeat this bill because of some \nextraneous matters in it. I think that is incredibly disrespectful to \nthe veterans community that has sacrificed so much. That is not just my \nview; that is what the American Legion believes and what the American \nLegion says: Discuss veterans issues in a veterans bill. The Iraq-\nAfghanistan Veterans of America say the same.\n  So we may have disagreements on this bill. People may choose to vote \nagainst it for whatever reason. People may offer amendments that we \nwould love to see--some of them may be good, some not so good--but let \nus respect those folks who have given so much to this country. Let us \nnot demean the veterans community by killing this bill because of \nsomething to do with Iran sanctions. That has nothing to do with \nveterans' needs.\n  I hope we continue to have a vigorous debate on this piece of \nlegislation. I see my friend from Florida is on the floor. People may \nwant to vote for it. That is good. They may want to vote against it. \nFine. But let us not play the same old politics which so disgusts the \nAmerican people.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I would like to inquire as to the pending \nbusiness before the Senate. Is it the veterans bill, the motion to \nproceed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is indeed the motion to proceed to S. 1982.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to address a \nnumber of matters of great concern. There might be, but I don't know of \nany State that has a greater presence of veterans within it than \nFlorida, certainly per capita. We have a huge military presence in our \nState and a large number of veterans.\n  I have commented to people, by the way, that in my time in the \nSenate, which is now about 3 years and 2 months, a substantial \npercentage of the calls we get to our office are from veterans \nregarding veterans' issues. I have a veteran in my family--my brother--\nwho has recently encountered some bureaucratic hurdles he is trying to \novercome in terms of getting service from the VA. So these are relevant \nmatters that are of great importance.\n  I am glad the Senate is on the debate. I am glad we have proceeded to \nhave this debate. It is an important one, and I do hope I will have an \nopportunity to offer an amendment I have relevant to the bill that \ninvolves and gives the opportunity for the Secretary who oversees this \nDepartment to be able to hire and fire, particularly to hold \naccountable mid- and higher level officials within the Veterans' \nAdministration who are not doing their jobs and are contributing to \nthis backlog.\n  I can tell you that in Central Florida we have a veterans hospital \nthat has been well over budget and has timeliness issues and it needs \nto be addressed. I think that is a veterans' issue that has \nextraordinary bipartisan consensus. So my hope is we will be able to \naddress it and we will have an amendment process that allows these \nideas to be brought forth. From what I heard from the Senator \ncommenting just a few moments ago, he welcomes amendments. So I hope I \nwill have an opportunity to offer that.\n  I know as part of this debate the issue of Iran sanctions has been \nraised. I don't think it is rare to have issues that perhaps are not \ndirectly on point to a bill offered in debate, particularly when \ngetting into a debate on an issue that has been so difficult. That is \npart of the problem with the Iran sanctions issue.\n\n[[Page S1152]]\n\n  I understand when someone files a bill, the managers have worked hard \non it, and the last thing they want is for it to be slowed down because \nof debate on another topic that is not directly on topic. I understand \nthat concern. I do. But on the other hand, I hope Members will \nunderstand that part of the frustration has been the inability to even \nget a debate on what truly is an extraordinarily important issue.\n  For those here watching and those at home watching and those who may \nsee this later, let me take a moment to briefly discuss what is at \nstake. I briefly discussed this a few weeks ago, but I wanted to take \nthis opportunity to do so again.\n  Here is the issue: Iran, a few years ago, began developing a nuclear \nprocessing capability. What that basically means is they take uranium, \nfor example, and they reprocess it to a certain level. You need to have \na certain level of reprocessing in order to, for example, provide \ndomestic energy for nuclear energy plants. Many countries in the world \nhave nuclear energy, but only a handful actually process it themselves. \nMost decide to buy it already processed from abroad.\n  We have agreements and arrangements with countries all over the \nplanet that do that. Only a handful actually retain the capacity to \nreprocess it or to enrich uranium or reprocess plutonium. So when we \nsee a country announce they are going to invest money, time, and energy \nin developing a reprocessing or an enrichment capability, that raises \nred flags, and here is why. Because while you only need a certain level \nof enrichment to be able to provide nuclear energy for peaceful \npurposes, and a little bit higher level in order to use it for medical \nisotopes, the exact same scientists, the exact same machines, the exact \nsame facilities are the exact same ones that can also reprocess or \nenrich to an even higher level to use in a weapon.\n  The story of Iran has been, over the last few years, to increase \ntheir enrichment and reprocessing capabilities. That in and of itself \nraises red flags. Adding to that uncertainty and concern about it has \nbeen the fact they have tried to hide most of this. Consistently, Iran \nhas been found to have secret development projects ongoing that they \nonly admit to once they are discovered. They take a tremendous amount \nof effort to hide it from the world. That begins to raise red flags, \nbecause if it is truly just a peaceful program, there would be no \nreason to hide it or to hide their capabilities. But Iran has \nconsistently hidden them.\n  There is even more reason to be concerned. In addition to increasing \ntheir capacity to enrich and reprocess, Iran is also developing long-\nrange missile capabilities. A long-range missile--basically a missile \nthat can fly from Iran 1,000 miles, 1,500 miles, 2,000 miles, 3,000 \nmiles--costs a lot of money to develop. It takes a lot of time to \ndevelop.\n  You don't spend time or money developing those capabilities for \npurely conventional purposes or for defensive purposes. Usually when \nyou undergo those efforts to develop that kind of capability, it is \nbecause you want to have the opportunity to one day put a nuclear \nwarhead on one of those rockets.\n  So that is the story of Iran: massive expansion in their enrichment \nand reprocessing capabilities; secret enrichment programs which they \ntry to hide from the world; and the development of long-range missile \ncapabilities. Add to it that we are not dealing with the government of \nBelgium, Japan, South Korea, or any other responsible government on the \nplanet; we are dealing with a government that actively uses terrorism \nall over the world as an active element of its foreign policy. They are \ninvolved in supporting various terrorist elements around the country, \nnot just in the Middle East. Open-source reporting revealed that just a \ncouple years ago they were involved in a plot to assassinate a foreign \nambassador in Washington, DC--not in the Middle East somewhere but \nhere. They have an active cyber capability designed to attack, disrupt, \nand create acts of terror online. They have been implicated, for \nexample, in the bombing of a Jewish center in Argentina. There are few, \nif any, countries in the world that more actively support terrorism \nthan the Government of Iran.\n  So this is with whom we are dealing. As a result, the international \ncommunity, through the United Nations, imposed sanctions. Not only did \nthey impose sanctions, they imposed the requirement that they \nimmediately suspend and stop all enrichment and reprocessing \ncapabilities. We can imagine why the neighbors of Iran are concerned. \nIt is not just Israel that is concerned. Ask the Saudis, ask the Turks, \nask any number of the other countries in the region.\n  Recently, the President and this administration have begun to \nundertake conversations with Iran about this program. Their hope is \nthat we can get Iran to a place where we can lock them in; where they, \nin exchange for the loosening of these sanctions, agree not to do \ncertain things.\n  I don't know of anyone here who would not love to wake up to the news \ntomorrow that the Supreme Leader in Iran has decided to abandon the \nreprocessing and enrichment capability and to truly show that all he is \ninterested in is domestic energy for peaceful purposes. The problem is \nthat is not what is happening. I believe what is happening is the \nUnited States, through the State Department and this administration, de \nfacto, is already--but if not, is on the verge of--agreeing to allow \nIran to keep in place its enrichment and reprocessing capabilities, and \nI will explain why this is a problem.\n  If that capability is still there, if they retain all the facilities \nnecessary for enrichment and reprocessing, even if they agree to limit \nit to a certain level for now, at any point in time in the future they \ncan ratchet it back up and can go on to develop a weapon. In fact, \nunfortunately, the design for a weapon is the easiest part of all this. \nThe hardest part is reaching the technological capability to enrich \nuranium to a certain point to weaponize it.\n  If we allow them to keep all the equipment, all the technology, all \ntheir scientists, all the infrastructure in place, then at any point in \nthe future when they decide it is time for a weapon, they can break out \nand do that. And I would submit that the evidence is strong that this \nis exactly what their strategy is.\n  I don't think, I know for a fact that the mandate given to those \nnegotiators on behalf of Iran and the Supreme Leader was the following: \nDo whatever you can to get these sanctions lifted off our shoulders, \nbut do not agree to anything that is irreversible.\n  Put yourself in their position. If you want to retain the option to \none day be able to enrich and then build a weapon, you are probably \nwilling to take one step back by agreeing to suspend enrichment only to \na certain level in exchange for the lifting of these sanctions, knowing \nthat at some point--in 2 years, 3 years, or 4 years--when the world is \ndistracted by something else, when something else is going on around \nthe planet, you can then decide to come up with any excuse to build a \nweapon.\n  One of the reasons I know that is their strategy is because it is \nexactly what the North Koreans did. The playbook has already been \nwritten. They would engage in these ongoing negotiations, on again, off \nagain, all designed to buy time.\n  Why does a government like Iran need or want a nuclear weapon? And \nthey do. It is pretty straightforward.\n  No. 1, because of deep historical reasons, they desire to become the \ndominant power in the Middle East, to drive not just the United States \nbut other nations out of the region and diminish everyone's influence \nat their expense.\n  The other is because they view a weapon as the ultimate insurance \npolicy. They don't want to be the next Muammar Qadhafi; they want to be \nNorth Korea so they can now act with impunity, so they can do anything \nthey want against us or anyone in the world because no one could \npossibly attack them because they have nuclear weapons.\n  I have heard stories about, well, we will know; we will be able to \nsee this happening before it happens and do something about it. But \nlook at Pakistan and India, which was a surprise to everybody, \nparticularly India's capabilities. It is not outside the realm of the \nreasonable to believe that at some point one day we will wake up to the \nnews that Iran has detonated a device and proven their capability. In \nfact, I have zero doubt in my mind that this is where they want to go.\n  What I find offensive in this whole conversation is the notion by \nsome in the administration that anyone who\n\n[[Page S1153]]\n\nfeels this way or anyone who has doubts or skepticism about these \nnegotiations is warmongering.\n  I actually think the failure to impose sanctions now will inevitably \nplace a future President--perhaps even this one--with a very difficult \ndecision to make, and that will be whether to go in and take military \naction to stunt or stall their weapons program because, make no \nmistake, a lot of damage has already been done. A lot of damage has \nalready been done to the sanctions that were already in place. There is \nalready growing evidence that the amount of revenue coming into Iran, \nthe amount of business dealings coming into Iran just simply on this \ntalk about the interim deal has truly spiked.\n\n  We also see it in their comments. The leaders of Iran--from the \nPresident, to the Supreme Leader, to the chief negotiator--are not just \nbragging in Iran; they are bragging all over the world that they have \nagreed to nothing and the West has capitulated.\n  What we were told by the State Department is, well, that is only for \ndomestic consumption; they are just saying that to be popular at home \nand to appease the radicals within Iran.\n  By the way, the term ``radical'' is an interesting term when applied \nto Iran. All the leaders in Iran are radical; it is just degrees of \nradicalism.\n  But to get back to the point I was making, we hear the comments they \nmake in Iran--bragging how they have won, how they snookered the West, \nhow they agreed to nothing, how everything they were doing before is \ngoing to move forward--and we are told: Just ignore that. They are just \nsaying that for domestic political considerations.\n  That is not true. In fact, the Supreme Leader himself, the Ayatollah, \nhas announced that these talks are going to lead to nowhere. He is not \ngoing to interfere, but they are going nowhere.\n  This is a transparent effort. All you have to do is open your eyes \nand see what they are doing. All they are doing is buying time. All \nthey are doing is looking to relieve as many sanctions as possible \nwithout giving up anything they can do in the future or are doing now. \nFor a deal such as this to work, you have to rely on all sorts of \nverification systems with a government that has made a specialty out of \nhiding their intentions and programs in the past.\n  The reason we see the push for the additional sanctions to be put in \nplace is because at least 59 of us in the Senate--and I suspect many \nmore who haven't lent their names to this effort yet--recognize that we \ncannot afford to be wrong about this because a nuclear Iran would be \none of the worst developments in the world in a very long time.\n  In addition to being able to hold the region hostage, in addition to \nnow being able to act with impunity--they don't have a weapon now, and \nthey try to assassinate Ambassadors in Washington, DC. Imagine what \nthey think they can get away with if they do have a weapon.\n  Beyond that, think about the risk it poses to our allies in that \nregion, and think about this: Think about the reaction of other \ncountries in the region to the news. The Saudis are not going to stand \nby and watch Iran develop a nuclear capability and not have one of \ntheir own. So I submit a nuclear Iran isn't just one more country \njoining the nuclear weapons club; it can be as many as two or three \nmore countries eventually joining the nuclear weapons club in the most \nunstable region in the world, a place that has only had conflict, I \ndon't know, for 5,000 years. This is what we are on the verge of here.\n  I appreciate the work diplomats working in the State Department do. \nThere is a role for diplomacy in the world, and the good news is that \nwe can negotiate agreements with most of the countries on this planet. \nBut I think diplomacy also requires us to understand its limitations. \nIt is very difficult to negotiate settlements and agreements with \ngovernments and individuals who don't ever feel bound by them, who see \nthem as one-way streets, who see them as tactics and vehicles to buy \ntime. That is what we are dealing with.\n  The other part we forget is that in some parts of the world and with \nsome governments on this planet, the language of diplomacy is viewed as \na language of weakness. It becomes an invitation to become aggressive \nor miscalculated.\n  I don't know of anyone in this body who is looking to get into \nanother war or armed conflict. That is not what Americans are all \nabout. If we look at the story of the conflicts we have been engaged \nin, almost all of them involved a reluctant nation having to get \ninvolved for geopolitical purposes, because we were trying to stem the \ngrowth of communism, because we were attacked in Pearl Harbor. That is \nnot who we are. That is not who we have ever been. Americans aren't \ninto that. What we want to do is live happy lives and raise our \nfamilies in peace. We want to be able to sell to and buy from other \ncountries. We want a peaceful world we can partner with for business \nand culture.\n  But I also think it is important to understand that when mistakes are \nmade in foreign policy, it is a lot harder to reverse than when they \nare made in domestic policies. If we pass a bad tax bill, we can always \ncome back and pass a new one. If we make a mistake--as this body did by \npassing ObamaCare--we can always come back and repeal it. If we make a \nmistake in domestic policy, we can always come back and reverse it \nsomehow. It is not the same in foreign policy. Once there is a \nnuclearized, weaponized Iran, it will be quite difficult to undo, and \nso are all the things it will lead to.\n  Let me also say that additional sanctions are no guarantee that they \nwill never get a weapon, but it changes the cost-benefit analysis. It \ntests their pain threshold economically. It forces them to make a \ndecision about whether they want to continue to be isolated from the \nworld economically and whether weaponizing is worth it.\n  If you put in place an interim agreement or a final one that allows \nthem to retain the capability to enrich in the future, they will build \na weapon. That is not a matter of opinion; in my mind, that is a matter \nof fact. Maybe this President won't be here by the time that happens, \nbut someone is going to have to deal with that, and it is not just the \nPresident; our country is going to have to deal with that. I at a \nminimum want to be on record today as making that point because if, God \nforbid, that day should ever come, I want it to be clearly understood \nthat I, along with my colleagues, warned against it.\n  By the way, I think this opposition to additional sanctions is part \nof a pattern of flawed foreign policy decisions on behalf of this \nadministration, one that has largely been built on the false assumption \nthat our problems in the world were caused by an America that was too \nengaged, too involved, too opinionated, was providing too much \nleadership and direction, when, in fact, the opposite is now true.\n  Many of the conflicts happening around the world today are a result \nof the chaos left by this administration's unclear foreign policy. Many \nof our allies openly question--and I can tell you from my travels that \nprivately they strongly question--whether America's assurances remain \nviable and whether we can continue to be relied upon in the agreements \nwe have made in the past to provide collective security for ourselves \nand our allies.\n  When you leave a vacuum, it is going to be filled. What it is being \nfilled by right now are some of the most tyrannical governments on the \nplanet. Look at what happened with Moscow over the last 5 years. Moscow \nviewed the whole reset strategy of the United States under this \nPresident not as an opportunity to engage us but as an opportunity to \ntry to get an upper hand on us.\n  Look at what has happened in the Asia-Pacific region where the \nChinese regional ambitions to drive the U.S. out have grown \nexponentially, as have their capabilities. Meanwhile, our partners in \nthe region, while they welcome the rhetoric of a pivot, question \nwhether we will have the capability to carry it out.\n  Certainly in the Middle East an incoherent foreign policy with regard \nto Syria left open an ungoverned space where foreign jihadists have \npoured into that country and have now basically converted entire parts \nof Syria as the premier operational space for global jihadists to train \nand operate.\n  Now Iran. The situation in Iran, to use a colloquial term, is \nfreaking out all the other countries in that region who have no \nillusions about who Iran\n\n[[Page S1154]]\n\ntruly is. They know exactly who these people are, and they are baffled \nat how the most powerful and informed government on the planet doesn't \nrealize what they realized a long time ago--that you are not dealing \nwith a responsible government here with Iran. You are dealing with a \nnation that openly supports terrorism as a tool of statecraft, that \nopenly has shown that they want to develop a nuclear weapons capability \nso they can become untouchable and the dominant power in that region.\n  If we don't put in place a mechanism for additional sanctions to take \nplace, I submit that the negotiation that is going on with the Iranians \nwill become irrelevant. By that point, even if you wanted to impose \nmore sanctions, it would be impossible to do because so many other \ncountries will have reengaged with commercial transactions with Iran. \nYou are not going to be able to put this genie back in the bottle, and \nthe genie is already halfway out.\n  I hope we will take this more seriously, but at a minimum I ask this: \nWhy can't we vote on it? If we are wrong, debate us on it. But why \ncan't we vote on it? Since when has the Senate become a place run by \none person on a matter of this importance and magnitude? Since when has \nthe Senate become controlled by one person's opinion?\n  Are you telling me that the people of Florida who I represent do not \ndeserve the right to be represented and heard as much as the people of \nNevada or any other State? Are you saying that on an issue of this \nimportance, one individual should have the power to basically say we \nwill have no debate when 59 Members of this body--in a place where it \nis tough to get 51 votes on anything--have expressed the strong opinion \nthat they favor this?\n  Why can't we have this debate? Isn't that what the Senate was \ndesigned to be, a place where the great issues of our time could be \ndebated and flushed out before the eyes of the American public and the \nworld?\n  What we are consistently told is we can't have this debate and we're \nnot going to do it. Why? Why can't we debate this? This is important. \nIts implications will be felt by people long after we are no longer \nhere. I hope more attention is paid to this.\n  Let me just say that I understand the frustration. A piece of \nlegislation is filed on behalf of veterans, and the Iran issue comes \nup. But we are running out of time. This is the only mechanism that \nexists to have this debate.\n  I would argue that it actually is relevant because it is our men and \nwomen in uniform we are going to turn to--when this thing ends up the \nway I know it will--and ask them to take care of this problem.\n  If in the end these negotiations fail, and I tragically have to say \nthey are destined to fail, and Iran retains their enrichment capability \nand eventually develops a nuclear weapon, it is the men and women in \nuniform of these United States--our sons, our daughters, our neighbors, \nour friends, our mothers, our brothers, our sisters, and our fathers--\nwhom we will ask, as we always do, to go solve the problem for us. But \nif we put in place sanctions that clearly articulate and lay out the \nprice they will have to pay to continue with these ambitions, we may be \nable to delay that, and even prevent it; otherwise, that day will come. \nThis piper will be paid, and I hope the price will not be so high. I \nfear that is where we are headed. We are on the verge of making an \nextraordinary geopolitical blunder that will be very difficult to undo \nor reverse once it is already made.\n  All we are asking is to have a vote on this issue. This matters \nenough to the American people. This matters enough to the safety and \nfuture of our children and future generations. This matters enough to \nthe world. It deserves a full debate, and it deserves a vote.\n  If you are against it, you can vote against it. If you are against \nit, you can debate against it. We want to hear their arguments and \nthoughts. Why can't we vote on it? It deserves a vote. It is that \nimportant.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I rise to commend the words of my esteemed \ncolleague, the junior Senator from Florida, who has just spoken \npowerfully about the threats facing our Nation. On Monday evening he \nspoke powerfully on the Senate floor about the brutal human rights \nabuses that have been endemic in communist Cuba over the past 50 years, \nand the sad reality that Cuba is playing a leading role in the \nrepression of the opposition protests that are currently taking place \nin Venezuela.\n  I commend the sentiments of the Senator from Florida, and I offer a \nfew additional thoughts of my own on this important topic.\n  Brave Venezuelan protesters persist in crowding the streets in \nCaracas, San Cristobal, Merida, and Valencia despite the detention, \ntorture, and murder of their compatriots in recent days. They are not \nalone. They have been joined by darker figures, representatives of \nHezbollah, Iran, and Cuba, all of whom have a vested interest in \npropping up the increasingly authoritarian socialist regime of Nicolas \nMaduro. The appearance of the Iranians, and their Hezbollah agents in \nVenezuela, is concerning, but it should not be surprising.\n  Iran has long maintained one of its largest embassies in Caracas, \nwhere it has been able to exploit the Venezuelan financial system to \nevade the international sanctions that--up until a few weeks ago--were \nplacing a real burden on Iran's economy.\n  Now that the administration has eased the sanctions on Iran, Iran is \nin a significantly stronger position. Not only have they received the \nfirst $500 million in unfrozen assets, but they have also reaped \nconsiderable collateral benefit.\n  Iranian President Rouhani recently tweeted: ``You are witness to how \nforeign firms are visiting our country; 117 political delegations have \ncome here.''\n  The Dutch ambassador to Iran tweeted in mid-January that he \nparticipated in ``speeddate sessions to meet business[es] interested in \nIran.''\n  China has emerged as Iran's top trading partner with nonoil trade \nhitting $13 billion over the past 10 months, according to Iranian \nmedia.\n  According to documents seen by Reuters, Iran has signed a deal to \nsell Iraq arms and ammunition worth $195 million--a move that would \nbreak the U.N. embargo on weapons sales by Tehran.\n  What could a reenriched Iran offer Venezuela, given that the joint \nplan of action that has enabled this economic detente has done nothing \nto reverse their nuclear program. The answer is chilling. The \nlongstanding commercial ties between Iran and Venezuela, not to mention \ntheir mutual hatred for the United States, raise the specter that \nshould Iran acquire nuclear weapons technology, it might be inclined to \nshare it with Venezuela, which would then act as a surrogate threat to \nthe United States in our own hemisphere.\n  We need to act immediately to reimpose sanctions on Iran and stand \nunequivocally against Iran acquiring nuclear weapons capability. I am \nsorry to say there is one reason--and one reason only--that we have not \ndone so, and that is because the senior Senator from Nevada has been \nsingle-handedly blocking the Senate from voting on a bipartisan bill on \nIranian sanctions. Given the broad bipartisan support in both Chambers, \nboth the senior Senator from Nevada and the rest of the Democratic \nleadership need to be held accountable for this obstruction and \nstanding in the way of defending U.S. national security interests and \nstanding in the way of defending our friend and ally, the Nation of \nIsrael.\n  As alarming as the increasing collaboration is between Iran and \nVenezuela, there is no country that has a greater stake in preserving \nthe status quo in Venezuela than communist Cuba. Over the 15 years of \nHugo Chavez's rule, Venezuela and Cuba have engaged in a mutually \nparasitic relationship in which Venezuela has exported free oil to Cuba \nand imported the repressive apparatus of a police state that Raul and \nFidel Castro have carefully nurtured other the last 50 years.\n  Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1992, many former \nSoviet satellites have moved towards freedom and prosperity promised by \ncloser ties\n\n[[Page S1155]]\n\nto the West--some even joining the historic NATO alliance. But Cuba, \ntragically, has remained mired in the communist past in no small part \nbecause Chavez provided the economic lifeline that sustained the Castro \nbrothers' brutal oppression.\n  While some hoped that after Raul Castro replaced his brother in 2008, \na new era of moderation might dawn, the opposite has occurred. Despite \nminor cosmetic reforms largely targeted toward beguiling the Western \nmedia rather than helping the Cuban people, the Castros have \nconsolidated their control of the island with a significant uptick in \nhuman rights abuses.\n  Last year I had the opportunity to visit and interview two Cuban \ndissidents to help provide a forum for them to tell their stories. They \ndescribed the oppression as ``Putinismo.'' That said it was following \nthe strategy of Russia's President Putin, appearing on the outside to \nmake cosmetic reforms while brutally repressing the people at home. \nThat is what is happening in Cuba.\n  The Castro playbook includes targeting family members of the \nopposition, brutal attacks and even murder, as well as keeping \ninexorable control over communications in and out of Cuba.\n  An American citizen, Alan Gross, was thrown into prison in 2009 for \nthe crime of handing out cell phones to Havana's Jewish population. \nAlan Gross should be released, and the United States should be calling \nfor Alan Gross's release.\n  In a tip to the information age, heavy Internet censorship, among the \nmost repressive on the planet, blankets the island to preempt the \nspontaneous organization facilitated by social media.\n  First Chavez, and now Maduro, have learned these lessons well under \nthe tutelage of agents from the Cuban intelligence services, and their \nwork has been on grim display during the protests that have taken place \nthis month. The death toll is now at 13, and climbing, as police \nbullets have taken the lives of not only activists, but of students, \ninnocent bystanders, and even a beauty queen.\n  Maduro's agents have also borrowed the tried-and-true Castro \ntradition of summarily detaining opposition leaders, including Leopoldo \nLopez who helped organize the protests. But Mr. Lopez's real crime has \nbeen to propose an alternative to the socialist catastrophe into which \nChavez and Maduro have plunged this once prosperous nation, and to \nsuggest that real economic freedom is the only path out of the rampant \ninflation and chronic shortages that are making life in Venezuela \nintolerable.\n  Recent polling by Gallup reveals a dramatic shift in Venezuelans' \nattitude toward the economy, as the socialist policies continue to \ndepress growth and to worsen the lives of hard-working Venezuelans. In \n2012, just a couple of years ago, 22 percent of the population thought \nthe economy was getting worse and 41 percent thought it was getting \nbetter. In 2013, those numbers reversed, with 62 percent believing it \nwas getting worse while only 12 percent believed it was getting better. \nThese numbers suggest there has been a sea change in how the majority \nof Venezuelans see their situation. These protests are different, and \nit is little wonder that so many have taken to the streets to demand \nsomething better.\n  America should stand with the protesters. America should stand on the \nside of freedom. America has a tradition for centuries of presenting a \nclarion voice for freedom because every heart yearns to be free across \nthe globe, and the United States should unapologetically defend \nfreedom.\n  Maduro appears to understand the threat of his people demanding \nfreedom, but the unprecedented scale of his crackdown on the protesters \nhas largely been masked from the rest of the world by a heavy veil of \nInternet and media censorship designed to simultaneously disable the \nopposition and to mask the scale of their oppression from the outside \nworld. Some ingenious remedies have emerged, including Austin, TX's, \nown Zello--a direct messaging service that allows members to \ncommunicate freely either privately with individuals or over open \nchannels that can support hundreds of thousands of users. Despite the \nbest efforts of the Venezuelan censors to block access to Zello, the \ncompany has nimbly developed patches and work-arounds to maintain \nservice to the some 600,000 Venezuelans who have downloaded the app \nsince the protests began.\n  Zello is a shining example of how we can use our technological \nadvantage to support those fighting for economic and political freedom \nacross the globe, recalling our proud tradition of Radio Free Europe \nduring the Cold War. Can my colleagues imagine apps such as Zello \nspreading to millions of Cubans, to millions of Iranians, to millions \nof Chinese, providing them the tools to directly speak out for freedom? \nWe have other ways of supporting those advocating for a more free and \nprosperous Venezuela, such as supporting the sort of liberal economic \nreforms Mr. Lopez has proposed.\n  Given the remarkable natural resources Venezuela has enjoyed, it is \nridiculous--it is tragic--that the economy has been so mismanaged that \ncitizens face a chronic shortage of basic necessities. But this \nsituation is not inevitable, and the United States is uniquely poised \nto help. For the United States, Canada, and now Mexico, democratic, \nmarket-oriented energy production has been the foundation of what we \nare beginning to call the American energy renaissance--and there is no \nreason that Venezuela could not reap these benefits if they reverse the \nsocialist policies that have destroyed their economy.\n  In this event the United States could help Venezuela reach its full \nenergy potential by offering a bilateral investment treaty that would \ncover the energy sector. Such an arrangement would protect American \ncompanies eager to invest in Venezuela and, at the same time, modernize \nfacilities and increase production of crude--which, I might add, can be \nrefined at the CITGO facilities in Corpus Christi, TX--resulting in \ngasoline and other refined petroleum products that can be sold on the \nopen market for the benefit of the Venezuelan people, not given to Cuba \nto prop up the Castros. Which is the better deal for the Venezuelan \npeople: having them receive the benefits of the bounty God has given \nthat country in the open market, receive freedom, receive material \nblessings, or have instead their oil given to Castro to fuel the \nrepressive policies that are inflicting misery on so many millions?\n  This is a dangerous and unsettling moment for Venezuela, but it is \nalso a moment of great opportunity. Almost exactly 1 year ago, the \nObama administration had a chance to push strongly for reform in \nVenezuela, when Chavez was on his deathbed. Instead, the Obama \nadministration opted not to rock the boat, in the hopes that Chavez's \nhand-picked successor would prove more susceptible to diplomatic \noutreach, that he might not follow Chavez. These hopes are apparently \nevergreen, as just yesterday a State Department spokeswoman announced \nthat they were open to closer engagement with the Maduro regime, \nsaying: ``We have indicated, and have indicated for months, our \nopenness to develop a more constructive relationship with Venezuela . . \n. .''\n  Negotiating with tyrants and bullies doesn't work. The notion that \nour State Department could at this moment extend yet another olive \nbranch to Caracas is exactly backward. This is the moment to point out \nthat Maduro's abuse of his fellow citizens is intolerable to the United \nStates; that if he wants better relations with us, he should start by \nlistening to the demands of his own people. He should immediately and \nunconditionally release Leopoldo Lopez, who is being held as a hostage \nat the mercy of an authoritarian state. He should lift the cloud of \ncensorship that he is using to isolate Venezuelans from each other and \nfrom the rest of the world, and the United States should do all it can \nto help the people of Venezuela as they choose a different path--a path \nof freedom and prosperity that will return this one-time enemy to their \ntraditional role of our partner and friend. That is where the \nVenezuelan people want to be, and it is only their brutal leadership \nthat is preventing it.\n  This is a time for American leadership to speak in defense of \nfreedom. This is a time for the President of the United States to \nunequivocally stand against oppression, against totalitarianism, and \nfor the desire of the Venezuelan people to be free and prosperous. That \nwould benefit them, it\n\n[[Page S1156]]\n\nwould benefit us, and it would benefit the world.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I wish to say something about the Iran \nsanctions legislation that is contained in the alternative bill of \nwhich Senator Burr has been the chief architect. First I wish to speak \nbriefly on what is happening in the Ukraine. Late last year, the \ncountry's increasingly autocratic President, Viktor Yanukovych, refused \nto sign a trade agreement with the European Union after coming under \nstrong pressure from Russian leader Vladimir Putin. His refusal to sign \nthe trade deal, coupled with the government's persistent attacks on \ndemocracy and civil liberties, as well as growing fears of Moscow's \neffort to turn Ukraine into a puppet state, sparked massive street \nprotests in the capital city of Kiev. When the government responded \nwith violence, the situation rapidly spiraled out of control until \neventually President Yanukovych was expelled from office and forced to \nflee.\n  It has been almost a decade since Ukraine's Orange Revolution \ncaptured the attention and spirits of freedom lovers across the globe. \nNow the country is once again at a crossroads. The decisions that are \nmade in the days and weeks that lie ahead will determine whether \nUkraine is allowed to flourish as a pro-Western democracy or it is \nforced to languish in corruption and authoritarianism as a Russian \nsatellite.\n  It is time for the President of the United States--the Commander in \nChief, President Obama--to remind the world where America stands in the \nongoing battle between democracy and dictatorship. It is time for him \nto rethink the so-called reset policy that has done nothing but \nembolden Vladimir Putin and discourage Russian human rights activists. \nIt is time for the President to make absolutely clear that Russian \nmeddling in the sovereign affairs of Ukraine is absolutely \nunacceptable.\n  As for Putin himself, it is time people everywhere see him for what \nhe really is: a brutal thug who epitomizes corruption, repression, and \ndictatorship.\n  Turning to another important issue, which is what is happening in \nIran, just a few months ago, after years of mounting sanctions and \neconomic pressures, it appeared the West had finally gotten the Iranian \ndictatorship's attention and it was literally on the ropes. But then, \nfor some reason, we chose to let them off the hook and to throw them a \nlifeline and to give up some of the very best leverage we had obtained \nover the course of years for minor concessions and hollow promises.\n  While the Obama administration is still trumpeting the November 2013 \nIranian nuclear agreement as a diplomatic watershed, I remain deeply \nskeptical and concerned that we threw an economic lifeline to the \nworld's leading state sponsor of international terrorism, even though \nthe ayatollahs have shown no real willingness to abandon their decades-\nlong quest for a nuclear weapon. Of course, were Iran to achieve a \nnuclear weapon, there would be a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, \ndramatically destabilizing that already very volatile region of the \nworld.\n  So given that reality, along with Iran's well-documented record of \nduplicity, I have joined with 58 other of my Senate colleagues--\nRepublicans and Democrats alike--in sponsoring new sanctions \nlegislation. We have been ably led by the Senator from Illinois Mr. \nKirk and other leaders. It is something called the Nuclear Weapon Free \nIran Act that would take effect if and only if Tehran violated the \nGeneva agreement.\n  In other words, this is a backstop to the negotiations that Secretary \nKerry has had and that the President has pointed to, but amazingly the \nObama administration has taken the very bizarre position that the \nDemocrats who are supporting this legislation--this backstop \nlegislation that would do nothing to undermine the negotiations between \nthe Secretary of State and other nations in the region--the President \nis now urging Democrats to stop supporting this important piece of \nbackstop legislation, even though a commanding majority of the Senate \nhas indicated their support for it.\n  In fact, the President has gone so far as to promise a veto of this \nlegislation if it reaches his desk. Of course, it is not true, as the \nPresident argues, that this legislation would effectively sabotage the \nGeneva deal. In truth and in fact, what it would do is provide, as I \nsaid, a backstop but reinforce what the President and Secretary Kerry \nare so proud of in terms of what they have already negotiated. If Iran \nfollows through, then this sanctions legislation would be of little \nforce and effect.\n  I am not sure I understand the administration's concern. After all, \nif the administration thinks Iran will follow through on its Geneva \ncommitments--something I am personally skeptical of--but if the \nPresident thinks they will follow through, then there is nothing to \nworry about. But if the administration believes that Iran will fail to \nhonor those commitments, then it never should have made the deal in the \nfirst place and it should have welcomed this amendment, this piece of \nlegislation, this backstop sanctions legislation that would buttress \nwhat they have negotiated.\n  I believe today what I have believed for many years--that our only \nhope for a peaceful resolution of the Iranian nuclear crisis is to \ncombine tough sanctions with the credible threat of military action. \nThat is the only thing that will bring the ayatollahs to the table, and \nthat is why we need to vote on new sanctions as soon as possible, \npreferably this week, to demonstrate that there will be serious \nconsequences if Iran fails to uphold the Geneva deal or if it tries to \ndelay indefinitely a final agreement.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I would like to be recognized for 10 \nminutes, if I could.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, thank you. If the Presiding Officer \nwould let me know when the 10 minutes expire, I would appreciate it.\n  I wish to rise in support of Senator Burr's alternative to Senator \nSanders' veterans bill. We are having a contest here about how best to \nhelp veterans. There is a lot of bipartisan agreement over the \nsubstance of the bill. The real difference is how to pay for it, but \nthere is one key difference. In Senator Burr's alternative, we have the \nIranian sanctions bill. I believe it is imperative for this body, the \nSenate, to speak on sanctions against Iran before it is too late. I \nhate the fact that we have lost our bipartisan approach to this topic.\n  We have been together for a very long time as Republicans and \nDemocrats. We have had 16 rounds of sanctions since 1987, 9 U.N. \nSecurity Council resolutions since 2006 demanding the full and \nsustained suspension of all uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing \nactivities and full cooperation with the IAEA.\n  The United Nations, the Congress, in an overwhelming bipartisan \nfashion, have been imposing sanctions in speaking to the threat we all \nface from the Iranian nuclear program. Unfortunately, the \nbipartisanship has come apart in terms of whether we should have \nanother vote. The bipartisan bill that would reauthorize sanctions at \nthe end of the 6-month negotiating period has 59 cosponsors, 17 \nDemocrats.\n  We believe desperately--at least I do--that the sanctions that have \nbeen so effective in bringing the Iranians to the table are literally \nfalling apart, and I will have some evidence to show that.\n  But here is what Senator Reid, the majority leader, said on November \n21, 2013:\n\n       I am a strong supporter of our Iran sanctions regime and \n     believe that the current\n\n[[Page S1157]]\n\n     sanctions have brought Iran to the negotiating table.\n       I believe we must do everything possible to stop Iran from \n     getting nuclear weapons capability, which would threaten \n     Israel and the national security of our great country.\n       The Obama administration is in the midst of negotiations \n     with the Iranians that are designed to end their nuclear \n     weapons program. We all strongly support these negotiations \n     and hope they will succeed, and we want them to produce the \n     strongest possible agreement.\n       However, we are also aware of the possibility the Iranians \n     could keep negotiations from succeeding. I hope that won't \n     happen, but the Senate must be prepared to move forward with \n     a new bipartisan Iran sanctions bill when the Senate returns \n     after the Thanksgiving recess. I am committed to do just \n     that.\n       I will support a bill that would broaden the scope of our \n     current petroleum sanctions, place limitations on trade with \n     strategic sectors of the Iranian economy that support its \n     nuclear ambitions, as well as pursue those that divert goods \n     to Iran.\n       While I support the administration's diplomatic efforts, I \n     believe we need to leave our legislative options open to act \n     on a new bipartisan sanctions bill in December, shortly after \n     we return.\n\n  The challenge of the majority leader was to find a bipartisan bill \nthat could speak anew to sanctions. We are able to do that. Senator \nMenendez has been absolutely terrific, along with Senator Kirk, in \nmaking sure that sanctions have worked. The Obama administration \ndeserves a lot of credit for keeping the sanctions regime together and \ngetting Iranians to the table.\n  But the interim agreement that has been entered into between the P5+1 \nand the Iranians quite frankly is well short of what we need. My goal, \nand I think the body's goal--at least I hope--would be to dismantle the \nplutonium-producing reactor that the Iranians are building; not just \nstop its construction, but dismantle it; take the highly enriched \nuranium that exists in Iran today and move it out of the country so it \ncannot be used for a dirty bomb or any other purposes.\n  This is what the U.N. resolutions have called for, removing the \nhighly enriched uranium that exists in great number from Iran to the \ninternational community so it can be controlled; and, last but most \nimportantly is to dismantle their enrichment capability. If the \nIranians truly want a peaceful nuclear power program, I am all for \nthat. I do not care if the Russians are jointly with us, that we build \na nuclear powerplant in Iran to help them with commercial nuclear \npower. We just need to control the fuel cycle. There are 15 countries \nthat have nuclear power programs that do not enrich uranium, Mexico and \nCanada being two, South Korea being another.\n  The point I am trying to make here is if you leave enrichment \ncapability intact in Iran, the only thing preventing their abuse of \nthat capability would be a bunch of U.N. inspectors. We tried this with \nNorth Korea. We provided foreign aid and economic aid and food \nassistance to control their nuclear ambitions. Well, they took the \nmoney and now they have nuclear weapons. The U.N. failed to stop the \ndesire of the North Koreans to develop a nuclear weapon.\n  That type of approach is not going to work in Iran. Israel is not \ngoing to allow their fate to be determined by a bunch of U.N. \ninspectors. If that is the only thing between the Iranian ayatollahs \nand nuclear weapons is a bunch of U.N. inspectors, Israel will not \nstand for that, nor should we.\n  So when the Iranians demand the right to enrich, that tells you all \nyou need to know about their ambitions. If they want a peaceful nuclear \npower program, they certainly can have it. We need to control the fuel \ncycle.\n  The interim deal has not dismantled any centrifuges. They have \nunplugged a few, but all of them exist, the 16,000 to 18,000 of them. \nHere is what the Iranian Government has been openly saying about the \ninterim deal:\n\n       The iceberg of sanctions is melting while our centrifuges \n     are also still working. This is our greatest achievement.\n\n  This is the head of the Iranian nuclear agency. The Foreign Minister \nsaid:\n\n       The White House tries to portray it is basically a \n     dismantling of Iran's nuclear program. We are not dismantling \n     any centrifuges, we're not dismantling any equipment, we're \n     simply not producing, not enriching over 5 percent.\n\n  Pretty clear. This is the President of Iran, Mr. Rouhani, on CNN.\n\n       So there will be no destruction of centrifuges--of existing \n     centrifuges?\n       No. No, not at all.\n\n  Another statement, another tweet:\n\n       Our relationship with the world is based on Iran's nation's \n     interest. In Geneva agreement, world powers surrendered to \n     Iran's national will.\n\n  You could say this is all bluster for domestic consumption. But just \nkeep listening to what I have to tell you. The Iranian Deputy Foreign \nMinister said of the interconnections between networks of centrifuges \nthat have been used to enrich uranium to 20 percent, so that they can \nenrich only to 5 percent: ``These interconnections can be removed in a \nday and connected again in a day.''\n  So you are not dismantling anything. You are unplugging it. They can \nplug it right back in. Here is what has happened, the President of Iran \nagain:\n\n       We have struck the first blow to the illegal sanctions, in \n     the fields of insurance, shipping, the banking system, \n     foodstuffs and medicine and exports of petrochemical \n     materials.\n       You are witness to how foreign firms are visiting our \n     country; 117 political delegations have come here: France, \n     Turkey, Georgia, Ireland, Tunisia, Kazakhstan, China, Italy, \n     India, Austria, and Sweden.\n\n  The French Chamber of Commerce hosted a delegation to Iran after the \ninterim deal. The International Monetary Fund says the Iranian economy \ncould turn around due to the interim agreement. Prospects for 2014 and \n2015 have improved with the agreement. They are getting a stronger \neconomy. The interim deal has done nothing, in my view, to dismantle \ntheir nuclear program that is a threat to us and Israel.\n  India's oil imports from Iran more than doubled in January from a \nmonth earlier. China has emerged as Iran's top trading partner, with \nnonoil trade hitting $13 billion over the past 10 months. U.S. \naerospace companies are talking about selling them parts. Thirteen \nmajor international companies have said in recent weeks they aim to \nreenter the Iranian marketplace over the next several months.\n  The value of their currency has appreciated about 25 percent. \nInflation has been reduced substantially. In other words, the interim \ndeal is beginning to revive the Iranian economy that was crippled by \nsanctions. The international community is lining up to do business in \nIran. The sanctions against Iran are crumbling before our eyes, and the \nIranians are openly bragging about this.\n  The only way to turn this around is to pass another piece of \nlegislation that says, we will give the 6-month period of negotiations \ntime to develop, but at the end of the 6 months, if we have not \nachieved a satisfactory result of dismantling their nuclear program, \nthe sanctions will continue at a greater pace.\n  Without that threat, without that friction, we are going to get a \nvery bad outcome here. The administration says that new sanctions will \nscuttle the deal and lead to war. I could not disagree more. The lack \nof threat of sanctions, the dismantling of sanctions, the crumbling of \nsanctions is going to lead to conflict. I do believe that if this body \nreinforced that we were serious about sanctions until the program gets \nto where the world thinks it should be, then we would be reinforcing \nour negotiating position.\n  So to my Democratic colleagues and Democratic leadership, I am urging \nyou, please, to let this bipartisan bill go forward, if not in the Burr \nalternative, bring it up as a separate piece of legislation. Let's act \nnow while we still can. I am hopeful we can avoid a conflict with the \nIranians. But the only way to do that--I ask unanimous consent for 5 \nmore minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The only way to do that is to make the Iranians \nunderstand that they are never going to have prosperity and peace until \nthey comply with the will of the international community, which is give \nthem a peaceful nuclear power program, not a weapons capability. Rather \nthan us bending to their will, they need to bend to ours, simply \nbecause a disaster is in the making if Iran comes out of this \nnegotiation with their nuclear capability intact.\n  If you allow the Iranians to enrich uranium, that is the final deal, \nwhere they still have an enrichment capability, theoretically \ncontrolled by the\n\n[[Page S1158]]\n\nU.N., every Sunni Arab state will want an enrichment program of their \nown, and you have destroyed nonproliferation in the Mideast.\n  I say again, if this final agreement allows enrichment at any level \nby the Iranians, Sunni Arab states are going to go down the same road. \nThen we are marching toward Armageddon, I fear. The last thing in the \nworld we want to do is allow the Iranians to enrich, telling our allies \nthey cannot. That will lead to proliferation of enrichment throughout \nthe Mideast, and you are one step away from a weapon.\n  If you had to make a list of countries based on the behavior that you \nshould not trust with enriching uranium, Iran would be at the top. For \nthe last 30 years they have sown destruction throughout the world, a \nstate sponsor of terrorism. They have killed our troops in Iraq; they \nare supplying weapons to the enemies of Israel; they have been up to \njust generally no good. Why in the world we would give them this \ncapability I cannot envision.\n  So the sanctions are crumbling. We see it before our eyes. The threat \nof military force against the regime I think has been diminished after \nthe debacle in Syria. Do you really think the Iranians believe after \nthe Syrian debacle that we mean it when we say we would use military \nforce as a last resort? I do not want a military engagement against the \nIranians. I just want their nuclear ambitions to end and give them a \nnuclear powerplant that is controlled to produce power and not make a \nbomb.\n  The Israelis will not live under the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran. \nThey will not allow this program to stay intact, unlike North Korea, \nwhere the South Koreans and the Japanese did not feel they needed a \nnuclear program to counter the North Koreans.\n  The Mideast is different. The Sunni Arabs will not be comfortable \nwith an enrichment capability given to the Iranians. Israel will never \naccept this, because it is a threat to the Jewish state unlike any \nother. So I will urge the body, before it is too late, to take the \nearliest opportunity to pass the bipartisan legislation that would \nreimpose sanctions if the agreement does not reach a satisfactory \nconclusion in the next 6 months.\n  We have 59 cosponsors. If we had a vote, I am confident we could get \nan overwhelming vote. It would be the right thing to send to the \nIranians. It would tell the Western World: Slow down. The idea of \ngiving this 6 months to continue at the pace it is going, it would be \nimpossible to reconstruct sanctions if we do not do it now. Six months \nfrom now, if the deal falls apart, President Obama says he would impose \nsanctions in 24 hours. By then, the regime will have been broken. \nWestern Europe will have been basically out of the game; they have a \ndifferent view of this than we do. So the idea you can wait for 6 \nmonths and the damage not be done, I think is unrealistic. You can see \nwhere the world is headed. Sanctions as a viable control device seems \nto be in everybody's rearview mirror unless the Congress acts, and acts \ndecisively.\n  What I hope we can do, in a bipartisan fashion, is let our allies and \nthe Iranians know that sanctions are going to be in place as long as \nthe nuclear threat continues to exist. I hope the President will \nreinforce to the Iranians: Whatever problem I had in Syria, I do not \nhave with you.\n  I hope the Congress could send a message to the Iranians that we do \nnot want a conflict, but we see your nuclear ambitions as a threat to \nour way of life. While we may be confused about what to do in Syria, we \nare not confused about the Iranian nuclear program. We want a peaceful \nresolution. Sanctions have to be in place until we get the right \nanswer. But if everything else fails, then we are ready to do what is \nnecessary as a nation as a last resort to use military force. I say \nthat understanding the consequences of military force. It would not be \na pleasant task. But in a war between us and Iran, we win, they lose. \nThey have a small navy, a small air force. I do not want war with \nanyone. But if my options are to use military force to stop the \nIranians from getting a nuclear weapon, I am picking use of military \nforce. Because if they get a nuclear weapon, then the whole Mideast \ngoes down the wrong road. You would open Pandora's box to attack the \nIranians. They could do some damage to us, but it would not last long. \nThey lose, we win. If they get a nuclear capability, you have created a \nnuclear arms race in the Mideast and you will empty Pandora's box and \nput Israel in an impossible spot.\n  So, my colleagues, we have a chance here to turn history around \nbefore it is too late. But the way we are moving regarding this \nnegotiation with Iran and the outcome, I have never been more worried \nabout. I do not want to allow the last best chance to stop the Iranian \nnuclear program to be lost through inaction.\n  If we misread where Iran is actually going, it will be a mistake for \nthe ages.\n  I am urging the majority leader, if not on this bill, as soon as \npossible, to allow the bipartisan Iranian sanction legislation to come \nto the floor for debate and a vote. I think it can change history \nbefore it is too late.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I stand here as someone who is very \ninterested in our Nation's veterans. We owe the men and women who stood \nin defense of our Nation the care and services they deserve for the \nsacrifices they have made for our country.\n  My dad served in the Air Force for over 20 years, and his service and \nsacrifice is in no small part why I am a Member of the Senate Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, and previously the House Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee. I requested to be a member of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittees in both Chambers because we made a commitment to take care \nof those who put their lives on the line for our safety and ideals, and \nI believe in carrying out the promise.\n  During my days as a Member of the House of Representatives, my mom \nwould routinely ask me when I would see her: What have you done for our \nveterans lately? I was happy to talk about the programs and services we \npromoted, supported, and passed--and certainly in a very bipartisan \nway. There is a long list of accomplishments of which we can be very \nproud, from modernizing the GI bill so our veterans can get the \neducation they need to succeed in life after the military, to helping \nour veterans pursue their dreams of owning a business, to improving the \nmedical services our veterans need for the wounds they have suffered \nwhile serving our country.\n  Unfortunately, problems exist. In my Arkansas office--and I think \nthis is true of most congressional offices--we have a number of \ndedicated staffers. In fact, we have three dedicated staffers who \nhandle veterans-related issues. They help cut through the redtape of \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs to get the care and attention our \nveterans have earned. Last year, more than 40 percent of the assistance \nwe provided to Arkansans that involved Federal agencies focused on \nveterans' issues.\n  Increasing funding doesn't necessarily mean we will have better \noutcomes. Take for instance the claims backlog. This is a huge problem \nimpacting hundreds of thousands of veterans nationwide. Even some of \nthe simplest claims are stuck in the process. Since 2009, the number of \nclaims pending for over 1 year has grown, despite a 40 percent increase \nin the VA's budget. The most recent statistics for the Little Rock VA \nRegional Office showed 7,663 total claims are pending. Nearly 54 \npercent have been in the process for more than 125 days. The regional \noffice averages nearly 217 days to complete a claim.\n  Thanks to the hard work and commitment of Arkansans who work at the \nVA, we are making progress on the backlog at the Little Rock office, \nbut there is still work to be done for our veterans. Take, for \ninstance, the retired lieutenant colonel in Arkansas who is eligible \nfor benefits he earned for his service in the military. He is not \nreceiving the correct pay. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service \napproved his paperwork in August and sent it to the VA. It has been 6 \nmonths and still no decision has been made. This is an easy case, and \nit simply shouldn't take that long.\n  Retired CSM Richard Green lives in Sherwood and has already received \nhis\n\n[[Page S1159]]\n\nretirement benefits, but he filed for benefits for his wife the month \nafter they married in October 2012. It took 16 months to process that \npaperwork--much longer than he was used to during active military \nservice when this sort of paperwork was fixed within one or two \npaychecks. Every part of the claims process is overwhelmed and bogged \ndown.\n\n  Paul Cupp from Fort Smith, AR, has been working on his VA appeal \nsince 2009. He was happy to get part of it approved in 2013, after 4 \nyears of waiting. However, months later, he is still waiting for his \nrating to get updated and to see the actual benefits from that \ndecision.\n  And the widows of our veterans are not exempt from this backlog. One \nArkansan in her seventies has been working on her claim since 2005, and \nis still awaiting a decision on appeal. Nine years is certainly \nunacceptable.\n  Instead of fixing the existing challenges our veterans are facing \nthrough fully implementing what we have committed ourselves to, \nincreasing accountability and improving efficiency, some of my \ncolleagues think the best way to tackle this is by expanding programs \nand increasing the responsibility of the VA. The problem is we are \nputting more people in a system which is clearly overwhelmed and needs \nimprovement.\n  This isn't the fault of the VA, which I believe is fully committed to \nmeeting all the demands our veterans and Congress expect from them. \nHowever, the VA can only do so much. As the number of veterans and the \ncomplicated nature of their needs increases, we must not pile on \nadditional responsibilities which overwhelm the agency. With the \nannouncement by Senator Hagel of a potentially significant drawdown in \nthe military, many more individuals will come into the VA system.\n  While the bill before us has worthwhile programs which I support and \nhave championed, we should not expect a massive mandate imposed on VA \nto change the outcomes we experience. We need a measured approach to \nchanges. They must be done over time and include oversight to make sure \nour veterans are receiving the attention they deserve in a timely \nmanner.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, it is great to see my colleague from \nArkansas. We know Senator Boozman tries hard to help our veterans. I \nthank him for his public service and for focusing on our men and women, \nwhether they are in uniform now or who have served this country.\n  In the last few weeks I have talked quite a bit about veterans. We \nhave had the veterans retirement cost-of-living fix and a few others \nwhich have brought me to the floor to talk about this very important \ngroup of people.\n  In my State of Arkansas we have nearly 255,000 veterans. They have \nput on the uniform and served their country. They have put their lives \non hold for our country. They deserve to return home to a country which \nis going to honor the commitments we have made to them and a country \nwhich will keep the promises we have made, which is why I have been \nvery supportive of these individuals, especially in the context of the \nComprehensive Veterans Health and Benefits and Military Retirement Pay \nRestoration Act of 2014, S. 1982.\n  Many Senators are working to make this bill better and get it into a \nposture where it can pass the Senate. This is a commonsense bill which \ncovers a broad range of topics which are important to our veterans, and \na lot of work is going on here behind the scenes. Sometimes when the \nAmerican people visit the Senate or tune in to C-SPAN 2, they sometimes \nsee an empty Chamber. They aren't always aware of what is going on in \nthe back rooms, here and in the hallways, with folks trying to work \nthrough a number of important issues, which is happening with this \nbill.\n  I have an important provision in this bill which I have been working \non for a while. I think it is going to have broad support on both sides \nof the aisle, as well as a number of military organizations around the \ncountry, called the Honor America's Guard and Reserve Retirees Act. It \nis kind of a long name, but it is a very simple premise.\n  Under current law, the military definition of a veteran applies only \nto servicemembers who have served on Federal active duty under title X \norders. This means that many of our servicemembers--most specifically \nour National Guard members--who have not been deployed under proper \norders are falling short of this established criteria.\n  To put this in perspective: I recently received a letter from an \nArkansas veteran named Vincent. He served for more than 20 years in the \nNational Guard. He has protected our families from natural disasters \nsuch as Hurricane Katrina. He served our country by protecting our \nborders in Operation Jump Start. He served our Nation in Operation \nDesert Shield, Desert Storm, Enduring Freedom, and in Iraqi Freedom. \nYet he still doesn't meet the military definition of a veteran of the \narmed services.\n  Vincent isn't the only one. There are 300,000 National Guard and \nReserve servicemembers across the country who fall into this same \ncategory. My bill, the Honor America's Guard and Reserve Retirees Act, \nwould fix this. It would amend the military definition of veteran to \ngive Guard and Reserve retirees with 20 years of service the honor of \nbeing called a veteran. And it is an honor. It would allow these \nservicemembers to salute when the Star-Spangled Banner is played, to \nmarch in veterans' parades, and be recognized as veterans by other \nveterans.\n  I know Members of this Chamber will ask, as they should: This is a \ncost-neutral bill. There is no cost with this. It is simple, it is cost \nneutral, and it is an overdue recognition of these individual \nservicemembers who served bravely for our country.\n  It is time we pass this bill so Vincent and hundreds and thousands of \nothers can receive the honor they deserve.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this morning when I came to the Senate \nfloor, I talked about how it is groundhog year, not ``Groundhog Day.'' \nWhat is going on here today is an example of what has been going on \nwith the Republican-driven direction of this Congress for several \nyears.\n  What are we doing here today? Nothing. Under the rules of the Senate, \ncloture was invoked 99 to 0. The purpose of that vote was to get on a \nbill. It is a shame we had to even file cloture on it, but we did, and \nthat takes a couple of days. Everyone should understand that after \ncloture is invoked, there is 30 hours. It is a waste of time.\n  Why are they doing that? Why are they causing this? Because they \ndon't want to legislate. They want to do anything they can to stop \nPresident Obama from accomplishing anything.\n  Bernie Sanders, chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, has \ndedicated his heart and soul to something he, his committee, and the \nveterans community believes in--improving the lives of veterans. We \nhave millions of people who have come home, and are coming home, from \nthe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. They deserve a lot.\n  The legislation that is on this floor is terrific. It is supported by \n26 different veterans organizations, including the largest, the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars. Here is what the commander of the Veterans of \nForeign Wars said earlier today:\n\n       American Legion National Commander Daniel M. Dellinger said \n     Wednesday--\n\n  That is today--\n\n     that sanctions against Iran have no place in a U.S. Senate \n     debate over legislation that aims to expand health care, \n     education opportunities, employment and other benefits for \n     veterans.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that his complete statement be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Commander: Keep Senate Bill Focused on Vets\n\n       American Legion leader says no other issues need to be \n     attached to legislation to improve health care, education, \n     employment and benefits for those who served our nation.\n\n\n[[Page S1160]]\n\n\n       Washington (Feb. 26, 2014).--American Legion National \n     Commander Daniel M. Dellinger said Wednesday that sanctions \n     against Iran have no place in a U.S. Senate debate over \n     legislation that aims to expand health care, education \n     opportunities, employment and other benefits for veterans.\n       ``Iran is a serious issue that Congress needs to address, \n     but it cannot be tied to S. 1982, which is extremely \n     important as our nation prepares to welcome millions of U.S. \n     military servicemen and women home from war. This \n     comprehensive bill aims to help veterans find good jobs, get \n     the health care they need and make in-state tuition rates \n     applicable to all who are using their GI Bill benefits. This \n     legislation is about supporting veterans, pure and simple. \n     The Senate can debate various aspects of it, and that's \n     understandable, but it cannot lose focus on the matter at \n     hand: helping military personnel make the transition to \n     veteran life and ensuring that those who served their nation \n     in uniform receive the benefits they earned and deserve. We \n     can deal with Iran--or any other issue unrelated specifically \n     to veterans--with separate legislation.''\n       A 99-0 vote in the Senate Tuesday cleared the way for a \n     full debate on S. 1982, introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-\n     Vt., chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. \n     The bill seeks to improve medical and dental care offered by \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs, open 27 new VA clinics \n     where access to care is now difficult, renew the Vow to Hire \n     Heroes Act that has helped some 70,000 veterans find jobs and \n     receive employment training, improve care for those who \n     experienced military sexual trauma and protect cost-of-living \n     adjustments for future military retirees.\n       Dellinger is the leader of the nation's largest veterans \n     service organization, the 2.4-million-member American Legion.\n\n  Mr. REID. It goes into detail as to how wrongheaded this is, that the \nRepublicans are trying to divert attention from an issue that is so \nvery important to the American people, and why their continued \nobstruction has been so detrimental to our country.\n\n\n                            Koch Advertizing\n\n  Mr. President, I can't say that every one of the Koch brothers' ads \nis a lie, but I will say this: The vast majority of them are. Now, \nenough editorial comment. I am going to read verbatim a column that \nappeared in today's The Hill magazine--newspaper, I should call it--\nhere on the Hill. It is entitled ``Koch brothers' ads shameful.'' Let \nme read this:\n\n       Having a right is not the same thing as being in the right.\n       In some instances, we have the right to behave immorally. \n     For example, the First Amendment gives some people, in some \n     circumstances, the right to lie.\n       Let's set aside for a moment whether the billionaire Koch \n     brothers have the right to run a flurry of dishonest ads \n     about ObamaCare and ask instead whether spending millions of \n     dollars to mislead and even lie to the American people is the \n     right thing to do.\n       There is no legitimate debate about the integrity of the \n     ads. In Louisiana, the Kochs' political front group placed an \n     ad that, to all appearances, features a group of Louisianans \n     opening letters from insurance companies informing them about \n     the problems they face as a result of the Affordable Care \n     Act.\n       Except that, as ABC News has documented, the individuals in \n     their ad are not Louisianans. They are paid actors who are \n     not reading actual letters sent by any real insurance \n     company.\n       In other words, nothing about the ad is true.\n       The response from the brothers' organization: ``The viewing \n     public is savvy enough to distinguish between someone giving \n     a personal story and something that is emblematic.''\n\n  A little editorial comment before I continue with this op-ed piece: \nHow about that for a response? That is code word for ``we have a lot of \nmoney, and we will run ads about anything we want to run ads about.''\n  I continue the column:\n\n       Were this an ad for Stainmaster carpet, a Koch product, \n     Federal Trade Commission guidelines would require the ad to \n     ``conspicuously disclose that the persons in such \n     advertisements are not actual consumers.''\n\n  That is from the FTC.\n\n       Moreover, the FTC would require them to either demonstrate \n     that these results of ObamaCare are typical or make clear in \n     the ad that they are not.\n       Needless to say, the ad meets none of these requirements, \n     thereby conforming to the legal definition of false \n     advertising.\n       Not all Koch ads feature actors. Even those with real \n     people, though, are not necessarily factual. Witness the \n     attack on Rep. Gary Peters (D-Mich.)--\n\n  Who, by the way, is running for the Senate--\n\n     in a Koch-funded ad featuring a Michigan leukemia patient.\n       Everyone sympathizes with her struggle, as well they \n     should. But neither her bravery nor her suffering makes the \n     words she utters true. They aren't.\n       In the ad, the patient claims, with ObamaCare ``the out-of-\n     pocket costs are so high, it is unaffordable.'' The Detroit \n     News reports the ``ad makes no mention that [the patient] \n     successfully enrolled in a new Blue Cross plan where she's \n     been able to retain her University of Michigan oncologist and \n     continues to receive the life-saving oral chemotherapy. . . . \n     The ad also does not mention that [her] health care premiums \n     were cut in half.''\n       The Washington Post's Glenn Kessler did the math. She saved \n     $6,348 a year on premiums. And because ObamaCare caps out-of-\n     pocket costs for plans at $6,350, she will be paying, at \n     most, $2 more this year for her care.\n       It's hard to call that an unaffordable increase.\n       If it were just these two egregious examples, someone might \n     suggest I'm picking on the Koch brothers. Now, I do not \n     always agree with the fact checkers, who are sometimes wrong. \n     But it is striking that PolitiFact reviewed 11 ads placed by \n     the brothers' organization, and not a single one was rated \n     ``true'' or even ``mostly true.'' Nine were rated ``false'' \n     or worse.\n       So, I return to my original question. Whatever their \n     constitutional rights, are the Koch brothers right to degrade \n     the Democratic process with lies? Are they right to use \n     tactics that are, by legal definitions, deceptive and \n     dishonest? Are voters choosing a candidate due any less \n     respect and honesty than consumers buying carpet?\n       We in the consulting profession--\n\n  This column is written by a nationally known pollster by the name of \nMark Mellman--\n\n       We in the consulting profession need to ask ourselves hard \n     questions about where the line is that we won't cross. When \n     does the pursuit of victory at any cost exact too high a \n     price? When does dishonesty distort democracy?\n       Politicians, political parties or media that fail to \n     condemn these tactics, as well as broadcasters that air these \n     ads, and the consultants who make them, are all complicit in \n     the Kochs' immorality.\n\n  Mr. President, this is the truth. This is the truth. What is going on \nwith these two brothers who made billions of dollars last year and \nattempted to buy our democracy is dishonest, deceptive, false, and \nunfair. Just because you have huge amounts of money, you should not be \nable to run these false, misleading ads by the hundreds of millions of \ndollars.\n  They hide behind all kinds of entities. It is not just their front \norganization, Americans For Prosperity. They give money to all kinds of \norganizations--lots of money. When you make billions of dollars a year, \nyou can be, I guess, as immoral and dishonest as your money will allow. \nIt is too bad they are trying to buy America, and it is time the \nAmerican people spoke out against this terrible dishonesty and about \nthese two brothers who are about as un-American as anyone I can \nimagine.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, does the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. REID. I sure do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise briefly this afternoon to join my \ncolleagues in expressing deep disappointment with yet another decision \nby the Obama administration to undermine the health care options of \nmillions of Americans.\n  As we all know, the President promised, ``If you like your health \ncare plan, you can keep it.'' But his law's drastic cuts to Medicare \nand Medicare Advantage are creating an impossible environment for \nAmericans to keep their insurance plans or to keep their doctors. Even \nmore troubling is that funds raided from Medicare will be spent on the \nPresident's flawed health care law.\n  In particular, Medicare Advantage serves more than 15 million \nAmerican senior citizens, including some 56,000 Mississippians. It is a \nprogram that incentivizes market-based competition and patient choice. \nThese are two elements that have made it both popular and successful. \nNearly one-third of all Medicare patients voluntarily enroll in this \ntype of health care plan, and 95 percent of Medicare Advantage members \nrate their quality of care as ``very high.''\n  Independent reports show that seniors will see their plans canceled. \nThey will see higher premiums and fewer choices because of these severe \ncuts to Medicare and Medicare Advantage. I have heard from health care \nprofessionals in Mississippi who are concerned about the law's negative \nimpact on patient care.\n  I came to the floor earlier this week to speak about the profound \nhuman\n\n[[Page S1161]]\n\ncost of the President's health care law. It is past time for the \nPresident and his allies in Congress to recognize the devastating \nconsequences of ObamaCare. Delaying and changing the law, which the \nadministration has done some two dozen times--with questionable legal \nauthority, I might add--will not fix the damage. This is a law that \njust doesn't work.\n  The solution is to repeal and replace ObamaCare with market-driven \nreforms that empower Americans to decide which health care options are \nbest for them. We can do better than this law, and we owe it to the \nAmerican people to do so.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I come to the floor again to talk about--\nit is my understanding we are not going to be allowed to offer any \namendments again on a significant bill that spends billions, tens of \nbillions of dollars--to talk about a couple of amendments I have.\n  My staff recently talked with some veterans from Oklahoma, and I want \nto give you an anecdote that just happened. This is about VA care. This \nis a lady, a 100-percent disabled veteran, who has had knee \nreplacements at a VA hospital. She did not have one knee replacement, \nshe had two knee replacements. And then she had two knee replacements \non the other knee.\n  If you look at the statistics of a knee replacement having to be \nreplaced, it is a very rare occurrence. But the fact that you would \nhave two knee replacements, and both of them would have to be replaced \nis unheard of.\n  The story does not end there. The story ends with the fact that \nduring her second knee replacement, they broke her femur. So they had \nto put a rod into her femur. When they put the implant in, she ended up \nwith one leg an inch longer than the other leg.\n  The fact is that this all occurred at a VA hospital. And it is \nunheard of that somebody who has a knee replacement on one side would \nhave to have another one done because of complications, and then have \nthe other knee done, and have to have that knee redone because of a \ncomplication. But then on top of it, as to the skill of the surgeon in \nterms of doing a second replacement and having a rod, and then putting \nthe wrong rod in, it creates a leg length discrepancy that can only be \ncorrected now by her spending a significant amount of money on an \northotic shoe on the shorter leg which, if you know anything about \nmedicine, changes the alignment of the spine, which causes tremendous \narthritis in the spine of that patient.\n  So here is a patient that if you look across the world in the private \nsector 99.9 percent of the time would not have had to have either of \nthem replaced, would not have had to have a rod put in her femur, and \nwould not have a leg-length discrepancy.\n  I agree that is an anecdote. But those are the kinds of things that \nwe are not holding the VA to account for.\n  One of the amendments I was going to offer to this bill was a very \nstraightforward amendment requiring every 6 months that the VA publish, \nin both their hospitals--outpatient--and nursing homes the quality of \ntheir care, the mortality rates, the complication rates, the infection \nrates, the wait times in their emergency rooms, the wait times for a \nscreening examination, the wait times for an endoscopy, the \ncomplications associated with those, so veterans could actually see and \ncompare it to the private sector--every other hospital knows all this \nstuff and publishes it--so they can see and compare the quality of \ncare. Because we have an honor-bound commitment to offer care to those \nwho have offered to sacrifice their life and their future for our \nfreedom.\n  But we are not going to be able to offer the first step in terms of \naccountability to the VA health system because we get to offer no \namendments.\n  What if you knew--and this does not apply and I do not mean to \ndenigrate the whole VA system because there are some great VA \nhospitals, but in your area, where you have to go, if you knew the \nquality was 20 or 25 percent less than what you could get in your own \nhometown, would you still go to a VA hospital? Should veterans not know \nwhether they are getting a standard of care that equates to what they \ncould get in the private sector? They are not going to know because \nthat is nowhere in terms of the accountability of the VA system I \ntalked about yesterday.\n  One of the other amendments I was going to offer would be to strike \nsection 301. The chairman of the committee yesterday referenced section \n302. He was actually talking about section 308 of his bill, not section \n302 of his bill. But when you expand VA health care to Priority Group \n8--these are people who do not meet the income, have no service-\nconnected disability, and have no limited resources--to put them into \nthe VA health care system, when we are not adequately treating the \nveterans who are eligible for service today in the VA health care \nsystem, what you are really doing is taking away our commitment to care \nfor those to whom we have already promised care. So it is somewhat \ncynical that we would expand from 6 million to a potential of 22 \nmillion people in a system that is behind the curve already.\n  The other thing that is important for that is the care for these \nveterans with nonservice-connected disabilities was excluded from the \nVA's priority group so the VA could focus--focus--its limited resources \non our veterans with service-connected disabilities. In other words, \nthey have a health complication because they served our country.\n  As former Secretary Anthony Principi said: Remember, when everyone is \na priority, no one is. That is exactly what this bill will do. It will \ntake the priority away from our veterans with service-connected \ndisabilities to where they will fall further through the cracks.\n  The other thing in this section is--the only thing worse than them \nbeing in the Affordable Care Act, which is what this is really \nspecifically designed to do, is to take them out of the exchanges and \nput them into the VA. So what we are saying under this bill is, if you \nare a high-income, nondisabled veteran, and the only health care \ncoverage you have available to you is an ObamaCare exchange, then you \nnow qualify for VA services.\n  What is that about? What that is about is moving to a single-payer, \ngovernment-run, totally government-run health care system. And this is \nabout moving 16 million veterans--or the potential of up to 16 million \nveterans--to that position. So the only thing worse than being covered \nby the VA, where veterans are waiting for weeks to see a doctor and \nliterally dying because of medical deficiencies, is being in an \nAffordable Care Act exchange.\n  This amendment would strike the expansion from the legislation, which \nwould ensure that the VA remains focused on the service-connected \ndisabled and increasing the quality of care for more than 6 million \nveterans currently in the VA system.\n  I want to talk a minute about why we did that. We created the VA \nhealth care system for those who have a complication of their service--\na complication of their service.\n  Do we have a commitment, one, to ensure that those who have a \ncomplication from their service get the care we have promised them?\n  I believe we do. Section 301 would markedly minimize that commitment \nto those who have a complication from their service. So how is it that \nwe have come about, that we have this great big VA bill on the floor, \nwithout any oversight, aggressive oversight, on holding the VA \naccountable to do what it is supposed to be doing now--with a 59-\npercent increase in budget since October 1 of 2009, and expand it and \nblow it to an area where we are going to offer these same services, \nwhere we are not meeting quality outcomes, we are not meeting \ntimeliness outcomes, we are not meeting care outcomes, and we are going \nto put that on the VA system?\n  I would say the better way to honor our veterans who have a \ncomplication associated with their service is to hold the VA \naccountable through transparency of their quality.\n  Here is the other thing that has not been studied, and we do not know \nthe answer to this. I certainly do not know\n\n[[Page S1162]]\n\nit. I cannot find it anywhere. It is this. What does it cost to do an \n``X'' procedure in a VA hospital, totally absorbed, versus doing it in \na nonVA hospital? Let's assume quality is the same. Would the American \ntaxpayer be better off if, in fact, we delivered that service at a cost \nthat is much less?\n  But nobody has asked for those numbers. The VA cannot give those \nnumbers. The VA does not know those numbers. So we are driving blind. \nWe do not know what it costs to do a total knee in a VA hospital. We do \nknow what it costs in Oklahoma City from every hospital. As a matter of \nfact, there is a wonderful hospital in Oklahoma City that advertises \nevery price, all their complications, everything else out there. They \nhave people from all across the country coming because they are so much \ncheaper and so much better than what people in the private market can \nget done where they live.\n  Let's see how VA cost and quality and outcomes compare to that. If \nyou really want to drive quality for our veterans, we have to have \naccountability in terms of how we spend money, accountability in terms \nof the outcomes, accountability in terms of the quality, and \naccountability in terms of the service.\n  The other amendment that I have would allow service-connected \nveterans who are driving hundreds of miles--in my State--to get care \nwith a pilot program which would allow them to go anywhere they wanted, \nto their home town, to the next town over if it is bigger and has \nhigher quality, rather than drive 200 miles to get their care at a VA \nhospital. We would cover it under Medicare rates, since we do not know \nthe cost ramifications of what we do at VA clinics and VA hospitals, in \nterms of the total absorbed cost, but we do know what the price would \nbe if we had Medicare paying. My learned opinion is that, No. 1, \nveterans would have access to care closer to home, probably improved \nquality, and most probably a decreased cost for the Federal Government, \ni.e., the American taxpayers in terms of meeting this honor-bound \ncommitment to our veterans.\n  If, in fact, you served this country, and one of the benefits of \nserving this country--and you have a service-connected disability \nassociated with that--is a promise of quality health care, why do we \nsay you can only get it in a VA clinic or a VA hospital? If you served \nour country, why can't you get it wherever you want? I mean, you served \nour country to preserve our freedom of choice, our freedom to do and \nselect what is best for us and our interests. Why can't a veteran have \nthat privilege that he or she fought for and put their rear ends on the \nline for? Why do we not avail them of the freedom that they sacrificed \nfor?\n  Nobody will answer that question. Nobody will come down and answer \nthat question. Those are knowable answers. They are moral questions. If \nyou sacrifice, should you not have the benefits of the freedom for \nwhich you sacrificed?\n  The other problem with this bill is it has a false pay-for, money \nthat we might have spent on a war in Afghanistan. Because we are not \ngoing to spend it, we are going to spend it here and call that a pay-\nfor. That is not a pay-for. It does not pass muster. It does not pass \nthe budget point of order on it. Everybody knows that.\n  So what we ought to be doing, instead of having this bill on the \nfloor, we ought to have a bill on the floor that holds the VA \naccountable, that creates transparency in the VA so that everybody in \nthe country, including the veterans can see outcomes, quality, and \ncost. Finally, we ought to give the veterans the freedom that they \nfought for; that if they are deserving of this benefit, they ought to \nbe able to get the benefit anywhere they choose, because they are the \nones who preserved the rights and the abilities and the capabilities \nfor us to experience the freedoms to make choices for ourselves.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I come to the floor as the ranking member of \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee as we consider S. 1982, the Sanders \nbill. I have been down to the floor several times, and I will not take \nup a lot of the Senate's valuable time right now. But I do want to \ncover some things that have transpired since the last time I was on the \nfloor today, when I read from an editorial that was written by \nConcerned Veterans of America. The group was challenged by some of my \ncolleagues here as to whether it was a front group, whether this was a \npolitical front group.\n  Let me assure my colleagues, it represents real veterans. But in an \neffort to try to debunk the belief that this is just about one \npolitical group, I want to read some from another editorial written by \nStewart Hickey of AMVETS. Now, nobody can question whether AMVETS is a \nlegitimate veterans service organization. They have been around for a \nwhile. I will be selective in my reading:\n\n       While we agree the bill addresses many critical issues and \n     recommends important solutions for our veterans, we do not \n     support this bill for several reasons. First, it would be \n     morally irresponsible and fiscally unsound, given the \n     historically volatile situation in Afghanistan, to hang the \n     funding for such robust legislation on any potential ``peace \n     dividend.'' Throwing more money--upwards of $30 billion, and \n     taken from war funds no less--at a failing department will \n     only make matters worse.\n       This kitchen sink-like bill also endeavors to be all things \n     to all veterans, and is very enticing to all of us ``Veterans \n     Service Organizations'' as the panacea for all of our \n     legislative agendas. The problem is, in its current \n     configuration, it has little to no chance of passage, it's \n     just too ``pie in the sky'' and lacks the power base to hold \n     VA accountable for providing excellent care and services to \n     veterans currently accessing the system.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       We all want what is best for the veterans community, and \n     many of the provisions in S. 1982 are positive. However, \n     ``bigger'' does not mean ``better.'' And the Sanders bill \n     further expands a VA system that is already overwhelmed and \n     cannot meet the current needs of veterans. Before \n     overcommitting the Department of Veterans Affairs and \n     subjecting our veterans to more broken promises, Congress \n     should rally on legislation that keeps the promises already \n     made.\n\n  Yet another veterans service organization says: Reform the Veterans \nAdministration.\n  Dr. Coburn from Oklahoma, the Senator from Oklahoma, was talking \nabout horror stories within the veteran's facilities. So I say to my \ncolleagues: You know, the mistake here is that we are not on the floor \ndebating the reform of the VA and then debating any expansion.\n  But the fact is that we look at editorial after editorial of people \nwho have some contact with the VA. They are saying: The last thing you \nshould do is expand service. The last thing you should do is use \ngimmicks to pay for it. The last thing you should do is saddle our kids \nwith not only the debt for it but the responsibility to uphold a \npromise that might be impossible.\n  Let me speak a little further on some of the things Dr. Coburn hit \non. This is about hospital delays, veterans dying at VA facilities. I \ncame down earlier--and I might add right now that this is the stack of \nthe Inspector General of the VA for 1 year, 1 year's worth of \ninvestigations on VA facilities where they made specific \nrecommendations of changes that had to be made.\n  This dealt with the death of veterans. It dealt with Legionnaire's \nDisease. It dealt with things as simple as more than one patient using \na disposable insulin pen--something meant for one patient that was used \nfor multiple patients, exposing them to potential illnesses.\n  If the question is, do we keep the promise of the quality of care to \nour veterans? And if that is not important enough, let me go to the \nveterans that are in the system trying for the first time to get a \ndisability rating because of a service-connected disability.\n  The number of claims pending in America right now is 673,000 \nveterans. These are individuals who have filed a claim with the \nVeterans' Administration, who are waiting in line for the determination \nto be made about what percentage of those claims they will approve. The \nnumber of claims that are considered backlogged right now is 389,000 \nveteran's claims.\n  Once a veteran receives a disability rating, if in fact they feel \nthat the VA has come to the wrong conclusion as to the percentage, they \nfile an appeal. The\n\n[[Page S1163]]\n\nnumber of appeals pending is 272,000 appeals. So one can conclude from \nthis that the number of claims pending is 673,000 plus 272,000. So \nthere are over 1 million veterans right now waiting for a determination \nby the VA specifically or by the Court of Appeals to sort out their \ndisability status.\n  The number of days to complete a claim is 265 days. Let me say that \nagain: 265 days to complete a claim. Right now, claims pending are \n673,000. The number of days for an appeal that is pending is 600 days--\n600. So let's just say of that 1 million claims that are either pending \nor that have been appealed, which is 1 million veterans, the number of \ndays to complete the claim on average took 265 days, and the number of \ndays for an appeal, on average, was over 600. We are now at 800 days. \nThat is almost 3 years.\n  I hope my colleagues are understanding what I am saying. We have a \nseverely dysfunctional Veterans' Administration today. We have a \npopulation of warriors who are coming out of the battlefield in \nAfghanistan. They are coming back from deployments. They leave the \nservice; they file for disability; they wait, they wait, they wait, \nthey wait. When they finally get their disability claim and they are \ngoing to the VA, now all of a sudden we are talking about dumping \nmillions of additional veterans into the line with them.\n  My good friend and chairman Senator Sanders said: We can handle this \nbecause we have 27 clinics, outpatient facilities in this bill that, \nunder a lease agreement, we are going to build out--27 facilities. They \nare for the veterans we have today. We don't have enough facilities to \nhandle the current population, and he said this could handle the \nmillions who are going to come in.\n  Let me remind my colleagues once again that currently we have $14 \nbillion worth of veterans construction underway. We appropriate about \n$1 billion a year. That is a 14-year backlog on the construction of \nthese facilities, and none of the 27 leases that are in this bill will \nbe ready in December 2014 when the enactment of this legislation takes \nplace.\n  There is one other area of massive expansion other than to veterans \nwith nonservice-connected disabilities, and that is to a program called \nour caregivers program. I am pretty passionate about this because I \nwrote the legislation. My good friend Senator Akaka, who is no longer \nhere, who was chairman of the Senate veterans' committee, became a \nchampion of it. Earlier, I read Senator Akaka's statements on the \nSenate floor the day it was passed. He stated as clearly as anybody \never has why we limited this to a demonstration project, why we rolled \nit out to a small group. Our intention was that when the VA was fixed, \nreformed, and was capable of implementing a plan that expanded the \ncaregiver program, we would do that but not a day sooner.\n  Now, all of a sudden, we are not just talking about extending the \ncaregiver program to every current-era veteran; Senator Sanders' bill \nextends it to every era. Veterans from every era who served who are \nstill alive would be eligible for caregivers.\n  On occasion, he has pointed to the wounded warrior program. I will \nread a letter the Wounded Warrior Project sent to the committee when \nthis legislation was being considered.\n  They said:\n\n       More than 2 years after initial implementation, VA still \n     has not answered--let alone remedied--the problems and \n     concerns that WWP and other advocates raised regarding the \n     Department's implementing regulations. For example, those \n     regulations leave ``appeals rights'' unaddressed (including \n     appeals from adverse determinations of law); set unduly \n     strict criteria for determining a need for caregiving for \n     veterans with severe behavioral health conditions; and invite \n     arbitrary, inconsistent decisionmaking. Simply extending the \n     scope of current law at this point to caregivers of other \n     veterans would inadvertently signal to VA acquiescence in its \n     flawed implementation of that law. We recommend that the \n     Committee insist on VA's resolving these long-outstanding \n     concerns as a pre-condition to extending the promise of this \n     law to caregivers of pre 9/11 veterans.\n\n  If there is one thing I have made perfectly clear yesterday and \ntoday, it is that there is nothing in this bill that reforms the VA. \nLook at any area of the legislation. There is no reform. Yet editorials \nfrom service organizations, letters from the Wounded Warrior Project--\nand they were, make no mistake, behind caregivers. Their letter to the \nchairman said: Don't do this until it is fixed.\n  Well, we are where we are. To suggest that all veterans, all veterans \norganizations, all organizations that deal with veterans are for this \nis just inconsistent with the paper trail that exists, letters and \neditorials.\n  There are two things that don't go away: one, the need to reform and, \ntwo, the promise we made to our country's warriors.\n  We have to ask ourselves: Are we better off fixing the VA before we \nenlarge the population or after we enlarge the population? I can answer \nthat. It is tough to do now, and it is not going to happen without \ncongressional leadership. But if we expand the population, dump it on a \nsystem that is physically not capable of handling it, administratively \nnot capable of handling it, what do we say to those veterans who need \nthe VA health care system and can't get in to see a primary care \ndoctor? What do we say to a person who needs mental health treatment \nbut can't see a psychiatrist, can't get in to be evaluated, and doesn't \nget the medication they need?\n  I plead with my colleagues, don't make this mistake. There is an \nalternative bill. It is taken from the Sanders bill. It is 80 percent, \nbut it doesn't have the massive expansion. It doesn't reform, but it \nreally moves forward on some important issues.\n  No matter what we do, at some point we are going to have to show the \nleadership how to reform the VA. Why? Because we are going to keep our \npromise to veterans. The promise to veterans was that we would provide \nthem a quality of care that was unprecedented.\n  I am not sure there is a Member of this body who believes we can dump \nthis population onto the Veterans' Administration and that we can look \nany veteran in the face and say: We kept our promise to you. Yes, you \nmay have access, but it may be months from now. You may have the \nability to go to the VA, but we don't have any room; there is no room \nin the inn.\n  These are all part of keeping your promises.\n  I will go back to what the AMVETS editorial said, and I will end with \nthat because I see my colleagues here.\n  Bigger is not necessarily better. When I gave these statistics on \nbacklogs of claims and appeals, these are veterans who aren't asking \nfor bigger, they are asking for better. They are asking us to sort out \nthis system and make it work in a way they deserve. All we will do is \nexacerbate the problem if, in fact, we pass S. 1982.\n  I urge my colleagues, support the alternative--if we are given the \nopportunity to offer one. If not, then don't do this to our country's \nveterans. Wait and let us reform the VA. That is our responsibility. \nThat is our promise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, are we in morning business? What is the \npending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator should be aware we are on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 1982.\n  Mr. WICKER. With the Senate's permission, I propose to speak, along \nwith Senator Manchin, as in morning business on another matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n\n\n                   Puerto Rico Status Resolution Act\n\n  Mr. WICKER. I rise today to speak about a recently introduced bill \nregarding the future of Puerto Rico's political status. Known as the \nPuerto Rico Status Resolution Act, this legislation would call for an \nup-or-down referendum on Puerto Rican statehood, excluding the option \nof Puerto Rico's current status of Commonwealth. The President and \nCongress would have to proceed with legislation if statehood receives a \nmajority of votes.\n  I support Puerto Rico's right of self-determination. This is an issue \nI have closely followed and been involved in for the better part of two \ndecades. Concern about the way we do statehood determination votes in \nPuerto Rico is an issue that has crossed party lines in the Congress.\n  I would say to my colleagues, Congress needs to make sure, at a \nminimum, that any process used to measure the intent of Puerto Rican \nvoters is\n\n[[Page S1164]]\n\nobjective; otherwise, the outcome will be neither fair nor a meaningful \ntest of public opinion. That is why it is so important not to exclude \nthe option of the current Commonwealth status.\n  The status resolution act does not rise to the threshold of fairness \nor a meaningful test of public opinion. There are two reasons:\n  First, legislation has already been enacted that calls for a \nplebiscite on Puerto Rico's political status. The 2014 omnibus already \nincludes funding for a plebiscite that would include all available \noptions for political status. Allowing Puerto Ricans the opportunity to \nchoose a status besides statehood is in keeping with a recommendation \nfrom the White House Task Force Report released in 2011.\n  Second, the referendum proposed by the status resolution act would \nhave the same shortcomings as the plebiscite held on November 6, 2012. \nThe results of that referendum were widely criticized, as well as the \ntortured ballot designed by the pro-statehood party. Of the 1.9 million \nPuerto Ricans who participated in the referendum, only 834,191--or \nabout 44 percent--favored statehood. Only 44 percent favored statehood. \nClose to half a million voters declined to respond to the second \nquestion on the ballot, evidencing their dissatisfaction with the \nchoices offered. We need to offer better choices. The percentage of \nstatehood supporters has not changed significantly over the past 20 \nyears and certainly does not serve as an impetus for Congress to \nentertain yet another admissions process now.\n  Elsewhere on the November 6 ballot that I referred to, public support \nwas clear for the pro-Commonwealth Popular Democratic Party and the \nelection of pro-Commonwealth and anti-statehood candidate Alejandro \nGarcia Padilla as Puerto Rico's new Governor. In fact, the \nCommonwealth's legislature, as a result of that election, is now \ncontrolled by the pro-Commonwealth party, as is the mayorship of San \nJuan, the capital of the Commonwealth.\n  Statehood advocates may attempt to manipulate ballots and election \nresults to support their preferred outcome, but they do so at the \nexpense of the democratic process and the right of every Puerto Rican \nto have a say in the island's political future.\n  The referendum process should be conducted in a fair and transparent \nmanner that reflects the true will of the people. In the past, I have \nintroduced legislation that would recognize Puerto Rico's right to \nconvene a constitutional convention--a process that could help build \nconsensus rather than advance the exclusive agenda of one political \nparty over the other.\n  For Commonwealth supporters, Puerto Rico's current status is \ninstrumental to preserving the island's rich heritage and maintaining \nthe authority needed to address specific needs. The status resolution \nact not only has the potential to trample on people's rights, but it \nalso distracts from the island's pressing economic and security \nconcerns.\n  In conclusion, Congress and the Obama administration should continue \nto strengthen the partnership between Puerto Rico and the United States \nin constructive ways instead of encouraging a shortsighted and flawed \nreferendum. Puerto Rico faces economic, energy, and public safety \nchallenges that have a direct impact on the quality of life of its \nresidents. Joint efforts to restore economic growth, modernize energy \nresources, and reinforce strategies for combating drug trafficking \ncould have a big impact. I am encouraged by proposed reforms, and I \nwish the best to Gov. Garcia Padilla in the early days of his term in \noffice.\n  I hope the Senate will not attempt to impose a solution from \nWashington, DC, on Puerto Rican voters--a solution that would be \ncontrary to the public opinion of inhabitants of the island.\n  I am glad my colleague from West Virginia, who serves on the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee which exercises jurisdiction over \nmatters relating to Puerto Rico, has joined me on the floor, and I \nwould now yield for him--Senator Manchin--to comment on a recent study \nby the GAO on Puerto Rico's economy and the potential effects of \nstatehood.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague Senator \nWicker for his longstanding concern about Puerto Rico's current status \nand how they can govern themselves and work independently. As you can \ntell, this is a bipartisan concern we have and we are working very \nclosely together.\n  As Senator Wicker mentioned, the Government Accountability Office is \ncurrently working on a report that examines Puerto Rico's economy and \nthe cost of admitting Puerto Rico as a State. I look forward to seeing \nthe results of that report. But in light of the fact we are still \nawaiting the GAO report, in addition to a number of other reasons, I \nshare Senator Wicker's concerns about the Puerto Rico Status Resolution \nAct.\n  On August 1 of last year, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nwhich has jurisdiction over Puerto Rican issues, held a hearing on the \npolitical status of Puerto Rico, where we had the opportunity to hear \nfrom Governor Padilla, Commissioner Pierluisi, and the President of the \nPuerto Rican Independence Party Ruben Berrios. I appreciated their \nwillingness to openly discuss the ongoing status debate in Puerto Rico \nand their work with the committee members on how to move forward.\n  Similar to Senator Wicker, I support Puerto Rico's right to self-\ndetermination. However, I have voiced my concerns that the 2012 \nplebiscite did not meet our democratic standards of fairness and \nexclusivity, and more than 470,000 Puerto Ricans who left the ballot's \nsecond question blank would seem to share my concerns as well. We need \na process with the support of all Puerto Ricans, regardless of their \nbeliefs and political status.\n  Supporters of statehood argue about the constitutionality of \ndifferent status options. Crafting a plebiscite, however, which \nexcludes all options except statehood, as the Puerto Rico status \nresolution does, is not the solution. It is not the solution.\n  The 2014 omnibus includes funding for a plebiscite that would be \nproctored by the Department of Justice which can authoritatively decide \non the constitutionality of all possible status options. Further, both \nthose who are pro-Commonwealth and those who are prostatehood have \nexpressed support for this process. This is not true of the 2012 \nplebiscite nor the Puerto Rico status resolution.\n  Political status is not the only issue facing Puerto Rico. The \nCommonwealth has faced more than half a decade of economic recession \nand high unemployment, as well as exceptionally high utility costs and \ncontinued obstacles to economic development.\n  As a former Governor I have great respect for Governor Padilla and \nthe challenges he is up against, which are not unlike many of our own \nStates in our country. In meeting with Governor Padilla, I have had the \nopportunity to hear directly about the enormous economic difficulties \nhe has tackled in his short time as Governor.\n  In my understanding the 2014 budget--his 2014 budget for Puerto \nRico--would significantly reduce the Commonwealth's projected deficit. \nGeneral fund expenses were down by nearly $200 million during the \nsecond half of last year and expected revenue is up. The Governor has \nmade these efforts with the goal of having a balanced budget by 2015, \nsomething we could all work toward and a goal I applaud. I understand \nand have seen that progress is being made.\n  The Senate should do everything we can to encourage economic \ndevelopment across our country, including in the Commonwealth of Puerto \nRico. We need to work as partners in confronting its high energy costs, \ndouble-digit unemployment, and continuing recession. As we support \nself-determination, we should ensure our focus on political status does \nnot prevent us from addressing the immediate economic needs of the \nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n  I thank my colleague for the time to join him in speaking on this \nimportant issue and I look forward to his support of a fair and open \nprocess and to working with him on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, if I might, let me congratulate my \ncolleague from West Virginia on his remarks and in closing make three \nobservations.\n\n[[Page S1165]]\n\n  Despite the economic hardships of the region, the economy of Puerto \nRico is the strongest of any of the Caribbean islands, and this has \noccurred under Commonwealth status--the special relationship that \nPuerto Ricans have with the United States as U.S. citizens but with \ntheir separate identity on the island.\n  Secondly, I would point out that some of the most vocal pro-\nCommonwealth voices in this Congress are Puerto Rican Americans who \nhappened to have been elected to the Congress from the States, and they \nspeak also and have spoken also with authority in favor of the \nCommonwealth concept but also in favor of a fair and accurate election.\n  Finally, I wish to just drive home a point Senator Manchin and I have \nmade. On election day in 2012, 1.9 million Puerto Ricans showed up to \nvote in that election. The pro-Commonwealth candidate for Governor was \nelected, the pro-Commonwealth candidate for mayor of San Juan was \nelected, and a majority of the legislature of the island that day \nturned out to be pro-Commonwealth.\n  As flawed as the plebiscite was, the fact remains, of the 1.9 million \nAmerican citizens in Puerto Rico who voted--who showed up to vote--only \n44 percent of them cast a ballot in favor of statehood. That is a \nfigure that cannot be controverted: 1.9 million people showed up to \nvote--American citizens in Puerto Rico--and only 44 percent of them \nchecked the box for statehood.\n  So as we go forward and as we implement the provisions of the omnibus \nact, let us make sure that whatever we do we have the facts, as Senator \nManchin has pointed out, and also we have a process to accurately \nreflect the will of the Puerto Rican people.\n  I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I have talked to a number of my \nRepublican colleagues, some of whom have expressed support for many of \nthe provisions in this comprehensive veterans bill. Many of my \nRepublican colleagues say they would like to support the bill, but they \nhave concerns about how it is paid for and the issue of deficit--\nincreasing the deficit. So let me say a word about this.\n  Unlike many expenditures, including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nthe truth is this bill will not add one penny to the deficit. Let me \nrepeat: This bill will not add one penny to the deficit. The \nCongressional Budget Office--the nonpartisan scorekeeper--has estimated \nthat mandatory spending in this legislation will total $2.88 billion \nover the next decade. All of this mandatory spending is completely \noffset not by the overseas contingency operations--or OCO--but through \nmore than $4.2 billion in actual savings from programs within the \njurisdiction of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. As a result, \nCBO has determined that overall mandatory spending--mandatory spending \nin this bill--will be reduced by more than $1.3 billion.\n  In addition to the mandatory spending, this bill authorizes $18.3 \nbillion in discretionary spending over the next 5 years to improve the \nlives of our Nation's veterans and their families.\n  As we know, there is no rule in the Senate that an authorization of \nfunding has to be offset. In essence, the discretionary spending \nprovisions in the legislation we are debating today are just \nrecommendations on how much additional funding we believe is needed for \nour Nation's veterans. It will be up to future legislation originating \nin the Appropriations Committee to approve or disapprove these \nrecommendations. In other words, the Veterans' Affairs Committee is an \nauthorizing committee; the final decisions in terms of expenditures are \nmade by the Appropriations Committee.\n  Many of my Republican colleagues have insisted even recommendations \nof new spending--spending which may never actually happen because it \nhas to go through the Appropriations Committee--be offset. I have done \nmy best to listen to their concerns and have come up with an offset \nwhich will not add to the deficit over the next decade.\n  Specifically, the discretionary spending authorized under this bill \nis paid for by using savings from winding down the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan--otherwise known as the OCO fund. CBO estimates spending \nfor overseas contingency operations will total $1.025 trillion over the \nnext decade, so a little more than $1 trillion. Spending as a result of \nthis legislation will be a tiny fraction of that amount--less than 2 \npercent.\n  OCO funds are designed, very broadly, to be used to fund war-related \nactivities. In my view, it is totally consistent with the goals of this \nfunding source to provide support for the men and women who have \ndefended us in those wars.\n  In recent years OCO funds have provided assistance to Syrian \nrefugees, and have helped the people of Haiti recover from a massive \nearthquake. Further, since 2005, the Defense Department has used OCO \nfunding for childcare centers, hospitals, schools, traumatic brain \ninjury research, and orthopedic equipment.\n  In 2010, $50 million in OCO funds was used for the Guam Improvement \nEnterprise Fund. Last year, OCO funds were allocated to the following \ncountries: Egypt, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Lebanon, Somalia, South \nSudan, Tajikistan, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Yemen. Last \nyear, OCO funds were used to combat trafficking in persons related to \nlabor migration in the Kyrgyz Republic, and to establish a Tunisian-\nAmerican Enterprise Fund.\n  In 2011, $89.36 million was used by the National Guard to support the \nsouthwest border of the United States.\n  This year, $218 million in OCO funding is being used for the TRICARE \nhealth care program.\n  These are some of the ways in the past OCO funding has been used. I \nam not here to argue about the wisdom of any of those expenditures. \nMany of them may well be valid. What I will say is the needs of our \nveterans are also valid. If we can spend OCO funds for the Guam \nImprovement Enterprise Fund, I think we can use OCO funds to protect \nthe interests of our veterans. Again, this expenditure is less than 2 \npercent of the savings from ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I have heard my friends on the other side of the aisle call this a \nbudget gimmick. I disagree. Republicans and Democrats in the House and \nSenate have voted several times to count war-related savings as a \nreduction in the deficit.\n  For example, virtually every Republican in the House of \nRepresentatives and Senate voted for the fiscal year 2012 budget \nresolution, introduced by Representative Paul Ryan, which counted $1 \ntrillion in deficit reduction from ``phasing down overseas contingency \noperations''--not what I am saying, but what the Heritage Foundation \npoints out.\n  If the savings from winding down wars can be counted as deficit \nreduction, clearly we owe it to our Nation's veterans to use a very \nsmall percentage of this fund to make their lives a little bit better \nat home.\n  To me, placing modest caps on OCO--overseas contingency operations--\nfunding to pay for the most comprehensive veterans legislation in a \ndecade is a no-brainer. This money was always intended to assure the \nwell-being and success of those brave men and women who have served our \ngreat country.\n  Finally, I think we should be very clear: The cost of war does not \nend once the last shots are fired and the last battles are fought. When \nmembers of the military lose arms, legs, eyesight, come back with PTSD \nor TBI from fighting in wars which Congress authorized, we have a moral \nobligation to make sure those veterans receive all of the benefits they \nhave earned and deserve. When American soldiers die in combat, we have \na moral obligation to make sure the spouses and children they leave \nbehind are taken care of as best as we possibly can.\n  This speaks to the funding of this legislation, and I hope we will \nhave strong support from all of our colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee for\n\n[[Page S1166]]\n\nhis remarks, and for the relentlessness, enthusiasm, and passion which \nhe has pursued putting together this extraordinarily strong bill for \nour veterans. I look forward to supporting it, and I commend him for \nhis excellent work.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here because every week the \nSenate is in session, now for 59 weeks, I give my climate speech, \nhoping some day sparks will hit tinder.\n  I could give a whole separate speech about the evil done by the \nSupreme Court Citizens United decision, and I could give a separate \nspeech about the gridlock which bedevils the Senate. But this week's \nclimate speech will touch all three--Citizens United, gridlock, and \nclimate change--to show how the three are connected.\n  We fail here in this Senate to address climate change because of the \npeculiar gridlock in Congress. And Congress is peculiarly gridlocked \nbecause of the evils of Citizens United. Our failure to address climate \nchange is a symptom of things gone wrong in our democracy.\n  I have spoken before on the Senate floor about the Supreme Court's \nCitizens United decision, one of the worst and most disgraceful \ndecisions ever made by the Supreme Court, destined to follow cases such \nas Lochner v. New York onto the ash heap of judicial infamy. But we are \nstuck with it now. Until the Supreme Court gets its bearings back, \ntheir Citizens United stands.\n  In a nutshell, the Citizens United decision says this: Corporations \nare people; money is speech; so there can be no limit to corporate \nmoney influencing American elections under constitutional principles of \nfreedom of speech.\n  If that doesn't seem right, it is because it is not. To unleash that \ncorporate power in our elections, the conservative Justices had to go \nthrough some pretty remarkable contortions: They had to reverse \nprevious decisions by the Court which said the opposite; they had to \nmake up facts which are demonstrably flat-out wrong; they had to create \na make-believe world of independence and transparency in election \nspending; and they had to maneuver their own judicial procedures to \nprevent a factual record which would belie those facts they were making \nup. It was a dirty business, with a lot of signs of intention, and it \nhas produced evil results.\n  Let's start with the contortions the conservative Justices had to go \nthrough to uncork all that corporate money. They had to first make the \nleap that corporations are people and money is speech to ensure \ncorporate money is protected by the First Amendment. They went a more \ncircuitous route, but that is where they ended up. And it is quite a \nleap when you think of how suspicious the Founding Fathers were of \ncorporations. There is no mention of corporations in the Constitution. \nSo much for these conservative Justices' fidelity to originalism--a \nconstitutional theory the conservatives put a lot of credence in when \nit suits them.\n  To treat corporations as people and money as speech, the conservative \nJustices also had to overrule previous Supreme Court decisions which \nhad said the exact opposite, which they did, upending a century of law. \nSo much for fidelity to precedent.\n  The conservative bloc then had to deal with the inconvenience that \nFirst Amendment doctrine actually allows the government to regulate \nelections, to protect against either political corruption or even the \nappearance of corruption.\n  So how do you take away the people's ability to restrain corporate \nmoney in elections when protecting against corruption is a legitimate \nreason for restraints on corporate money? What you do--and what they \ndid--is decide, by making a finding of fact, that corporations' money \nwould not corrupt elections or politics; indeed, that no amount of \ncorporate money could even appear to corrupt elections or politics. So \nmuch for fidelity to the judicial rule which appellate courts, State or \nFederal, are not supposed to engage in fact-finding.\n  This fact-finding about corruption by the conservative Justices \ncaused another little inconvenience: The assertion that corporate money \ncan't corrupt politics is laughably false. This meant the conservatives \ncouldn't allow a factual record in the case. A factual record, with \ntestimony and evidence about such a ludicrous proposition, would have \nblown it out of the water. So they let the little, narrow Citizens \nUnited case get all the way through the judicial process, including \nbriefing and argument before them, and then they went back and changed \nthe question into a big one.\n  This clever maneuver at the very end of the case guaranteed there \nwould be no factual record developed on the new and larger question. \nAnd that freed their hand.\n  I should emphasize that this was a third transgression. The first \ntransgression was for conservatives to ignore their own constitutional \ntheory of originalism in getting to the ``corporations are people and \nmoney is speech'' result. The second transgression was violating the \ntraditional rule that appellate courts were not supposed to engage in \nfactfinding at all, let alone ludicrous factfinding. The third \ntransgression was this maneuver with the question presented.\n  As a general rule, when cases come to a supreme court, State or \nFederal, the court defines the ``questions presented'' by the case. \nThis may not seem like a big deal, just something in the ordinary \ncourse, but it is actually an important limit on judicial power under \nour constitutional separation of powers. It is what prevents a supreme \ncourt from roving willy-nilly into any question it wants any time. \nCourts have to wait until a case comes that presents a particular \nquestion, and then they identify what the question is. So it was odd \nindeed when the Chief Justice went back, after the case was briefed and \nargued, and did his own new ``question presented.'' But it did the job.\n  Now the court--with no record saying otherwise--could pretend that \ncorporate money just plain can't corrupt American elections, can't do \nit, no way, no how--the conservative immaculate conception of corporate \nmoney.\n  Pretending that corporate money couldn't possibly corrupt or even \nappear to corrupt American elections allowed them to sweep away any \ninterest of the people in keeping corporate corruption out of our \npolitics and elections. People don't need to worry their little heads \nabout corruption, they said. Corporate money in elections is immaculate \nand can't corrupt.\n  Bingo. That got them where they wanted. We, the people, could no \nlonger limit corporate spending in our elections. As we have seen, the \nbig money began to flood in.\n  Citizens United actually gets worse in its plain errors about how \nindependent corporate money was going to be from candidates and how \ntransparent it was going to be whose money was truly behind all of \nthose negative ads. Independent? Transparent? Look at the last \nelections. How did that work out? Subsequent history shows the falsity \nof that nonsense.\n  Those contortionist justices completely ignored a big, important \nfact: what big money can do, big money can threaten to do or promise to \ndo, and there is going to be nothing independent or transparent about \nthose private threats and promises. The Citizens United decision opened \nthis avenue to corruption while pretending corruption was impossible.\n  So on to the next step: How do the evils of this Citizens United \ndecision lead to the evils of gridlock? Look around. Look at who is \nscared of whom and look at who is angry with whom around here.\n  Democrats and Republicans actually get along pretty well--at least \nDemocrats and most Republicans. We are policy adversaries on many \nsubjects, but Democrats and Republicans have been policy adversaries \nfor decades. Democrat versus Republican is old news. It doesn't explain \nthe new weirdness around here.\n  Look at what you see. The real fear and the real anger around here is \nbetween the mainstream Republicans and the tea party extremists. Look \naround. Ask around. Where do emotions run high? Where are the shouting \nmatches? Where are the insults hurled? Where are Senators heckled by \ntheir colleagues? The worst of it is not between Democrat and \nRepublican, it is between tea party and Republican.\n  Who is being told how they can and cannot vote and what they can and \ncannot say? Who is being bullied and punished when they don't follow \nthe party line--the tea party line? Not\n\n[[Page S1167]]\n\nDemocrats, Republicans. No one likes being bullied.\n  Is it the irrefutable logic of tea party argument that scares regular \nRepublicans? Is it the clear grasp by the tea party of modern economic, \ncultural, and scientific realities that scares regular Republicans? Is \nit the broad way the tea party represents our great and diverse \ndemocracy that scares regular Republicans? Is it the keen political \nacumen of the tea party, say, shutting down the U.S. Government and \ndarned near blowing the debt limit, that scares regular Republicans?\n  Those questions answer themselves, don't they? No. The thing that \nscares regular Republicans is the big money--the big corporate money, \nthe billionaire money--behind the tea party.\n  The Koch brothers, for instance, may be a living cartoon of avarice, \nout to pollute even more and make even more money, but when the Koch \nbrothers' big money comes in and bombs you in a small primary election, \nit is pretty scary. When the paid-for rightwing attack machine turns on \nyou in your Republican primary, that can be pretty scary.\n  So the gridlock comes when the Republican party will not work with \nDemocrats--not because we don't make sense and not because most \nRepublicans don't want to make sense but because they are scared of tea \nparty attacks funded by Citizens United money.\n  That brings us to climate change. As I have described in a recent \nspeech, tens--perhaps even hundreds--of millions of dark-money dollars \nare being spent. Is all that money being spent having any effect on \nRepublicans? Just look.\n  In this body we have Republican colleagues who have publicly \nacknowledged in the past carbon-driven climate change and have called \nfor legislative action. In this body we have a former Republican \nPresidential nominee who campaigned for President on addressing climate \nchange.\n  In this body we have Republicans who have spoken favorably about \ncharging a fee on carbon, including the Republican original cosponsor \nof a bipartisan carbon pollution fee bill. We have a Republican \ncolleague who cosponsored climate change legislation when he was in the \nHouse and another who voted for the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill \nwhen he was in the House.\n  In this body we have Senators who represent historic villages now \nwashing into the sea and needing relocation because of climate change \nand sea level rise, and Senators who represent great American coastal \ncities that are now overwashed by the sea at high tides because of \nclimate change.\n\n  We have Republican Senators whose home State forests--by the hundreds \nof square miles--are being killed by the marauding pine beetle, and \nRepublican Senators whose home States' glaciers are disappearing before \ntheir very eyes in their own lifetimes. We have Republican Senators \nwhose home States are having to raise offshore bridges and highways \nbefore the rising seas.\n  We have Republican voters who actually get that climate change is \nreal. It is the tea party that has the deniers. Sixty-one percent of \nnontea party Republicans say there is solid evidence the Earth is \nwarming, but only 25 percent of tea partiers agree--a 36-point swing \nbetween Republicans and tea partiers.\n  Republicans outside of Congress, immune from the effects of Citizens \nUnited, have actually supported a carbon pollution fee so long as it is \nrevenue neutral and doesn't add to big government. You could actually \nlower other taxes with it. But Republicans in Congress will now \nscarcely say a word about climate change--not since Citizens United; \nnot since that disgraceful decision uncorked all that big, dark money \nand allowed it to cast its shadow of intimidation over our democracy.\n  So that is how Citizens United connects to climate change.\n  While our American democracy suffers and stalls, the evidence of \nclimate change relentlessly mounts. The damage will be done in our \natmosphere and oceans. The damage has already started.\n  I have to warn my colleagues that the denier machinery--the beast I \ndescribed earlier this month--will ultimately be shown for the evil \napparatus of lies that it is. When that happens, there will be more \ndamage to go around. There will be damage to a party that allowed \nitself to be taken over and silenced by that corrupt apparatus, \nignoring the plain facts in front of their faces.\n  There will be damage to a supreme court that went through such \npeculiar contortions to let that dark money loose, ignoring plain facts \nin front of their faces. We Americans, who hold our lamp high to the \nrest of the world as a beacon of democracy, will have some explaining \nto do about how we--to the dismay of the rest of the world--let our \ngreat democracy be stifled by greedy polluters, ignoring the plain \nfacts the world faces.\n  The historian David McCullough spoke at the Library of Congress 2 \nweeks ago about John Adams and America's founding generation. He \nreminded us that when those men signed the Declaration of Independence, \nthey were signing their own death warrants. When they pledged their \nlives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to this cause, it was not \nmere words. David McCullough explained: ``It was a courageous time.'' \nAnd look at us, our great democracy mired in polluters, lies, and \nmoney.\n  But I still believe this can be a courageous time. As Americans have \nin the past, we can shed the shackles of corrupting influence and rise \nto our duty. It just takes courage to make this a courageous time.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iran\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to address the significant \nand persistent national security threat stemming from Iran's unchecked \nnuclear program. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment to S. \n1982 from the senior Senator from North Carolina which includes \nprovisions to strengthen our sanctions against Iran should they fail to \ncomply with their obligations under the joint plan of action.\n  Last November the Obama administration, without sufficient \nconsultation with Congress, committed to an interim nuclear agreement \nwith the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n  Under this agreement we are granting to Iran over $7 billion in \nsanctions relief in exchange for their commitments to decelerate their \nnuclear program--commitments which will be difficult, if not \nimpossible, to verify or enforce.\n  In effect, we are delivering billions of dollars in repatriated oil \nsales proceeds, additional foreign trade, and currency--all in exchange \nfor hollow promises of compliance with laws and U.N. Security Council \nresolutions they should already be following.\n  The stated U.S. policy, which American Presidents have repeated for \ndecades, is to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. However, \nthis agreement maintains Iran's nuclear weapons capability, and it \nallows Iran to continue to enrich uranium.\n  Moreover, Iran will not be required to destroy any centrifuges and \nwill be permitted to replace centrifuges that become inoperable. The \npact does little to reverse Iran's nuclear ambitions and sets a \nprecedent for further sanctions relief in exchange for cosmetic \nconcessions.\n  Rather than easing effective sanctions, we should be tightening \nexisting sanctions until a better long-term deal can be reached. The \nUnited States must take a strong stance to prevent a nuclear-armed \nIran. If they do not agree to roll back their nuclear program, then \nthey should face stronger sanctions.\n  That is why I strongly support provisions in the amendment from \nSenator Burr that would incorporate key provisions of the Nuclear \nWeapon Free Iran Act into the pending veterans legislation.\n  Mr. President, 58 of my Senate colleagues have already signed on to \nthis important freestanding legislation. They and I agree that the \nGovernment of Iran continues to expand its nuclear and missile programs \nin direct violation of multiple United Nations Security Council \nresolutions. Iran has a\n\n[[Page S1168]]\n\ndemonstrated record of defiance and will continue to work toward \nstockpiling weapons grade nuclear material, sponsoring terrorism, and \ndisregarding basic human rights.\n  Given these facts, it only makes sense that we take our own national \nsecurity and commitment to our allies' security seriously by passing \nexpanded sanction authorities, should Iran fail to uphold its end of \nthe interim agreement.\n  Equally important, this legislation would give Congress the \nopportunity to review and--if necessary--disapprove of any final \nagreement with Iran.\n  I am hopeful Iran will come to the table with real, verifiable \nconcessions in a final agreement on their nuclear program. However, \nhope is a poor national security strategy.\n  The Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act would set the proper framework for \nensuring Iran dismantles its illicit nuclear infrastructure, complies \nwith all Security Council resolutions, cooperates with the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, respects human rights, and ceases \nto promote global terrorism.\n  Furthermore, the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act implements President \nObama's own policy. In his recent State of the Union Address, he stated \nthat he will ``be the first to call for more sanctions'' should Iran \nfail to uphold the interim agreement.\n  By passing this legislation, we are ensuring that the United States \nhas the ability to further penalize Iran for its continued \nnoncompliance.\n  Nevertheless, President Obama has threatened to veto this \nlegislation, further indicating his willingness to blindly concede to \nIranian rhetoric.\n  Now is not the time for this Nation to exhibit weakness. Now is our \nchance to demonstrate to Iran and to the world that we are serious \nabout nuclear nonproliferation and compliance with international laws \nand obligations.\n  For these reasons, I strongly support the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran \nAct as presented in this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to act \nswiftly to pass this important measure.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an innovative \neducator from my home State of Kentucky--Mr. William King--who, earlier \nthis month, was awarded the prestigious Milken Education Award.\n  If you were to ask William King about his occupation, he may not \nrespond that he is a ``teacher'' or ``educator.'' Instead, he is more \ninclined to give himself the label of ``educational entrepreneur.'' \nThat's because in his 12 years in education, Mr. King has been \nrelentless in his search to find new and better ways to educate our \nNation's schoolchildren.\n  In his current capacity as freshman principal at Bowling Green High \nSchool--his alma mater--William is charged with shepherding his \nstudents through the all-important transition from middle to high \nschool. King has spearheaded initiatives such as TeachMeet Kentucky and \nTeachMeet Nashville--which are informal meetings where teachers gather \nto share ideas and best practices--and No Office Day, where school \nadministrators spend an entire day with students in the classroom. It \nis his Jump Start program, however, that has earned him one of, if not \nthe most, prestigious awards in education--the Milken Education Award.\n  William created Jump Start to help better prepare students to excel \nin their first year of high school. Now, I face a lot of challenges \nhere in the Senate, but few are more trying than those faced by a \nteenager who is about to enter high school. Mr. King not only \nrecognized just how daunting this transition can be for students, but \nhe also had the ability and the selfless inclination to do something \nabout it.\n  With his innovative program, King works with students and parents and \nalso coordinates between eighth- and ninth-grade teachers to ensure \nthat his kids are prepared for the academic challenges they are about \nto face.\n  The Milken Education Award is a prestigious one; it is not given out \njust for good intentions. Wining an ``Oscar of Teaching,'' as it's \nknown by teachers across the country, requires results--and William \nKing unquestionably delivers results. Since implementing Jump Start, \nninth-grade retentions have dropped by 68 percent. For this, he was \nrecognized with the Milken Education Award, as well as $25,000 to spend \nas he chooses, at a surprise assembly at Bowling Green High School.\n  Lowell Milken, chairman and co-founder of the Milken Family \nFoundation, once said, ``A sound education provides the opportunity to \nrealize one's potential.'' William King has shown that he is \nwholeheartedly dedicated to this proposition, and that he is deserving \nof praise from this body. I ask that my Senate colleges join me in \nrecognizing this exemplary Kentucky citizen.\n  The Park City Daily News recently published an article highlighting \nWilliam's work and his award. I ask unanimous consent that the full \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Park City Daily News, Feb. 12, 2014]\n\n                    Educator Receives $25,000 Award\n\n                            (By Chuck Mason)\n\n       A Bowling Green High School administrator who graduated as \n     a BGHS Purple in 1996 got the surprise of his life Wednesday \n     morning.\n       Freshman Principal William King received a Milken Educator \n     Award and $25,000 he can spend any way he wants. His Jump \n     Start program working with freshman has reduced by 68 percent \n     the number of BGHS freshmen who do not pass.\n       ``I had no clue,'' said King after the ceremony. ``I had a \n     list of all these names (of BGHS teachers) in my head (who \n     could be receiving the award). ``It could have been anyone on \n     our staff.''\n       King also has been instrumental in holding TeachMeet \n     seminars, which are informal meetings for teachers to share \n     best practices of how they use technology in their \n     classrooms, at Western Kentucky University, in Nashville and \n     other locations in the United States.\n       The Milken Educator Award, called the ``Oscars of \n     Teaching'' by Teacher Magazine, was presented as the cheers \n     of 1,200 students bounced off walls of the high school's \n     arena. Many of the students cheering King have been under his \n     leadership since they first entered the school halls four \n     years ago. King was told the assembly was to honor the \n     academic accomplishments of BGHS students, and it started \n     that way before Kentucky Education Commissioner Terry \n     Holliday took the microphone to make remarks and then \n     introduced Jane Foley, senior vice president of the Milken \n     Family Foundation. Foley made the surprise announcement that \n     King is Kentucky's 2014 Milken Educator Award winner, after \n     telling the students first how much the award was worth and \n     that one educator in the arena was to receive it.\n       ``We welcome you to our family of excellence,'' said Foley, \n     who received her own Milken Educator Award in 1994.\n       Three south-central Kentucky educators previously received \n     a Milken Educator Award, which was created in 1987.\n       King was surprised during the morning assembly. Principal \n     Gary Fields said it was a challenge to keep the announcement \n     secret from King. The winner said he wasn't even sure he was \n     supposed to be in the arena that morning for the academic \n     assembly. Fields read a lengthy list of BGHS students who \n     excelled in academics, at one point, turning to Holliday and \n     remarking, ``commissioner, I'm only halfway through the \n     list.''\n       King, who monitors teacher and student success, founded the \n     Jump Start program, in which teachers and parents ensure \n     incoming freshmen are ready for high school. King spent a \n     dozen years as an educator, including as an instructional \n     assistant, social studies teacher, curriculum coordinator, \n     literacy coach and freshman principal. He's a 1996 BGHS \n     graduate and an Eagle Scout.\n       King ``always comes into our social studies class and talks \n     with us,'' said Savannah Hanson, a junior at BGHS. She said \n     the Milken Family Foundation made a good choice in honoring \n     King.\n       Since 1987, the foundation has awarded more than $64 \n     million to nearly 2,600 kindergarten through 12th-grade \n     educators across the United States in awards. Total funding \n     for the program, which includes resources for the winning \n     educators, is more than $136 million. Fifty-two Kentucky \n     teachers have received the award since 1993.\n       ``A sound education provides the opportunities to realize \n     one's potential, which is why the future belongs to the \n     educated,'' Lowell Milken, chairman and co-founder, said in \n     grant program information. ``Effective education equips each \n     new generation with the knowledge and skills to make sound \n     and independent judgments, as well as proceed to the next \n     stage in learning and in life.''\n       The Milken awards were conceived to attract, retain and \n     motivate talented people in the teaching profession.\n\n[[Page S1170]]\n\n       Foley said the Milken Educator Award is not one that \n     teachers or administrators can apply for. ``We don't accept \n     nominations. You don't find us, we find you,'' Foley said.\n       ``Not an accolade for lifetime achievement or the \n     proverbial gold watch at the exit door, the Milken Educator \n     Awards targets early- to mid-career education professionals \n     for their already impressive achievements and, more \n     significantly, for the promise of what they will accomplish \n     in the future,'' the website noted.\n       Accompanying Holliday and Foley was Madeline Abramson, wife \n     of Kentucky Lt. Governor Jerry Abramson.\n       After the award was announced, the students did a rousing \n     chant with a Bowling Green Purples theme, clapping their \n     hands in staccato fashion, then stamping their feet.\n       ``There's no way I can top that,'' said Holliday, taking \n     the microphone once again. Looking at King, the commissioner \n     added, ``What an honor for Bowling Green High School and \n     Kentucky.''\n       Milken award winners have exceptional educational talent as \n     evidenced by effective instructional practices and student-\n     learning results in the classroom and school; have exemplary \n     educational accomplishments beyond the classroom that provide \n     models of excellence for the profession; are individuals \n     whose contributions to education are largely unheralded yet \n     worthy of the spotlight; are early- to mid-career educators \n     who offer strong long-range potential for professional and \n     policy leadership; and have an engaging and inspiring \n     presence that motivates and impacts students, colleagues and \n     the community, the website noted.\n       The last south-central Kentucky educator to receive a \n     Milken Educator Award was Karen Branham in 2001. At the time, \n     Branham was a teacher at Glasgow High School. She is now \n     assistant superintendent for student learning for the \n     Elizabethtown Independent School District.\n       The MFF is headquartered in Santa Monica, Calif.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/26/senate-section/article/S1170-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mr. NELSON.

Mr. President, I wish to pay special tribute to \nKathleen B. Rice, a key member of my staff on the Select Committee on \nIntelligence. Kathleen will leave us shortly to join Boveri Murphy \nRice, LLP, a boutique trial and litigation firm in South Bend, IN, \nwhich represents clients nationwide, ranging from Fortune 500 companies \nto smaller businesses and individuals. Kathleen has had a distinguished \ncareer in her 19.5 years of service to the Senate, Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, Department of Justice, and the U.S. District Court for \nthe Southern District of Florida. I am honored to have the opportunity \nto publicly thank her and note my appreciation for her outstanding \nservice to the Select Committee on Intelligence during the past 7.5 \nyears.\n  Since becoming the vice chairman of the committee in 2011, I have \nroutinely relied upon her impressive legal acumen and excellent advice \non matters large and small. Kathleen is well known on the Hill and by \nthe private sector as one of the leading congressional staff experts on \ncybersecurity legislative issues. During the 111th Congress, she \ndistinguished herself as an authority in the field with her work on S. \n3538, the National Cyber Infrastructure Protection bill, on behalf of \nSenators Kit Bond and Orrin Hatch. Based upon that experience, I \nselected Kathleen to serve as the lead counsel for all of my \ncybersecurity legislative efforts. Since then, she has worked \ntirelessly to develop and negotiate legislative proposals consistent \nwith my strong desire to get an effective cybersecurity information \nsharing bill enacted into law. During the last Congress, Kathleen was a \ncrucial participant in the negotiations that led the ranking members of \neight Senate committees to co-sponsor S. 2151 and S. 3342, the \nStrengthening and Enhancing Cybersecurity by Using Research, Education, \nInformation, and Technology Act of 2012, more commonly known as \n``SECURE IT.'' During this Congress, Senator Feinstein and I have been \nworking very hard to develop a bipartisan cybersecurity information \nsharing bill that we believe will be well-received by the private \nsector and our colleagues in the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives. We are finally quite close to being able to mark up \nour cybersecurity information sharing bill and Kathleen played an \nintegral role every step of the way.\n  Kathleen is a recognized legislative wizard. When negotiations have \nstalled, it is usually Kathleen who comes up with the textual solution \nthat provides the basis for a practical and effective bipartisan \ncompromise--a valuable skill that unfortunately has been in short \nsupply on the Hill in recent memory. In addition to cyber, she has been \na key staff contributor to the process of passing and enacting the \ncommittee's annual intelligence authorization bills. Her expertise on \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) was invaluable during \nthe negotiation and enactment of the Protect America Act of 2007, the \nFISA Amendments Act of 2008, Public Laws 111-141 and 112-14, extension \nof certain expiring FISA sunsets, and the FISA Amendments Act \nReauthorization Act of 2012. She routinely monitors the legislative \ncalendar to ensure that pending legislation does not negatively impact \nintelligence community activities and operations. She also works \nclosely with the Members and staff of other committees on all issues \nrelated to national security.\n  Kathleen's mastery of criminal and national security law, coupled \nwith her inexhaustible work ethic and sound judgment, have made her an \nindispensable member of the committee staff and an invaluable resource \nto other congressional committees. Her quick wit and good humor make \nher a pleasure to work with--less so, if you unwisely choose to work \nagainst the interests of her ``client''. Kathleen is a team player who \nmakes everyone around her perform better. She has been an astute mentor \nand guide to the senior staff responsible for assisting the vice \nchairman and members of the committee with formulating and implementing \nthe committee's legislative and oversight priorities. She also has done \na terrific job interfacing and collaborating with my personal staff to \nensure that my office is accurately transmitting my views on current \nnational security issues and events.\n  My colleagues and I trust Kathleen's judgment implicitly. Her example \nof dedicated public service and exceptional day-to-day performance on \nthe job has earned our respect and admiration, and it inspired a \ngeneration of staff who had the privilege to work alongside her. There \nis no doubt that Kathleen has a bright future in the private sector; \nhowever, should the right opportunity present itself, I would strongly \nencourage my Senate colleagues to entice her back into public service. \nWe will miss Kathleen dearly, but her legacy will remain a part of the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/26/senate-section/article/S1170-3", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1170-S1171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO RICHARD S.

Rich has a total of 33 years of distinguished service to \nthe Senate and the U.S. Army. He will leave us shortly to join the \nWashington office of the Rand Corporation where he will serve as an \nassociate director for the Intelligence Policy Center within the \nNational Security Research Division. I am honored to have the \nopportunity to publicly thank Rich and note my appreciation for his \noutstanding service to the Select Committee on Intelligence during the \npast 5\\1/2\\ years.\n  Since becoming the vice chairman of the committee in 2011, I have \noften relied upon Rich's impressive analytical skills and teamwork on a \nwide range of intelligence issues. As the committee's director of \nanalysis, he has routinely mentored our senior staff members in the \nexecution of their substantive and regional portfolios. Rich is well \nknown on the Hill and throughout the intelligence community as a \nleading expert on issues related to Asia and the Middle East, with \nspecial emphasis on South and Southeast Asia. He has also\n\n[[Page S1171]]\n\ndone superlative oversight work on issues related to analytic quality, \nlinguists in the intelligence community, human intelligence, \ntechnology, education and training, and intelligence authorities and \nreform. He has conducted and participated in many committee studies \ninvolving analysis, analytic tradecraft, and analyst technologies.\n  Rich even has a ``superpower''--he reads faster than anyone I have \never met. I have been told by reliable sources that he can read at \nleast 1,600 words per minute. This sometimes worked to his personal \ndisadvantage, because he was frequently tasked with reading very large \nbills, some in excess of 1,000 pages, to assess whether any provisions \ncould negatively impact intelligence authorities and operations. Rich's \ninexhaustible work ethic and sound judgment have made him an \nindispensable member of the committee staff and an invaluable resource \nto other congressional committees. His quick wit and good humor make \nhim a pleasure to work with. He is the consummate team player who \nimproves the performance of everyone around him.\n  My colleagues and I trust Rich's judgment implicitly. His example of \ndedicated public service and exceptional day-to-day performance on the \njob has earned our respect, admiration, and it inspired a generation of \nstaff who had the privilege to work alongside him. There is no doubt \nthat Rich has a bright future at the Rand Corporation; however, should \nthe right opportunity present itself, I would hope that he will \nconsider another stint in public service. We will miss Rich deeply, but \nhis legacy will remain a part of the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/26/senate-section/article/S1171-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               REMEMBERING MAJOR GENERAL FLOYD L.

On January 29, 2014, \nNevada's humble servant was called home after 92 years of devoted \ncommunity advocacy.\n  Born December 21, 1921, Mr. Edsall answered a call for military \nservice at an early age through his involvement at UNR in their ROTC \nprogram. In 1944, he fought in World War II and was awarded the Silver \nStar and three Bronze Stars for his valiant bravery.\n  Upon his return from service with the Army's 63rd Infantry Division, \nMajor General Edsall taught at Elko and Sparks High Schools as well as \nhis alma mater UNR, where he coached football and track and field. \nThroughout his teaching and coaching career, he remained active in the \nNevada Guard.\n  Major General Edsall is recognized as the Nevada National Guard's \nfirst full-time adjunct general. From 1967 to 1979, he commanded the \nNevada Air and Army Guard all while maintaining a steadfast dedication \nto expanding the Guard's enlistments during the Vietnam war. His focus \nand recruitment abilities exhibited with the Guard were widely \nregarded, and Major General Edsall retained his role of leadership over \nthe span of three Nevada gubernatorial administrations.\n  Recognizing a lifetime of commitment to service, the Nevada Army \nGuard dedicated a 1,697-acre training facility in his honor in 1997, \nand on May 10 of the same year, the Maj. Gen. Floyd Edsall Training \nCenter opened to further the foundations of service his namesake bears.\n  Major General Edsall's passing is a great loss and his loyal \ncommitment to the Silver State will never be forgotten.

Mr. President, earlier this month, a Hartford \nicon, Walter ``Doc'' Hurley, passed away at the age of 91. For some, \nDoc was a teacher, for others a coach, and for many more he was a \ndedicated philanthropist and friend. No matter what role he played at \nany given time, Doc Hurley worked his entire life to positively impact \nthe Hartford community, and he will be sorely missed.\n  Doc led an eclectic and inspiring life. After attending Weaver High \nSchool in the North End of Hartford, he served in World War II as a \nmarine. Upon coming home from the war, he finished college, worked as a \nteacher in Virginia, and spent a brief stint as a professional football \nplayer in the All-American Football Conference before finally returning \nto Hartford in 1959.\n  It was when he became vice principal at Weaver High School in \nHartford that he began in earnest his lifelong goal of inspiring \nstudents to pursue a college degree. The most visible piece of Hurley's \nlasting legacy in the community is the Doc Hurley Scholarship \nFoundation and the renowned Doc Hurley Scholarship Basketball Classic. \nOver the years, Doc's foundation was responsible for awarding more than \n$570,000 in scholarships to 550 high school seniors. Many of these \nstudents who went on to successful careers owe their start to Doc \nHurley and his scholarship foundation. Doc was a once-in-a-generation \nmentor, coach, teacher, and positive inspiration for Hartford's youth.\n  Last October, I held an antiviolence basketball tournament for nearly \n1,000 kids with the University of Connecticut men's basketball team in \nthe field house that bears Doc Hurley's name at Weaver High School. I \nwas proud to have had the chance to work with him on that basketball \ntournament and, more importantly I will work to continue his legacy of \nencouraging Hartford's students to achieve their highest potential.\n  I join everyone in Hartford and around Connecticut in celebrating the \nlife of Walter ``Doc'' Hurley and mourning the loss of this great \nman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/26/senate-section/article/S1171-3", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1171-S1172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BROWN UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, this March, Providence, RI, \ncelebrates the 250th anniversary of the founding of Brown University, \nknown as one of the world's great universities.\n  In 1764, the American Colonies were on a headlong course toward \nRevolution. Many of those who would lead the charge to independence \nalso had a hand in establishing this great American college. Among the \nfounding Fellows and Trustees of what was then called the College in \nthe English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations were \nfuture signers of the Declaration of Independence, delegates to the \nContinental Congress and Congress of the Confederation, and members of \nthe prominent Brown family of Providence. One of them, John Brown, was \nlater in the 1772 attack on the royal customs vessel HMS Gaspee in \nNarragansett Bay, an act of violence against the crown that drew the \nfirst British blood in the conflict that led to the American \nRevolution, more than a year before the Boston Tea Party.\n  Since then, prominent Brunonians have included Secretaries of State \nJohn Hay and Charles Evans Hughes, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, \nand our own Governor Lincoln Chafee and Congressman David Cicilline, to \nname just a few. For two and a half centuries, bright and eager young \nAmericans have arrived in Providence's beautiful College Hill \nneighborhood, greeted by historic architecture and the famous Van \nWickle Gates. They brought their ambition and their talent and, \ninevitably, they left their mark and continue to leave their mark--on \nour State and our Nation.\n  Today, Brown University is a hub of research, innovation, and \nlearning, and an integral partner in our capital city's culture and \neconomy. As a magnet for talent and resources, Brown has helped fuel \nProvidence's Knowledge District, and the university itself is the \nfifth-largest private employer in Rhode Island. Brown's Alpert Medical \nSchool has helped bolster our State's leadership in the health care \nfield, with more than 1,700 physicians--43 percent of all physicians in \nthe State--affiliated with the school. And Brown's heralded BrainGate \nprogram famously helped Cathy Hutchinson use a robotic arm to pick up a \ncup of coffee and take a sip 15 years after a stroke left her paralyzed \nand unable to speak. These and countless other contributions continue \nto put Rhode Island on the forefront of the innovation economy, and I \nam grateful for Brown's role in driving our Ocean State forward.\n  Brown is a wonderful place. As I travel the country and encounter \nBrown\n\n[[Page S1172]]\n\ngraduates, and attend Brown functions and meet undergraduates, I have \nbeen struck at how much they love this college. For a great many of our \nbest and brightest high school seniors, Brown is their decided first \nchoice among all the great universities of the world.\n  In its original charter, it was said that Brown, ``to which the youth \nmay freely resort for education in the vernacular and learned \nlanguages, and in the liberal arts and sciences, would be for the \ngeneral advantage and honor of the government.'' Two hundred fifty \nyears later, it is clear that Brown has lived up to that expectation.\n  I am proud to congratulate the president of Brown University, \nChristina Hull Paxson, Brown's trustees and faculty, and its students \nand alumni on 250 remarkable years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/26/senate-section/article/S1172-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/26/senate-section/article/S1172-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/26/senate-section/article/S1172-3", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:09 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1123.

L. No. 110-\n     246 which originally was to expire in 2012, but was extended \n     by the 112th\n\n[[Page S1174]]\n\n     Congress in the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, Pub. L. \n     No. 112-240; and\n       Whereas, a new food, farm, and jobs bill is critical to \n     maintaining a strong agricultural economy and an abundant \n     food supply that benefits all Americans, including by \n     providing programs relating to farm commodity support, \n     horticulture, livestock, conservation, nutrition assistance, \n     trade, and international food aid, agricultural research, \n     farm credit, rural development, bioenergy, forestry, and \n     innovative strategies to revitalize this nation's rural \n     economy by creating jobs in small towns and rural \n     communities; and\n       Whereas, in Iowa, agricultural producers have faced a \n     multitude of disasters, including drought, flood, and \n     blizzard conditions which have been alleviated by disaster \n     assistance under farm bill programs; and\n       Whereas, during 2013, the United States Senate and House of \n     Representatives have been engaged in prolonged negotiations \n     to enact a new food, farm, and jobs bill that is now in \n     conference committee which is considering differences between \n     the Senate version, titled the Agriculture Reform, Food, and \n     Jobs Act of 2013 (S. 954), and the House version, titled the \n     Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management (FARRM) Act of \n     2013 (H.R. 2642); and\n       Whereas, without the passage of a new food, farm, and jobs \n     bill the United States will be subject to previously enacted \n     permanent law, including commodity price support statutes \n     effective in 1949; and\n       Whereas, the prolonged delay in passing a new food, farm, \n     and jobs bill has created uncertainty for agricultural \n     producers and will negatively impact the nation's overseas \n     trade; and\n       Whereas, without the immediate passage of a new food, farm, \n     and jobs bill consumers will increasingly suffer economic \n     consequences: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That with the \n     reconvening of the United States Congress after its holiday \n     recess, the United States House of Representatives and the \n     United States Senate should enact a new food, farm, and jobs \n     bill with all possible speed but no later than January 31, \n     2014; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States Senate and \n     the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the Honorable Debbie Stabenow, Chairwoman of \n     the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the \n     United States Senate, and the Honorable Frank Lucas, Chairman \n     of the Committee on Agriculture of the United States House of \n     Representatives; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution shall be \n     transmitted to each member of the Iowa congressional \n     delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the Honorable Tom Vilsack, Secretary of the \n     United States Department of Agriculture.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-197.

A bill to include New Zealand in the list of foreign states \nwhose nationals are eligible for admission into the United States as E-\n1 and E-2 nonimmigrants if United States nationals are treated \nsimilarly by the Government of New Zealand; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, today, I introduced bipartisan legislation \nthat would promote trade and investment in America from a critical \npartner of ours in the Asia-Pacific region, New Zealand. I want to \nthank Senators Lee, McCain, Rubio, Schumer and Murray for cosponsoring \nthis bill and for their support for this commonsense proposal.\n  The Encouraging Trade and Investment from New Zealand Act would \nextend eligibility for E-1 and E-2 visas to New Zealand citizens. E-1 \nvisas are available to certain foreign nationals coming to the United \nStates to engage in substantial trade, including trade in services or \ntechnology principally between the United States and their home \ncountry. E-2 visas are for certain foreign investors coming here to \ndevelop and direct the operations of an enterprise in which they \ninvested a substantial amount of capital.\n  These non-immigrant visas are distinct from EB-5 investor immigrant \nvisas, H1-B work visas and B-1 business visitor visas. Because of the \nunique structure of E-1 and E-2 visas, they are scrutinized closely by \nthe State Department so that they directly support economic activity \nand jobs in the United States.\n  Allowing New Zealanders to apply for these visas would directly \npromote job creation. In 2010, New Zealand-owned U.S. firms in the \nUnited States supported 10,900 American jobs. By the end of 2011, the \ntotal value of direct investment from New Zealand to the United States \nreached $6 billion. While these positive trends continue, the New \nZealand government and New Zealand businesses have indicated that the \nlack of E-1 and E-2 visas is a dominant factor impeding further \ninvestment in our country.\n  The Encouraging Trade and Investment from New Zealand Act would fix \nthat. Because of the changes in our treaty practices, the E-1 and E-2 \nvisas can only be extended to New Zealand through legislation. \nHistorically, we extended trade and investment visas to any country \npossessing a treaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation with the \nUnited States or through other agreements.\n  Today more than 50 countries have access to E-1, trade, visas, and \nmore than 80 countries have access to E-2, investors, visas. In recent \nyears, the U.S. government has generally stopped pursuing treaties of \nfriendship, commerce, and navigation.\n  Indeed, in 2012, Congress enacted legislation extending E-1 and E-2 \nvisas to Israel. It is now the right time to do the same for New \nZealand.\n  Attracting trade and investment capital from New Zealand would \nbolster the reach of the United States' economy in the fast growing \nAsia-Pacific region. President Obama has made engagement with the Asia-\nPacific region a top economic and security priority, the so called \n``pivot to Asia,'' and New Zealand is a valued strategic partner.\n  Extending trade and investment visas would bolster the bilateral \nrelationship, increase foreign investment, and strengthen America's \nties to the Asia-Pacific region. Every state will gain from greater \ntrade and investment from New Zealand. In 2012 over 350,000 foreign \ntraders and investors holding E-1 or E-2 visas came to our country and \nmanaged a business in all 50 states.\n  Substantial benefits will accrue to Hawaii--the United States' \ngateway to Asia and the Pacific. Hawaii has recently seen a substantial \nincrease in tourism from New Zealand, fostered by increased direct \nflights between New Zealand and Hawaii. In fact, Hawaiian Airlines is \nthe only U.S. airline offering direct service to New Zealand.\n  New Zealand recently announced that it would be opening a consulate \nin Honolulu, Hawaii. This consulate will help further bilateral ties \nand benefit from its proximity to the heart Hawaii's financial district \nand headquarters of U.S. Pacific Command.\n  U.S. citizens are already eligible for a similar visa in New Zealand. \nI encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \ninitiative to allow them to do the same here to create jobs in our \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/26/senate-section/article/S1176-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1176-S1177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 362--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF ``CAREER AND \n                      TECHNICAL EDUCATION MONTH''\n\n  Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mr. Portman, and Ms. Baldwin) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 362\n\n       Whereas a competitive global economy requires workers to be \n     trained in skilled professions;\n       Whereas in a National Association of Manufacturers report, \n     80 percent of respondents indicate a moderate to severe \n     shortage of qualified skilled production employees, including \n     frontline workers, such as machinists, operators, craft \n     workers, distributors, and technicians;\n       Whereas career and technical education (referred to in this \n     preamble as ``CTE'') has proven to be an effective solution \n     to ensure that competitive, skilled workers are ready, \n     willing, and capable of holding jobs in high-wage, high-\n     skill, and in-demand career fields, such as science, \n     technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines, \n     nursing, allied health, construction, information technology, \n     energy sustainability, and many other fields that are vital \n     in keeping the United States competitive in the global \n     economy;\n       Whereas approximately 14,000,000 students are enrolled in \n     CTE programs, which exist in each State and in nearly 1,300 \n     public high schools and 1,700 2-year colleges across the \n     United States;\n       Whereas 10 of the 20 fastest growing occupations in the \n     United States require an associate's degree, or a degree with \n     fewer requirements;\n       Whereas 13 of the 20 occupations with the largest number of \n     new jobs projected require on-the-job training and an \n     associate's degree or certificate, and nearly all such \n     occupations require real-world skills that individuals can \n     master through CTE;\n       Whereas CTE matches employability skills with workforce \n     demand and provides relevant academic and technical \n     coursework, leading to industry-recognized credentials for \n     secondary and postsecondary education and adult learners;\n       Whereas CTE students are significantly more likely than \n     non-CTE students to report developing problem-solving, \n     project-completion, research, mathematics, college \n     application, work-related, communication, time management, \n     and critical thinking skills during high school; and\n       Whereas students at schools with highly-integrated, \n     rigorous academic and CTE programs have significantly higher \n     achievement in reading, mathematics, and science than \n     students at schools with less integrated programs: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n\n[[Page S1177]]\n\n       (1) designates the month of February as ``Career and \n     Technical Education Month'' to celebrate career and technical \n     education across the United States;\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of Career and Technical \n     Education Month;\n       (3) recognizes the importance of career and technical \n     education in preparing a well-educated and skilled workforce \n     in the United States; and\n       (4) encourages educators, counselors, and administrators to \n     promote career and technical education as an option for \n     students.\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution with \nSenator Portman designating February as Career and Technical Education \nmonth.\n  The key to America's continued success lies in improving our Nation's \neducational system. In a National Association of Manufacturers report, \n80 percent of respondents indicate a moderate to severe shortage of \nqualified skilled production employees, including frontline workers, \nlike machinists, operators, craft workers, distributors, and \ntechnicians. If we are to win the race for talent, we need a long-term \nplan that produces the best workforce in the world.\n  Career and technical education is a proven solution for creating \njobs, retraining workers with the skills they need to fill open \npositions in the job market, and ensuring students of all ages and all \nwalks of life are career and college ready. Career and technical \neducation will also help close the skills gap to meet the needs of \nhigh-growth, skill intensive industries. Approximately 30 percent of \njobs by 2018 will require some college or a two-year associate degree, \na need which can be met by improved access to career and technical \neducation programs.\n  Senator Portman and I have also created the Senate Career and \nTechnical Education Caucus, a bipartisan effort committed to \nstrengthening access and improving career and technical education. \nThrough these efforts, we will support students and grow our nation's \nworkforce by ensuring our youth have access to high-quality, rigorous \ncareer and technical education that will prepare them for college and \nfor their future careers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/26/senate-section/article/S1177-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         SENATE RESOLUTION 363--CELEBRATING BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND (for herself, Mrs. Hagan, Mr. Levin, Mr. Casey, Mr. \nIsakson, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Begich, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \nCardin, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Wyden, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Schumer, \nMrs. Shaheen, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Markey, Mr. Manchin, Mr. Menendez, \nMs. Stabenow, Mr. Kaine, Ms. Cantwell, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Warner, Mr. \nNelson, Mr. Coburn, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Merkley, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Coons, \nMr. Durbin, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Portman, Mr. Carper, Mr. Grassley, \nMrs. Feinstein, Mr. Booker, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Wicker, Mr. \nFranken, Mr. Scott, Ms. Warren, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. \nUdall of Colorado) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
