Mr. President, yesterday I mentioned to the Senate that I \nhad been reading a book by Caroline Kennedy called ``A Patriot's \nHandbook.'' I have been looking at the book. It was given to my wife \nfor Mother's Day a number of years ago.\n  I mentioned yesterday that I read about one of John McCain's \nexperiences in a Vietnam prison camp. It will take me just a minute and \na half or so to read this, but this is what I paraphrased yesterday \nthat I will read today. It is ``The Mike Christian Story'' by Senator \nJohn McCain in his book ``Faith of Our Fathers.''\n\n       Mike was a Navy Bombardier-navigator who had been shot down \n     in 1967, about 6 months before I arrived. He had grown up \n     near Selma, Alabama. His family was poor. He had not worn \n     shoes until he was 13 years old. Character was their wealth. \n     They were good, righteous people, and they raised Mike to be \n     hardworking and loyal. He was 17 when he enlisted in the \n     Navy. As a young sailor, he showed promise as a leader and \n     impressed his superiors enough to be offered a commission.\n       What packages we were allowed to receive from our families \n     often contained handkerchiefs, scarves, and other clothing \n     items. For some time, Mike had been taking little scraps of \n     red and white cloth, and with a needle he had fashioned from \n     a piece of bamboo he laboriously sewed an American flag into \n     the inside of his prisoner's shirt. Every afternoon, before \n     we ate our soup, we would hang\n\n[[Page S4288]]\n\n     Mike's flag on the wall of our cell and together recite the \n     Pledge of Allegiance. No other event of the day had as much \n     meaning to us.\n       The guards discovered Mike's flag one afternoon during a \n     routine inspection and confiscated it. They returned that \n     evening and took Mike outside. For our benefit as much as \n     Mike's, they beat him severely, just outside our cell, \n     puncturing his eardrum and breaking several of his ribs. When \n     they finished, they dragged him bleeding and nearly senseless \n     back into our cell, and we helped him crawl to his place on \n     the sleeping platform. After things quieted down, we all lay \n     down to go to sleep. Before drifting off, I happened to look \n     toward a corner of the room, where one of the four naked \n     light bulbs that were always illuminated in our cell cast a \n     dim light on Mike Christian. He had crawled there when he \n     thought the rest of us were sleeping. With his eyes nearly \n     swollen shut from the beating, he had quietly picked up his \n     needle and thread and begun sewing a new flag.\n       I witnessed many acts of heroism in prison, but none braver \n     than that. As I watched him, I felt a surge of pride at \n     serving with him, and an equal measure of humility for \n     lacking that extra ration of courage that distinguished Mike \n     Christian from other men.\n\n  I mentioned this yesterday because I had it in my mind when we \nsaluted the flag. I said yesterday--and I will repeat and paraphrase \ntoday--when we salute the flag, we should remember the Mike Christians \nof the world who sacrificed so much so that we can salute the flag.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/09/senate-section/article/S4288-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4288-S4289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              A FAIR SHOT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I love baseball season. I have never had the \ngood fortune of having a team I grew up with, as has my colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Illinois--Cubs fan, where he lives, White Sox fan--\nbut I have loved baseball since I was a little boy. I love baseball \nseason. I go to games. I think I can go to one this Saturday, unless \nsomething comes up. But I do go home at night--and I have spoken with \nthe Republican leader about the pleasure we get from watching a little \nbit of the baseball games every evening. I do enjoy that.\n  I have watched over the years these managers. I spent so much time in \nsouthern Nevada, in Las Vegas. The baseball team most everyone in Las \nVegas watched and listened to was the Los Angeles Dodgers, and the \nmanager for much of that time, after I came back here, was Tommy \nLasorda, and he was like so many managers, he was a character. He was a \nshowman. I assume he picked some of the times to pick a fight with the \numpire because he was upset with a call, but I think part of it was his \nidea that the team needed something a little extra. Tommy Lasorda would \ngo out there, and he was famous for kicking the dirt and yelling loudly \nat the umpire and making sure he used a lot of swear words. That was \nthe manager. He wasn't the only one. Tommy Lasorda comes to my mind. \nAnd, on occasion, he would get thrown out of the game.\n  Why did he do this? Was he upset at the call? At times it got real \nugly, with chest thumping and, as I indicated, kicking dirt. Lou \nPinella was famous for that. He would kick dirt sometimes on an umpire \nand it usually got him kicked out of the game. As I indicated, they \ntried to keep it clean, but those baseball managers and players \nsometimes have a vocabulary that is for locker rooms and they would say \nmean-spirited things to the umpire, and certainly what they said wasn't \nsuitable for children.\n  A lot of times they exited the game after being told they were \nejected to divert attention from what was going on with their team. It \nwas a gimmick many times, a distraction meant to sidetrack one side and \nrally the other.\n  In the House of Representatives, the Republican leadership is trying \na similar tactic by threatening to bring a lawsuit against the \nPresident of the United States. They are searching desperately for \nsomething--anything--to keep the radicals within their own pockets over \nthere happy. That is hard to do, as we have seen. They want to do this \nto divert the American people's attention from their very own inaction.\n  The Presiding Officer doesn't have to take my word for it--no one has \nto--because conservative pundits are falling over themselves to \ncriticize this ploy. Even last night, Sarah Palin--what did Sarah Palin \nsay? She said, ``You don't bring a lawsuit to a gun fight, and there's \nno room for lawyers on our front lines.'' That is Sarah Palin. That is \nwhat she thinks of the action by the Republican leadership in the \nHouse. She wants to go even further, whatever that is.\n  One Republican pundit said it was political theater. Another called \nthe lawsuit feckless.\n  However they choose to label it, there is one thing that \nconservatives, liberals, and moderates agree on: This lawsuit is \nnothing more than a political stunt. It is nothing more than kicking \ndirt at the umpire. This feeble attempt to pick a fight with President \nObama is intended to draw attention away from the House's inertia on \nissues important to the American people, such as immigration. More than \na year ago we passed immigration and the other House has refused to do \nanything about it, creating lots of problems, and causing this great \ncountry of ours to go further in debt. One trillion dollars would \nresult in reducing our debt if we could pass that legislation. We did \nit; the House should do it.\n  All we are asking is that the middle class get a fair shot, whether \nit is raising the minimum wage, whether it is student debt, which is \nstunningly high--the highest debt we have in America today is student \ndebt, $1.3 trillion. We need to do something about fair pay for women, \nthat they get the same money men get for doing the very same work. A \nfair shot--that is what the American middle class deserves, and the \nHouse Republicans are refusing to give them any shot at fairness.\n  Instead of considering all of these important legislative \ninitiatives--I mentioned only a few--the tea party House is content to \nput on a show, to kick a little dirt--a big, expensive show, in many \ninstances. Who pays for the charade they are talking about over there? \nThe American taxpayers.\n  Let me give one example. Benghazi. Benghazi was a tragedy, but there \nis no political conspiracy. Here is what they have done, mostly in the \nHouse: 13 public hearings, 15 Member and staff briefings, over 25,000 \npages of documents from the White House. Now they are using taxpayer \nmoney on a large-scale stunt that isn't new for them. They have other \nstunts such as the supposed lawsuit. But they have now set up a 12-\nmember Benghazi panel they are creating. They intend to spend $3.3 \nmillion this year--this year, which has just a few months left in it--\n$3.3 million, as they try once again to turn a real tragedy into some \nkind of a conspiracy.\n\n  To put that number in perspective, think about this: The Benghazi \npanel will outspend the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. The House \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs has 25 Members of Congress and it has \nabout 30 staff members. The Benghazi little program they are putting on \nover there will spend more money than the entire Veterans Affairs' \nCommittee in the House.\n  We are still waiting for the House to come together with us to do \nsomething about the veterans emergency we have. They have forgotten \nabout what is going on around the country. We need thousands of new \npersonnel in the Veterans Affairs Department, and the House refuses to \ncomplete the conference with Chairman Sanders.\n  Much like the other sideshows put on by the Republican-controlled \nHouse of Representatives, this so-called lawsuit is baseless. When \nSarah Palin thinks you are going too far, you better take a look at it \nby the tea party-driven House over there. And the House direction of \nthe lawsuit--people keep asking the House leadership: On what are you \ngoing to sue him? They do not know. They are working on it. But they \nare going to have a lawsuit. They are going to kick around a little \ndirt. I am in no position to offer legal guidance, but I have been in \ncourt a few times. You know your case is in big trouble when you cannot \nspecify the reason you are filing the lawsuit.\n  So the leadership in the House of Representatives should put aside \nthis ill-fated venture and leave the chest-bumping and dirt-kicking \ncharade to baseball managers.\n  President Obama is doing something to solve problems, and Republicans \nare suing him because they want to do nothing, and that is sad. \nRepublicans in the House would be better served spending their efforts \nand resources passing legislation, giving the middle class a fair shot.\n\n[[Page S4289]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/09/senate-section/article/S4289-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, earlier this week I hosted a tele-\ntownhall with people from across western Kentucky, from places such as \nLyon County and Webster County. These constituents shared their \nthoughts on a range of issues, from ObamaCare to taxes, but one issue \nkept coming up over and over again. The Kentuckians I spoke with were \ntruly worried about the Obama administration's war on coal jobs. They \nhave seen the devastation in eastern Kentucky, and they know what the \nPresident's newest regulations will likely mean for middle-class \nfamilies such as theirs: skyrocketing utility bills, higher prices, \nfewer jobs. They know the administration's war is an elitist crusade \nthat threatens to shift good, well-paying jobs overseas, splinter our \nmanufacturing base, and throw yet another load onto the backs of \nmiddle-class Kentuckians who have already struggled so much.\n  The hard-working people I represent are worried enough just about \nmaking their mortgage payments and paying for car repairs and coping \nwith energy bills and summer vacations. These are the people whom \nPresident Obama and his Washington Democratic allies should be \nlistening to--not to liberal elites who have been begging the President \nto go after the coal industry and the people whose livelihoods depend \non it. But President Obama does not seem terribly interested in those \nfolks or their problems. Once again he will be off campaigning this \nweek. He will huddle with more leftwing ideologues--the folks who love \nto make a buck off of coal and then attack coal families with ego-\ndriven political crusades, such as the ideologue the President rolled \nout the red carpet for just a few weeks ago down at the White House.\n  Meanwhile, here in the Senate the Democratic majority will continue \nto block and tackle for the President and his anticoal offensive. \nSenate Democrats block basically every attempt--every attempt, however \nsmall--to inject congressional oversight into the administration's \nenergy regulations. They shut down votes. They obstruct the committee \nprocess that should be at the heart of our work. They even gag their \nown Members.\n  They blocked commonsense legislation such as the Coal Country \nProtection Act. What that bill--my bill--would do is require the \nadministration to certify that jobs will not be lost and utility rates \nwill not go up as a result of the President's energy regulations. That \nis not too much to ask. But Washington Democrats are blocking my bill \nbecause they know the President's regulations will cost jobs and will \nraise utility rates, and they are more interested in protecting the \nPresident's ideological agenda than jobs.\n  In other words, Senate Democrats block and tackle and obstruct--all \nto defend the President's war on coal jobs. It is a clear case of \nextreme devotion, and it makes sense because the Democratic majority \nreally only has one mission these days: Protect the President and the \nleft at all costs. That is why the average Democratic Senator has \nalmost no power anymore. Our friends on the other side of the aisle do \nnot ever get to do anything. They are just another backbencher \nfortifying President Obama's Senate moat--the place where good ideas go \nto die. It is a shame.\n  The Senate used to be a place where big ideas were debated and \nserious solutions were explored. Committees operated and amendments \nwere offered. I remember a time not too long ago when there was even \nsuch a thing as an independent-minded Senate Democrat. But today's \nDemocratic leadership has put an end to all of that.\n  It is about time our Washington Democratic friends open their eyes to \nthe true cost of the President's policies, both in my State and in \ntheirs.\n  It is time for these Washington Democrats to stop pretending they are \nnot complicit in the administration's war on coal jobs or in the harm \nit is causing to our constituents because there is real pain out there. \nBeyond the Democratic echo chamber, there is real pain out there, out \nin the real world, in places such as Pike County.\n  Washington Democrats need to understand that Kentuckians are more \nthan just some statistic on the bureaucratic balance sheet. These are \nreal Americans who are hurting, and they deserve to have their voices \nheard. One way to do that, as I have suggested, is for the \nadministration to hold some listening sessions on its new energy \nregulations in the areas that stand to suffer the most from them, in \nplaces such as eastern and western Kentucky. I have already issued \nmultiple invitations for the President's people to visit places in my \nhome State. I am issuing one again today.\n\n  The sad truth is that officials in Washington do not want to come \nanywhere near coal country. They just want to impose their regulations, \nhear some ``feedback'' from the echo chamber in order to check a box, \nand then move right along to the next front in their war on coal. They \ndo not even want to talk to the very people they intend to put out of \nwork. Well, several tele-townhall participants want to know why the \nPresident will not come down to see the mines and the coal families \nthemselves. I am wondering too.\n  Mr. President, the campaign trips can wait. You recently expressed an \ninterest in hanging around middle-class Americans for a change. What I \nam saying is, here is a perfect chance. Come on down to Kentucky and \ntalk to some coal miners.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/09/senate-section/article/S4289-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4289-S4290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       Specialist Kevin J. Graham\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of one \nsoldier from Kentucky who gave his life in service to our country. SPC \nKevin J. Graham of Benton, KY, was killed in Kandahar, Afghanistan, on \nSeptember 26, 2009, when the enemy attacked his vehicle with an IED. He \nwas 27 years old.\n  For his service in uniform, Specialist Graham received many medals, \nawards, and decorations, including the Bronze Star Medal, the Purple \nHeart, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the Combat Infantryman Badge, the \nNational Defense Service Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with \nBronze Service Star, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the \nArmy Service Ribbon, the Overseas Service Ribbon, the NATO Medal, the \nExpert Marksmanship Badge, the National Defense Service Medal, and the \nArmy Service Ribbon.\n  Soldiering was not simply a vocation to Specialist Graham; it was a \nway of life and it was a calling. From a young age, friends and family \nrecall his strong desire to become a soldier.\n  ``Before he went into the Army, he would see guys in uniform and say \nhe needed to be doing something like that,'' says the Reverend Jonathan \nGoodman, Kevin's pastor from Benton's Calvary Baptist Church. ``He felt \nlike it was his life's work, and he was honored to serve his country.''\n  Kevin was born in 1982 in Illinois and raised in Wisconsin. He moved \nwith his parents to Marshall County, KY, about 5 years before his \ndeath. As a child Kevin received his education through Christian \nLiberty Academy as a homeschooler. He was a member of Paddock Lake \nBaptist Church in Wisconsin, where he was involved with the youth group \nand assisted the youth pastor.\n  As a young boy Kevin and his best friend used to dress up in Army \nfatigues and patrol the neighborhood. Neighbors would say they felt \nsafe because they knew someone was watching out for them. Kevin's \ninterest in the military also included a love of military history. He \nwould read endlessly about the Civil War and World War II and talk \noften with his father, grandfather, and others who had served about \ntheir experiences. Kevin collected memorabilia from different \nconflicts, including some given to him by veterans. His interest in \nmilitary aviation led him to spend his summers at an airfield in \nKenosha, WI, to see hundreds of World War II planes gather in \nformation.\n  Kevin also learned to shoot at an early age. By the time he was 16, \nhe had earned a job overseeing the skeet range at the local shooting \nfacility. He\n\n[[Page S4290]]\n\nearned many badges for his marksmanship, including one for hitting his \ntarget 73 out of 75 times.\n  Kevin also had a love for old cars. He bought a 1965 Pontiac Le Mans \nand rebuilt it from the ground up. He attended countless car shows and \nwon several trophies.\n  In July 2007 Kevin fulfilled a lifelong goal and honored the service \nof his father Daniel, who earned a Purple Heart for his service in \nVietnam, by enlisting in the U.S. Army. He completed basic training \nthat November.\n  One of Kevin's closest friends, Tristan Miller, joined the Army \nwithin months of Kevin. Kevin ``was enlisting in a time of war and he \nchose to enlist as an infantryman,'' Tristan recalls. ``Kevin knew what \nhe was going into. This was something he volunteered to do. Kevin knew \nsomething was wrong out there, and he was going to take a stand about \nit.''\n  Kevin was later based at Fort Lewis, WA, where he met the woman who \nwould become his wife, Krystal, in the fall of 2008. On March 22, 2009, \nthey were married, just a few days before Kevin's 27th birthday. Kevin \nalso grew very close to Krystal's son Brian and enjoyed spending time \nas a dad.\n  Then, in July, Kevin was deployed to Afghanistan--his first \ndeployment. He deployed as part of 4th Platoon, Alpha Company, 1st \nBattalion, 17th Infantry Regiment, 5th Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd \nInfantry Division, based out of Fort Lewis. He was promoted to \nspecialist and assigned to be a mortar carrier driver, a responsibility \ngiven to those soldiers among the best able to remain calm in the face \nof a crisis. No doubt Kevin's lifetime of preparation, going back to \nhis boyhood neighborhood patrols, served him well for his greatest and \nfinal role.\n  ``It was an honor to be his parents,'' says Sandra Graham, Kevin's \nmother. ``Truly an honor.''\n  We are thinking of Kevin's family and friends today, including his \nwife Krystal, his stepson Brian, his mother Sandra, his brothers \nDaniel, Sean, and Scott, and many other beloved family members and \nfriends. Kevin's father, Daniel Graham, a hero in his own right, has \nsadly passed on.\n  Mr. President, I know my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in expressing \nour deepest condolences to the family of SPC Kevin J. Graham and great \ngratitude for his life of honorable service and his enormous sacrifice \nin uniform. Without heroes like Specialist Graham, our country could \nnot be free. I hope it is some small measure of comfort to his family \nthat the life of Specialist Graham has been remembered and \nappropriately honored here in the U.S. Senate.\n  Those of us in this body must never forget the men and women such as \nSpecialist Graham who built the foundation upon which our democracy \nstands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/09/senate-section/article/S4290-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp).

Madam President, 14 dead, 82 wounded--that grim statistic \nwas reported this weekend. It was not from Baghdad. It was not from \nDamascus. It was not from Gaza. No, it was not from the Middle East. It \nwas from the Midwest. It was from the city of Chicago--14 dead, 82 \nwounded over the Fourth of July weekend.\n  This morning the Chicago Tribune headline read: ``2 dead, 9 hurt in \nshootings on the South, West sides''--last night. A 17-year-old boy who \nwould have started college orientation Thursday was shot to death \nTuesday night in the Brainerd neighborhood, one of at least 11 people \nshot across the city since Tuesday afternoon. A boy was struck in the \nchest and back and died on the scene. Four minutes later, on the West \nSide, a 23-year-old man was fatally shot as he rode his bicycle in a \nHumboldt Park neighborhood.\n  The story goes on to recount each and every incident. These numbers \ncloak the grief that families are now going through as someone they \nlove is either gone or seriously injured. When you listen to their \nvoices, you understand what life is like in the mean streets on the \nSouth Side and West Side of Chicago.\n  Greg Baron, a 20-year-old from Chicago's South Side, has already been \na victim of gun violence once. He spoke to the Chicago Tribune \nyesterday and said: ``I have to watch my back every day because I do \nnot want to get killed or shot again.''\n  Marsha Lee, a Chicago mother, has already lost one son to gun \nviolence. She recently described how she had to teach her three little \ngirls how to take care of themselves when it came to the gunfire. She \ntold National Public Radio: ``You have to get down low, get down on the \nground, and stay on the ground until it's over, and when it's over you \nhave to check yourself and check one another to see if anybody has been \nhit.''\n  Life in Chicago, life in America--I agree with Mayor Rahm Emanuel of \nChicago. This type of violence is absolutely unacceptable. While the \nnumber of murders in Chicago statistically is, thankfully, down \ncompared to last year, there are still too many deaths from gun \nviolence and too many people living in fear. Who pays the price? The \nfamilies do, but all of us do.\n  The University of Chicago Crime Lab calculates the total cost of gun \nviolence in America at around $100 billion a year--$100 billion. That \nis a staggering number. Cook County, which, of course, contains the \ncity of Chicago, estimates the trauma care for each shooting victim \ncosts $52,000 on average. So for last weekend, with 80 wounded \nChicagoans, we just added $4 million in health care costs, assuming \nthat they can be treated and released at some point in the near future.\n  It is time to do something about it. It is time to stop talking about \nit. I did some polls across our State, and even more important, as I \nvisited the State, I asked questions from one end to the other. We are \nquite a diverse State. Southern Illinois is the South. As the late Paul \nSimon used to say: Southern Illinois is the land of grits and gospel \nmusic--small town America. It is rural. It is where my family roots \nare. I know what they think about guns. Guns are part of the culture. \nGuns are part of the family experience. A father taking his son or even \nhis daughter out to hunt is an important moment in each of their lives.\n  They value the ownership of guns and overwhelmingly use them \nresponsibly and legally for hunting and for target practice. Still, \nwhen you speak to those people about gun violence in the cities and ask \nthem a very basic question, these proud gun owners respond in a way \nthat I am proud of. They agree that no convicted felon and no person \nmentally unstable should be able to buy a gun, period.\n  We considered that on the floor of the Senate--the Manchin-Toomey \namendment. Close the gun show loophole. Ask the question: Have you been \nconvicted of a felony? Is there something in your background that \nsuggests a mental instability that should prohibit you from owing a \ngun? We could not pass that measure.\n  But I offered another measure as well. It is one that relates to this \nbasic issue. If we want to keep guns out of the hands of those who \nwould misuse them, if we want to protect the rights of law-abiding, \nrespectful citizens who own firearms and follow the law, then we should \ntake care and make sure we do everything in our power to keep guns out \nof the hands of folks who will use them to hurt and kill innocent \npeople.\n  The superintendent of police in Chicago is Gary McCarthy. I like Gary \na lot. He came to Chicago from New York, hired by Mayor Emanuel. He \nreally has rolled up his sleeves and gone out in the streets and tried \nto tackle this terrible issue of gun violence. They asked him about \nthis weekend, with 14 dead and 82 wounded in Chicago.\n  He said: ``Something has to happen to slow down the straw purchasing \nthat happens in this State.'' Let me explain\n\n[[Page S4291]]\n\nthat. Here is what the Superintendent meant. The law says that if you \nare a convicted felon you cannot buy a gun. So how do they get their \nhands on guns? Many of them send someone else who does not have a \nhistory of criminal convictions to buy the guns. That so-called straw \npurchaser, a third-party purchaser, purchases the firearm, walks out \nthe door, and either gives it or sells it to the person who can go use \nit in the commission of a crime. Superintendent McCarthy identifies \nthat as one of the key problems in the city of Chicago. It is a problem \nacross America. Mayor Emanuel pointed out yesterday we need tough \nFederal gun laws ``so that the guns of Indiana and Wisconsin are not \nflowing just into the streets.''\n\n  Well, I agree with him. We have a bill before us, pending before us \nin the Senate. It is not technically a bill about guns and firearms. It \nis about sportsmen. A lot of provisions in there are good provisions. \nSome I may question. But by and large, it is all about sportsmen. Now \nwe are being told that colleagues are going to come forward and offer \namendments related to firearms and guns.\n  I may be an exception, but I welcome this debate. I want this debate. \nI want an opportunity to raise important issues about gun violence and \ngun safety in America. I am going to offer an amendment, an amendment \nwhich stiffens the penalties for those who purchase guns to give them \nto another person or sell them to another person to commit a crime.\n  What I said in Chicago I will say on the floor of the Senate. \nGirlfriends, wake up. When that thug sends you in to buy a gun, under \nthis amendment you run the risk of spending 15 years of your life in a \nFederal prison. So think about it. Is he really worth it? Are you \nwilling to take that risk and give away 15 years of your life so some \ngang member or thug can have a gun to go out on the street and kill an \ninnocent person--so that another 15-year-old child can be gunned down, \nkilled in the streets of Chicago or any other city and see their dreams \nabsolutely disappear in the blood on the sidewalk?\n  I want to offer this amendment. I hope my colleagues, whatever their \nviews on guns, will agree with me. This is no violation of a basic \nright under the second amendment to the Constitution. This just says \nthat if you are going to buy a gun to give it to a thug to commit a \ncrime, we are going to put you in jail for 15 years. Think about it. It \nis the only way that we can address this in a manner that will start to \nshut down this pipeline of guns flowing into the city of Chicago and \ncities across America.\n  Some of my friends in Illinois see this issue a lot differently. They \nthink if everybody carried a gun then good people would shoot down the \nbad people. I am skeptical. History tells us that most of the time the \nguns that good people carry are not used as effectively as they hoped \nthey would be used and sometimes even injure the person carrying it. I \nstill trust law enforcement as a first line of defense for families and \nneighborhoods all across my State. Law enforcement has told us loudly \nand clearly: Stop wasting your time in Washington. Address the issues \nthat make a difference in the neighborhoods and lives of families of \nChicago and Illinois and this Nation. Make this a safer Nation--14 \ndead, 82 wounded over the weekend in Chicago.\n  I guess the question to be answered by the Senate is: Do we care? \nWill we do anything? This Senator is going to offer this amendment. I \nhope I get my chance. I hope the filibusters on the other side and from \nother people do not stop me. Is this a guarantee that this will become \nlaw? No, but it is a guarantee this week will not go by without an \neffort from this Senator and I hope from others to address this issue \nof gun violence.\n  I hope it is evidence that many of us believe the Senate is still an \nimportant part of American government that can address the problems \nthat threaten good, decent law-abiding families all across America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today regarding the Indian coal \nproduction tax credit that is being held up by bipartisan politics in \nthe House of Representatives and this body. I have supported this \nimportant provision from my first days in the Senate. Chairman Wyden \nand Ranking Member Hatch did commendable work to bring the tax \nextenders bill to the floor in May. But since then, political \nbrinkmanship has won out at the expense of good-paying jobs and \ncertainty for millions of American businesses and taxpayers.\n  This particular provision not only helps tribes responsibly develop \ntheir natural resources, but it also creates and sustains jobs and \neconomic development in Indian Country to support self sufficiency and \nself determination for several American tribes. This tax credit will \nhelp to employ more people at a good wage and continue a policy that \nhas a track record of working for Montanans.\n  The Crow Nation in Southeast Montana relies on this tax credit to \ndrive their economy. Like many of our tribal nations, the Crow Nation \nsuffers from a much higher unemployment rate than the rest of the \ncountry. Unemployment for the Crow Nation is around 50 percent. That is \nunacceptable. I was proud to work with Chairman Wyden to have this \nprovision added to the EXPIRE Act. The political games being played to \nbring down an important piece of bipartisan legislation are a clear \nexample of why Washington is broken. Congress must take action now. \nThis vital provision will keep tribal jobs and revenue intact. \nExtending this provision also means more money for our schools and \npublic infrastructure in Indian Country. When I traveled to Montana's \ntribal nations in my first week as a Senator, Crow leaders, including \ntribal chairman Darin Old Coyote, shared with me how important this tax \ncredit is for the future of the Crow Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to set partisan differences aside and support \nthe tax extender legislation put forward by Senators Wyden and Hatch.\n  The bill they put forward contains some provisions that I would not \nsupport as stand-alone measures, but overall the bill will be a driver \nof economic development for small businesses. This bill contains many \nprovisions that are essential for job creation, and the 2-year \ntimeframe helps give individuals and businesses the certainty they need \nto move our economy forward.\n  Small businesses across Montana rely on many of the provisions in \nthis bill to keep their companies going, from the new markets tax \ncredit, which spurs development in economically distressed and \nunderserved communities, to the work opportunity tax credit, which \ncreates incentives for hiring veterans. These provisions are driving \nMontana's economy.\n  It is irresponsible for Congress to continue to keep these businesses \nin a state of uncertainty. We must move forward with a real plan to \nencourage business investment and innovation. I urge my colleagues in \nboth Chambers to put aside their political gamesmanship and show the \ncourage our constituents expect and deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. First, let me commend my colleague from Montana. Since \nhe has been here he has been one of the strongest and most stalwart \nvoices in defending the rights of Native Americans, and I know they \npopulate his State in large numbers. I know he has made it a passion \nand he has been extremely effective and I compliment him for that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/09/senate-section/article/S4291-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4291-S4292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ISRAEL\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise to dispel a dangerous notion, \none I have seen too frequently in newspapers, heard on TV and among \npeople, commentators and others in the wake of the violence in Israel.\n  The dangerous notion is that there is a moral equivalence between the \nactions and reactions of Israel and the Palestinian State to the \nviolence and response in the Middle East--or the Palestinian people \nmore so than the State. It must be said there is no moral equivalence \nbetween the actions and reactions of Israel and Hamas and the \nPalestinian Authority to the violence that has occurred there.\n  Two instances make that very clear. We all witnessed terrible \ntragedies occurring in that tortured region of the\n\n[[Page S4292]]\n\nworld. We are now all familiar with both the kidnapping and cold-\nblooded murder of three Israeli boys and, in what seems to be payback, \nthe killing of a young Palestinian teenager. Both were abhorrent--both \nwere abhorrent--and the losses of the families on both sides cannot be \nunderstated, but I think what we ought to focus on--we all know each \nside has its fanatics. Each side experiences tragedy of the highest \norder. What I am saying does not apply to all the people on either \nside, particularly the Palestinian side, but the reaction is what \ncounts.\n  What was the reaction among too many Palestinians to the murder of \nthese three boys? They were almost exultant. They were treated as \nheroes. The mother of one of the supposed murderers, people who are \nsuspected of the murder of the Israelis, Abu Aysha, said: ``If he [my \nson] truly did it--I'll be proud of him till my final day.'' That is \nwhat she said: ``I'll be proud. . . . ''\n  Those who were purported to kill the three Israelis were regarded as \nheroes, not just among a small segment in the West Bank and in Gaza but \namong large numbers of people. There were parades. They were honored. \nThat was the reaction.\n  Let's compare that to Israel's reaction when a group of Israeli \nfanatics killed the Palestinian teenager. The Israeli people, in large \npart, were aghast. They said we have to find who did it and bring them \nto justice. Prime Minister Netanyahu called them terrorists, those who \nmight have killed that Palestinian, equal to the terrorism on the other \nside of the three who killed the Israelis.\n  Israel made every effort to find those and have now made arrests. \nWhile the leader of the Palestinian Authority condemned the killing of \nthe three Israeli boys, there was no such effort on the Palestinian \nside to find those who did it, to bring them to justice. There were no \ncalls of universal condemnation.\n  How can we compare the two sides? How can people say: Oh, the \nIsraelis. Oh, the Palestinians. It is one big fight. They are all the \nsame.\n  It is not. Again, regretfully, there are fanatics on both sides, and \nI abhor the Israeli fanatics. They make things bad for the vast \nmajority of Israelis who want to live in peace in a two-state solution, \nbut the vast majority of Israelis condemn the Jewish fanatics. The vast \nmajority of Palestinians seem to praise the Palestinian terrorists. \nHamas, one of the two main governing organizations in Gaza and the West \nBank, loudly praises the kidnapping and killing of the three Israeli \nboys.\n  Is there moral equivalency here? Are both sides sort of acting the \nsame?\n  By the way, when you read Palestinian textbooks and go to schools and \nread about what the children are taught--vitriolic hatred, not only of \nIsrael but of the Jewish people--you sometimes understand maybe why not \nsupport but condemn and sort of gain some inkling of understanding of \nwhy so many are filled with hatred. But who is putting out those \ntextbooks? Not just Hamas--the Palestinian Authority and many \nPalestinian governing units.\n  So the reaction of Israel, its government and its society, to the \nkilling of an innocent Palestinian youth and the reaction of the \nPalestinian authorities and people, in large part, to the killing of \nthree Israeli youths showed there is no moral equivalency because the \nreaction was totally different.\n  Then let's take what happened yesterday. It is the same thing. You \nread all the headlines, Israelis and Palestinians fighting with each \nother, rockets sent on both sides, air raids sent on both sides, but \nlet's look at what happened. Hamas sent rockets into the heart of \nIsrael to kill innocent civilians--no warnings, not in response to \nanything Israel did. They just decided to send these rockets. Some \ncommentators say it is because they are weak now that Egypt will no \nlonger let them get all those supplies through the tunnels.\n  What is Israel's response? Of course they have to eliminate the \nrockets and rocket launchers, but what other society sends leaflets to \nthe houses that have these rocket launchers, saying: Please vacate.\n  What other society tries to call people on cell phones to say: Leave. \nWe have to get rid of the rocket launchers. We don't want to kill \ninnocent people.\n  That is what Israel did. Did Hamas send any warnings to the people of \nSderot or Beersheba or Jerusalem or Tel Aviv that they were going to \nindiscriminately send rockets into civilian areas? No. Did Hamas do \nthis in response to Israel? No. So this idea again in the papers--oh, \nboth sides are fighting, what can we do, they are both sort of equally \nwrong--is morally abhorrent to me and to many others.\n  There is, in conclusion, no moral equivalency, no moral equivalency \nto weigh these two states and, frankly, in large part, with two \nexceptions, how two societies react: the horrible murders of young \npeople, Israel, sad, condemning the Israelis who did it, and too many \nPalestinians praising the Palestinians who did it. In response to \nrockets sent into civilian areas, Israel tries to limit its response to \nmilitary targets and lets civilians who might be near those targets \nknow they should evacuate.\n  We all pray for peace in the Middle East. I certainly do. There has \nbeen too much death, too much anguish, too much insecurity, but we are \nnot going to achieve peace by equating the two sides and saying they \nare equivalent, morally or in any other way.\n  The steps the beleaguered nation of Israel takes to try and protect \nitself are far different than so many of the aggressive actions of too \nmany on the Palestinian side, with too much support from too many of \nthe Palestinian people.\n  There is no moral equivalency.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I come to the floor this morning to speak on the \nBipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2014.\n  I have been working on this bill with my colleague from North \nCarolina, Senator Hagan. We have been working on this bill together for \nabout 1 year. Our package is very reflective of its name. It is a \nbipartisan sportsmen's package.\n  We have, as of this morning, 46 Members signed on in support of this \nlegislation. I think most would agree that at this time to have 46 \nMembers across the aisle reaching together on any issue is quite \nextraordinary, and one would think we would have a clear path forward \nas to how we can advance a measure that has brought together a very \ndiverse group of Senators, diverse from different parts of the country. \nBut it speaks to how important and how widely accepted and supported \nthese issues are, and this is in no small part due to the fact that \nAmerica's sports men and women come from all over the country. They are \nnot just in the rural areas and out in the country, but they are in the \nbig cities, they are in urban centers, they are in the North, and they \nare in the South. For so many of us, outdoor activities and traditions \ndefine who we are.\n  I don't know how it is in North Dakota, but September 1 in our \nhousehold--I recognize that is Labor Day for us around the country, but \nfor most Alaskans I know, it is opening day. It is opening day, and it \nis when everybody is getting ready to go out duck hunting, and then we \nhave moose season, we have caribou season. We define our seasons not by \nthe calendar but by what is happening with hunting.\n  Right now, in my State, all that anyone is talking about is fishing. \nThe reds are running on the Kenai. That is where I am going to be this \nweekend with my husband. Last week it was all about the kings on the \nNushagak.\n  This morning an article in the newspaper around the State is about a \nsports angler who caught a 482-pound halibut off of Gustavus. It \ndescribed the fisherman as a 77-year-old man who came up to the State. \nThis is his third visit to Gustavus because he likes going out for the \nhalibut. For a small community such as Gustavus to have fishermen come \nin to their town and bring the dollars they do, this is big for us. \nThis helps our economy. It is not only fun, it is an economic driver in \nso many parts of my State.\n  Whether it is hunting or fishing, these are issues Alaskans care \nabout. I think they are also issues people in North Dakota, Virginia, \nand Maryland and all over the country care about.\n  What we have done in this very bipartisan bill is combined a host of\n\n[[Page S4293]]\n\nmeasures that speak to some of the regulatory reforms that will provide \ngreater access for our sports men and women, whether on the water or on \nthe land, whether it is the Hunting, Fishing, and Recreational Shooting \nProtection Act, the Target Practice and Marksmanship Training Support \nAct, which provides for revenues and dollars to help with hunter \neducation programs--very important for us around the country--\nelectronic duck stamps, Farmer and Hunter Protection Act, Hunting \nHeritage Opportunities Act--again, all provisions and measures Senator \nHagan and I have worked on to build these initiatives into one package \nto focus on how we can do more to provide for greater access for our \nsports men and women around the country.\n  But we also provide for some very important conservation principles. \nWe include the North American Wetlands Conservation Act and the \nNational Fish and Wildlife Foundation Reauthorization Act, some very \nimportant measures. We have a provision we have included from Senator \nHeinrich, the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act \nreauthorization. So it is not just on the access side, but it is also \nfocused on the conservation side as well.\n  There is very strong support not only within this body but also \nwithin sports organizations all over the country. Some 42 different \norganizations have come together to sign a letter in support of \nadvancing this measure through the Senate.\n  We spend a lot of time here on the Senate floor talking about: Well, \nwe might be able to advance something in the Senate, but we don't know \nhow it is going to fare on the House side. We have already seen good \naction, similar legislation sponsored by Congressman Latta from Ohio, \nthat passed the House on February 5 of this year by over a 100-vote \nmargin. So clearly the support is not only bipartisan, it is bicameral.\n  What we have done, working together with Senator Hagan and her good \nstaff, is worked hard to try to coordinate these efforts to ensure that \nthe House and Senate bills are closely aligned, so that when we move \nsomething out of here we don't have to guess as to what might happen, \nwe know we are going to have good, strong support.\n  I am obviously very hopeful that we can complete our work on this \nbill. But before we complete the work on the bill, we have to be able \nto start work on the bill.\n  I also recognize that unless we can agree to an open and a fair \namendment process where we actually take some votes around here on \namendments offered by folks on both sides, we are probably unlikely to \nmake progress on this bill. I think that is very unfortunate, because I \nknow there are a lot of folks in my State hoping we are going to move \non this, who are saying: If the Senate can't come together on something \nlike a bipartisan sportsman package, where you have 46 Members coming \ntogether to do this, wow, how are they going to do anything? We need to \nbe able to demonstrate we can work together on some of these \ninitiatives where there is a good level of consensus.\n  I hate to be in the place where we are right now, arguing about \nwhether we are going to be able to take up any relevant amendments. I \nwant us to take up these relevant amendments.\n  I like the bill Senator Hagan and I worked on. If I didn't like it, I \nwouldn't be standing here trying to advance and encourage my colleagues \nthat we move forward to it. But I also know that as good as Senator \nHagan and I are in representing these issues, we don't have a monopoly \non all the good ideas. We don't have a monopoly on everything coming \nfrom different parts of the country. We need to have input from our \ncolleagues.\n  I will remind us that the measure in front of us is not a measure \nthat has gone through the full committee process. This is a measure \nthat has advanced to the floor through a process known as rule XIV, \nwhere it hasn't had the benefit of Members advancing their amendments \nthrough the committee process.\n  I want to have an amendment process. I want to have the debate on \nsome of the measures we have in front of us. I want to stand and tell \npeople why I think it is important we provide for additional access for \nour sports men and women on our public lands and that we can be doing \nmore to help incentivize that. But we have to have that amendment \nprocess.\n  As many of my colleagues know, we have been here before. We have been \nhere as recently as 2012. It was a highly frustrating experience. We \nhad a similar sportsmen's bill that was bogged down--basically, it was \npolitical posturing--late last Congress and it didn't go anywhere as a \nresult.\n  So with that history in mind, and knowing what we went through in \n2012, I decided last July 2013 to introduce my own sportsmen's package. \nWhat I wanted to try to do is figure: OK, let's see if we can take some \nof the politics out of this measure, try to be very bipartisan, try to \nbe nonpolitical.\n  As the ranking member of the committee with jurisdiction and as one \nwho wasn't up for election at this point in time, I felt I was in \nperhaps a good spot to maybe lead this thing forward. So we put the \nideas out there in November. Senator Hagan introduced her own bill, the \nSPORT Act. What became very apparent to both of us was that if we \ncontinued down this two-track path, we would not be successful in \npassage.\n\n  Senator Hagan and I agreed: We know what the goal is, passage of good \nbipartisan legislation. So we sought middle ground and we put together \nwhat we think is common sense. We took good ideas that both of us had, \nwe melded them and we put together what we think are the best interests \nof the sportsmen's community around the country. Then we went out and \nrecruited our cosponsors, we secured the time for floor consideration, \nand now we are here, caught in the same argument about whether relevant \namendments from our caucuses should be allowed.\n  My answer on this is pretty simple. It is a flatout yes. Yes, of \ncourse relevant amendments should be allowed. Yes, we should actually \nbe doing our job here in the Senate, taking good ideas from both sides \nand advancing a package that, again, hasn't gone through the \ntraditional path of the committee process.\n  Senator Hagan and I have again built this, and many of our colleagues \nagree with it; otherwise, they would not have signed on as cosponsors. \nWe greatly appreciate their support. But, again, I think it is \nimportant to get their perspectives on this initiative before we take a \nfinal vote on the bill.\n  I do want to be very clear, because I heard comments this morning \nthat Republicans are somehow or another filibustering this bill. I find \nthat kind of stunning. The Republican conference is absolutely prepared \nto vote on all relevant amendments. We have a list. Last evening when I \nleft, there was a list of 13 that had been filed. This morning, that \nlist has grown. It has doubled. It is probably growing as we speak. \nLet's get moving on these relevant amendments--these amendments that \nare tied to the bill itself.\n  It is not just Republican amendments. We have a good handful of them \nI would like to see advanced. There are amendments on both sides, and \nsome of these amendments are very relevant to specific States.\n  I know Senator Landrieu has an amendment that is very unique to \nLouisiana. It is the Kisatchie National Forest deer hunting amendment, \nvery specific to Louisiana. It wasn't included in the package Senator \nHagan and I built because we were trying to do it broader, more \ncomprehensive, national in scope. But if Senator Landrieu feels this is \nan important piece to have, she should have an opportunity to weigh in \non that.\n  Senator Cardin and Senator Crapo have introduced an amendment, the \nNational Fish Habitat Conservation Act--again, a bipartisan amendment \nled by Senator Cardin, clearly relevant to this measure. Why would we \nnot want to have the opportunity to advance some of these provisions \nthat Members feel will enhance a bill that already has good, strong \nsupport.\n  I want to make sure Members know I am fully committed to a full and \nopen amendment process; that Republicans would like to see a full and \nopen amendment process; and that we get moving. Instead of talking \nabout getting moving, we actually make that happen.\n  I thank those who have come forward and offered their support for \nthis measure. A lot of work has gone into\n\n[[Page S4294]]\n\ncrafting the bill. But I am fearful that, once again, we are at risk of \nbasically being cast aside because of political concerns.\n  I ask the majority leader to reconsider his view that relevant \namendments are too difficult to vote on. We have to return to regular \norder. We have to have a fair and healthy debate on legislation--\nespecially legislation such as this that has not gone through the \ncommittee process, has good, strong support, but needs to have further \ninput from Members all over the country.\n  I appreciate the consideration of the body here in trying to advance \na measure that will help us not only when it comes to access for our \nfishermen and our sports men and women, provides for further \nconservation measures, but also helps us to advance a process in this \nbody that at this time we so desperately lack.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to speak about a very troubling \nissue--to speak about innocent lives being stolen from communities and \nneighborhoods across our country and around the globe. I speak of the \nissue of human trafficking.\n  Last month, in more than 100 U.S. cities--just last month--168 \nchildren were rescued from sex trafficking and 281 pimps were arrested \non Federal and State charges.\n  The weeklong campaign known as Operation Cross Country was conducted \nby the FBI, law enforcement officials, and the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children. It underscores a heartbreaking reality: \nHuman trafficking is not a far-away problem. It is happening right here \nin America, in all 50 States.\n  Each year thousands of men, women, and children are robbed of their \nbasic freedom to live as they choose. They become victims of a rampant \nand evil crime, coerced through intimidation and even through violence \nto work as laborers or prostitutes. According to estimates from the \nPolaris Project, a nonprofit organization dedicated to fighting human \ntrafficking, there were more than 5,000 potential trafficking cases in \nAmerica last year. However, the precise number of domestic victims is \nunknown.\n\n  It should be noted that sex trafficking affects individuals of all \nbackgrounds and races, but it disproportionately impacts women, both \ndomestically and internationally. According to the Polaris Project, 85 \npercent of sex trafficking victims in the United States are women. \nAlthough news headlines often glibly refer to a ``war on women'' in \npolitical terms, we as policy makers might well devote more of our \nenergy to the issue of sex trafficking--a real war, a daily war, a \nnightmarish war--faced by the most vulnerable among us--young women who \nare bought and sold against their will for sex.\n  I stand with colleagues from both political parties in calling for an \nend to this nightmare. We must not ignore the horror stories on our \ndoorsteps. Earlier this year 16 children ranging in age from 13 to 17 \nyears old were rescued from a sex trafficking operation at the Super \nBowl, one of our most celebrated events--the scenario of horror for \nthese 13- to 17-year-olds. These young Americans deserve justice and \nthey deserve rehabilitation.\n  Our friends in the House of Representatives have recently passed a \npackage of bills on antitrafficking, and I hope we will soon consider \nsimilar efforts in the Senate. To highlight a few, Senator Rubio has \nintroduced a bill to help protect children in foster care from becoming \nvictims of trafficking; Senator Cornyn has introduced legislation for \nincreasing federal resources available to trafficking victims; and \nSenator Klobuchar has introduced legislation to help ensure that minors \nwho are sold for sex are not prosecuted as perpetrators but properly \ntreated as the victims they really are.\n  This week I have introduced the End Trafficking Act of 2014. Similar \nto the legislation put forward by my colleagues, my bill would ensure \nvictims of trafficking receive the treatment they need to lead healthy, \nfree, and productive lives. One proposal in my bill would be a court-\nbased pilot program modeled after Hawaii's girls courts, similar to the \nFederal drug court system. Rather than being correctly treated as \nvictims, trafficked juveniles are often charged with a delinquency \noffense and detained. Many do not receive the counseling or support \nthey need while in detention and some even return to the trafficker who \nabused them.\n  My bill supports a specialized court docket and integrated judicial \nsupervision that would put the well-being of the victim first. \nDetention does not amount to rescue, and these victims need to be \nrescued. They should have an opportunity to return home and receive \ntreatment.\n  Human trafficking is a complex problem that demands multifaceted \nsolutions. Supporting the victims is only one part of the equation. We \nmust also target those who perpetuate these atrocious crimes. The \nlegislation I have introduced also seeks to punish those responsible \nfor trafficking--the providers and the buyers--the pimps and the johns. \nFirst, there should be strict enforcement of laws already on the books \nthat prohibit the purchase of sex with minors. Second, child victims \nshould have a longer statute of limitations period during which to file \ncivil lawsuits against their traffickers. Finally, those who distribute \nor benefit financially from commercial advertising that promotes \nprostitution should face criminal charges also. My bill would do all \nthree.\n  We have seen the value of coordination among local, State and Federal \nagencies to fight trafficking. This was certainly true in Operation \nCross Country. Working together, agencies and law enforcement partners \ncan improve the ways they target traffickers to help victims.\n  We all need to realize that in the United States--the freest, most \nprosperous nation in the world--traffickers still find and transit \nvictims. Our efforts to fight trafficking within our borders are \nimportant to fight against trafficking worldwide. There are some 21 \nmillion people around the world who endure this cruel form of modern \nday slavery. There is no other way to put it. Although the United \nStates cannot single-handedly eradicate the problem, we can serve as a \nmodel for other countries to follow by preventing trafficking and \nsupporting victims here at home.\n  Again, the title of the bill is the End Trafficking Act of 2014--\nintroduced this week. I am looking for cosponsors. I am looking for \nRepublicans, Democrats, and Independents to come forward and say with a \nunified voice that this Senate, this Congress, this Federal Government, \nintends to put the full weight of our efforts toward combating this \nserious national and international problem.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and, following procedure, Madam \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided \nbetween Republicans and Democrats for the remaining period of morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/09/senate-section/article/S4294-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4294-S4296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PROTECTING WATER AND PROPERTY RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today I rise in support of Barrasso \namendment No. 3453 to the underlying bill. This amendment actually has \n36 cosponsors--36 of my fellow colleagues have cosponsored legislation \ncalled the Protecting Water and Property Rights Act of 2014, and this \nlegislation is identical to the amendment we have on the floor today.\n  The amendment restricts the expansion of Federal authority by this \nadministration's EPA to encompass all the wet areas on farms, ranches, \nand suburban homes all across America. More specifically, the amendment \neliminates the administration's proposed rule--a rule to implement this\n\n[[Page S4295]]\n\nexpansion of Federal authority, an expansion which I don't think the \nFederal Government should have or does have. But we do have a recently \nproposed rule, and through this proposed rule, Federal agencies are \nattempting to expand the definition of waters of the United States. \nThey want to expand the definition--it is a specific term, waters of \nthe United States--to now include ditches and other dry areas where \nwater does flow, but only flows during a short duration, basically \nafter a rainfall. Federal regulations have never defined ditches and \nother upland drainage features as waters of the United States. So this \nis an expansion of the way we view waters of the United States.\n  This proposed rule does and will have a huge impact on farmers, \nranchers, and small businesses needing to put a shovel into the ground \nto make a living. The rule, in a sense, amounts to a user's fee for \nfarmers and ranchers to use their own land after it rains. It forces \nsuburban homeowners to pay the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to \nuse their backyards after a storm.\n  To me this is one of the worst things we could ever do to Americans, \nlet alone during this poor economy. That is why the Protecting Water \nand Private Property Rights Act is endorsed by the American Farm Bureau \nand the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. It is endorsed by the \nNational Federation of Independent Business and by the American Land \nRights Association. They have endorsed this amendment because they know \nhow devastating the rule is to farmers, ranchers, small business \nowners, and even to homeowners.\n  This administration claims it is providing flexibility for farmers \nand ranchers in the proposed rule, but farmers and ranchers across the \ncountry who read this are not deceived.\n  Bob Stallman, president of the American Farm Bureau, released a \nstatement on June 11 of this year stating that ``the rule would micro-\nmanage farming via newly-mandated procedures for fencing, spraying, \nweeding and more. Permitting meanwhile, could delay time-sensitive \ntasks for months, potentially ruining crops in the process.''\n  According to the June edition of the publication National Cattleman \nin an article entitled ``EPA's Ag Exemptions for WOTUS,'' waters of the \nUnited States, the article states: ``Although agriculture exemptions \nare briefly included, they don't come close to meeting the needs of \ncattlemen and women across the country.''\n  The president of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, Bob \nMcCan, stated in an article:\n\n       For example, wet spots or areas in a pasture that have \n     standing water, under this rule, could potentially be \n     affected. We'd now need permission to travel and move cattle \n     across these types of areas.\n\n  The article lists some of the major areas of agriculture which are \nnot exempted by the EPA's proposed rule. The article states:\n\n       Activities not covered by the exemptions include \n     introduction of new cultivation techniques, planting \n     different crops, changing crops to pasture, changing pasture \n     to crops, changing cropland to orchard/vineyard and changing \n     cropland to nurseries.\n\n  Those activities are not included.\n  The rule also provides no flexibility for investments by small \nbusinesses across the country.\n  According to the National Federation of Independent Business:\n\n       Unfortunately, despite claims by the Agencies, the proposed \n     rule will only increase uncertainty.\n       The proposed rule still requires the Agencies to determine \n     on a case-by-case basis whether many common land formations \n     fall under federal jurisdiction.\n       Often, this determination does not occur until after \n     substantial investments and planning by a small business have \n     taken place--thus chilling investment and expansion. Small \n     businesses cannot be speculative with their resources and \n     capital.\n\n  Private property owners would also face no flexibility. My own \nconstituent, Mr. Andy Johnson, Uinta County, WY, has been threatened by \nthe EPA with penalties calculated to reach an estimated $187,000 a day \nfor building what he believes is a stock pond on his property. In a \nmonth's time, he could be liable for more than $5 million in penalties.\n  What are homeowners to do when faced with this kind of threat? They \ncould choose to fight city hall with limited resources or give in to \nstrong-arming by the Federal Government. Given the Agency's plans to \nexpand the jurisdictional limits of the Clean Water Act, the EPA could \neasily use the proposed rule to bankrupt small landowners for something \nas simple as building a pond or a ditch anywhere near a wetland or \nstream.\n  Congress never intended for the Clean Water Act to be used this way. \nTo me it defies logic to think this proposed rule will benefit anybody \nbut bureaucrats in Washington who are far removed from the communities \nbetween the coasts.\n  I think it is time for the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers to keep \nout of the lives of our constituents' backyards, and it is time to do \nit by opposing the proposed rule.\n  I wish to end with a broader point about how the Senate operates \nthese days.\n  Today the Washington Post had an editorial specifically about the \nlegislation, and it is entitled ``Clear rules for clean water,'' which \nis the proposal I have here today. The editorial board of the \nWashington Post writes: ``If lawmakers don't like the call the EPA is \nmaking''--and I don't like the call the EPA is making--``they should \nclarify the terminology themselves.''\n  In an ideal world, I agree with them. If we don't like something, we \nshould be able to propose a better idea and then we should be allowed \nto vote on it in the Senate. The reality is the majority leader, \nSenator Reid, has essentially shut down the Senate and refuses to allow \nus to vote on new ideas that would actually solve challenges such as \nthis one.\n  In fact, Republicans and Democrats have proposed hundreds and \nhundreds of amendments, and we have only been able to vote on a very \nsmall number of those--and very select ones at that. The truth is the \nmajority leader, Harry Reid, refuses to allow any votes on almost any \namendment and is enforcing a gag order on real debate, discussion and, \nmost importantly, on votes. He has imposed a gag order on important \nissues that impact the lives of all Americans.\n  To prove my point, I put together a chart. I wish to take a moment to \nreview the voting record over the past full year in this body. This \ncalendar has the headline ``Reid Blocks Votes.'' The Republican votes \nare in red. We have the last full year of calendar months, and July is \ndown here as the 13th month because we started last year on July 1.\n  The red Xs are days when there were votes on Republican amendments, \nand votes on Democratic amendments are in blue. Over the past 12 \nmonths--from July of 2013 to July of 2014--Majority Leader Reid has \nallowed Republicans to vote on their amendments a total of 8 days--8 \ndays out of the entire 12 months there have been votes on Republican \namendments. There have been a total of 11 amendments which Republicans \nhave had a chance to offer and have votes on even though we have \nintroduced hundreds of amendments.\n  It is interesting. Harry Reid has actually been tougher on his own \nparty. The Democrats have been more restricted and more limited. If you \nlook at this calendar, you will see the days in blue. Harry Reid has \nonly allowed Democrats to vote 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days over this past year \nthat Democrats have had votes on their own amendments on the floor of \nthe Senate. Over that time Democrats have proposed hundreds and \nhundreds--over 500--of amendments, and there have only been 7 \nDemocratic amendments over the course of 5 days that have had a vote. \nDemocrats have not had a vote on an amendment proposed by a Democratic \nSenator since March 27. It has been 103 days and counting since the \nDemocrats have had an amendment that one of them has proposed and \noffered here in the Senate for a vote.\n  It is so interesting because as I look at the Presiding Officer--of \nthe Democrats newly elected to the Senate in 2012, Members of the \nPresiding Officer's entire class have not had a single rollcall vote on \none of their own amendments on the floor of the Senate--ever. It is an \nastonishing display of what the majority leader has done to muzzle an \nentire legislative body of both parties.\n  I will tell the Presiding Officer I think it is an embarrassing \nrecord. It is\n\n[[Page S4296]]\n\nan embarrassing record for the majority leader, and I think it is an \nembarrassing record for the Democrats--who control the Senate--to \ntolerate.\n  I think it is important for Americans to pay close attention to not \njust what Senators say when they go home, but actually what happens and \nwhat they do and what they stand for and what they vote on. So I would \nsay the next time Democrats go home and tell their constituents they \nare introducing legislation to solve a problem, the constituents ought \nto ask, when? When is the vote? That is what I want to know. When is \nthe vote? When is the vote, Mr. President? When is the vote, Senate \nDemocrats? When is the vote, Majority Leader Reid? When is the vote?\n\n  As usual, when the question is asked, silence. That is all we get in \nreturn.\n  So I actually believe we have a majority of Senators, Republicans and \nDemocrats, who would actually vote to pass my amendment. This amendment \nI have to this bill on the floor--a majority of Senators, Republicans \nand Democrats, bipartisan, would vote to pass this amendment to stop \nthe EPA's extreme takeover of waters across America. But under Senator \nReid's command-and-control style of leadership, I don't think we will \never know. I don't think we will have that vote, and I think Senator \nReid will block it.\n  So I would say that if my colleagues agree with the editorial board \nof the Washington Post, ``Clear rules for clean water''--today's \nWashington Post editorial--then they should be able to stand and be \ncounted. Democrats should demand it. In the recent history of the \nUnited States, if that history is any indication, as we can see by this \nembarrassing vote calendar, I am not at all confident that this body \nwill ever be given the opportunity to stand and be counted, and the \nreason is because Majority Leader Reid won't allow Republicans or \nDemocrats to vote on my amendment or hardly anyone else's amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have just returned from Afghanistan, \nwhere I met with the two Presidential candidates, Dr. Ashraf Ghani and \nDr. Abdullah. Both Dr. Ghani and Dr. Abdullah are impressive men who \nhave committed to reformist agendas and campaigned throughout the \ncountry. Afghanistan is fortunate to have two such capable Presidential \ncandidates.\n  In the course of my meetings with the two candidates last Sunday and \nindeed during many meetings over the years, each has told me that he \nappreciates the support the United States has provided to their \ncountry, and each will sign a bilateral security agreement with the \nUnited States as soon as possible after the next President is \ninaugurated.\n  This is a particularly sensitive time for Afghanistan, which has not \nhad a peaceful transition of power in the 50 years since Zahir Shah was \noverthrown in a coup. More than 7 million ballots were cast in the \nfirst round of the Presidential election back in April, and more than 8 \nmillion ballots were recorded in the runoff election last month. All \nagree there was an impressive turnout in a country where the Taliban \nhas repeatedly threatened violence against those who vote.\n  There have been dramatic improvements in Afghanistan over the last \ndecade in the number of schools and universities, in the number of \nstudents and teachers--particularly female students and female \nteachers--in Afghan life expectancy, in average income, and in many \nother areas. The Afghan Army and the Afghan National Police, who have \ntaken over security responsibility from U.S. and coalition forces, have \nshown great capability by successfully securing two rounds of elections \nand repelling a concerted Taliban attack in the Helmand region of the \ncountry.\n  If the ongoing dispute about the outcome of the Afghan Presidential \nelection is not resolved in a fair and credible manner, however, these \nachievements would be at risk. The Taliban does not have the ability to \ndefeat the Afghan Army or to take over Afghan cities and population \ncenters. However, if a disputed election were to lead to infighting or \nto the establishment of parallel governments, the army could be \nseverely weakened and divided, providing new opportunities for the \nTaliban.\n  The United States and our coalition allies would be much less likely \nto provide the continued military and economic assistance that \nAfghanistan needs if that country's leaders cannot pull together and \nresolve their disputes through the existing election process.\n  The State Department stated on Monday:\n\n       The continued support of the United States for Afghanistan \n     requires that Afghanistan remains united and that the result \n     of this election is deemed credible.\n\n  Both candidates told me personally on Sunday that they believe a \ncomprehensive audit of the election results is necessary and \nappropriate and that they will abide by the results of such an audit. \nThey also stated that they understand the outcome of the election will \nnot be final and will not be credible until such an audit has been \ncompleted.\n  The two campaign teams have been working with the United Nations and \nother international elections experts over the last few days to develop \nan appropriate audit scope to recommend to the elections commission. I \nhad hoped that an agreement on this review could be announced at the \nsame time that a preliminary vote count was released on Monday. While \nthat did not happen, the head of the Independent Election Commission \nsaid the following:\n\n       The announcement [of] preliminary results does not mean the \n     winner has been announced. The investigation of votes could \n     have impacts on the final results.\n\n  The two campaigns have already agreed on audit triggers that will \nresult in the review of nearly half of the ballots cast, but they have \nnot yet reached full agreement on the measures to be taken. I hope they \nwill be able to do so in the very near future. But this is the bottom \nline: Whether or not they are able to reach agreement in full, the \nElectoral Complaints Commission, working with the Independent Election \nCommission, has a responsibility to decide how many ballots to audit, \nand they have that responsibility on their own initiative. The \nIndependent Election Commission must then announce a winner.\n  The path to resolution of the matter is not unclear. On the contrary, \nthe Afghan Constitution and election law are very clear. There is no \nuncertainty about this path. The Independent Election Commission and \nthe Electoral Complaints Commission have the responsibility to proceed \non their own to determine how many ballots need to be audited and to \nconduct an audit with or without the agreement of the candidates. \nIndeed, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan has \nalready called on the election commissions to do just that.\n  I said to the two candidates on Sunday that the Afghan people and the \nAfghan security forces have shown great bravery in standing up for \ntheir country and that it is now time for the country's leaders to do \nthe same. It would be truly unfortunate if the great progress made in \nAfghanistan at the expense of so much Afghan, American, and coalition \nblood and treasure were to be jeopardized by political infighting and \nthe failure of political leadership.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4297]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/09/senate-section/article/S4297-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate divided in the usual form.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nnomination of Dr. William ``Bro'' Adams to be Chairman of the National \nEndowment for the Humanities, NEH.\n  The NEH is one of the largest supporters of humanities programs in \nthe United States. The individual scholars, museums, libraries, \nuniversities, and other cultural institutions it supports enrich \ncommunities across the country. Through his extensive and impressive \nwork in public service, education, and the humanities, Dr. Adams is \nwell-qualified to lead the Endowment.\n  A Vietnam war veteran, Fulbright Scholar, college president, and \nboard member for both the Maine Film Center and the Maine Public \nBroadcasting Corporation, Dr. Adams' diverse experiences have prepared \nhim to lead the Nation's cultural agency. He is a graduate of Colorado \nCollege and earned his Ph.D. in the history of consciousness from the \nUniversity of California at Santa Cruz.\n  Dr. Adams recently retired from a successful tenure as president of \nColby College in Waterville, ME, where he served from 2000 through June \nof this year. He launched and executed an ambitious plan to expand the \nschool and its cultural presence, overseeing a $376 million capital \ncampaign--the largest ever in the State of Maine. In doing so, Dr. \nAdams helped found the Goldfarb Center for Public Affairs and Civic \nEngagement, construct the Diamond Building for Social Sciences, launch \na film studies program, and expand Colby's creative writing curriculum. \nAdditionally, he played a pivotal role in growing Colby's Museum of Art \ninto one of the largest art collections in Maine.\n  Under Dr. Adams' leadership, Colby College has supported several \nprojects that have helped to reinvigorate the humanities in the \nWaterville community. These have included forging partnerships on major \nrenovation projects such as of the Waterville Opera House, the Hathaway \nCreative Center's historic mill property, the Waterville Public \nLibrary, and the Maine Film Center.\n  Dr. Adams is a proven leader whose engagement and direction have \nenriched the State of Maine. I am confident that Bro Adams will lead \nthe NEH and serve our country with great vision and integrity. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this nomination.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the time be yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n\n[[Page S4298]]\n\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof William D.

The majority leader.\n\n\n                       BIPARTISAN SPORTSMEN'S ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. I want the record to reflect how much I appreciate the hard \nwork of the Senator from North Carolina, Senator Hagan, working on this \nbipartisan bill. She did it with the ranking member of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, Senator Murkowski, and they have done good \nwork coming up with this bill.\n  But the Senator from Alaska spoke this morning about her desire for \nconsideration of amendments. Typical, typical, typical of the last 6 \nyears here. This bill has 26 Republican cosponsors. This bill was \nbrought up 2 years ago. They have worked hard to improve the bill since \nthen, and you would think with 26 Republican cosponsors to this bill we \ncould move forward on it. But, as usual, they come down here and they \nsay, well, a good bill, but we want to have a bunch of amendments.\n  I am all for consideration of amendments on this bill. We all are. \nBut the Republicans can't agree on what amendments they want.\n  I just met with a number of people earlier today about this and \nexplained to them how we used to do things. There wasn't on virtually \nevery piece of legislation a necessity to get cloture on a bill and now \neven to get on a bill we need cloture, as we find on the bill we just \nfinished some procedural work on, the sportsmen's bill. It affects \nmillions and millions of Americans, but they want amendments. They want \namendments because they want to kill the bill as they have tried to \nkill everything in the last 6 years.\n  So I repeat, I am all for consideration of amendments. But as we have \nrepeatedly done, we need to have a list of amendments from which to \nwork. Senators have for decades and decades started with a list of \namendments and worked through those lists. So I ask Republicans, if you \nwant an amendment process, bring me a reasonable list that leads to \npassage of the bill.\n\n[[Page S4299]]\n\n  They can't do that because they can't agree on what amendments they \nwant, and there are so many examples. Energy efficiency is something \nsimilar to this, where the senior Senator from New Hampshire worked on \na bill with--it doesn't matter if it was the senior or junior Senator--\nSenator Portman. They worked together on this legislation for months \nand months--in fact, about a year--and we had a bill on the floor and \nwe were moving forward. I was told before the bill, by the Republicans, \nlet's get this done; it is a great bill.\n  So I am again reflecting on what happened with the history here.\n  They said before recess, we need a sense-of-the-Senate on Keystone. I \nsaid we have an agreement. Why do we need to do that? But I said OK, a \nfew hours later, you want that, let's do it, because this bill is \nimportant.\n  We need to do that. The recess was a week. We came back. They said: \nWell, we want to change things a little bit. We want an up-or-down vote \non Keystone. They keep changing things. That is not right.\n  I said: OK, we will vote on Keystone.\n  They couldn't take yes for an answer. We agreed for an up-or-down \nvote for Keystone. They wouldn't take it. It is the same thing on this, \na bill the Republicans support. They oppose their own legislation. So \nwe are going to move forward.\n  Now we have the terrorism insurance legislation that I just moved to \nproceed to. This is an important piece of legislation. Let's hope we \ncan get this done. If we can't, construction in America--whether it is \nin Indiana, Nevada, Maryland, Iowa, Oregon or Mississippi; it doesn't \nmatter where it is--won't go forward because people won't be able to \nget insurance.\n  So I would hope we can get this bill done, but we will see. There are \ndiscussions going on, and we will get the same: Yes, I think we can \nwork something out. But when it comes right down to it, Republicans \ncan't agree on what they want. I hope on that important piece of \nlegislation we can get a list of amendments from the Republicans. I am \ntold they are willing to do that. I hope that in fact is the case, \nbecause it would be a shame for our country if we couldn't get this \ndone.\n  The economy is doing better. We added almost 300,000 jobs last \nreporting period. But if we can't get this done and we can't get the \nhighway bill done, it is going to be a slam to our economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to enter into a colloquy with my colleagues Senator Wicker \nand Senator Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        U.S. Helsinki Commission\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I have the honor of being the Senate chair \nof the U.S. Helsinki Commission, and the ranking Republican Member is \nSenator Wicker. We join with our House colleagues in the work of the \nHelsinki Commission.\n  I mention that because this past week, from June 28 through July 2, \nthe 23rd Annual Parliamentary Assembly was held in Baku, Azerbaijan, in \nwhich over 300 parliamentarians participated. We had a very strong \nrepresentation from the Senate and the House of Representatives \nrepresenting the United States. I was proud to join with Senator Wicker \nand Senator Harkin as well as Congressman Smith, Congressman Aderholt, \nCongressman Gingrey, Congressman Schweikert, and Congressman Schiff in \nrepresenting U.S. interests.\n  By way of background for some of my colleagues who may not be \nfamiliar, the Helsinki Commission is a U.S. participant in the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. This followed up \non the Helsinki Accords which took place in 1975, when all the \ncountries of Europe--including the Soviet Union--joined the United \nStates and Canada and agreed to principles that recognized the \nimportance of good governance, human rights, and economic \nopportunities, as well as territorial security, in order to have \nstability within the OSCE participating States. The United States has \nbeen an active participant in this process.\n  I think we saw the value of the OSCE directly when Russia invaded \nCrimea, and the OSCE mission there was our eyes and ears on the ground \nand helped restore some semblance of order in Ukraine as it now is \nmoving forward.\n  In our work in Baku, we were representing the United States on some \nextremely important issues, and I will talk about some of those issues \nand my colleagues on the floor are going to talk about issues they \nchampioned.\n  But I must say, Russia sent a very strong delegation to Baku to \nrepresent their country. On behalf of the U.S. delegation, I brought \nforward a resolution in regard to violations entitled: ``Clear, Gross \nand Uncorrected Violations of Helsinki Principles by the Russian \nFederation.'' This resolution became the principal debate of the 23rd \nParliamentary Assembly.\n  We held a plenary debate. We don't normally do that. We normally \ndebate issues in different committees, but the entire assembly debated \nthe issues concerning Russia's activities within Ukraine because of the \nseriousness of this matter.\n  Russia violated all 10 core principles of OSCE. We had that in the \nresolution. We were very clear about that. We believe that the best way \nto bring about compliance with these universal values is to put a \nspotlight on those who are violating them.\n  In Russia's invasion into Ukraine and taking over Crimea and in their \ninterference in Eastern Ukraine, they have violated each of the 10 core \nprinciples including: sovereign equality, refraining from the use of \nforce, inviolability of frontiers, territorial integrity of states, \npeaceful settlement of disputes, nonintervention in internal affairs, \nrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, equal rights and \nself-determination of peoples, cooperation among states, and \nfulfillment in good faith of obligations under international law.\n  Our delegation brought that forward. Russia countered with \njustifications we found totally unacceptable, but it was a very \nspirited debate. Many amendments were offered to our resolution because \nby the time we debated the resolution and the time we filed it, there \nhad been some changes in Russia's behavior. So the resolution was \nactually made stronger through the amendment process, which is what we \nintended at the time.\n  Russia made various pleas to try to delete various sections of our \nresolution. By an overwhelming vote of the parliamentarians of Europe, \nCentral Asia, the United States, and Canada, we passed this resolution \nthat the United States brought forward pointing out the clear violation \nof Russia's commitments under the OSCE in its activities in Ukraine. It \npassed by over a 3-to-1 vote among the parliamentarians. We were very \nproud of the work we had done to bring forward that clear statement on \nbehalf of the parliamentarians of the OSCE.\n  I am extremely proud of the role my colleagues played. We were \ninvolved in many other issues. Senator Wicker was one of the key \nspokesmen on several issues relating to our involvement within the \nOSCE. He was involved in bringing out our involvement in Afghanistan, \nwhich is of continued interest.\n  In addition to the 57 participating countries of the OSCE, we have \npartners of cooperation. These are countries not located within our \ngeographical bounds but which have interests in the OSCE. Afghanistan \nis one of our partners for cooperation.\n  We just finished a hearing of the Helsinki Commission on our \nMediterranean partners, which includes Tunisia, Algeria, Israel, \nJordan, and Egypt, and we worked with Morocco--all partners for \ncooperation. So the reach of Helsinki is far beyond just Europe and \nCentral Asia. In this parliamentary assembly, we took up issues that \ninvolved many of these other matters.\n  Mr. President, I yield for my colleague Senator Wicker for comments \nhe might wish to make with regard to the work we did in Baku.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I thank my two colleagues from the other \nside of the aisle for joining with us today in this colloquy.\n  Let me say how proud I was as a Republican Senator from Mississippi \nto\n\n[[Page S4300]]\n\nstand shoulder to shoulder with my colleague from Maryland Ben Cardin. \nThere are probably many places in Maryland he would rather have been at \nthe beginning of July 2014, but he is someone who year after year has \ntaken the time to travel to sometimes some rather unknown capital \ncities such as Baku or Chisinau, Moldova, and represent the United \nStates in our partnership with the OSCE on the Helsinki Commission.\n  As Senator Cardin said, the 1975 Final Act of the Helsinki Commission \nrecognized 10 principles that 57 countries in Europe and Eurasia said \nwe believe we can stand by and live with and live under, issues such as \nterritorial integrity, sovereignty, refraining from the use of force--\nvery important cornerstones of peace, democracy, self-determination and \nthe rule of law in Europe.\n  It is certainly a fact well known within the OSCE and the delegations \nthat come from far and wide to attend these that Ben Cardin is \nrespected internationally, that his word carries weight, that he speaks \non behalf of the United States of America, and on behalf of the OSCE \ncountries with authority, evenhandedness, and fairness. So I think it \nmeant a lot for someone of Senator Cardin's stature to come forward and \npresent these.\n  Indeed, we did have overwhelming support for the supplemental item \nauthored by Senator Cardin. The amendments to water it down by the \nRussian delegation were rejected time and again by overwhelming votes. \nIn the end the final resolution was adopted by over 90 votes in favor \nof the Cardin resolution and only 30 votes against it. Of course, the \ndelegates from the Russian Federation and several of their closest \nallies and neighbors voted against it. But country after country, \ndelegation after delegation, small brave nation after small brave \nnation voted in favor of it because internationally we realized that \nthe words of the resolution were correct.\n  The action of Russia in Crimea--invading this defenseless peninsula \nand annexing it illegally--that action violated all 10 principles of \nthe Helsinki Final Act, and it needed to be said. It needed to be said \nnot only by the United Nations, which has in effect said this in the \nGeneral Assembly, and it needed not only to be said by a major power \nlike the United States of America, through our State Department and \nthrough the Congress, but it also needed to be said by the collective \nbody that represents these 57 countries from Europe and Eurasia.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the final supplemental \nitem as adopted by the Parliamentary Assembly be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Baku Declaration and Resolutions Adopted by the OSCE Parliamentary \n              Assembly at the Twenty-Third Annual Session\n\n                     [Baku, 28 June to 2 July 2014]\n\n\n   resolution on clear, gross and uncorrected violations of helsinki \n                  principles by the russian federation\n\n       1. Noting that the Russian Federation is a participating \n     State of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in \n     Europe and has therefore committed itself to respect the \n     Principles guiding relations between participating States as \n     contained in the Helsinki Final Act,\n       2. Recalling that those principles include (1) Sovereign \n     equality, respect for the rights inherent in sovereignty; (2) \n     Refraining from the threat or use of force; (3) Inviolability \n     of frontiers; (4) Territorial integrity of States; (5) \n     Peaceful settlement of disputes; (6) Non intervention in \n     internal affairs; (7) Respect for human rights and \n     fundamental freedoms; (8) Equal rights and self-determination \n     of peoples; (9) Co-operation among States; and (10) \n     Fulfilment in good faith of obligations under international \n     law,\n       3. Recalling also that the Russian Federation is a \n     signatory, along with the United States of America and the \n     United Kingdom, of the December 1994 Budapest Memorandum on \n     Security Assurances, which was made in connection with \n     Ukraine's accession to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of \n     Nuclear Weapons,\n       4. Concluding that the Russian Federation has, since \n     February 2014, violated every one of the ten Helsinki \n     principles in its relations with Ukraine, some in a clear, \n     gross and thus far uncorrected manner, and is in violation \n     with the commitments it undertook in the Budapest Memorandum, \n     as well as other international obligations,\n       5. Emphasizing in particular that the 16 March 2014 \n     referendum in Crimea was held in clear violation of the \n     Constitution of Ukraine and the Constitution of Crimea as an \n     autonomous republic within Ukraine, and was further conducted \n     in an environment that could not be considered remotely free \n     and fair,\n       6. Expressing concern that the Russian Federation continues \n     to violate its international commitments in order to make \n     similarly illegitimate claims in the eastern part of Ukraine, \n     as it has done, and threatens to continue to do, in regard to \n     other participating States,\n       7. Asserting that improved democratic practices regarding \n     free and fair elections, adherence to the rule of law and \n     respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in the \n     Russian Federation would benefit the citizens of that State \n     but also contribute significantly to stability and confidence \n     among its neighbours, as well as enhance security and co \n     operation among all the participating States,\n       8. Noting the particular vulnerability of Crimean Tatars, \n     Roma, Jews and other minority groups, along with those \n     Ukrainian citizens opposed to the actions undertaken or \n     supported by the Russian Federation, to attacks, harassment \n     and intimidation by Russian supported separatist forces,\n       9. Welcoming the efforts and initiatives of the OSCE to \n     develop a presence in Ukraine, including Crimea, that would \n     support de-escalation of the current situation and monitor \n     and encourage respect for the Helsinki principles, including \n     the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all Ukrainian \n     citizens, as well as the work of the OSCE High Commissioner \n     on National Minorities, the OSCE Representative on Freedom of \n     the Media, and the Office for Democratic Institutions and \n     Human Rights (ODIHR),\n       The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly:\n       10. Condemns the clear, gross and uncorrected violation of \n     the Helsinki principles by the Russian Federation with \n     respect to Ukraine, including the particularly egregious \n     violation of that country's sovereignty and territorial \n     integrity;\n       11. Condemns the occupation of the territory of Ukraine;\n       12. Considers these actions, which include military \n     aggression as well as various forms of coercion designed to \n     subordinate the rights inherent in Ukraine's sovereignty to \n     the Russian Federation's own interests, to have been \n     unprovoked, and to be based on completely unfounded premises \n     and pretexts;\n       13. Expresses unequivocal support for the sovereignty, \n     political independence, unity and territorial integrity of \n     Ukraine as defined by the country's Constitution and within \n     its internationally recognized borders;\n       14. Affirms the right of Ukraine and all participating \n     States to belong, or not to belong, to international \n     organizations, to be or not to be a party to bilateral or \n     multilateral treaties including the right to be or not to be \n     a party to treaties of alliance, or to neutrality;\n       15. Views the 16 March 2014 referendum in Crimea as an \n     illegitimate and illegal act, the results of which have no \n     validity whatsoever;\n       16. Calls upon all participating States to refuse to \n     recognize the forced annexation of Crimea by the Russian \n     Federation;\n       17. Also calls upon all participating States further to \n     support and adhere to mutually agreed and fully justified \n     international responses to this crisis;\n       18. Deplores the armed intervention by forces under the \n     control of the Russian Federation in Ukraine, and the human \n     rights violations that they continue to cause;\n       19. Calls on the Russian Federation to end its intervention \n     in Ukraine and to bring itself into compliance with the \n     Helsinki principles in its relations with Ukraine and with \n     all other participating States;\n       20. Demands that the Russian Federation desist from its \n     provocative military overflights of the Nordic-Baltic region, \n     immediately withdraw its military forces from the borders of \n     the Baltic States and cease its subversive activities within \n     the ethnic Russian populations of Estonia, Latvia and \n     Lithuania;\n       21. Supports continued efforts and initiatives of the OSCE \n     to respond to this crisis, and calls on all OSCE states to \n     provide both resources and political support and to allow the \n     OSCE to work unhindered throughout Ukraine, including Crimea;\n       22. Urges the Russian Federation to contribute to regional \n     stability and confidence, generally enhance security and co-\n     operation by engaging its civil society and all political \n     forces in a discussion leading to liberalization of its \n     restrictive laws, policies and practices regarding freedom of \n     the media, freedom of speech, and freedom of assembly and \n     association, and abide by its other commitments as a \n     participating State of the OSCE;\n       23. Encourages Ukraine to remain committed to OSCE norms \n     regarding the building of democratic institutions, adherence \n     to the rule of law and respect for human rights and \n     fundamental freedoms of all its citizens;\n       24. Exhorts the Russian Federation to fully utilize the \n     expertise and assistance of the OSCE and its institutions, \n     including the Parliamentary Assembly, to enact meaningful \n     improvements in its electoral laws and practices;\n       25. Congratulates the people of Ukraine and commends the \n     authorities of that country for successfully holding \n     presidential elections on 25 May 2014 which were conducted \n     largely in line with international commitments and \n     characterized by a high voter\n\n[[Page S4301]]\n\n     turnout despite a challenging political, economic and, in \n     particular, security environment;\n       26. Expresses a continued willingness to provide the \n     substantial assistance to Ukraine in these and other matters \n     at this critical time.\n\n  Mr. WICKER. It may be that Senator Harkin will want to touch on this \nissue also, but I think it is significant that we have such great \nleadership in both bodies--in the Senate and in the House--with the \nOSCE, people who are willing to take the time to get to know our \nEuropean neighbors at the parliamentary level and have that exchange \nthere, people such as Congressman Robert Aderholt, who is a vice \npresident of the Parliamentary Assembly and who has been very diligent, \nagain, in traveling to some of these exotic locations that nobody \nperhaps envies; and Congressman Chris Smith, a veteran House Member who \nspeaks out so eloquently and so firmly not only for the rule of law and \nhuman rights internationally, but he has actually been recognized by \nthe Parliamentary Assembly as a special representative on the issue of \nhuman rights and trafficking. I commend our colleague from the House of \nRepresentatives Chairman Smith for his leadership in getting passed a \nresolution condemning the trafficking of minors internationally and \ngetting the Parliamentary Assembly to make a strong statement on the \nrecord on this very serious problem that faces, not only us here \ndomestically, but also on the international front.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Will my colleague yield on that point.\n  Mr. WICKER. Indeed.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I appreciate the Senator mentioning Congressman Smith's \nresolution on child sex trafficking. That was a separate resolution \nthat was approved by the parliamentary assembly. The Helsinki \nCommission has been in the forefront on trafficking issues. The \nTrafficking in Persons Report that is prepared annually is used by the \nState Department and is known globally as the document on evaluating \nhow States have proceeded on trafficking issues.\n  The work started in the parliamentary assembly of the OSCE, to the \nleadership of our commission and Congressman Smith who has been our \nchampion. It led to the passage of legislation in 2000 that had the \nTrafficking in Persons Report and followed up with this year's \nparliamentary assembly on child sex trafficking. I do congratulate \nChairman Smith and our delegation for continuing the sensitivity. The \nOSCE now has a special representative in trafficking. So you do provide \ntechnical assistance in each of our participating States to deal with \nthe trafficking issue.\n  I wanted to point out that we do a lot of our work in the three \ncommittees, and one of those committees is where Senator Harkin was \nextremely valuable in pointing out that the original document prepared \nby the committee did not mention the very important human rights \nconcerns of people with disabilities. There is no stronger voice in the \nSenate than Senator Harkin with regard to the rights of people with \ndisabilities. I must tell you, I heard from many of my colleagues in \nthe parliamentary assembly how honored they were that Senator Harkin \nwas in that room to bring this issue to the attention of the \nparliamentary assembly, to give it its proper attention, and the \nmatters he brought forward were overwhelmingly adopted at the \nparliamentary assembly.\n  If I might yield for Senator Harkin to talk a little bit about the \nwork he did in that group.\n  Mr. HARKIN. First, I want to thank my colleagues Senators Cardin and \nWicker for their leadership in the OSCE.\n  I was honored to join my colleagues Senator Cardin and Senator Wicker \nlast week at the 23rd annual session of the Parliamentary Assembly of \nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, OSCE, in Baku, \nAzerbaijan. It's important that Members of Congress uphold our shared \ninterests and responsibilities in this vital organization, whose \nmission is to address issues of national and regional security, to \npromote mutual economic prosperity, and to improve the lives of \ncitizens in all OSCE member States, especially through promotion of \nhuman rights.\n  I was proud to be part of the eight-member delegation from the United \nStates led by Senator Cardin, who is Chairman of the U.S. Helsinki \nCommission, our lead entity for participation in the OSCE. I \ncongratulate Chairman Cardin and the U.S. Commission's co-chairman, \nRepresentative Chris Smith, on their accomplishments in advancing \nsecurity and human rights last week. Chairman Cardin was able to pass a \nneeded resolution holding Russia accountable for violating OSCE \nprinciples and its own international commitments through its \ndestabilizing actions in Ukraine. And Representative Smith achieved \npassage of a key measure at the Assembly to help combat child sex \ntrafficking.\n  As my colleagues have stated, the OSCE and thus also the U.S. \nHelsinki Commission were formed to ensure there is long-term security \nfor the Europe and its allies and to promote cooperation among member \nStates. Part of that cooperation is to foster economic development and \ngrowth, and it was within this area of cooperation that I sought to \ndirect my efforts last week as a U.S. delegation member.\n  The Assembly's Second Committee, the Committee on Economic Affairs, \nScience, Technology and the Environment, is charged with promoting \nactivities that will enhance the economic development of member States. \nIt was there that I was able to offer three amendments to this year's \ncommittee resolution focusing on individuals with disabilities.\n  I am grateful that all three amendments were adopted. The economic \nhealth of all nations is tied to equal opportunity and equal protection \nfor all citizens.\n  Our own Americans with Disabilities Act recognizes the importance of \nopportunity and access in daily life for all citizens, particularly \nthose with disabilities. Without access, without equal opportunity, \npeople with disabilities are relegated to poverty and second class \ncitizenship.\n  My amendments to the Second Committee resolution called for three \nthings: ensuring equal opportunity and access for all persons with \ndisabilities in daily activities of all member states; the ratification \nof the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities by all OSCE members; and the prohibition of discrimination \nagainst people with disabilities in employment and the workplace.\n  As I mentioned, I am happy that these amendments could pass with \noverwhelming support and were added to the final resolution of the \nSecond Committee. They were then subsequently adopted by the full \nParliamentary Assembly as part of what will now be known as the ``Baku \nDeclaration.''\n  I thank our leader Senator Cardin for inviting me to this important \nmeeting and allowing me the opportunity to offer these amendments which \nfocus on the issue of equal opportunity for people with disabilities in \nthe member States and across the globe.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I congratulate my colleague from Iowa, a \nsenior Member of this body, someone who is respected around the globe \nfor being willing to meet fellow parliamentarians and to successfully \nput forward language that was adopted by consensus.\n  If I could mention a couple of other matters that pertain to this \ntrip, First of all, it is interesting that the capital of Azerbaijan, \nBaku, on the western shore of the Caspian Sea, would be the host of \nthis parliamentary assembly.\n  Azerbaijan is an important ally of the United States. I think it is \nimportant for Americans and for Members to know that their neighbor to \nthe north is Russia and their neighbor to the south is Iran. This is a \nvery tough neighborhood that our ally exists in. Yet they are oriented \nto the West. They are oriented to the United States. They want to be \nallies of ours. They were steadfast friends of ours in Afghanistan and \nhave been during the entire time we have been there. They are steadfast \nallies of the Nation of Israel. Again, I think for a majority Muslim \nState such as Azerbaijan to take that stand in a troubling neighborhood \nspeaks well of them. There are steps we wish they would take further \ntoward transparency and openness and the rule of law, and maybe their \nelections weren't all we hoped for in the past, but they are an ally \nthat continues to make progress. So I salute our host nation.\n\n[[Page S4302]]\n\n  I think it should also be said, and I will yield to Senator Cardin on \nthis point, that we stopped back by Chisinau, Moldova, on our way back \nfrom Baku, a member of the OSCE, a nation that is also in a troubling \nneighborhood that feels the breath of Moscow breathing down their \ncollars and the threats by people from the Russian Federation who would \nlike to exert undue influence on that great little nation.\n  It happened that we were there on the day the Moldovan Parliament \nratified the agreement associating Moldova with the European Union. \nThis was a wonderful day for the friends of freedom and the European-\noriented citizens of Moldova. It was great to see the young people \nwalking through the city with the flag and hear Beethoven's Ode to Joy, \nthe European anthem, as it were, and to be there for this very \nsignificant, pivotal day in the history of Moldova and to say we will \ncontinue to stand with the great people of that country. I know Senator \nCardin was thinking of those things when he scheduled that stop.\n  Mr. CARDIN. First, the Senator was able to meet with the President of \nAzerbaijan. We thank him for that. He was able to adjust his calendar \nto do that and we appreciate it because it was very important to hear \nthe message the Senator gave on the floor of the Senate.\n  Azerbaijan is an important ally to the United States. They have \nissues they need to deal with on human rights. We were clear about \nthat. We met with the NGO community while we were there. But I think \nthe Senator's leadership and the way the Senator balanced that \npresentation was very important.\n  There is also the energy issue with Azerbaijan that is very important \nto us in that region as an energy source for Europe. It is an \nimportant, strategic country.\n  And, yes, they do have issues on human rights. We did meet with the \nNGOs and we will continue to voice those concerns.\n  I am glad the Senator from Mississippi mentioned Chisinau and \nMoldova. We also on the way visited Georgia, and Georgia and Moldova \nhave some common interests: They are both moving toward Europe with the \nassociation agreements. They recognize their economic and political \nfuture is with Europe and they both have Russian troops in their \ncountry, and they are both very much concerned about what is happening \nin Ukraine. We got tremendous interest about what we did in Baku on \ntaking on the Russians directly about their violations of the OSCE \nprinciples in their activities in Ukraine. Moldova, as you know, is in \nthe Transnistria area which borders the Ukraine. There are Russian \ntroops there, and the independence of Moldova is very much impacted by \nRussia's presence in Transnistria. Even though there is no border \nbetween Moldova and Russia, they still have that real threat that \nRussia could use its force to try to dictate policy in Moldova. And \nGeorgia, of course, with the territories being controlled by the \nRussians--you saw what happened there, the bloodshed--is a country that \nis very much concerned about being able to control their own destiny. \nThey want to be independent and they don't want to be dominated by \nRussia's intimidation. I think our presence in both of those countries \nwas a clear signal that the United States stands for an independent \nGeorgia and an independent Moldova. We want them to make their own \ndecisions. We believe their future is clearly with integration into \nEurope. They believe their future is with integration into Europe and \nwe will continue to be very supportive of those activities.\n  I have one more comment in regard to our work in Baku. There were a \nlot of issues that were taken up through declaration. For example, our \ndelegation brought forward a resolution on the 10th anniversary of the \nBerlin conference dealing with antisemitism. Congressman Smith and \nmyself were both involved in the original Berlin issues.\n  My colleague has already put into the Record the resolution \nconcerning Russia and Ukraine.\n  I must tell you I was so proud of my participation in this forum. I \nthink the United States learned a lot more about the OSCE during the \nUkraine crisis when they saw it was the OSCE mission that was on the \nground giving us independent information about what was happening in \nUkraine, the importance of our participation, and what Senator Wicker \nsaid in the beginning, our work here knows no political boundaries. \nThis is not a partisan effort. It has been Democrats and Republicans \nworking over the last 40 years to use the Helsinki principles to \nadvance good governance, economic opportunity, and human rights \nthroughout not just the OSCE countries but globally.\n  It has been a real pleasure to work with Senator Wicker on these \nissues and I thank him for his dedication and leadership. There has \nbeen no stronger voice on the floor of the Senate in regard to human \nrights issues. I have been on the floor listening to Senator Wicker as \nhe talked about individual cases of human rights violations in Russia \nand other countries. He speaks his mind on these issues and I am proud \nto be associated with him on the Helsinki Commission.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I will let Senator Cardin have the last \nword on this matter, and I see there are others who want to speak on \nother issues. Let me emphasize to everyone within the sound of our \nvoices that diplomacy and foreign policy are carried out not only \nthrough the executive branch, the State Department, the other good \noffices that we have in the executive branch. Foreign policy is alive \nand well through the participation of Members of the House and Senate, \nthe parliamentary assembly, and in the OSCE. It is important we keep \nour role there.\n\n  My hat is off to the leaders of this Congress--House and Senate--who \nhave, over the years, been willing to exercise leadership and to earn \ncredibility in the OSCE. I am proud to have stood with them this year \nin this delegation. I believe we came back with a better understanding.\n  I appreciate the role of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty in \ncovering our participation there and getting that out to the rest of \nthe world.\n  I am proud to have stood with this delegation--eight Members from the \nHouse and Senate, senior Members and relatively new ones. We stood for \nthe principles of the rule of law and transparency and democracy among \nour allies in Europe and Eurasia.\n  I yield for my friend.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I wish to be identified with Senator Wicker's comments, \nand again I thank all the participants, the eight Members who took \ntheir time to participate on behalf of the United States.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                   Civil Rights Act 50th Anniversary\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Madam President, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of \nthe signing of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, I rise to pay tribute to a \nfew Hoosier leaders who played important roles in the passing of this \nlandmark legislation.\n  The story of the Civil Rights Act can be told through the leadership \nand vision of a long list of extraordinary Hoosiers, including many in \nthe Indiana congressional delegation who supported the bill regardless \nof party. Yet to truly understand the Indiana leadership behind the \nCivil Rights Act, we need to start back home.\n  During World War II, Rev. Andrew Brown vowed to dedicate himself to \nsocial justice while in a hospital bed after being told by a doctor \nthat one of his legs would need to be amputated. Brown promised God \nthat if his leg was saved, he would spend the rest of his life fighting \nfor justice for all people.\n  Later, recalling this moment during an interview, Brown said:\n\n       That's the miracle in my life. That's the commitment that I \n     made. . . . I'll keep fighting until I fall, because that's \n     what I told God I would do.\n\n  Brown did just that. He went on to fight for civil rights as a young \npastor at St. John's Missionary Baptist Church in Indianapolis in the \n1950s and 1960s. Brown organized African Americans to show voting \nstrength in 1963. He was the founder of the Indiana Black Expo, started \nOperation Breadbasket--a radio show devoted to promoting economic and \nsocial justice--and served as the president of the Indiana chapter of \nthe NAACP.\n\n[[Page S4303]]\n\n  He marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in Selma, AL, in 1965. \nHe welcomed King directly into his home during trips to Indianapolis. \nHe worked closely with Martin Luther King, Jr., on the national civil \nrights movement, and he was at the home of Dr. King's parents on the \nnight of Dr. King's tragic assassination in April 1968.\n  Another renowned, homegrown Indiana leader was Willard Ransom. They \nare all featured here. After graduating from Harvard Law School as the \nonly African-American member of his class, he was drafted into the \nmilitary during World War II. While serving, Ransom spent much of his \ntime in Alabama, where he was distraught by the discriminatory manner \nin which fellow Americans were being treated.\n  Resolving to see these practices come to an end, Ransom returned to \nhis home community of Indianapolis, where he quickly became a leader in \nthe fight for greater civil rights. He spoke against housing \ndiscrimination and school segregation. He played a role in drafting \ncivil rights bills before the State legislature. He served as the State \nPresident of the NAACP five times, and he was the first African \nAmerican to run for Congress in Marion County.\n  Henry Johnson Richardson, Jr., moved to Indianapolis from Alabama to \nattend Shortridge High School and went on to attend law school at \nIndiana University in Indianapolis. Richardson became a judge in Marion \nCounty and then a State representative during the struggle for civil \nrights.\n  He actively fought to desegregate schools and university housing and \nhelped change the State Constitution to allow African Americans to \nserve in the Indiana National Guard.\n  These men brought together Hoosiers from every corner of the State, \nevery socioeconomic class, race, and religion to further their efforts. \nThey knew if we wanted to improve together, we have to work together.\n  In 1959 University of Notre Dame president Father Theodore Hesburgh \nand his fellow members of the Civil Rights Commission found themselves \nin Shreveport, LA, while conducting hearings across the country on \nvoting rights. Noticing the Commission was uncomfortable in the heat of \nthe Shreveport Air Force Base, Father Hesburgh made arrangements for \nthe Commission to move their work to Notre Dame's research facility in \nthe Presiding Officer's home State of Land O'Lakes, WI.\n  While the Commissioners relaxed and enjoyed the flight to their new \nlocation, Father Hesburgh reportedly sat in the back of the plane \ndrafting resolutions that would come to make up the core of the \nCommission's report.\n  After an evening of fishing together in Land O'Lakes, WI, Father \nHesburgh strategically presented the Commission with his 14 \nresolutions, 13 of which were approved unanimously.\n  After learning of how Father Hesburgh brought the potentially \ndivided Commission together, President Eisenhower remarked, ``We have \nto put more fishermen on commissions and have more reports written at \nLand O'Lakes, Wisconsin.''\n\n  Congress would later go on to enact approximately 70 percent of the \nCommission's recommendations, including the recommendations in \nlegislation such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Father Hesburgh knew \nthat if we want to improve together, we have to work together.\n  A like-minded Indiana leader serving in the Senate in 1964 was \nSenator Birch Bayh, who was also the father of Evan.\n  On June 19, 1964, exactly 1 year after President John Kennedy \nsubmitted the Civil Rights Act to Congress, Senator Bayh helped the \nSenate pass the most important and sweeping civil rights legislation \nsince Reconstruction.\n  The clerk announced the bill passed 73 to 27 at 7:40 p.m. According \nto a copy of a draft press release amongst Bayh's papers at Indiana \nUniversity, Senator Bayh stated:\n\n       Reason replaced emotion. Respect for another's view \n     replaced blind refusal to hear a differing opinion . . . and \n     when this bill is signed into law, we shall have established \n     the basis for fulfillment of Thomas Jefferson's hope for a \n     nation in which all of the people are treated equally under \n     the law.\n\n  Indiana's other Senator, Vance Hartke, also helped to pass the Civil \nRights Act out of the Senate on the evening of June 19, 1964. Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr., wrote Senator Hartke after the vote, saying:\n\n       The devotees of civil rights in this country and freedom \n     loving people the world over are greatly indebted to you for \n     your support in passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964. I add \n     to theirs my sincere and heartfelt gratitude.\n\n  Senators Bayh and Hartke brought to the Senate a belief that if we \nwant to improve together, we have to work together.\n\n  Another Hoosier who stepped up to help shepherd through the Civil \nRights Act of 1964 was then-minority leader of the House, Congressman \nCharles Halleck, from Rensselaer, IN.\n  While working to move civil rights legislation forward, President \nKennedy and leaders in the House went to Minority Leader Halleck to ask \nfor his help to get the bill through the Judiciary Committee. \nCongressman Halleck, despite having a small percentage of African-\nAmerican constituents and despite receiving some criticism, agreed to \nhelp.\n  When the Civil Rights Act came to the Judiciary Committee, some \ncommittee members took issue with several of its provisions. After \nworking with other committee members to take out some of the \ncontroversial provisions in the bill, Congressman Halleck and others \nwent to work to convince their colleagues to support a more moderate \nversion of the bill.\n  In the end, the bill passed the committee with bipartisan support. No \none got 100 percent of what they wanted, but thanks to Congressman \nHalleck, the Judiciary Committee was able to move forward a strong bill \nof which both Republicans and Democrats could be proud.\n  In private conversations shortly thereafter, Congressman Halleck \nadmitted that his vocal support for the Civil Rights Act was \nendangering his position as House minority leader. He said he would \nlikely lose his position after the next elections because of his \nsupport, and he was right.\n  Despite the personal cost and consequences, Congressman Halleck's \nwork to bring Republicans together with Democrats to support the Civil \nRights Act was key to its success. He showed if we want to improve \ntogether, we have to work together.\n  On August 28, 1963, another Indiana Congressman stood behind Martin \nLuther King, Jr., on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and bore witness \nto a speech that would change the arc of American history. John \nBrademas came from Mishawaka, IN, and grew up hearing stories of the \nKKK boycotting his father's restaurant simply because he was Greek \nOrthodox.\n  These stories, coupled with John's progressive Methodist faith, \ninstilled in him a deep sense of social justice that guided him \nthroughout his career in public service. Congressman Brademas became an \ninstrumental supporter of civil rights during his 22 years in Congress.\n  After witnessing Dr. King's ``I Have a Dream'' speech, Congressman \nBrademas welcomed King to speak in Indiana's Third District. Years \nlater, Coretta Scott King remembered his work and helped campaign for \nBrademas' last bid for reelection.\n  A pioneer in Federal education policy, Congressman Brademas worked \nhard to both integrate schools and increase their funding across the \nentire country.\n  Minority Leader Halleck and Congressman Brademas were not alone in \nsupporting the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Indiana U.S. Congress Members \nMadden, Adair, Roush, Roudebush, Bray, Denton, Harvey, and Bruce all \nsupported the Civil Rights Act to help it pass the House with \nbipartisan support on July 2, 1964. They knew that if we want to \nimprove together, we have to work together.\n  The list of Hoosiers involved in fighting for civil rights is long, \nand we should not forget the everyday Hoosiers, the men and women who \ndid their part in their daily lives to broaden opportunities for all \nAmericans. We may never read their names in history books or know what \nthe United States would be like if they had not done what they did, but \nwhat we do know is they understood that if we truly want to improve our \ncountry, to strengthen who we are as a people, we have to all work \ntogether.\n  The Civil Rights Act of 1964 would not have passed without leaders \nwho were willing to set aside their differences and work together. No \none got everything they wanted, but America got what was so crucially \nneeded. Our\n\n[[Page S4304]]\n\ncountry took a monumental leap forward.\n  This 50th anniversary is a powerful reminder that if we truly want to \nimprove our country, we have to work together.\n  I am honored to follow in the footsteps of these and many more great \nHoosiers who fought for civil rights. I am humbled to have the chance \nto talk about them today.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                       Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Madam President, it is with great pride that I rise to \nspeak about the Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2014.\n  Before proceeding, I wish to thank Senator Murkowski for being a true \npartner in developing and building support for the sportsmen's package. \nI am proud to say that by working together, the Bipartisan Sportsmen's \nAct is cosponsored by 18 Democrats, 26 Republicans, and 1 Independent. \nIt is endorsed by a very diverse group of more than 40 different \nstakeholders.\n  When I became cochair of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus in \nearly 2013, I was committed to advancing bipartisan legislation that \nwould benefit our hunters, our anglers, and our outdoor recreation \nenthusiasts in North Carolina and around the country. Taken together, I \nbelieve the 12 bills included in this bipartisan act accomplish that \nobjective and do so in a fiscally responsible manner. This package does \nnot add a dime to our deficit. It actually raises $5 million over the \nnext 10 years for deficit reduction.\n  Outdoor recreation activities are part of the fabric of North \nCarolina. From the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in the West to \nthe Cape Hatteras National Seashore in the East, North Carolinians are \npassionate about the outdoors--me included. Hunting, fishing, and \nhiking are a way of life, and many of these traditions have been handed \ndown through my own family.\n  According to a recent report, 1.4 million sports men and women call \nmy State home, and that is nearly 20 percent of the State's entire \npopulation. In 2011 a total of 1.6 million people hunted or fished in \nNorth Carolina. To put that in perspective, that is roughly the same \namount of people who live in the Raleigh and Durham metropolitan areas.\n  Nationwide, over 37 million people participate in these activities. \nThat is the equivalent of the population of the State of California. \nWhile many of these men and women live in our rural areas, they are \njust as likely to hail from some of our much more urban areas.\n  To ensure that future generations have an opportunity to enjoy our \ngreat outdoors as we do today, this act, the Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act \nof 2014, reauthorizes several landmark conservation programs. For \nexample, the package includes legislation to reauthorize NAWCA, which \nis our North American Wetlands Conservation Act. This voluntary \ninitiative provides matching grants to organizations, States and local \ngovernments, and to private landowners to restore wetlands that are \ncritical to our migratory birds. These partnerships actually generate \n$3 in non-Federal contributions for every dollar of Federal NAWCA \nfunds, and they have actually preserved more than 27 million acres of \nhabitat over the last two decades.\n  The benefits of this program to outdoor recreation enthusiasts \nnationwide cannot be overstated. The abundance of migratory birds, \nfish, and mammals supported by these wetlands translates into \nmultibillion-dollar activities for hunting, fishing, and wildlife \nviewing. In North Carolina, NAWCA has advanced numerous projects to \nimprove waterfowl habitats and to enable the acquisition of thousands \nof acres of land used for increasing public opportunities for \nactivities of hunting, fishing, and other wildlife-associated \nrecreation.\n  Here is a photo of the Cape Fear Arch region. As part of the \nSoutheastern North Carolina Wetlands Initiative, the North Carolina \nCoastal Land Trust, Ducks Unlimited, the North Carolina Wildlife \nResource Commission, and the Nature Conservancy received a $1 million \nNAWCA grant to protect wetlands and associated uplands in this Cape \nFear Arch region. The Federal grant then is matched by close to $3 \nmillion in non-Federal funding.\n  The Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act also includes legislation sponsored by \nSenators Heinrich and Heller that reauthorizes the FLTFA, which is the \nFederal Land Transaction Facilitation Act, which enables the Bureau of \nLand Management to sell public land to private owners, counties, and \nothers for ranching, community development, and other projects. This \n``land-for-land'' approach has created jobs and generated funding for \nthe Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Forest Service, the National \nPark Service, and the Fish and Wildlife Service to help those entities \nacquire critical inholdings of land from willing sellers. This takes \nplace in 11 Western States as well as Alaska.\n  Our sportsmen's package also contains Senator Wicker's bipartisan \nbill that will enable hunters in all States to purchase duck stamps \nelectronically. Currently, eight States are now participating in a \nprivate program that enables the issuance of e-duck stamps. Since that \nprogram began, hunters in those eight States have actually purchased \n3.5 million electronic duck stamps.\n  I can personally vouch for the benefits of enabling hunters in all \nStates to actually purchase duck stamps online. There have been \noccasions when members of my own family were unable to take a visitor \nhunting because we couldn't find a physical stamp. Let me give an \nexample. Our son-in-law came to visit last year. My husband had planned \nto take him duck hunting. Unfortunately, three different places my \nhusband visited were out of duck stamps. So now when my husband buys \nhis duck stamps for the season, he purchases two or three extra just in \ncase a family member or a visitor decides to go hunting with him.\n  Enabling all hunters to purchase these duck stamps online will not \ncost taxpayers any money, and it will help preserve additional wildlife \nhabitat across the country because a portion of the proceeds of duck \nstamps goes to protecting the habitat.\n  Another bipartisan bill in this package reauthorizes the National \nFish and Wildlife Foundation, NFWF. This poster actually shows the \nnumber of different habitats that are included in the National Fish and \nWildlife Foundation. For example, in Florida right now there are 658 \ndifferent preserves and projects.\n  The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation is a nonprofit that \npreserves and restores native wildlife species and habitats. Since its \ninception, NFWF has awarded over 11,600 grants to more than 4,000 \ndifferent organizations nationwide. Funding from the National Fish and \nWildlife Foundation consistently generates $3 in non-Federal funds for \nevery $1 in Federal funds.\n  One priority that NFWF is currently working on is designed to \nintroduce America's youth to careers in conservation. In addition to \nemploying youth, NFWF is also exploring ways to expand conservation \nemployment opportunities for our Nation's veterans.\n  Our package also includes regulatory reforms and enhancements that \nwill benefit sports men and women across the country. Another example \nis bipartisan legislation that was introduced by Senator Mark Udall of \nColorado. His bill is included, and it will enable States to allocate a \ngreater portion of the Federal Pittman-Robertson funding to create and \nmaintain shooting ranges on public lands. There is currently a shortage \nof public shooting ranges across the country. In North Carolina, a \nprincipal impediment to target range development is the initial cost of \nacquiring the land and then constructing the facility. By reducing the \nnon-Federal match requirement from 25 percent currently to 10 percent \nand then allowing the States to access funds over a greater period of \ntime, this legislation will enable the States to move forward with new \npublic ranges.\n\n  The Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act will also help improve access for \nhunting and fishing and wildlife viewing on public lands. Right now \nnearly half of all the hunters conduct a portion of their hunting \nactivity on public lands, and a lack of access to these public lands is \ncited as a primary reason people stop participating in these \ntraditional activities; they just can't get\n\n[[Page S4305]]\n\nthere. The Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act would require that at least 1.5 \npercent, or $10 million, of annual Land and Water Conservation Fund \nmoney be used to improve access to our public lands.\n  The State of North Carolina is home to four national forests that \ncomprise 1.25 million acres. Our outdoor recreation enthusiasts \nregularly have problems with actually getting access to this gorgeous \nplace depicted here, which is the Pisgah National Forest. I probably \nspend more time backpacking in this forest than any other one. This \nlegislation will help dedicate funding to expanding the access here and \non public lands across the country.\n  Outdoor recreation activities are not only engrained in North \nCarolinians' way of life, they are also huge economic drivers in my \nState and in States across the country. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService has found that hunting, fishing, and wildlife-related \nrecreation activities contribute $3.3 billion annually to North \nCarolina's economy. Nationwide, the same report found that 90 million \nAmericans participate in this wildlife-related recreation, resulting in \nclose to $145 billion in annual spending. That is shown on this chart, \nthe actual economic impact for wildlife-related recreation. In 2011 \nsports men and women spent a total of about $34 billion on hunting, \nwhich is depicted on the chart, $41 billion on fishing, and $56 billion \non wildlife watching. The biggest amount of money spent while enjoying \nthe outdoors is on wildlife watching. An extra $14 billion is spent on \nother activities.\n  According to the Outdoor Industry Association, all of these \nactivities support over 192,000 jobs just in North Carolina and a total \nof 6.1 million across the country. So this really does have a huge \neconomic impact across our Nation.\n  I often say I don't care if an idea is a Democratic idea or a \nRepublican idea, only that it is a good idea, and I will put work \nbehind that. I believe this bill embodies that spirit.\n  The Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2014 is a balanced, bipartisan plan \nthat is endorsed by more than 40 stakeholders, from Ducks Unlimited to \nthe Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, and it is fiscally \nresponsible. I urge my colleagues to approve this legislation for the \nbenefit of our economy and the more than 90 million sports men and \nwomen across the country.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to address the Senate as in morning business and engage in a \ncolloquy with the Senator from Arizona and the two Senators from the \nState of Texas, Mr. Cornyn and Mr. Cruz.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Border Crisis\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, as my colleagues know and the Senator \nfrom Texas and the Senator from Arizona both understand, we are facing \na crisis on our border. It has been changed now to a ``situation.'' I \nunderstand that it is no longer a crisis but a situation, according to \nthe White House.\n  The Senator from Texas has been to the border. I have been to our \nborder. We have seen this veritable flood of young people who have come \nto our country under the belief that they will be able to stay.\n  The real human tragedy here of many, as my colleague from Texas and \nmy friend from Arizona know, is that the trip from Central America to \nthe Texas border, which is the closest place of arrival, is a horrible \nexperience for these young people. Young women are routinely violated. \nYoung men are mistreated. It is a terrible experience for them. Those \nwho are for ``open borders,'' those who think this is somehow \nacceptable ignore the fact that this is a human rights issue of these \nyoung people who are enticed to come to our country under false \ncircumstances and suffer unspeakable indignities and even death along \nthe way.\n  The President of the United States, who initially stated that they \nwould--and I would quote him--he said that we had to stop this and \ninitially said that we needed to reverse the legislation that has \nencouraged the people to come here. I quote him:\n\n       Kids all over the world have it tough, he said. Even \n     children in America who live in dangerous neighborhoods. . . \n     . He told the groups [that he was addressing that] he had to \n     enforce the law--even if that meant deporting hard cases with \n     minors involved. Sometimes, there is an inherent injustice in \n     where you are born, and no president can solve that, Obama \n     said. But presidents must send the message that you can't \n     just show up on the border, plead for asylum or refugee \n     status, and hope to get it.\n       Then anyone can come in, and it means that, effectively, we \n     don't have any kind of system, Obama said. We are a Nation \n     with borders that must be enforced.\n\n  Unfortunately, the proposal--and I would ask my friend from Texas--\nthat has come over for $3.7 billion has nothing to do with dispelling \nthe idea and the belief in the Central American countries that they can \ncome here and if they get to our border they can stay. They cannot \nstay. They cannot stay. If they believe they are victims of \npersecution, they should go to our consulate, go to our embassy. But we \ncannot have this unlimited flow of individuals.\n  Finally--I will yield for my colleagues--what about people in other \nparts of the world? Do they not need this kind of relief? Are they not \npersecuted? What about the Middle East? What about Africa? This is \nselective morality that is being practiced here, I would say to my \nfriend from Texas.\n  We want people to come to this country legally. We want them to come \nif they are persecuted. But we want an orderly fashion. Finally, could \nI just say and remind my friends that despite what may be said, the \nfact is--and the numbers indicate it--for young people these terrible \ncoyotes are bringing them for thousands of dollars. The Los Angeles \nTimes reports: In fiscal year 2013, 20,805 unaccompanied children from \nEl Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras were apprehended by the Border \nPatrol and only 1,669 were repatriated.\n  I ask my friend from Texas: What kind of message does that send?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would say to the distinguished senior \nSenator from Arizona that the administration has been sending mixed \nmessages. First they called this a humanitarian crisis. Then they \ncalled it--I think the Senator said--a ``situation.'' They are sort of \nwalking this back. But I just wanted to remind my colleagues from \nArizona of what the President said a few years ago in El Paso when \npeople said we needed better border security measures in place.\n  He ridiculed people. The Senators may remember this. He said--this is \nthe President talking in El Paso in May 2011--he said:\n\n       You know, they said we needed to triple the Border Patrol. \n     Now they are going to say we need to quadruple the Border \n     Patrol, or they will want a higher fence, or maybe they will \n     need a moat, or maybe they want alligators in the moat. They \n     will never be satisfied. I understand that. That is politics.\n\n  But the truth is, the measures we put in place are getting results. \nThe truth is, they are not getting the kind of results the American \npeople expect--nor these children who are being subjected to horrific \nconditions as they are smuggled from Central America up through Mexico \nto the United States. One of the most puzzling things to me--I see my \ncolleague from Texas here. I know Governor Perry has implored the \nPresident to come visit the border.\n  Now he said: Well, I will invite the Governor to an immigration \nroundtable--where I doubt the Governor will get in a word because the \nPresident will probably just deliver another lecture. He is pretty good \nat that. But that is 500 miles from where the problem is. How can you \nhave a humanitarian crisis, as the White House has called this, and not \nwant to go see it for yourself? Maybe you will actually learn \nsomething.\n  I agree with the Senator from Arizona. In the bill the administration \nsent over, they stripped out all of the reforms that would actually go \nto solve the very problem we all know needs to be solved here and \ninstead asked for a blank check.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask the Senator a question? The first thing that \nneeds\n\n[[Page S4306]]\n\nto be done is to amend the legislation which basically would then make \nevery country treated the same way contiguous countries would be. That \nhas to be the first step. Again and again, I think it is important to \nemphasize here that this is a humanitarian issue, but it is a \nhumanitarian issue about these children who are taken--for how many \ndays? Fifteen, twenty days on top of a train they are being taken and \nexploited by these terrible coyotes.\n  So should we not have a system where if someone deserves asylum in \nthis country we could beef up our consulates, beef up our embassies, \nand have them come there and make their argument, and then be able to \ncome to this country, I would argue?\n  Mr. CORNYN. The Senator is exactly right. What we need is a legal \nsystem of immigration, not an illegal system, because the people who \ncontrol illegal immigration are the cartels and the coyotes the Senator \nmentioned earlier and the criminal gangs. By the way, they have \ndiscovered a new business model. They treat these children as \ncommodities, and they hold them for ransom. They sexually assault the \nyoung women, as the Senator pointed out.\n  We do not know how many of these children start this perilous journey \nfrom Central America, some 1,200 miles away, and never make it to the \nUnited States because they simply die along the way. So this is a \nhorrific situation.\n  I know both the Senators from Arizona might want to speak to this. \nThe President has acknowledged that even under the Senate immigration \nbill that passed the Senate, none of these children would qualify. I \nwould ask maybe the junior Senator from Arizona if he would care to \ncomment.\n  How did this situation get created where even under the law that the \nPresident has advocated for, the Senate immigration bill, none of these \nchildren would be able to stay?\n  Mr. FLAKE. That is correct. The Senator from Texas is correct. \nNeither the President's deferred action program nor legislation passed \nby the Senate would allow people coming now to have some type of legal \nstatus. In the case of the President's DACA, or Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals Program, you would have to have been here by 2007. \nUnder the Senate legislation you would have to have been here by 2011 \nat a minimum. So it would not apply.\n  The problem here--the root of it or the main part of it--is that \npeople coming from noncontiguous countries to the United States, \nmeaning Central American countries like Honduras, El Salvador, and \nGuatemala, are treated differently than kids who come from Mexico or \nCanada. In the case of kids coming--unaccompanied minors--from Mexico \nor Canada, the average is 3 days that we take care of them and then \nrepatriate them or send them back.\n  Here in this case, partly because of the law we have under the \nTrafficking Victims Protection Act, kids who come here need to be \nplaced with a guardian or family. The President's proposal is asking \nnearly $2 billion for the Department of Health and Human Services, \nwhich has no role in border enforcement at all--none. It has no role in \ndeportation or to repatriate these children back. It is simply to \nsettle these children with families or guardians around the country.\n\n  I should note that HHS does no due diligence whatsoever to ensure \nthat the people they are placing them with are here legally. So the net \neffect is, when a child goes to a legal guardian or a parent, it is \nvery unlikely that they will then show up later for deportation \nhearings.\n  So, in effect, you are telling the cartels and the human smugglers \nand others: Keep doing what you are doing because it works. When those \nunaccompanied minors get here, they will be able to stay. They will be \ntaken care of.\n  As Senator McCain said, that is the least human thing we can do--to \nencourage parents and relatives in these countries to send their \nchildren or put them in the care of smugglers and others. If we want to \nstem the tide here, the way to stem the tide is to have parents and \nrelatives in these countries seeing these children come back to these \ncountries as we do to children in Mexico or Canada who come across the \nborder.\n  So I thank the Senator from Arizona for arranging this colloquy. We \nhave to take action.\n  Mr. CORNYN. If I may, the junior Senator from Texas had visited \nLackland Air Force Base recently and observed some of these 1,200--if I \nam not mistaken--children who are being essentially warehoused because \nwe do not have any other place to put them. If he might comment on what \nwe are going to do if the numbers continue to grow at the level they \nare growing now. I know in 2011 there were about 6,000 unaccompanied \nminors detained at the southwestern border.\n  This year since October, it is somewhere in the 50,000 range. If that \nnumber continues to escalate, where are we going to put all of these \nkids?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend the senior Senator from Texas. I am \nhonored to stand here with the senior Senator from Texas and the \nSenators from Arizona as we speak out together against the humanitarian \ncrisis that is unfolding on our border.\n  President Obama today is down in the State of Texas. But, sadly, he \nis not visiting the border. He is not visiting the children who are \nsuffering as a result of the failures of the Obama policies. Instead, \nhe is doing fundraisers. He is visiting Democratic fat cats to collect \nchecks. Apparently, there is no time to look at the disaster, at the \ndevastation that is being caused by his policies.\n  Just a couple of weeks ago, as the Senator from Texas observed, I was \ndown at Lackland Air Force Base where there are roughly 1,200 children \nbeing housed. There is one thing President Obama had said about what is \nhappening that is absolutely correct. This is a humanitarian disaster. \nBut it is a disaster of the President's own making. It is a disaster \nthat is a direct consequence of President Obama's lawlessness. A quick \nreview of the facts makes that abundantly apparent.\n  In 2011, just 3 years ago, there were roughly 6,000 unaccompanied \nchildren apprehended trying to cross illegally into this country. Then \nin 2012, in the summer of 2012, right before the election, President \nObama illegally granted amnesty to some 800,000 people who were here \nillegally who had entered the country as children.\n  The direct, predictable, foreseeable consequence of granting that \namnesty is the number of children--unaccompanied children--immediately \nbegan to skyrocket. This year, the estimates are that 90,000 \nunaccompanied children will enter this country illegally. That is up \nfrom 6,000 just 3 years ago--6,000 to 90,000. Next year the estimate is \n145,000.\n  This explosion is the direct consequence of the President's \nlawlessness. It is worth underscoring. The people who are being hurt \nthe most are these kids. The coyotes who are bringing them in are not \nwell-meaning social workers trying to help out some kids. These are \nviolent, hardened transnational criminal cartels. These mothers and \nfathers, sadly, are handing over their children to violent criminals \nwho are physically abusing and who are sexually abusing small children.\n  When I was down at Lackland Air Force Base, a senior official there \ndescribed to me how those cartels--with some of these children after \nthey have taken them and after they have begun coming to this country \nto take them here illegally--would hold these children captive, hold \nthem hostage to extract additional money from the families.\n\n  If the families did not send them additional money, as horrifying as \nit is, these drug cartels would begin severing body parts of these \nchildren. I listened to the senior official at Lackland describe how \nthe cartels would put a gun to the back of the head of a little boy or \nlittle girl and force that child to cut off the fingers or the ears of \nanother little boy or little girl. If they do not do so, they will \nshoot them and move to the next one.\n  So on our end, we are having children come to this country whom we \nare having to deal with who are maimed. They have been maimed by the \nbrutality of these criminal cartels. Others of them have deep, deep \npsychological trauma from a child forced to do something so horrific. \nThis is a tragedy that is playing out. It is happening in real time.\n  Now, the administration has suggested the cause of this is violence \nin Central America. I would suggest to my friends, the senior Senator \nfrom\n\n[[Page S4307]]\n\nTexas and the Senators from Arizona, that argument is a complete red \nherring. With violence in one country, you would expect to see the \nnumber of immigrants from that country to go up. But there is no reason \nunaccompanied children would go up. That is something unique and \ndistinct.\n  There have always been countries across the world, sadly, that have \nbeen plagued by violence. When that happens, we have always seen an \ninflux in immigrants, both legal and illegal, from those countries. \nWhat we are seeing here is particular, though. It is particularized \ntowards children. The reason it is particularized towards children is \nbecause the President granted amnesty in a way that was particularized \ntowards children.\n  If you want to understand just how false the administration's talking \npoint is for the cause of what is happening, you need to look no \nfurther than a report which was prepared by our border security that \nSenator Cornyn and Senator Flake and I all saw in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. A couple of weeks ago we had a hearing on this humanitarian \ncrisis, and a whistleblower at the Border Patrol handed over this \nconfidential document to a number of Senators on the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  It described how the Border Patrol interviewed over 200 people who \nhave come here illegally--adults and children--and asked them a simple \nquestion: Why did you come? Ninety five percent said: We came because \nwe believe if we get here we will get amnesty. We believe we will get a \npermiso is what they said; that once they get here, once a child gets \nhere, that little boy, that little girl is scot-free. I would suggest \nto my friend, this is what amnesty looks like.\n  I would suggest to my friends this is what amnesty looks like. \nAmnesty looks like dangerous drug cartels entering this country \nwantonly. Amnesty looks like thousands of young children being housed \nin military bases. Amnesty looks like hundreds of immigrants who came \nhere illegally being transported to cities and towns amid opposition \nfrom the citizens who lived there. Amnesty looks like a complete and \nutter disregard of our rule of law. Amnesty is unfolding before our \nvery eyes.\n  I would suggest that the only response that will stop this \nhumanitarian disaster is for President Obama to start enforcing the \nlaw, to stop promising amnesty, to stop refusing to enforce Federal \nimmigration law, and, finally, to secure the borders. Indeed, I would \ncall upon our colleagues in this body in both parties to come together \nand secure the border once and for all and to stop holding border \nsecurity hostage for amnesty.\n  Mr. CORNYN. If I could ask a question, really, of all three.\n  I think we have described the catastrophe that continues to unfold \nand indeed grow. I know, speaking for myself--and I venture to say, I \nbet, for all four of us--we are actually interested in trying to solve \nthis problem.\n  The President sent over an appropriations request that is essentially \na blank check. The junior Senator from Arizona appropriately \nacknowledged that the majority of the money is for health and human \nresources to continue to warehouse these kids with no actual solution.\n  The Senator from Arizona said we need to change that 2008 law. I \nagree with that. We need to make sure the children are detained and \nthen get whatever process they are entitled to, perhaps even appear \nbefore an immigration judge--that is something we should talk about--\nbefore they are repatriated.\n  But I want to ask the senior Senator from Arizona, because of his \nlong distinguished service on the Armed Services Committee, I was \ntroubled to read and hear some of the testimony of General Kelly, the \nhead of Southern Command, who is the combatant commander for the world \nsouth of the Texas border, Mexico and into Central and South America--\nor actually I guess Mexico is Northern Command. But he said they sit \nand watch 75 percent of the cartel activity involving illegal drugs and \nthey simply don't have the assets to do anything about it.\n  I asked him: Do you think trying to figure out how to adequately fund \nand resource Southern Command, how to get our U.S. military to perhaps \nwork more closely with the Central American military forces and the \nMexican military forces, is that part of the solution to this problem?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would say to my colleague, yes. Also, the commander of \nSouthern Command believes there is an increasing inflow of people \nentering our country illegally who are not from Mexico or from Central \nAmerica. They are from other countries around the world, and there is a \nreal and imminent threat of people coming to the United States of \nAmerica not just to get a job with a better life but to commit acts of \nterror. We are seeing increasing numbers.\n  I say to my friend from Texas, it is my understanding--tell me if I \nam correct--that now 82 percent of the people coming across the border \nillegally are other than Mexican, a majority from Central America but \nthen China, India, Africa--from all over the world they are coming.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would say to the Senator I have been in Brooks County \nnear Falfurrias, TX, to see some of the rescue beacons they have there \nwith some of the language written in Chinese. This is in Brooks County \nnear Falfurrias, TX, where I guarantee nobody who lives there speaks \nChinese--or not many people.\n  So the Senator's point is well taken. Out of the 414,000 people \ndetained coming across the southwestern border last year, they came \nfrom 100 different countries. Most of them were from Mexico and Central \nAmerica, but the Senator is exactly right; we have seen a huge influx \nfrom Central America up through Mexico, and that is the primary source \ntoday.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I just mentioned, and we all know--and I certainly would \nlike my friend from Arizona to comment on this--we have a proposal that \ncame over from the President of the United States to spend some $3.7 \nbillion. I think all of us are for finding a way to pay for it but \nagree with measures that need to be taken, such as beefing up our \nconsulate and embassy capabilities, such as increasing the number of \nrefugee visas for citizens of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala by \n5,000 each next year, do what is necessary to try to address this from \nthe humanitarian standpoint.\n  But the President of the United States failed, even though he had \nstated with the proposal that came over, there is not a request to \namend the Trafficking Victims Prevention Act. In other words, we could \nbe in an unending funding for treatment of people who came illegally \nunless we address the fundamental problem that is driving it.\n  I would ask my friend from Arizona--and, by the way, could I also \npoint out that legislation he and I were part of and spent hundreds if \nnot thousands of hours on called for 90-percent effective control of \nthe border and 100-percent situational awareness, some $8 billion being \nspent. It was amended on the floor for an additional 20,000 Border \nPatrol, that a fundamental element of immigration reform, as we \nproposed it, was to get 90-percent effective control of the border, \nand, in addition to that, that we would have that funding come out of \nfees people would pay as they moved on a path to citizenship, not \nsubject to appropriations.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I thank the Senator for making that point with regard to \nthe legislation. We propose to truly put border security first, and I \ncontinue to hope the House will take that up.\n  But one of the points that has been made is we have to stem this \nhumanitarian crisis in a way that will actually solve the problem, and \nthat will be solved when parents and relatives in these countries \nrealize that sending their children, unaccompanied minors, is futile, \nthat they will spend a lot of money and it won't work.\n  There is a good example of how we can give effect to this from a \ncouple of years ago. In 2005, the country of Mexico allowed Brazilians \nto come in on kind of a visa waiver-type program. What happened is a \nlot of Brazilian nationals came through Mexico and used it as a conduit \nto come into this country. So we had a huge number of so-called OTMs or \nother-than-Mexicans coming up, Brazilians, and we were doing what can \nbest be described as catch and release. We would take them back across \nthe border and let them go.\n\n  That wasn't solving the problem, so the Bush administration decided \nwe\n\n[[Page S4308]]\n\nneeded to solve this problem. The way to actually solve it is to detain \nthese individuals and then send them home to Brazil. We did that. It \nwas an operation called Texas Hold 'Em. After that operation, within 30 \ndays, the number of Brazilians coming through Mexico into this country \ndropped by 50 percent; within 60 days, that number dropped by 90 \npercent.\n  So we can do this, but it needs to involve us changing the law with \nregard to trafficking, to allow us to treat children in Honduras, \nGuatemala, and El Salvador the same way we treat children who come from \nMexico or from Canada and allow us to repatriate and to take these \nchildren back. Once that happens, when we actually do that, then we \nhave a chance to stem this tide. It is the best thing we could do on a \nhumanitarian basis as well, to not have these children subject to the \ncartels and human smugglers who are preying on them right now.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would ask the junior Senator from Texas, surely the \nPresident understands the facts as we have laid them out here, the \nproblems with the 2008 law, really, the flaw in that law. They have \ncreated a business model out of it because they realized these \nimmigrants who come across will not be detained, either the children or \nmany adults, women traveling with minor children, because there are not \nadequate detention facilities.\n  I wonder if the Senator has an opinion why, if the President--\nsurrounded as he is with some pretty smart policy people, people such \nas Secretary Jeh Johnson, the Secretary of Homeland Security, whom I \nhave had a conversation with about this very topic--hasn't sent over a \nrequest to actually fix the problem, as opposed to continuing to \nwarehouse people?\n  Mr. CRUZ. The senior Senator from Texas is exactly right that the \nPresident has effectively admitted he has no intention of stopping this \nproblem. The supplemental request he has submitted, $3.7 billion, the \nmajority of that goes to HHS's social services, providing care to these \nkids, rather than stopping and solving the problem.\n  The Senator and I have both spent a lot of time down on the border of \nTexas and all four of us have spent time down on the border of Texas or \nArizona. The consistent answer from local leaders, from local law \nenforcement, from local elected officials about what is effective \nsecuring the border--the most consistent answer is boots on the ground; \nthat if you want to effectively secure the border--boots on the ground, \nparticularly combined with technology.\n  It is striking, out of $3.7 billion, a tiny percentage of that is \ndirected toward boots on the ground. This is an HHS social services \nbill, and it is unfortunately a pattern we have seen with the Obama \nadministration of bait-and-switch. They are calling this a border \nsecurity bill. It is reminiscent of the 2009 stimulus, which we will \nall recall was sold to the American people. The 2009 stimulus was about \nbuilding roads, infrastructure, and shovel-ready projects, all of which \nare good ideas. Then when over $800 billion was spent by the Obama \nadministration, very little of it actually went to roads, \ninfrastructure, or shovel-ready projects. Instead, it paid off liberal \ninterest groups such as, in this case, the administration calls the \n$3.7 billion border security and yet almost none of the money goes to \nborder security.\n  Indeed, I would note for all of the Democrats who are seeing this \nhumanitarian crisis unfold, who are discovering suddenly the need for \nborder security--and I would note my friend the senior Senator from New \nYork stood on this floor as we were debating immigration last year and \nsaid: The border is secure today.\n  President Obama stood in El Paso in 2010 and said: The border is \nsecure today.\n  I would note, for everyone who says now they are focused on border \nsecurity that when the Senate Judiciary Committee was considering \nimmigration reform, I introduced an amendment--the senior Senator from \nTexas supported it--that would have tripled our Border Patrol, that \nwould have increased fourfold the fixed-wing assets, the technology \nthat would have provided the tools to finally solve this problem, and \nevery single Senate Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee voted \nagainst it. So we shouldn't be surprised the President's proposal that \nis labeled border security doesn't actually secure the border, doesn't \ndo anything about the lawlessness or the amnesty, which means the Obama \nadministration is effectively admitting they expect these children to \ncontinue coming--hundreds of thousands of them in years to come, \nhundreds of thousands of little boys and little girls being subjected \nto horrific physical abuse, sexual abuse, and they intend to do nothing \nto fix the problem, to stop it, to secure the borders, to uphold the \nlaw. That is heartbreaking, and that is not the responsibility of a \nCommander in Chief.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would ask the senior Senator of Arizona, who is also a \nnational well-known security expert but who also knows a little bit \nabout this big world we live in, what is it we can do with some of the \nmoney slated to go to countries such as Honduras, Guatemala, and even \nMexico?\n  Historically, we have had a successful partnership, for example, with \nthe Colombian Government to help them build their capacity under Plan \nColombia. Admittedly, that is a different scenario.\n  In Mexico we have the Merida Initiative, where we train and provide \nequipment to help build their police and law enforcement capability.\n  Are there things we ought to try to tie the money that goes to these \ncountries to right now that would be productive programs and help solve \nthe problem at its source?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Absolutely. And I think, as we mentioned earlier, beefing \nup our embassy and consulate capabilities to hear these cases in the \ncountry of origin--particularly Central America--is very important.\n  I would also point out an article entitled ``Deportation data won't \ndispel rumors drawing migrant minors to U.S.'' It is a very interesting \npiece.\n\n       Organized crime groups in Central America have exploited \n     the slow U.S. legal process and the compassion shown to \n     children in apparent crisis, according to David Leopold, an \n     immigration attorney in Cleveland.\n       He said smugglers, who may charge a family up to $12,000 to \n     deliver a child to the border, often tell them exactly what \n     to say to American officials.\n       ``The cartels have figured out where the hole is,'' he \n     said.\n       As it now stands, the 2008 law guarantees unaccompanied \n     minors from those countries access to a federal asylum \n     officer and a chance to tell a U.S. judge that they were \n     victims of a crime or face abuse or sexual trafficking if \n     they are sent home. If the claim is deemed credible, judges \n     may grant a waiver from immediate deportation.\n       ``Word of mouth gets back, and now people are calling and \n     saying, `This is what I said in court' '', said a senior U.S. \n     law enforcement official, who was not authorized to speak on \n     the record. ``Whether it is true or not, the perception is \n     that they are successfully entering the United States. . . . \n     That is what is driving up the landings.''\n\n  Of course, the numbers are staggering, as we have pointed out.\n  The President himself spoke in the Rose Garden last week.\n\n       Speaking in the Rose Garden last week, Obama said he was \n     sending a ``clear message'' to parents in Central America not \n     to send their children north in hopes of being allowed into \n     America.\n       ``The journey is unbelievably dangerous for these kids,'' \n     Obama said. ``The children who are fortunate enough to \n     survive it will be taken care of while they go through the \n     legal process, but in most cases that process will lead to \n     them being sent back home.''\n\n  Unfortunately, his statement is not backed up by the actual numbers. \nWe are talking about one-tenth of these children actually being sent \nback, as they are being coached by these coyotes who are giving them \nthe story to tell.\n  I wish to emphasize on the part of all of us on this side of the \naisle and every American we represent that we have compassion for these \npeople. We care about a humanitarian crisis. We care about these \nchildren. It is not a matter of fortressing America. We are all for \nlegal immigration. We are from every part of the world. We will be \nportrayed by the open border people, very frankly, as those who want to \nstop these poor children from being able to come to our country. It is \nnot that. We are trying to stop the human abuses, the terrible things \nbeing perpetrated on these children under the false pretenses--they \nshould be false pretenses but now not so false--that they can come to \nthis country and stay.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I think the senior Senator has accurately described how \nthe cartels have figured out how to game the system.\n\n[[Page S4309]]\n\n  Indeed, with all the advertising we do down in Central America saying \n``don't come,'' as the junior Senator from Arizona indicated, as long \nas they get a call saying ``I made it'' and the cartels realize that \nfor every migrant child they shuttle up through the smuggling corridors \nit is going to be another $5,000 or more in the bank, there is every \nincentive to continue.\n  But I ask the senior Senator and perhaps our other colleagues--the \nPresident has said that he has a pen and he has a phone, and he is \ngoing to do things without Congress. He said that because he is \nfrustrated. I know we all have experienced a level of frustration \nduring the immigration debates from time to time and over the years. \nBut he says he is going to consider issuing another order relative to \ndeportation policy, which strikes me as doubling down on his message \nthat he is not going to enforce the law; he is going to try to \ncircumvent the law and basically welcome more people here outside of \nlegal avenues. So I ask my colleagues, doesn't that make things worse, \nnot better?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Well, the other aspect of this that makes things worse: \nOf course, the President on the one hand agrees with us that they can't \nstay. I don't know how many times I have quoted him here. But at the \nsame time, as any objective observer would indicate, the proposal that \ncame over for $3.7 billion has nothing that would dispel the incentive \nand the magnet creating this flood of young people whose trip we have \nbeen talking about, I ask my friend from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I thank the Senator. I have to run to a hearing, but I \nwish to say yes. I, Senator McCain, Senator Feinstein on the other side \nof the aisle, and many others--I think everyone here--signed a letter \nto the President asking him to make a clear statement that children \ncoming now will be deported. He did so, and so did the Secretary of \nHomeland Security. Our State Department has relayed that message. And \nyou can say that until you are blue in the face, but if the reality is \nthat unaccompanied minors who get here are then placed with guardians \nor families around the country and we appropriate $1.8 billion to do \nso, then the message being sent is exactly the opposite of what the \nPresident is saying.\n\n  I think that is what we are all here today to say--that we have to \nnot just say the right thing, we have to do the right thing. And the \nright thing is to change the law that allows the loophole for people to \nstay here indefinitely and send the message by actually sending \nchildren--as we do with unaccompanied minors from Mexico and Canada--\nback because that will send the message clearer than any words we could \nsay to those tight-knit communities who hear by word of mouth. And \nnobody is going to pay another $5,000 or $6,000 or $7,000 to send a \nchild through those dangerous conditions to the border if they know \nthey are going to be returned home.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I could finally add that this proposal that came over \nfor $3.8 billion--and I can only speak for myself, but unless there are \nprovisions in that legislation which would bring an end to this \nhumanitarian crisis, then I cannot support it. I cannot vote for a \nprovision which will then just perpetuate an unacceptable humanitarian \ncrisis that is taking place on our southern border. I don't know if my \ncolleague would agree.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I would note that the confirmation and message of amnesty \nreceived by the parents entrusting their children to these drug dealers \nis the Border Patrol report, which said that 95 percent of those coming \nbelieve they would get a permiso. They believe they would be allowed to \ngo scot-free. That is the message being heard. It is why these children \nare being subjected to violence.\n  A Lackland Air Force Base senior official described a young Hispanic \nchild who is a quadriplegic, who is paralyzed from the neck down, and \nthe drug cartels abandoned him on the Texas side of the Rio Grande. \nThey found him lying by the river, on the other side of the river. That \nis the sort of care and consideration they are providing for these \nchildren. What is happening to these children is horrific.\n  We are a compassionate nation. We have always been a compassionate \nnation. But any policy that continues children being abused by violent \ndrug cartels is the opposite of compassion.\n  So I ask two questions to my friend the senior Senator from Arizona.\n  This afternoon I had lunch with the attorney general of Texas, Greg \nAbbott, who described that the attorney general of Texas and the U.S. \nAttorney's Office have recently arrested an alleged terrorist in Texas \nwith ties to ISIS--with ties to the radical Islamic terrorists who are \nright now wreaking havoc across Iraq and Syria.\n  The first question I would ask the senior Senator from Arizona is, \nhow significant does he see the threat of terrorists crossing our \nporous border and targeting the homeland?\n  Then, of the $3.7 billion President Obama has requested in the \nsupplemental bill, just $160 million is directed to Border Patrol \nagents and immigration judges--both. So less than 5 percent of the \ntotal actually goes to boots on the ground.\n  The second question I would ask of the senior Senator from Arizona \nis, in his judgment, is devoting less than 5 percent of the resources \nfrom this bill to boots on the ground a serious effort at securing the \nborder and solving the problem?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would say to my colleague, the answer to the second \nquestion is obviously no. It is my understanding that if you break this \nlegislation into individual illegal immigrant, it is like $80,000 per \nindividual--a remarkable sum. I will be glad to be corrected for the \nrecord if that is not true.\n  But concerning the Senator's first question, about a month ago, for \nthe first time in Syria, an American citizen blew himself up as a \nsuicide bomber in Syria.\n  There are now thousands and thousands of Europeans--we believe there \nare as many as 100 U.S. citizens, although that number varies--who are \nfighting in Syria on behalf of the most radical terrorist organization: \nISIS. These many hundreds of Europeans who are fighting there have--\nguess what. As European citizens of these countries in Europe, they \nhave a visa. They can go to a European country, get on a plane \ntomorrow, and fly to the United States of America because they are a \ncitizen of one of the European countries with which we have a visa-free \nagreement.\n  Our Director of National Intelligence, the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation have \nall said unequivocally that the events that are transpiring now in the \nlargest, most wealthy, most influential, and largest center for \nterrorism, between Syria and Iraq, is breeding these people who have \nsaid they want to attack the United States of America.\n  Baghdadi, who is now the leader of ISIS, whom we saw on television \napparently preaching at a mosque in Mosul the other day, despite the \nfact that there is $10 million on his head, when he left our prison \ncamp Bucca in Iraq, he said: See you in New York. And I don't think he \nwas joking.\n  So this also is clearly a national security issue over time as well, \nI say to my friend from Texas.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                Refugees\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, we are here today to address a refugee \ncrisis in America. I never thought I would have to use those words on \nthe floor of the Senate, but there is no other way to describe what is \nhappening on our southern border.\n  What is happening in Central America--the violence, the kidnappings, \nthe failure of the rule of law--is the root cause of the problem and it \nis threatening tens of thousands of families and thousands and \nthousands of children. It is causing a refugee crisis that is simply \nunacceptable in America and unacceptable in our hemisphere. Let's be \nclear. It is being caused in large measure by thousands in Central \nAmerica who believe it is better to run for their lives and risk dying \nthan stay and die for sure. It is nearly a 2,000-mile journey from \nthese countries to the U.S. border. These families are not undertaking \nthis journey lightly.\n\n[[Page S4310]]\n\n  My Republican colleagues make it sound as though parents are \nwillingly choosing to risk their children's lives, send them on a \n2,000-mile journey fraught with smugglers, thieves, child abductors, \nand sex traffickers as if that is a choice. They are parents, just as \nwe are parents. I, as a parent, cannot imagine having to make that \nchoice--to send them on a perilous journey with no guarantees of \nsurvival except out of an absolute fear for their lives if they stay. \nTo politicize the decision to send a child away as opportunistic, as a \nway to take advantage of American law, is as cynical a position as I \nhave ever heard.\n  First of all, there is no deferred action. Nothing we did for \nDREAMers in this country would help any of these people. They don't \nqualify under any elements of that provision. The immigration reform \nthat passed here in the Senate by a broad bipartisan vote--68 votes--\nwould not help any one of these people because they would have had to \nhave been in the country by December 31, 2011. Nothing in that law is \nan attraction--nothing.\n  Yet the Republicans in the House of Representatives will not even \ntake a vote on immigration reform. Frankly, my Republican friends \ncannot have it both ways. They cannot criticize the President--in fact, \nsue the President--for abusing his Executive authority and at the same \ntime come to this floor and criticize him for a lack of leadership when \nthey will not even cast a vote. That is nothing if not totally and \ntransparently political.\n  This is not about a welcome mat. It is a desperate effort on the part \nof thousands of parents to do what parents instinctively do, and that \nis to do what you must do to protect your child from the threats of \nviolence and death at home even if it means sending them away.\n  Let's be clear. First and foremost, violence and crime are a pandemic \nthat has sadly become part of life in Central America--in Honduras, El \nSalvador, and Guatemala. Honduras has the highest per capita murder \nrate in the world. El Salvador and Guatemala are in the top five in the \nworld.\n  Second, more than 80 percent of the illicit drugs coming from South \nAmerica to the United States travel through Central America. Drug \ntraffickers and local gangs harass and extort local residents, and they \nare able to use their profits to corrupt the police, judicial system, \nand government institutions.\n  Third, the rates of poverty and inequality in these countries are sky \nhigh, while levels of economic growth and development lag far behind \nother countries in Latin America.\n  A recent report by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees found the \nmajority of the minors they interviewed here in the United States had \nleft their home country out of fear. The bottom line is we must attack \nthis problem from a foreign policy perspective, from a refugee \nperspective, and from a national security perspective. We need to do \nall we can to stabilize the situation in Central America and stop the \nflow of children and refugees to our border.\n  After a full year of squandering every conceivable opportunity to \npass commonsense immigration reform, Speaker Boehner has admitted his \nparty has killed any prospects for reform. Now we have to deal with the \npolitical consequences of the Republican leadership's obstructionism.\n  I fully support the President's efforts to fix some of the most \nurgent problems facing our Nation's broken immigration system, and I \nlook forward to seeing those families who are here and eligible receive \nrelief from deportation as we continue to advocate for a permanent \nlegislative solution.\n  In the meantime, we need to provide emergency funding to deal with \nthis refugee crisis. To begin with, the President's supplemental \nappropriation request is a very tough pro-enforcement legislation.\n  By the way, as we talk about more money for enforcement, we are \nactually doing a good job in enforcement of the border. Why do I say \nthat? Because the reason we know of the size of the refugee challenge \nwe are facing is because we are interdicting and apprehending these \npeople at the border and then putting them in detention facilities. It \nis not that the Border Patrol is not doing their job. They are doing \ntheir job.\n  Yet we have a supplemental request on the appropriations bill that \nincludes $3.7 billion for enforcement, Homeland Security, and other \nresources. It provides critical funding to prosecute traffickers who \nare bringing these kids here, and that is what my Republican colleagues \nhave been asking for.\n  Let's be clear. We need to keep the supplemental clean and free of \nriders and authorizing language. If we don't keep it clean, it will \nnever get passed. One person will want to add an item to immigration \nreform, and then another person will want to add an item to immigration \nreform. The bottom line is this body already passed--with over 68 \nvotes--comprehensive immigration reform. We don't need to have a debate \non a bill we have already passed. We need to deal with the emergency.\n  I love it when my Republican friends scream for action. This is \nemergency funding, and it is as conservative as it gets, focused almost \nentirely on enforcement. The bill is giving Republicans what they have \nalways asked for--more money for border enforcement, especially in the \nborder States.\n  We need to provide the President with the money so he can handle the \nrefugee crisis. It is what we expect of nations around the world. It is \nwhat we tell other nations around the world. The history of America is \nto treat refugees appropriately and according to international \nstandards.\n  Some of these children and families are refugees and some of them are \nnot. The children who have claims should be able to pursue those claims \nwith a day in court under existing U.S. law. If they lose, they will be \ndeported. We have a legal system to address the crisis. Let's use it, \nand let's give the President the resources he needs to enforce it.\n\n  The President's supplemental appropriations request, in my mind, is \nan essential beginning, but I hope the administration will consider the \n20-point plan I laid out that deals, in part, and I think importantly, \nwith the root causes. Because if we spend $3.7 billion for enforcement \nand spend what we have been spending, which is about $110 million among \nfive countries in Central America to create citizen security so people \ndon't flee in the first place, it seems to me we have this equation a \nlittle wrong. We are going to spend $3.7 billion to deal with the \nconsequences, but we are going to spend $110 million to deal with the \ncause. If we don't deal with the cause, guess what. There will never be \nenough money, and there will always be a continuing challenge of \nrefugees fleeing the violence in their countries.\n  I hope we will increase aid for citizen security directed to help \nthem with our law enforcement entities, to deal with the security of \ntheir country, to deal with the drug traffickers, to deal with the \ngangs. I hope we will increase aid to be able to create a sense of \nsecurity in neighborhoods so people don't flee the country; so it isn't \nlikely that your mother or father will be killed in front of you or \nyour brother will be killed or your sister will be raped, which is \nincreasingly the stories heard from these individuals, and that we will \ndo it while implementing humane reforms that don't put innocent \nchildren in harm's way.\n  South of our border, we are seeing unprecedented violence, \nunprecedented suffering, unprecedented abuse. This is far more than an \nimmigration issue, it is a refugee issue, much as we have seen in other \nparts of the world, and we must stop it. It will not be easy. There are \nno easy answers and no easy fixes, but I, for one, believe we should \nmuster all the outrage we can to come up with a short-term fix and a \nlong-term solution, as well as a strategy that does the following:\n  First, we have to identify the root causes of this far-reaching \nrefugee problem. Second, we have to put pressure on governments in the \nhemisphere that are not handling crime and violence in their Nations in \na way that prevents families from sending their children across the \nborder in the first place. Third, we need to combat the smuggling and \ntrafficking rings in Central America. That is in our own national \nsecurity interests. Fourth, we have to effectively deal with the \nsituation at hand and meet the humanitarian needs of these children--\nand I mean children, 8 years old, 7 years old--no matter what it takes, \nwithout placing them in jail in the process.\n\n[[Page S4311]]\n\nFifth, we have to deal with the overriding issues and basic causes from \na foreign policy point of view. Then, we can deal with the join-or-die \ngang recruitment and the gang threats against children and their \nfamilies in the hemisphere--in Honduras and in Guatemala. Six, we have \nto do all we can to combat international crime, working with our \nneighbors to end the violence, threats, and crime activity that is \ndestabilizing the region. Seventh, we need to crack down hard on the \nexplosion of gangs and smugglers forcing families apart and preying on \nyoung children.\n  I can tell my colleagues, as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, I am seeing day after day violence in so many countries \nspreading to so many countries, but I have never seen or thought I \nwould see refugees from this hemisphere spilling over our borders. We \nneed to act, and we have to deal with the immediate crisis at hand.\n  This is not just a challenge here. Asylum claims in the region, \nmeaning to other countries in the Central American region, have \nskyrocketed by 700 percent in recent years. Current law protects the \nability of those children under our system who apply for asylum and \ntrafficking protection and other specialized forms of relief to have \ntheir day in court. Not every child will have a valid claim, and those \nwho do not will ultimately be deported and reintegrated back to what is \nobviously a violent set of circumstances as it exists today, but that \nwill be the case. But it is critically important that every child be \ngiven the chance to have due process under our existing law so we don't \ninadvertently return them to death and violence. There are better ways \nto deal with this population than through detention or expedited \nproceedings that don't undermine that due process.\n  I would like the administration to explore the use of alternatives to \ndetention for families we want to monitor and make sure they show up at \ntheir court proceedings. This supplemental appropriations bill should \nalso include the opportunity to make sure we look at those systems and \nthat the representation of children in court is an adequate one.\n  While the short-term needs are very pressing, we must also not ignore \nthe long-term importance of shoring up our regional security in Central \nAmerica. Congress should increase funding for CARSI, the Central \nAmerica Regional Security Initiative, to assist with narcotics \ninterdiction, institutional capacity building, and violence prevention.\n  State and USAID must develop a long-term strategy that includes \nincreased development budgets to support sustainable growth. The \nMillennium Challenge Corporation should accelerate engagement in the \nregion. I also think the State Department should designate a high-level \ncoordinator to establish an office to be the focal point for policy \nformulation and a response to humanitarian concerns facing children \nescaping this region. Lastly, State and USAID should work together to \nestablish effective repatriation and reintegration programs for \nchildren who are returning to their home countries.\n  If we don't deal with the root causes, this is what is going to \nhappen: We will expedite the process, we will deport, and when they go \nhome and face the same violence we have done nothing to change, their \noption will still be the same, flee or die. And they will take the risk \nall over again, and we will have the challenge all over again.\n  There are no easy answers, but I truly believe, at the end of the \nday, immigration reform--which had very significant border protection \nprovisions, very significant antitrafficking and smuggling of \nindividuals--in terms of assistance to deal with those challenges, \nwould have been and is still incredibly important.\n  Convincing our Republican colleagues in the House that if we continue \nto do nothing, then there will continue to be trouble on our borders \nand the refugee problem will only get worse seems to be a difficult \nproposition. The fact is the Senate-passed bill actually contains \nimportant border security measures. If it had been passed in the House \n1 year ago when the Senate passed it and sent it over there, then maybe \nwe would have preempted a good part of the challenge we have today. It \ncontains antismuggling, antitrafficking measures. It contains \nprovisions to address criminal activity. Yet the House Republican \nleadership cannot bring itself to marginalize the extreme rightwing and \ndo what is right and just and fair.\n\n  The bottom line is that we have to attack this problem from a refugee \nperspective, a foreign policy perspective, and a national security \nperspective. We need to do all we can to maximize our effort to fight \nthe criminals, increase development opportunities, and provide the type \nof economic statecraft that can provide relief. We have to give \nfamilies a chance to fight back economically and politically against \nthose who are causing the violence and the illicit trafficking, the \ngang and drug violence, and those running criminal networks in the \nregion.\n  I am concerned and I am angry and it is time to fight back, but it is \nalso time to deal with the crisis that is upon us, and we can only do \nthat if we give the President the resources to meet the challenge. \nFailure to be willing to support the resources to do that will rest on \nthose who cast a negative vote and, therefore, from my perspective, \nwill risk the national security along the border of the United States, \nwill risk the consequences of the humanitarian and refugee crisis that \nwill continue to flow, and will risk the consequences of the drug \ntraffickers in Central America, the gangs in Central America, all who \nuse that as a route to come to the United States.\n  It is easy to say no. It is far more difficult to be constructive. So \nfar what I have heard in response to this crisis is the negativity of \nno, the criticism of the President for using Executive powers when the \nCongress of the United States fails to act in its own right. You can't \nhave it both ways. This is a moment to call for the greater interests \nof the Nation than to play partisan politics that I have seen so far.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the humanitarian \nsituation on our southern border.\n  Over the last year, we have seen a flood of unaccompanied children \ncome from Central American countries such as El Salvador, Honduras, and \nGuatemala. In fact, the number of children has more than doubled in the \npast year to nearly 60,000. This is a humanitarian crisis, and it is \nheartbreaking.\n  Sadly, there are some who believe they have found a simple solution \nto this problem--that we can somehow just round up these young children \nand send them back on a plane where they came from immediately. I \ndisagree.\n  The United States has always been a leader in providing aid and \nassistance to those in danger and in need. These are values our country \nand Congress have overwhelmingly endorsed. In fact, the current \nprocedures for dealing with children from these countries were set in a \n2008 law. The law was signed by President Bush and unanimously passed \nby both the House and the Senate. These procedures are in place because \nour values as a nation dictate that we do what we can to protect \nchildren from violence and trafficking.\n  It saddens me that there are some who have even called for changing \nthis underlying protective law, presumably so we can just ship these \nchildren back to where they came from without the due process \nprotections this law affords. Of the thousands of children showing up \nat our doorstep, many of whom were at risk in the hands of criminal \nsmugglers during their trip, 40 percent of them are young girls. Many \nare under the age of 12 and have been sent on their own without the \nprotection of their parents or other family. These children aren't \ncoming here because of President Obama or Democrats or Republicans. \nThey are coming to our border because of the terrible violence and \nconditions they face in their home countries. In fact, there is a \ndirect correlation between growing violence in these home countries and \nthe increasing waves of children coming to the United States.\n  For example, many face join-or-die gang recruitment situations which \namount to forced conscription such as we saw with the child soldiers in \nother countries. They are subjected to sexual violence and brutality. \nIt is hard for someone from our country to imagine how severe this \nviolence is, but data from the United Nations offers some perspective.\n  The U.N. estimates that the murder rate in Honduras in 2012 was 30 \npercent\n\n[[Page S4312]]\n\nhigher than U.N. estimates of the civilian casualty rate at the height \nof the Iraq war. That is a staggering level of violence for any nation \nto endure. We all agree the current situation is unsustainable and \nneeds to be addressed, but simply sending children back into harm's way \nis not the answer. We should be working together to address the root \ncauses that are pushing these children to make these dangerous \njourneys.\n  I am proud to have worked with my colleague Senator Menendez, from \nwhom we just heard, to introduce a comprehensive plan to address this \nissue. That plan is a bit more complicated than simply rounding up \nchildren and shipping them out, but it is clear this crisis requires \naction on several fronts.\n  First, we should continue to crack down on human smuggling and \ncriminal activity in concert with the children's home countries. \nSecond, we have to honor our domestic and legal requirements related to \nthe treatment of children, refugees, and asylum seekers. This means \nsupporting the administration's efforts to provide humane treatment to \nthese children. Third, we have to redouble our efforts to support \npeace, economic growth, and social development in Central America.\n  I look forward to discussing more of the details of our plan with any \nof my colleagues who want to work together constructively to solve this \nproblem. Only by focusing on addressing the root cause of this crisis \ncan we truly address it.\n  The President has been managing a coordinated response to handle this \nvery difficult, heartbreaking situation. I hope we can work together to \nprovide adequate resources to professionals on the ground. We must also \ncontinue pressing for comprehensive immigration reform so our system \nwill not be so overwhelmed in times such as these.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, as you do now, I recently had the honor \nof presiding over this Chamber and had the opportunity in the hour I \njust finished presiding to listen to our colleagues as they have come \nto this floor, as you just have, Madam President, to speak to the \nhumanitarian crisis unfolding on the southern border of our country. \nAnd sadly--I think truly sadly--I have listened to a whole series of \nour Republican colleagues use this opportunity to line up on the floor \nand to whale upon our President and claim that this humanitarian crisis \nis his fault, that it is solely the fault of the President that there \nare tens of thousands of children coming to the American border \nunaccompanied, seeking refuge in this country, that it is solely his \nfault. It is tough to even know where to begin in responding to these \nsuggestions, but let me try. Let me start from my perspective as a \nmember of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  It is important first to remember that this is no ordinary issue of \nborder security or of immigration enforcement. This is a humanitarian \nand a refugee crisis. The tens of thousands of children--young \nchildren--presenting themselves alone at the border of the United \nStates are not dangerous criminals who threaten our national safety. \nThey are so often children who have traveled thousands of miles from \ntheir home countries at enormous risk and expense, and they have come \nnot because our border is wide open, not because it is unsecure. In \nfact, virtually all of them are being interdicted at the border by our \neffective border security. The challenge is that these children are \nbeing sent on these incredibly long and expensive and dangerous and \ndifficult trips in the first place.\n  Our Republican colleagues have suggested that this is solely caused \nby our President's lawlessness, that somehow either a law that was \nproposed and passed here in the Senate, a comprehensive immigration \nreform bill, or the President's deferred action program with regard to \nthose who are so-called DREAMers is what is causing this flood of child \nrefugees to this country.\n  But as has been said by other of our colleagues just in the last \nhour, neither of those two things--neither the comprehensive \nimmigration bill passed on a bipartisan basis by this Chamber nor the \ndeferred action program of the administration--would create really any \nlegal opportunity for these child refugees to stay in the United \nStates. Neither of them applies. In order to get access to the benefit \nand the opportunity to be in the United States under those two \nprovisions, you would have to have been here years ago. The problem is \nreally instability, violence, the tragic collapse of governance and \nsafety in three Central American countries.\n  If the magnet drawing thousands of refugees to this country were the \nactions or inactions of the President, would not we see a huge surge in \nrefugees from elsewhere in Central America, from Panama or from Belize \nor from Costa Rica or everyone closer to us from Mexico as well? But we \nhave not.\n  In the last 5 years child migrants from Mexico have stayed relatively \nflat, while children from the three countries that are the focus of \ncurrent violence--El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala--have surged out \nof control. In 2009 child migrants from those three countries made up \njust 17 percent of all the children trying to come across the American \nborder. This year, three-quarters are coming from El Salvador, \nHonduras, and Guatemala.\n  Why are they coming from these three countries? Why these three \ncountries?\n  Well, if you ask them, they will tell you. The United Nations High \nCommissioner for Refugees surveyed, last year, 404 child refugees and \nasked: Why have you made this long and dangerous and difficult trip to \nthe American border? Only 9 of 404 surveyed said because they believed \nthe U.S. would ``treat them well.'' More than half said they came out \nof fear because they were ``forcibly displaced.'' They are refugees, \nnot criminals.\n  We need to deal with the source of the problem in these three \ncountries, not make this a partisan game on the floor of this Chamber. \nI think the evidence is clear that these children are being sent on \nthis difficult, long, and expensive trip by their parents in \ndesperation--because they have no other choice. If they stay in their \nhome countries, the levels of violence, of gang activity, of murder \nhave skyrocketed off the charts. They are fleeing not just to America \nbut to Mexico, to Nicaragua, to Costa Rica as well. Children are \nfleeing the violence in these three countries in every direction--not \nbecause they are drawn by the magnet of some failure of immigration \npolicy here but because they are driven by the centrifugal force of \nviolence in these three countries. In fact, asylum applications from \nchildren are up by more than 700 percent in the countries of Mexico, \nPanama, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Belize--the countries immediately \naround these three that are at the very center of the violence.\n  It is my hope that with the emergency supplemental request submitted \nby the President, as we consider it and debate it in a hearing in the \nAppropriations Committee tomorrow and as we debate it here on the \nfloor, we will see more and more ways in which this emergency \nsupplemental provides resources needed to ensure that these children \nare given the fair hearing they are entitled to under the law--a law \nsigned by President Bush, passed unanimously by this Chamber; that we \nwill honor our international commitment and allow these children their \nday in court, and if they have no legitimate claim to refugee status, \nthey will be deported, but if they have a legitimate claim, that they \nare treated fairly.\n  Families and children are fleeing these Central American countries \nbecause conditions have become unbearable. Gangs, narcotics groups, and \ncorrupt officials have weakened security situations and created an \nenvironment where innocent civilians are targeted by gangs.\n  In Honduras, for example, as has been mentioned earlier today, in the \ncity of San Pedro Sula, the murder rate is four times higher, the \nchance of dying through murder is four times higher than faced by \nAmerican troops in the highest years of combat deaths in Iraq. It has \none of the highest murder rates on the planet.\n  In Guatemala, a weak government lacks the capacity to address \ninsecurity and poverty, and these forces continue to drive Guatemalans \nto flee and to send their children to seek some peace outside their \ncountry.\n\n  In El Salvador, after a failed truce, gangs have divided up territory \nand are\n\n[[Page S4313]]\n\nchallenging control of the state, while bringing violence into every \nneighborhood.\n  Despite these significant issues, we can and we should contribute and \ninvest more in partnership with these three countries to hold them \naccountable for delivering on stability for their citizens.\n  Visits by the Vice President, by the Secretary of State, and meetings \nwith the leaders of these three countries have laid out a path forward \nand a plan, and funding in this emergency supplemental will help \ncontribute to the prosecution of the coyotes and the criminal gangs who \nare profiting off of the trafficking of these children, to increasing \nthe capacity of these countries to receive back those children and \nadults who are being repatriated, and to leading a media campaign to \nmake sure parents understand that children sent to the United States \nare not automatically entitled to stay in the United States.\n  We have to strengthen our efforts to counter corruption, to hold \nthese governments accountable, and to assist in building stronger \nsecurity, judicial, and governing institutions in these three Central \nAmerican countries.\n  I am also a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate \nAppropriations Committee. From those seats, I know how important it is \nthat we make sure resources are available to our badly overstretched \nimmigration enforcement system. This provides additional resources for \nimmigration judges, for the Legal Orientation Program, and for \nproviding counsel to minors. As has been mentioned earlier today on \nthis floor, we have an international obligation, when children fleeing \nviolence present legitimate claims for refugee status, to make sure \nthey have their day in court before either repatriating them to their \ncountry of origin or allowing them refugee status here.\n  This emergency supplemental would increase the funding so there would \nnot be such an enormous backlog of cases, so there would be a Legal \nOrientation Program, which has a proven record of success. While it \ndoes not provide personal counsel to everyone awaiting trial, it gives \nout basic information so legitimate claims can be made and illegitimate \nclaims do not waste the time of our immigration courts.\n  Last, providing counsel to minor children it is a small portion of \nthis total supplemental, but if you have a child who is a victim of \nchild trafficking, who has a valid asylum claim, they have to be given \nthe opportunity to present a valid claim.\n  We already know funding in these areas is insufficient to meet this \nsurge in refugee minors seeking the relief of the American country and \ncourt system, and I think we have to do both: invest in ensuring \nstability in the three countries in Central America from which tens of \nthousands of children are fleeing and invest in ensuring that our \nborder security, our immigration courts, and the reasonable and \nappropriate process for separating out those who are legitimate \nrefugees from those who are seeking access to our country illegally is \ndone in a fair and an appropriate way.\n  A refugee crisis is not the time for us to abandon our laws or our \nvalues. It is the time for us to enforce and abide those laws--fairly \nand efficiently. To do so, I think, frankly, our best solution would be \nto have the House take up, consider, and pass the comprehensive \nimmigration bill, the bipartisan immigration bill that was taken up and \npassed by this Chamber over a year ago. Frankly, I think this crisis is \nin no small part because of a critical opportunity that we missed a \nyear ago to legislate in a responsible, bicameral, and bipartisan way \nto invest more in the border, to invest more in stabilizing the region, \nand to invest more in ensuring that we have the resources in our courts \nto deliver justice in this country appropriately.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                       Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, the matter before this Chamber is the \nsportsmen's bill. Most of us, including myself, support and encourage \nsportsmen and sportsmanship. This bill has many laudable provisions. \nAmong other provisions, it expands opportunities for sportsmen to use \nguns on Federal property with the encouragement of Federal law.\n  I voted in favor of this bill, in effect, when the issue was clotured \nalmost 2 years ago because I support sportsmen and think that Federal \nlaw should, in fact, encourage them. I voted against cloture just a few \ndays ago and I oppose this bill now because since that first vote, this \nNation has experienced the horrific and unspeakable horror of Sandy \nHook, coming after decades of horror and unspeakable violence resulting \nfrom the illegal use of guns and the illegal purchase of guns in this \nNation. There are too many guns illegally in the possession of \ncriminals and other people dangerous to themselves or others.\n\n  I have worked on this issue for decades, first as attorney general \nand now as a Senator. I cannot vote for this bill expanding the use of \nguns on Federal property with the encouragement of Federal law, so long \nas this great institution has done nothing--absolutely nothing--to make \nAmerica safer from the kind of carnage and killing that is epitomized \nby the terrible and unspeakable tragedy that occurred at Sandy Hook.\n  I have spoken often about that tragedy. I have continued to meet with \nthe loved ones of those 20 wonderful and beautiful children and 6 great \neducators. They are with me, as is the terrible tragedy of that day \nwhen I went to the firehouse where they learned for the first time that \ntheir loved ones would not be coming home. But I have stood also with \nloved ones from urban areas of Hartford, New Haven, and elsewhere from \nall other the country--victims of gun violence who perished \nunnecessarily and avoidably.\n  They are the survivors of this continuing carnage that just this past \nweekend took tens of victims from around the country, including many in \nChicago--as has been described so eloquently by Senator Durbin--and two \nalone in the east side of Bridgeport, CT, just this past weekend.\n  I have stood with the family of Lori Jackson, her mom and dad. She \nwas a young woman with two small children--twins--murdered by her \nestranged husband when he was under a restraining order, a temporary \nrestraining order, literally the day before a permanent one would go \ninto effect and he would have been barred under current law from \npossessing or buying a firearm of exactly the kind he used to kill her.\n  Lori Jackson's mom was almost killed. A bullet went through her jaw \nand part of her head. Another went through her arm. As she stood with \nme, she was still bandaged from that wound. They stood with me because \nthey want to save others from the terrible tragic fate that befell her \nthat early morning as she sought refuge in their home--her parent's \nhome--knowing her estranged husband was treacherously, dangerously, \nperilously, searching for her.\n  But the law could not protect her. Federal law was powerless to do it \nbecause of a loophole that, in effect, exempted temporary restraining \norders from the same protection that is provided to permanent \nrestraining orders. Yet we know from her experience and from so many \nothers that the initial period--those 10 days to 2 weeks when there is \na temporary order--are the most dangerous and perilous times to women \nand others who are threatened by their intimate partners, spouses or \nformer spouses. It is the most dangerous time because it is when the \nintimate partner, often the estranged husband, learns that she is \nleaving. It is over. She is seeking a divorce. She is taking the kids \nbecause it has become too dangerous. The threats have become too real \nand immediate.\n  That was Lori Jackson's situation. I have offered a bill to close the \nloophole that rendered Federal law useless to her. I called it the Lori \nJackson bill. I am offering an amendment that is identical to that \nlegislation I introduced with my great colleague and friend Senator \nMurphy, who has been a teammate in this effort against gun violence.\n  The Lori Jackson bill has nine other cosponsors: Senators Durbin, \nMurray, Boxer, Hirono, Warren, Markey, Baldwin, Menendez, and Kaine. \nThe identical amendment that I propose today is supported by Senators \nMurphy, Durbin, Markey, Warren, Markey, Feinstein, Hirono, and Boxer.\n\n[[Page S4314]]\n\n  Lori Jackson was so brave. There is really no other word for it. She \nwas brave, courageous, resolute, and strong--trying to escape the cycle \nof domestic violence which is a scourge across this country. We must \ncontinue the effort to fight domestic violence. But we know that a \nwoman who is a victim of domestic violence is five times more likely to \ndie if there is a gun in the house.\n  In her name and her memory, so that her legacy will be one of hope \nand courage, I offer this amendment to the sportsmen's bill. Let us do \nsomething to make the Lori Jacksons of America safer from gun violence, \nif we are going to expand the use and opportunity for guns on Federal \nproperty or under Federal law. Because it is Federal law that failed to \nprotect them now--a simple loophole, that a modest change can close. \nLet's do it in her name and in the name of Jasmine Leonard, who also \nhad a temporary protection order against her husband and who died at \nhis hand; Chyna Joy Young, who celebrated her 18th birthday just days \nbefore she was shot and killed by her estranged boyfriend; Barbara \nDiane Dye, who was granted a temporary restraining order and then fled \nto safety in Texas, returning only for a hearing on the permanent \nrestraining order when her husband cornered her in a parking lot, and \nshot her repeatedly with a .357 Magnum revolver, killing her--and in \nthe name of all of the other victims of domestic violence whom we can \nprotect with this sensible, commonsense, modest measure that offers \nthem some protection. I know that this amendment and the others that I \nsupported offered by my colleagues such as that of Senator Durbin, who \nhas been such a steadfast champion, and Senator Feinstein, who likewise \nspearheaded this cause well before I came here, while I was attorney \ngeneral working in the State of Connecticut on this cause.\n  I know that this measure will not alone solve the problems of gun \nviolence in this country. But it is a step. It will save some women and \nmen who may be victims of domestic violence. It is to be regarded as a \ncompanion to legislation proposed by Senator Klobuchar--very important \nlegislation that I support as well, to prevent stalkers from accessing \nfirearms. These kinds of measures are steps in the right direction. We \nshould take those steps, put them first, and give safety the priority \nit deserves before we create more opportunities, and expand more access \nto Federal land for the use of guns. Gun safety should come first. We \ncan send that message but also very practically and really help save \nlives, injuries, and dollars.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I know we have some other colleagues on the way down to \nthe floor to speak, so I will be brief. I just want to join Senator \nBlumenthal and thank him for his tremendous leadership, as he noted, \ngoing back to his days as Connecticut's attorney general and now as a \nmember of the Judiciary Committee. There have been few people in this \ncountry, frankly, who have led more on taking on the fight against gun \nviolence, especially when it comes to protecting victims of domestic \nviolence, than Senator Blumenthal. I am proud to join him in offering \nthis amendment.\n  After being married for a number of years, Zina Daniel and her \nhusband Radcliffe Haughton became estranged. In October of 2012 she got \na restraining order against him, telling a court that he had slashed \nher tires and had threatened to throw acid in her face and burn her and \nher family with gas.\n  She told the court that his threats against her terrorized her every \nwaking moment. She got a permanent restraining order, but even that \npermanent restraining order was not enough. He went on line--her \nestranged husband--went around our background check system, as is \ncurrently part of Federal law, and posted a ``want to buy'' ad on \nArmslist, one of the biggest online marketers of firearms. Within hours \nhe found a seller. He bought a Glock handgun for $500 cash in a \nMcDonald's parking lot. There was no background check. There were no \nquestions asked by our seller. It was a simple transaction that was \nallowed because of our lax gun laws.\n  The next day he stormed into the Brookfield, WI, spa where his \nestranged wife worked and he murdered her and two other women. He \ninjured four others and then he killed himself. This story is a caution \nboth about our laws that protect victims of domestic violence but then \nalso our unreasonable laws right now around how we conduct background \nchecks in this country.\n  He was prevented from going into a store and buying a handgun only \nbecause Zina had gotten a permanent restraining order. But had she had \na temporary restraining order, there would have been no such \nprotection. That is what the amendment Senator Blumenthal and I have \nwill cure. It will give spouses, girlfriends, partners, protection \nduring that moment of intense rage right when the husband is expelled \nfrom the house for violence, when that temporary restraining order is \nbeing taken out.\n  But this story also tells us that we have miles to go when it comes \nto the other protections that are necessary to reduce the incidents of \ngun violence. In this case she had one protection surrounding the \npermanent restraining order, but because we do not require background \nchecks for online purchases, her husband was able to buy a gun within a \nday and go and murder her and two others.\n  If we had background checks required for online purchases, it is \nlikely that Zina Daniel and her two coworkers would still be alive \ntoday. So that is why we are on the floor today. Senator Blumenthal and \nI and many others of our colleagues believe that if we are going to \nhave a weeklong debate about guns, we should be talking about what \nactions are actually going to reduce the epidemic rates of gun violence \nacross this country, in particular the epidemic rates of gun violence \nwhen it comes to people who are victims of domestic abuse.\n  Senator Blumenthal probably covered the landscape in terms of the \nstatistics.\n  But it is pretty stunning the risks that women in particular are put \nin when their spouse has easy access to a firearm. Abused women are \nfive times more likely to be killed by their abuser if their abuser \nowns a firearm, and one of the few moments we can prevent that abuser \nfrom obtaining that firearm is when the court gets involved at that \nmoment of separation between the wife and the husband, between the \nabused and the abuser, that moment of the temporary restraining order.\n  Senator Blumenthal and I think this is an amendment that could get \nbroad bipartisan support. I wish we could get 60 votes for background \nchecks, but I am realistic that it is not likely that five minds have \nchanged since the last time we took this vote.\n  But just as we came together after a period of disagreement to pass \nthe Violence Against Women Act, we can certainly make the decision that \nin those limited circumstances, during those limited days of a \ntemporary restraining order, that abuser shouldn't be able to go out \nand buy a weapon.\n  Our amendment builds in protections so that this isn't a denial of \ndue process; that the judge actually has to make a finding that there \nis a threat of violence. Those are fairly limited circumstances, but if \nthis amendment is passed, we will save lives.\n  Senator Blumenthal closed, and I will close in the same vein, by \nnoting that while this amendment will save lives, it is not going to \ndramatically change the reality in this country, which is 80-plus \npeople killed every day by guns. But everybody has a role to play in \ntrying to reduce the rates of gun violence.\n  A young man in New Haven, CT, by the name of Doug Bethea, lost a \nclose friend of his this summer, a 16-year-old boy named Torrence \nGamble, whom he saw at a funeral for another friend of theirs who had \nbeen killed by gun violence. Torrence said he wanted to get off the \nstreets and start setting his life straight.\n  He wanted to set up a time to meet with his friend Doug Bethea to try \nto find a way out. It was only a couple of days after saying, ``Doug, \ndon't forget about me''--in fact, the very next day--that Torrance was \nshot in his head and died of his injuries at Yale-New Haven Hospital.\n  So Doug decided to do something about it, and he spent the summer \ngoing out bringing information to house-to-house to tell families and \nkids\n\n[[Page S4315]]\n\nin New Haven about their options to get off the streets, to do \nsomething productive with their time this summer, all of the rec \nleagues, arts programs, and dance programs that kids can invest \npositive energy in.\n  Target did their part a couple weeks ago by asking their customers to \nrefrain from bringing guns onto their property, and we can do our part \nthis week. If we are going to talk about guns this week, let's make \nsure we do something that reduces the rates of gun violence all across \nthis country. This is a commonsense amendment, an amendment I am sure \ncan gain broad bipartisan support. We hope we can do our part this week \nto try to stem the plague and scourge of gun violence on the streets of \nAmerica.\n\n\n                       BIPARTISAN SPORTSMEN'S ACT\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I support S. 2363, the Bipartisan \nSportsmen's Act of 2014. I am pleased to join 45 of my colleagues--23 \nRepublicans and 23 Democrats in total--as a cosponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  This package of bills supports a variety of important conservation \npriorities while protecting access to public lands for hunters and \nanglers. It reauthorizes annual funding for the National Fish and \nWildlife Foundation and the North American Wetlands Conservation Act, \ntwo public-private matching grant programs that have provided wildlife \nhabitat, flood protection, and land and water conservation benefits \nacross Virginia. For instance, National Fish and Wildlife Foundation \nChesapeake Stewardship Grants leverage annual Federal support with \nprivate funds for projects that incur agricultural, stormwater, and \nhabitation restoration benefits in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. In \n2013, Virginia received $2.5 million for 12 projects throughout its \nportion of the watershed.\n  I have long supported measures to conserve open space in Virginia. \nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, 3.3 million people participate in \nhunting, fishing, and wildlife-watching in the Commonwealth. As \nGovernor, one of my proudest environmental achievements was meeting an \nambitious goal of preserving 400,000 acres for recreation and \nconservation by the end of my 4-year term.\n  While I am an avid hiker and outdoorsman, conservation is not just \nimportant to me for the intrinsic enjoyment of Virginia's beautiful \nlands and waters. Conservation is also good for business. According to \nthe Outdoor Industry Association, outdoor recreation generates $13.6 \nbillion in consumer spending, 138,000 jobs, $3.9 billion in wages and \nsalaries, and $923 million in State and local tax revenue in Virginia \nevery year.\n  It is no small feat to put together a bill supported by nearly half \nthe U.S. Senate in equal partisan proportion. I encourage my colleagues \nto support this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Washington State \nis recognized.\n\n\n                         The Export-Import Bank\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I appreciate the comments made by the Senator from \nConnecticut, and I come to the floor to talk about a very important \nissue, U.S. manufacturing jobs and what the Senate needs to do to make \nsure we are protecting U.S. manufacturing jobs.\n  I am speaking of the need to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, a \ncredit agency that helps U.S. manufacturers and small businesses sell \ntheir products to overseas markets.\n  Some of you may have read recently comments by some of our colleagues \nwhere they have shifted their position. The agency is set to expire on \nSeptember 30 of this year, and it is so critical that we reauthorize \nthis program because it is such an important tool for U.S. \nmanufacturers.\n  Over the last few weeks, fringe organizations and activists have \nsuddenly tried to turn this into a political casualty, saying we should \nkill the program, and I am here to advocate that it is a win-win \nsituation for American manufacturers, for American taxpayers, and for \nthe jobs it creates. That is because the Export-Import Bank supports \nabout 1.2 million jobs, it returned $1 billion to the U.S. Treasury \nlast year alone, and it supports between 35,000 suppliers of \nmanufactured parts, and that was just in the year 2011. As this chart \nshows, the Export-Import Bank helps us generate export sales and \nsupports 1.2 million jobs. That is between 2009 and 2013.\n  One would think a program that doesn't cost the taxpayers any money, \nactually helps us pay down the deficit, helps create that many export \nsales and that many jobs would be something we would want to \nreauthorize and give predictability to businesses all across the United \nStates.\n  In fact, if the credit agency is not reauthorized, nearly 90 percent \nof the companies that would be harmed are small businesses. Sure, there \nare big companies such as Boeing or General Electric or Caterpillar \nthat help sell products around the globe, and some of my colleagues \nwant to criticize that somehow we should be apologizing for the fact \nthat we actually make expensive products and sell them.\n  I am quite proud that we sell products from the United States to \nChina and various parts all around the globe that are actually \nexpensive products. We should be proud we are making something worth \nmillions of dollars that people want to buy. So I am glad that ``Made \nIn the USA'' is actually closing deals all across the globe.\n  Today we also want to highlight that all of these companies that are \nin the manufacturing sector are part of a manufacturing chain. We know \nthis well, because in the State of Washington, when we look at who \nmakes aerospace products, while we can say there is a company in \nEverett, WA, named Boeing, there are hundreds of companies, thousands \nof companies across the United States that are part of what is called \nthe supply chain.\n  Behind every 777 or Caterpillar tractor there are thousands of \nworkers who are working every day to refine their product, stay \ncompetitive, retrain, and refocus to make sure we build the very best \nproducts in the United States and that we are competing on a global \nbasis.\n  When these larger companies and small businesses they work with try \nto win deals overseas, they run into lots of different challenges. That \nis why we are here today to say making sure we reauthorize this program \nis critically important to small business manufacturers and suppliers \nthroughout the United States.\n  So with all of these small businesses and companies--30,000 to 35,000 \ncompanies across the United States--there is actually a supplier in \nevery State in the United States, but let's look at some of the \nnumbers.\n  In Georgia, there are over 833 different companies, such as United \nSeal and Rubber Company and other important companies, that make \nproducts just for aviation or for Caterpillar or for other products.\n  In the State of Florida, there are over 1,252 different small \nbusinesses and manufacturers that are helping to produce products that \nare sold on an international basis, and those companies want the \nExport-Import Bank reauthorized.\n  In the State of Wisconsin, there are over 1,397 different suppliers, \nsuch as Hentzen Coatings in Milwaukee, which provides primer, sealer, \nand wing coating. These are companies that also want to see the \nreauthorization of this important tool that helps products they help \nmanufacture and build be sold in international markets.\n  Of course, there are places, such as Texas, which have a lot of \npeople in the supply chain. Here are just some of the companies that \nare involved in manufacturing that take advantage of this important \nexport-created agency by building products into final assembly. They \nare all over the State of Texas.\n  In fact, here is another continued list of these companies from Texas \nthat are part of building products that are then using the Export-\nImport Bank to sell their products around the globe. But we can't go \nover all of those in Texas because there are actually 4,355 different \ncompanies in the State of Texas that are involved in the supply chain \nof companies that are selling products through the export credit agency \nand its assistance.\n  So we can see this is not a program that just affects one State or \none region; it is an example of small business manufacturers working \neverywhere to stay competitive, to sell products, and win in the \ninternational marketplace.\n  Personally, having visited many of these companies in the State of \nWashington, I find it very frustrating, as\n\n[[Page S4316]]\n\nthese people are working night and day to make the best airplanes, to \nmake the best manufactured product, to take the risk to go and sell in \noverseas markets, to compete with international competitors, to retrain \nand reskill a workforce, that we have people in Congress who don't have \nthe good common sense to understand what an important tool the Export-\nImport Bank is in helping U.S. manufacturers sell into new emerging \nmarkets.\n  I know there are other States--we are not going to show charts about \nthem--but in Ohio--I know the Presiding Officer is from Ohio--there are \nover 1,700 suppliers.\n  These companies are companies such as Hartzell Propeller. They are a \nfamily-owned propeller manufacturer in Southwest Ohio. Hartzell is part \nof the Dayton aviation economy that dates back to the Wright brothers. \nIn fact, it was Orville Wright who suggested that the Hartzell family \nbuild an airplane propeller.\n\n  Today the Wright brothers are gone, but this company is still here \nand they are still innovating. In fact, I think they are part of the \nspirit of innovation in America that makes it so great.\n  I am so frustrated that people here don't understand that innovative \nspirit, don't understand what it takes, don't understand that they are \nhampering--truly right now almost torturing--small businesses by not \ngiving them the certainty and predictability for the export assistance \nprogram.\n  This company builds crop-dusting plane propellers. Hartzell has grown \nits company from about 13 to about 300 people in the last 3 years, and \nthat is because these crop-dusting planes have been sold using the \nExport-Import Bank. The loans haven't come directly to Hartzell as part \nof the Ex-Im supply chain, but companies similar to them that make \nthese propellers are important companies to making sure we win in the \ninternational marketplace.\n  The President of this company, Joe Hartzell, I thought said it best. \nHe said:\n\n       If you take Ex-Im away from my customers, you might as well \n     bring unemployment checks to their offices, because you're \n     going to put people on the street. If they're not building as \n     many airplanes, then I'm going to have a jobs problem.\n\n  Here is a manufacturer--I heard the same thing in Seattle a few weeks \nago when I was there--a company in Ohio saying if we don't get this \nprogram reauthorized, we are going to have bigger problems. So people \nsuch as Hartzell are trying to tell everyone here we need to keep \nworking to make sure we get this reauthorized.\n  We need to make sure companies throughout the Midwest, such as in \nWichita, KS, or people in the West, such as in Tempe, AZ, or companies \nin Irving, TX, everywhere where we are part of this huge supply chain, \nare doing the work we need to do.\n  Another area that is big on the supply chain is in the general area \nof aviation, and it supports over 200,000 jobs. So 200,000 jobs \nrepresents the number of people who are involved in aviation today, and \nthose are individuals, businesses that are doing their best to stay \ncompetitive in aviation, even though we have incredible competition.\n  This incredible competition comes from the fact that there are so \nmany different companies around the globe that also want to build \nairplanes. There is a demand for 35,000 new airplanes over the next 20 \nyears. So we can imagine every country wants to try to build airplanes. \nChina wants to build airplanes. Brazil is already in the business, \nCanada, the Europeans. Everybody wants to build airplanes.\n  The good news for us is we actually have a supply chain in the United \nStates, and this chart represents that supply chain of 15,000 \nmanufacturers and over 1.5 million jobs.\n  These are all companies throughout the United States of America who \nare involved in using the Export-Import Bank to make sure their \nproducts are sold on an international basis. There are actually jobs in \ncompanies in every State of the Union that take advantage of being part \nof this supply chain.\n  And why it is so important to keep the supply chain? Because if you \nkeep the supply chain in your country, then you have the skill set it \ntakes to keep innovating, because each of these companies is working on \nthe individual parts and making them the best they can possibly be. \nThat way we get the efficient airplane of today. This innovation is \ntaking place all across the country, and we have to stay competitive.\n  Now, get rid of the Export-Import Bank and over time this supply \nchain will start to disappear. Why? Because in Europe they will still \nhave an Export-Import Bank, and companies such as Airbus will continue \nto use that product and they will have a supply chain, and over time \nall these small businesses and all this expertise in aviation will move \nout of the United States of America to somewhere else. Then what \nmanufacturing jobs will we have in the United States?\n  Aviation is one of the best sectors for manufacturing that we have \ntoday. With over 1.5 million employees, we need to keep aviation \nmanufacturing competitive in the United States of America. That is why \nwe need to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank.\n  There are other sectors of aviation, such as Gulfstream, which is \nanother company, based in Savannah, GA, and has been one of the \nforemost makers of business jets. They have watched their international \ncompetition increase steadily over the last decade, and the Export-\nImport Bank has helped them be competitive. The Gulfstream supply chain \nhas about 3,500 different businesses and about 13,000 employees, and \nall those employees are working hard to try to stay competitive. They \nare working to make sure we keep those jobs in the United States of \nAmerica. But they also have to have the Export-Import Bank so they can \nthen continue to win in the international marketplace. Gulfstream \nactually sells product to China. So jobs in Georgia and throughout the \nsupply chain are helping us win in the international marketplace.\n  Whether they are composite companies or light industrial or fuselage \nskins, all of these things are helping people be competitive.\n  Right now, Gulfstream and the supply chain has sold 8,000 planes to \nChina. That helped support 2,100 jobs, and most of those jobs were \nright in the Savannah, GA, area. So if we are going to cancel the \nExport-Import Bank, how are they going to get these products financed \nand how are they going to get them sold?\n  While we are very appreciative of both sectors of aviation--the \ncommercial sector and general aviation sector, and we haven't even \ntalked about the others, such as the defense sectors of aviation--these \nare two big components to our economy. Some people might think, well, \nthere is a way to get these planes sold, or these are big companies, \nthese are integral parts to our U.S. manufacturing base, and we need to \nkeep it. The demand of the United States, as I said earlier, is for \n35,000 new planes over the next 20 years, and 80 percent of those \nplanes will be delivered outside of the United States. That means if we \nwant to keep winning the race for airplane sales, we are going to have \nto work outside the United States.\n  Yesterday, Standard & Poor's reported that if the Export-Import Bank \nis not reauthorized, it would be a huge benefit to Airbus. In fact, \nthey said:\n\n       . . . Airbus would still be able to offer . . . financing, \n     and this could be a deciding factor for some new aircraft \n     contracts, especially in emerging markets and for sales to \n     start-up or financially weak airlines.\n\n  In other words, we would be sending U.S. jobs overseas, and that is \nnot what we want to do. Countries are building up their investment to \ntry to compete with us, and the Export-Import Bank is a key tool for \nU.S. manufacturers to compete.\n  Trade is a critically important part of our economy. In 2013, U.S. \nexports reached $2.3 trillion worth of goods, and a key part of that \nexport growth can be attributed to this program. The Export-Import Bank \nsupported $37.4 billion worth of U.S. exports which supported over \n200,000 jobs in the United States. That alone is enough information for \nme to say the Senate ought to act quickly to reauthorize this program.\n  There are many other aspects of the Export-Import Bank that help \nsmall businesses and manufacturing. In fact, there are about 12 million \nmanufacturing jobs in the United States, and 1 in 4 jobs is tied to \nexports. That is why, when I think my colleagues try to portray the \nExport-Import Bank as an issue that maybe a few big companies\n\n[[Page S4317]]\n\nwould benefit from, I think they have it totally wrong. This is an \nissue about the competitive nature of manufacturing and the supply \nchain of manufacturers all across the United States, and whether we \nwant to keep manufacturing jobs--because they are high-wage, high-\nskilled jobs--in the United States.\n  While my colleagues would like to talk about other things in the \neconomy, I think it is important to realize how manufacturing jobs are \na higher wage. They are a higher wage than service-sector jobs, they \nhelp stabilize the middle class, they help the U.S. economy grow \nbecause of those large export numbers, and they help the United States \ncontinue to innovate and stay ahead in a global marketplace. All \nof these are reasons why the Export-Import Bank is such a viable tool.\n\n  Think about it from the perspective of being a critical part of \nmanufacturing, and these are the high-wage jobs and it supports that \nsupply chain I just went through. Then we can see why it is so \nimportant that this get done before the end of September.\n  Right now, what is happening is my colleagues not only want to \nthreaten to not reauthorize this program, they actually want to kill \nit. My guess is they would like to say: OK, we will agree to a short-\nterm extension of a few months, only in hopes of killing it later.\n  I want to make sure all my colleagues know how important it is not \nonly that we reauthorize this, but we reauthorize it for several years \nso companies have the predictability and certainty to know the program \nis going to be there and they have the support.\n  The Export-Import Bank has four primary tools. It has loan guarantees \nthat provide security to commercial lenders who make loans to foreign \nbuyers of American products. For example, the loan helped Goss \nInternational in New Hampshire sell their printing presses in emerging \nmarkets in Brazil.\n  We have export credit insurance, and companies such as Manhasset in \nYakima, in my State of Washington, used it to help get their music \nstands sold across the globe and make sure there was credit insurance \nto protect them.\n  There are loan programs, for example, to help foreign buyers of U.S. \nproducts such as FirmGreen in Newport Beach, CA, which is run by a \ndisabled veteran who helped to sell their goods in Brazil.\n  It also provides working capital like in Morrison Technologies \nmanufacturing in South Carolina which used the tools to purchase \nmaterials needed for a recent surge in business that couldn't have been \nmet without that financing.\n  So here they are, all these companies throughout the country using \nthe Export-Import Bank and staying competitive. I personally would make \nthe Export-Import Bank bigger. When we look at what China is doing or \nwhat Europe is doing, they are making a bigger financial investment in \nhelping their businesses become exporters.\n  In the United States, the Export-Import Bank finances less than 5 \npercent of U.S. exports. A significant portion of the capital of \nexports is done in the private sector, but this tool helps commercial \nbanks and helps commercial manufacturers get their product when other \navenues aren't available in the private sector.\n  Here is an example of one of the programs and how the Export-Import \nBank works. We can see the U.S. exporter sells to the foreign buyer and \nthat commercial financing is still part of the equation. The Export-\nImport Bank is only used as a safety net to make sure that financial \ncommercial obligation is secure in this situation. So it is not as if \nwe are replacing commercial banking, it is not as if we aren't even \nmaking market rates. We are for products such as aerospace.\n  The issue is, we need to make sure commercial banks are willing to \nguarantee these kinds of sales. We are providing a safety net with the \nExport-Import Bank. And what has the cost been to the U.S. Government? \nWell, we have had incredible success, because everybody pays fees into \nthis system, and those fees and the success of the program has helped \nus pay down the Federal deficit. That is right; it has actually made \nmoney for U.S. taxpayers and helped us pay down the Federal deficit.\n  It supports 1.2 million export-related jobs, it has helped support \n$37 billion in exports from the United States, which helps our economy, \nand it has returned more than $1 billion to U.S. taxpayers. I would \ncall that a win-win situation for American jobs and American taxpayers.\n  We have 73 days left until that program expires. I don't want to let \nthat happen. So today we are announcing that over 200 different supply \nchain companies are sending a letter to the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives asking them to urgently support the reauthorization of \nthe Export-Import Bank.\n  We are also hearing from lots of businesses and business \norganizations that also support the immediate reauthorization: the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the \nBusiness Roundtable, National Association of Businesses, the \nInternational Association of Machinists, National Grain and Feed \nAssociation, and many more organizations. All of them want to be able \nto say ``Made in the USA,'' and have their products sold overseas.\n  I hope my colleagues will be there to help ensure this program gets \nreauthorized in a short amount of time. I personally hope the Senate \nwill take up this legislation in the next few weeks before we adjourn \nfor the August recess. I would hate to see what happens to all the \nbusiness deals these manufacturers have on the table if they go home in \nAugust and people are saying: Well, the bank only has a few days left \nto be reauthorized; I am not going to do business with you until I \nknow. Or if somebody tries to stick a 5-month reauthorization on some \nbill, and then everybody still says: When is this program going to be \nreauthorized? Otherwise, I am not going to do a deal with U.S. \nmanufacturers.\n  Of all the things we are doing in sending a message to the actual \ncompetitors of creating jobs in today's economy, why are we sending \nsuch a message of uncertainty in this situation? These are real jobs in \na marketplace that is growing.\n  The middle class is going to grow from about 2.3 billion to about 5 \nbillion people outside the United States over the next 15 years. We are \ngoing to see a doubling of the middle class. That is where products are \ngoing to be sold in emerging markets. Those emerging markets don't all \nhave the financial tools to make those deals a reality, but the Export-\nImport Bank can help. They can help make sure a customer pays, that \nU.S. manufacturing wins, and that we keep our marketplace.\n  We hope all our colleagues will support this legislation. Time is \nrunning out. Know that this program has returned over $1 billion to the \nU.S. Treasury. That is a pretty good deal for us. If somebody on the \nother side has a better way of growing jobs and paying down the Federal \ndeficit, I would like to hear it, because this is an important tool, \nand time is running out. I urge my colleagues to help support the \nExport-Import Bank.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from companies asking to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, \nand I yield the floor.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     July 9, 2014.\n     Hon. John A. Boehner,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner, Leader Reid, Leader Pelosi and Leader \n     McConnell: We are writing today to ask you to reauthorize the \n     Export-Import Bank without further delay. The Export-Import \n     Bank is absolutely essential to our companies. While many of \n     us don't access the Bank's services directly, our customers \n     do. We sell goods and services of all kinds to American \n     businesses that rely on the Export-Import Bank to sell their \n     products abroad.\n       Recent reports on the uncertainty of the Bank's future may \n     have already impacted sales, which can negatively impact our \n     bottom line. Our customers need the certainty of export \n     credit to successfully pursue many of their commercial sales \n     abroad. The ongoing defense budget uncertainty compounds this \n     threat for many of our companies with commercial and defense \n     customers.\n\n[[Page S4318]]\n\n       Reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank should not be a \n     partisan political game. Until recently, it never has been. \n     In fact, the Bank has been reauthorized more than a dozen \n     times, and recently it was reauthorized with broad bipartisan \n     support. Reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank also helps \n     reduce the deficit. The Bank earns money on its fees and \n     interest, and last year returned over one billion dollars to \n     the U.S. Treasury.

The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                            EPA Rule Changes\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few minutes about the \nEPA rules on water. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy is in Missouri \ntoday to discuss the EPA's proposed rule which would significantly \nexpand the authority of the United States under the Clean Water Act.\n  In a conference call with reporters yesterday, Administrator McCarthy \ncalled some of the questions about the rule ``silly'' and ``ludicrous'' \nand said that her trip to Missouri was part of a broader campaign to \nreassure the agricultural community and set the record straight. I hope \nshe is spending at least as much time in my State listening as she is \ntalking. If she does that she will find out that some of these concerns \nare very real but they have lots of impact and not just for the farm \ncommunity across the country but for lots of people who are affected in \nlots of different ways by what happens if you expand the authority of \nthe Federal Government as this rule would to deal with water almost \neverywhere and almost all water.\n  Not only did she say that these questions were silly and ludicrous, \nbut the Missouri farm bureau expressed the concern that ``virtually \nevery acre of private property potentially falls under the Clean Water \nAct jurisdiction. . . . Things that you normally do on a farm would be \ncalled into question.'' According to the Springfield News-Leader, \n``McCarthy says that's hog wash.''\n  If the way to actually deal with the people we work for is to say \nyour ideas are silly, they are ludicrous, and your comments are hog \nwash, I think once\n\n[[Page S4319]]\n\nagain we are certainly seeing the Federal Government at its worst, not \nat its best.\n  This is a big organization. It is a well-run organization. It has \nrepresented Missouri's agricultural interests for a long time. There \nare folks who stand and say virtually every acre of private property \npotentially falls under the Clean Water Act jurisdiction if this rule \nis finalized, and at least 40 members of this body believe that to be \nthe case. That is what they said, and she said it was hog wash. \nAccording to the paper, she rattled off what she said were ``some of \nthe most dubious claims made by the rule's critics.''\n  This is a rule which has critics because it is a rule that deserves \nto have critics. It draws concerns from farmers. In fact, just today I \nsaid: Before I come over, let's be sure I know that we haven't had an \nepiphany of understanding here and suddenly Administrator McCarthy \nsaid: I have listened and you are right. These are problems to which we \nneed to find the answers.\n  But what I found when I looked was that the farmers she met with \ntoday--there was no press in the meeting that included the farmers and \nthere were no farmers in the meeting that included the press. So farm \nfamilies were concerned that when you take the press out, away from \neverybody else, and you go out on this farm and talk about--I assume--\nall the great benefits that more Federal control of that farmland would \nproduce, but then when you have a meeting with the farmers, no press is \nin that meeting where anybody can hear the concerns that these farmers \nhave.\n  I think the Members of the Senate have been pretty clear as we \ncosponsored bills that would require the EPA to withdraw this rule and \ntry again. It is clear that this is really a blatant overreach into the \nprivate lives and private property rights of the American people by the \nadministration--and not just farmers but anybody who owns land \nanywhere. If I were just hearing from farmers, I would be concerned, \nbut I am hearing from farmers, I am hearing from builders, I am hearing \nfrom realtors, I am hearing from local governments: What happens if the \nFederal Government has this most broad definition of waters of the \nUnited States?\n  The proposed rule would give the EPA, the Corps of Engineers, the \nmost extreme of environmental groups a powerful tool to delay almost \nanything to prevent development, to prevent land use on property owned \nby municipalities, property owned by individuals, property owned by \nfarming families and by small businesses, because all that property \nincludes water in some way or another.\n  The law was clear when it was written that the EPA under the Clean \nWater Act would have authority ``over the navigable waters of the \nUnited States.'' This rule, in fact, makes the jurisdictional assertion \nthat navigable waters now means ``any water that could go into \nnavigable waters.'' Any water that could eventually flow into the \nMissouri River, the Mississippi River, the Ohio River, the Gulf of \nMexico, the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean and all water everywhere, \neventually some of it heads to those places. So every drop of water \neverywhere is potentially under the jurisdiction of the EPA.\n  Navigable waters means what it means.\n  There was an editorial today in the Washington Post which actually \nsupported the rule, but I thought the most interesting sentence in that \neditorial today that supports the rule was right in almost the exact \nmiddle of the editorial. It said: ``It's true that the agency's plan \nwould expand the scope of the Clean Water Act regulation.'' Now, the \nway it expands the scope of the Clean Water Act regulation is it \nexpands the scope of the Clean Water Act.\n  We actually have a procedure for that. It is the procedure that \neverybody who took a civics class learned when they took that civics \nclass. The House passes a bill or the Senate passes a bill. The two \ncome together. I know this doesn't happen as often as it needs to \nanymore, but that is not the way it has to happen. The two come \ntogether. They agree on a bill. It goes back to both Houses. They vote \non that bill one final time. It goes to the President's desk and gets \nsigned into law. That is how you expand the Clean Water Act.\n  You don't expand the Clean Water Act by somebody saying: You know, we \njust really think that the Congress should have done something here \nthat they didn't do, and so we are going to do it. Then your friends \nwho actually support the goal are so lulled into the idea that the \ngovernment won't work that they even forget the constitutional process \nand say: Well, there is no question; the truth is this expands the \nregulations under the Clean Water Act.\n\n  If you ask anybody at the Washington Post or anybody else that uses \nwords all the time to define navigable waters of the United States, \nnobody would say that is any water that flows into any water that might \neventually flow into water that you can navigate. Nobody would say \nthat. Nobody would say those are the navigable waters of the United \nStates. But that is the authority that the EPA has.\n  Now we are talking about the authority the EPA would like to take. \nThat is why I and a number of my colleagues--I think 29 of us--joined \nSenator Barrasso in a bill that would say you can't do this. We are \ngoing to protect the water and property rights and stop the EPA from \ngoing beyond the wall.\n  Senator Barrasso is also going to file that as an amendment that I \nintend to support on the bill before us now, the sportsmen's act. That \nhas lots of water implications, many of which I have supported--the \nwetlands act. There are many things in there that I can be supportive \nof, but I am not supportive without any congressional authority of the \nEPA's deciding they are just going to take property rights from people \nwho have those rights. I am particularly not supportive of that when \nthe law was designed to define what the EPA could do.\n  If anybody wants to go out and do any kind of survey of the American \npeople--let alone the legislators who voted for the Clean Water Act--\nand ask what ``navigable waters'' is, nobody thinks that is every drop \nof water that eventually flows to a source that could at some point in \nthe distant distance be navigable.\n  We know what the law says. We know the authority the EPA has been \ngiven. I think we can have a legitimate debate about whether that \nauthority has been properly used or not. But there is no legitimate \ndebate about whether the EPA is trying to go way beyond what the \nCongress has authorized.\n  This idea the administration has that the pen and the phone will \nreplace the Constitution of the United States is not worthy of this \ncountry. It not worthy of what we do. It is a disastrous course to set, \nto believe: OK, Congress, you deal with immigration for the next 60 \ndays or I will just do it on my own. Congress, you change the Clean \nWater Act or we will just change the Clean Water Act with regulation. \nCongress, you change the Clean Air Act or we will change the Clean Air \nAct.\n  There is a reason for the constitutional process, and I hope \nMissourians in the next 24 hours are given the chance to remind \nAdministrator McCarthy of what that reason is. And there are reasons \nthat the Congress is looking for ways to remind the President of what \nthat is. That is why I am supporting the Enforcement Law Act that has \nalready passed the House of Representatives. What the Enforcement Law \nAct would do is give individual Members of Congress standing if a \nmajority of either House of the Congress believes the President wasn't \nenforcing the law as written to go to a court and ask the court to \ndecide if the President is enforcing the law as written.\n  In my view there is no way in the world that you could look at this \nproposed rule by the EPA and believe that the EPA and this \nadministration is in any way complying with what is the clear intent of \nthe law. If they don't like the law, there is a way to come to the \nCongress and ask it to change the law. That is their job. It is not \ntheir job to do the job of the Congress. That job the Constitution left \nto somebody besides the Executive, whose job it is to execute the law--\nnot to improve on the law, not to write the law, not to make the law. \nAnd we see all those things being attempted by people who believe they \nknow what is better for the United States of America than the people of \nthe United States believe is good for the United States of America.\n  I would yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S4320]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in a \nvery important discussion with regard to the waters of the United \nStates and the proposed rule by the EPA.\n  The good Senator from Missouri, I, a Senator from Wyoming and--as has \nbeen already said on the floor--about 30 of us in total are proposing \nan amendment to the sportsmen's bill which is currently under \nconsideration on the floor--an amendment that would address the \nregulatory overreach by the EPA and, specifically, their proposed \nwaters of the U.S. regulation.\n  The amendment we have is very simple, very straightforward. It is \nrelevant to the legislation that is currently on the floor and should \nbe brought forward for a vote. It is amendment No. 3453, and as I said \nit deals with the waters of the United States.\n  I am going to take just a minute to read it because it is very simple \nand very straightforward and could be dealt with in a very expeditious \nway. Obviously with 29 Senators supporting it, it is an amendment that \nwe should be voting on. This is a clear example of an amendment where \nthis body needs to take a stand, and it is one that should receive a \nvote as part of this sportsmen's legislation.\n  So I will read from the amendment:\n\n       In General. Neither the Secretary of the Army nor the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall--\n       (1) finalize the proposed rule entitled ``Definition of \n     'Waters of the United States' Under the Clean Water Act'';\n       (2) use the proposed rule described in paragraph (1), or \n     any substantially similar proposed rule or guidance, as a \n     basis for any rulemaking or any decision regarding the scope \n     of the enforcement of the Federal Water Pollution Control \n     Act.\n       (b) RULES. The use of the proposed rule described in \n     subsection (a)(1), or any substantially similar proposed rule \n     or guidance, as the basis for any rulemaking or any \n     decision regarding the scope or enforcement of the Federal \n     Water Pollution Control Act shall be grounds for vacation \n     of the final rule, decision, or enforcement action.\n\n  So very simply, what we provide is that the EPA cannot move forward \nwith the proposed waters of the U.S. rule. It is appropriate because in \nessence, as my colleague from Missouri very accurately described, the \nEPA has gone way beyond its jurisdiction on this rule.\n  EPA alleges that it is responding to confusion in regard to the \nproposed Waters of the U.S. rule that it is getting from farmers and \nranchers across our country. The fact is that is not the case. What EPA \nis doing is they are expanding their jurisdiction dramatically under an \nargument that the Supreme Court did not make, but an argument, rather, \nthat the EPA is making that under what they call ``significant nexus'' \nthey are empowered to regulate waters far beyond navigable bodies of \nwater.\n  This is something I think affects almost every industry sector, but I \nam going to bring it back to a discussion of our farmers and ranchers \nand private property rights, which are, in fact, impacted by this \nproposed rule to talk about why it is so important that we have an \nopportunity to vote on this amendment and to defeat the proposed rule.\n  America's farmers and ranchers and entrepreneurs go to work every day \nto build a stronger Nation. Thanks to these hardworking men and women, \nwe live in a country where there is affordable food at the grocery \nstore and where a dynamic private sector offers Americans the \nopportunity to achieve a brighter future. In these difficult economic \ntimes the Federal Government should be doing all it can to empower \nthose who grow our food and create jobs. Yet instead regulators are \nstifling growth with burdensome regulations which generate costs and \nuncertainty.\n  The proposed rule by the Army Corps of Engineers and the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to regulate the waters of the United \nStates is exactly the type of regulation that I am talking about. The \nwaters of the United States rule greatly expands the scope of the Clean \nWater Act with regulations over America's streams and wetlands.\n\n  If we look at the chart I brought, we can see it is not just \naffecting our farmers and ranchers, it goes far beyond that. For \nexample, it affects the power industry, the oil and gas industry, the \nconstruction industry, and the manufacturing industry. Almost anything \nyou can think of is impacted by this regulatory overreach. It is \nclearly a power grab by the EPA, and it needs to be checked.\n  The Supreme Court has found that Federal jurisdiction under the Clean \nWater Act extends to navigable waters. We are not arguing with the \nEPA's ability to regulate something like the Missouri River or a lake \nthat is a navigable body of water, but the Supreme Court has also made \nit clear that not all bodies of water are navigable or under the EPA's \njurisdiction.\n  What has our farmers and ranchers so concerned is that the Corps and \nthe EPA went far beyond lakes and rivers. This new proposed rule would \nbring EPA permitting, reporting, enforcement, mitigation, and citizen \nlawsuits to ephemeral streams. Ephemeral streams are really dry land \nmost of the time. To a farmer, an ephemeral stream is simply a low area \nacross the field. It brings tributaries into it--tributaries which are \nall ditches that carry any amount of water that eventually flows into a \nnavigable body of water. Think about that. Ditches. All waters that are \ndeemed adjacent to other jurisdictional waters, including dry ditches \nand ephemerals, plus any other waters that the EPA has determined to \nhave a significant nexus. In real-world terms, these categories could \nbring burdensome regulations to a vast number of small, isolated \nwetlands and ponds. It is hard to see, but that is what we tried to \ndepict on this chart. It is almost any type of water anywhere you find \nit.\n  For those of you who have not had the opportunity to visit with a \nfarmer from my State of North Dakota, know that dealing with excess \nwater is a common issue, to say the least, particularly in recent \nyears. Most farmers could tell you that just because there is water in \na ditch or a field one week doesn't mean there is going to be water in \nthat field or ditch the next week. It certainly doesn't make that water \nworthy of being treated the same as a navigable river or lake. It \ndefies common sense. A field with a low spot that has standing water \nduring a rainy week and happens to be located near a ditch does not \nwarrant Clean Water Act regulation from a legal or, as I have said, \ncommonsense perspective.\n  The Corps and the EPA have responded to these concerns by saying they \nare going to exempt dozens of conservation practices, but these \nexemptions are extremely limited and they do not cover many Clean Water \nAct rights. For example, the farmer with a low spot in his field next \nto the ditch described above--as I just explained--may now be sued \nunder the Clean Water Act's section 402 National Pollutant Discharge \nElimination System. Think about that. Now the farmer faces the risk of \nlitigation and litigation costs for using everyday weed control or \nfertilizer applications among other basic and essential farming \nactivities.\n  Let me get this right. The EPA is saying: We are doing this because \nthis is going to help farmers somehow understand what they have to do.\n  So the EPA goes beyond navigable bodies of water--let's take a State \nsuch as Ohio, for example. They are going to go beyond the Great Lakes \nand beyond the Ohio River, and the EPA is now going to extend their \nregulatory jurisdiction to water wherever they find it--in a ditch or \non a farm--and they are going to regulate that, and they might give \nthat farmer or rancher an exemption, and somehow they are helping and \nclarifying things for that farmer or rancher? It defies common sense.\n  Farmers and ranchers have to work through uncertain weather and \nmarkets to ensure that America is food secure, and they do an amazing \njob of it. They are the best in the world. Sixteen million people in \nthis country are either directly involved in agriculture or indirectly \ninvolved in agriculture. We have a positive balance of payments in \nagriculture. We have the lowest cost, highest quality food supply in \nthe world. Now the EPA by its own volition is going to go out and make \nit harder and more expensive and more difficult for our farmers and \nranchers to do what they do better than anyone in the world. Farmers \nand ranchers have to work through uncertain weather and markets to \nensure that we have food security. They don't need the burden of \nadditional regulations and litigation,\n\n[[Page S4321]]\n\nand they certainly don't need that burden under the auspices of the EPA \nsaying that somehow this is going to help. Well, that is not the case.\n  I offered a very similar amendment in the Appropriations Committee in \nthe energy and water section. The night before we were to have our full \nAppropriations Committee meeting, at 7:30 that night, that bill, the \nEnergy and Water bill, got pulled, so we didn't have our appropriations \nvote the next morning.\n  The amendment I had prepared simply would have defunded this proposed \nregulation, but because there was bipartisan support for this \namendment, we are not going to get a chance to vote on it.\n  Twenty-eight other Senators and I have been here on the floor this \nafternoon. The Senator from Missouri was just here. The Senator from \nWyoming was here earlier. Others have been here. I am here now. There \nwill be more. So here we stand. We are on a sportsmen's bill, this is a \nrelevant amendment, and the question is, Why aren't we voting on it? It \nhas bipartisan support and 29 cosponsors. It is something that is \nclearly important not just to our farmers and ranchers but really to \nbusinesses and industry across this great country. So why aren't we \nvoting on it? If somebody wants to come down and make an argument that \nthey are for it, they can do so. But when all is said and done, the way \nthis body works is by voting and determining where the majority falls.\n\n  I ask my colleagues, why in the world are we not voting on this \namendment that is incredibly important to our farmers and ranchers and \nto businesses and to industry and to the people of this country? As I \nsaid, we didn't get a chance to vote on it in committee, and here we \nare on a bill where it is relevant. Are we going to get a chance to \nvote on it now? And if not now, when?\n  The majority rules, so let's have a vote. Let's give everybody a \nchance to stand and be counted. Let's have our vote, and let's stand up \nfor the American people and make sure we strike down this proposed \nwaters of the United States regulation.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             VA Health Care\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I have received a number of calls in recent \nweeks, as we all have, about what is happening at the Veterans' \nAdministration. Over the July 4th week, back in Ohio, I heard from lots \nof veterans at roundtables in communities all over the State, from \nSteubenville to Dayton, and lots of places in between: What are we \ngoing to do about the VA? I heard outrage. I heard disillusion over the \nVA. There is outrage about a system charged with caring for those who \ndefend our Nation that falls short. There is frustration and \ndisillusion because our veterans are waiting too long. We need to fix \nthat.\n  But I also saw letters to the Cincinnati Enquirer and the Cleveland \nPlain Dealer and I had conversations with veterans who defended and \nbragged about the service they are getting, the care they are getting, \nwhether it is the VA in Cincinnati or Dayton or Cleveland or Columbus \nor Chillicothe--the hospitals we have in my State--or whether it is the \ncommunity-based clinics in places such as Mansfield and Zanesville and \nLima and Springfield--those smaller community-based outpatient clinics, \nso-called CBOCs, that serve veterans who need less acute care but still \nneed service from a doctor, from a nurse, from a physical therapist.\n  We can only conclude a couple of things. We can conclude there are, \nin fact, serious problems with the VA that need to be fixed. The \nPresiding Officer is a prominent member of the Veterans' Committee, and \nfrom his veterans hospitals in Connecticut he hears the same. We can \nalso conclude that those who get in the system overwhelmingly are \ngetting good care. There are 6.5 million veterans who are using VA \nhealth care with 85 million patient visits a year. That was in 2013. I \nassume there is a similar number this year. They are getting good care.\n  The problem is access to the system. The waiting times are simply \nunacceptable and outrageous and the disillusionment for those veterans \nis worse. We know what waiting times mean, especially in mental health \ntreatment, where far too many veterans commit suicide.\n  With costs of war--and particularly this last round of wars over the \nlast decade where we went to war as a nation, wrongly, in Iraq--we \ndidn't pay for that war--and then the President and the Congress a \ndecade ago made a fateful mistake, mostly out of arrogance, assuming \nthat these two wars would be so short we didn't need to scale up the \nVA, we didn't need to increase funding, we didn't need to expand \nservices, we didn't need to hire more doctors and nurses--two things \nhappened. One, a whole bunch of new veterans, new soldiers and sailors \nand marines and air men and women, came home from Iraq and Afghanistan. \nA whole lot more were in the war than President Bush and the Congress \nthought would happen or cared to think would happen a decade ago.\n  The second thing is they came home in much worse shape than in \nprevious wars. Soldiers who would have died on the battlefields--the \nPresiding Officer is a veteran himself and he knows and we all know \nthat the illnesses and physical and mental injuries are much greater in \nthis war because they survived the battlefield when they might not have \nsurvived these same kinds of explosions 20 or 30 years ago.\n  The third thing--I said two. The third thing that happened is because \nof a decision Congress made that was right a couple of decades ago--I \nbelieve it was President Clinton who signed that bill; it might have \nbeen President Bush 1--in passing a bill which included a provision \ncalled presumptive eligibility for Agent Orange. Before presumptive \neligibility, when a veteran came home from Vietnam right after the war \nor developed an illness many years later, that veteran would have to \nfight with the VA to prove that Agent Orange was the reason he or she \nhad that illness. After Agent Orange presumptive eligibility, what that \nmeant is that these soldiers and these veterans, 20 years later, if \nthey had 1 of the 20 or so illnesses defined by the law that were \nconnected to Agent Orange, they automatically were eligible. That is \ncalled presumptive eligibility, meaning they were eligible for VA \nservices and health care. That was a great thing.\n\n  However, what that meant is that as more and more veterans moved \nforward from Vietnam, as they aged into their fifties and sixties and \nsome into their seventies, they have had a huge influx of patients into \nthe VA. That is why this veterans conference report--the bill that \npassed the House and the bill that passed the Senate with almost no \n``no'' votes--is so important, because our commitment to our veterans \nmust match their commitment to our Nation.\n  I am the first Ohioan to serve a full term ever on the Senate \nVeterans' Committee. I have been lucky enough to be appointed to the \njoint House and Senate conference committee. We need to iron out the \ndifferences in these bills. We need to do three things. First, increase \nthe accountability in the VA. VA employees, senior employees in \nparticular, who don't do their jobs should lose their jobs; that if it \nis proven in fact they did not do their jobs, if they altered \ninformation, if they explained away delays incorrectly or dishonestly, \nthat they be held accountable, period.\n  Although let's keep in mind the vast majority of VA employees, \nwhether they are in Hartford or whether they are in Cleveland, are \ndedicated public servants to our Nation and to our veterans. These are \nmen and women who chose to serve veterans, to work in Chillicothe, in \nZanesville, and in Columbus, and so many of them are veterans \nthemselves. They chose a career to serve veterans and they are veterans \nthemselves. Whether it is a police officer at the Dayton VA, a claims \nprocessor at the Cleveland VARO, a nurse\n\n[[Page S4322]]\n\nat the Toledo CBOC, our veterans rely on them. We shouldn't condemn the \nVA at large for the wrongdoings of a relative few.\n  Second, the compromise bill will provide an option for veterans who \nare experiencing long wait times. In the Presiding Officer's State of \nConnecticut and in mine, few veterans are all that far from a CBOC or \nfrom a hospital, and this new proposal says that for veterans more than \n40 miles away from a CBOC or hospital, they can go elsewhere to a local \nhospital or a local community-based health center instead of the VA \nbecause they are closer. We don't have too many places in my State--and \nI believe there are none in the Presiding Officer's State--where that \nis the case. But those veterans who have had to wait 30 years or 30 \ndays should have that option because care for the veteran, our \ncommitment to veterans must match their commitment to our Nation.\n  Third and last, the compromise bill will expand and enhance the VA's \nability to provide veterans with the care they deserve. It will allow \nthe VA to hire more doctors and nurses and physical therapists, to \nbuild more beds, to build more capacity at these VA centers and CBOCs \nto make sure they have the staff necessary. With the end of these two \nwars, thousands of our newest veterans will be joining the ranks of VA \nhealth care.\n  The shortage of care providers has been especially pressing for vets \nstruggling with a brain injury--the so-called invisible injuries. That \nis when a soldier in the Army gets a head injury and it might be \nconsidered a minor head injury. A number of combatants have told me \nthey get their ``bells rung'' is the term they use. It is an invisible \ninjury, a minor concussion--often not reported but a minor concussion--\nand then another one and then another one. Look at what the stories \nhave told us about the NFL players. The same holds true, only in a more \nserious way, for soldiers and for marines, what happens to them down \nthe road. Thirty years later they go to the VA, their behavior has \nchanged, their families are calling. The VA has no documentation of \nthese injuries. They have to struggle to show these injuries, to prove \nthese injuries to the VA, to the doctors for a diagnosis and to the VA \nfor the coverage of the disability.\n  That is why my tracker bill, the Fairman Significant Event Tracker \nAct--or SET Act--is so important. Instead of the burden being on the \nveteran to show here were my concussions, here were my injuries, I \nshould be eligible for disability; here is what happened to me, \ndiagnose me with the right diagnosis, the Army itself should be keeping \nthose records, and they should follow the health care of the veteran \nwhen they are in the military, when they are in the VA. The interface \nhas to take place much more smoothly, so when a soldier turns in her \ngear and she comes back to Ravenna, OH, or she comes back to Wauseon, \nOH, or she comes back to Maple Heights or Garfield Heights, the VA \nlocally will know what has happened to her.\n  These are the challenges. I will finish with a couple of troubling \nnotes I received from a couple of people in Ohio. One came from Gary in \nFranklin County, which is the home of the State capital: My brother was \na Vietnam vet and survivor of a major battle in Vietnam. He never \ndiscussed his experiences. He took his life in 1992. This bill will \nprovide important mechanisms to help reduce the rate of suicides among \nour veterans. Every Member of Congress should support it. It is not a \npolitical issue, but a part of our sincere and legitimate commitment to \nour veterans.\n\n  I couldn't have said it better.\n  Christine from Miami County, the county just north of Dayton in \nsouthwest Ohio: This bill will remove the redtape that our veterans \nencounter at a time when they are least able to deal with it. My son \ndied at his own hands after a tour in the Middle East. He sought help \nfrom the VA and was diagnosed with PTSD shortly before dying. I know \nhis mental state at the time, and he would not have been able to handle \nproviding proof that he experienced traumatic events or remember the \nduties he performed.\n  In other words, he had these injuries. The military didn't have the \nrecords of these injuries because he wasn't injured so badly that he \nwas sent back to Germany or to Bethesda or to Walter Reed, but the \nmilitary should have kept these records so he knew what, in fact, was \nwrong. He was not able, in his condition, to put together and find his \nold buddies that were with him 6 or 8 years earlier that could kind of \nrecall the incidents of what happened.\n  Christine writes that this bill is a simple, effective solution.\n  We need to address the issues facing our veterans. Our commitment to \nour troops must match their commitment to our Nation.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here for the 73rd ``time to wake \nup'' speech that I have done to urge my colleagues to wake up to the \ngrowing threat of climate change. The changes we are seeing, driven by \ncarbon pollution, are far-reaching--from the coast lines of States such \nas Rhode Island and the Presiding Officer's State of Connecticut, to \nthe great plateaus and mountain ranges out West; from pole to pole; \nfrom high up in the atmosphere to deep down in the oceans.\n  In Rhode Island, we know the oceans are ground zero for the effects \nof carbon pollution. Since the Industrial Revolution, the oceans have \nbeen absorbing our carbon dioxide emissions--roughly a quarter of the \ntotal excess emissions--which, by the laws of chemistry, has caused \nrapid changes in ocean acidity, the pH level of the oceans, changes not \nseen for a long time. When I say ``a long time,'' I mean at least 25 to \n50 million years, potentially as many as 300 million years. To put 300 \nmillion years into perspective, we homo sapiens--the human species--\nhave been on the Earth for about 200,000 years. So 300 million years \ngoes way back into geologic time, back before the dinosaurs. So a \nchange that is unprecedented in that much time is something we should \npay attention to.\n  Recently, four Republican former EPA Administrators testified before \nmy Environment and Public Works subcommittee on the dire need for \ncongressional action to curb this carbon pollution that is causing \nthese effects in our oceans.\n  Here is how the EPA's very first Administrator, William Ruckelshaus, \nput it. He said:\n\n       Since the ocean absorbs 25-30 percent of the carbon from \n     stationary or mobile sources we thought the ocean was our \n     friend. It was keeping significant amounts of carbon from the \n     atmosphere. But our friend is paying a penalty.\n\n  As carbon dissolves in water, it makes the water more acidic--a \nfundamental chemical proposition--and that can upset the delicate \nbalance of ocean life. Again, that is just basic physics and chemistry.\n  Ronald Reagan's EPA chief Lee Thomas--Ronald Reagan's EPA chief--\nwarned us that thanks to the profuse carbon pollution we have emitted, \noceans are now acidifying at a rate 50 times greater than known \nhistorical change--50 times.\n  Of course, my colleagues in the minority did not seem inclined to \nlisten to their fellow Republicans. Instead, they took a page out of \nthe polluters' playbook, and as usual their routine was to call into \nquestion widely accepted science.\n  Well, I recently visited communities around the country. I will \nmention my trip recently along the southeast coast--the Atlantic \ncoast--where researchers, elected officials, and business and home \nowners are seeing the effects of climate change firsthand.\n  It does not matter what somebody thinks on the Senate floor. They are \nseeing it firsthand. They know better than what the polluting special \ninterests are trying to sell. Indeed, recently the United States \nConference of Mayors unanimously adopted a resolution calling for \nnatural solutions to fight the effects of climate change to ``protect \nfresh water supplies, defend the Nation's coastlines, maintain a \nhealthy tree and green space cover, and protect air quality.'' \nUnanimously, by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, a bipartisan \norganization.\n  So there are a lot of people who know better than the nonsense the \npolluting special interests are trying to sell.\n\n[[Page S4323]]\n\n  I flew out during this trip to where sea level rise is gnawing away \nat the Outer Banks. When you fly over the North Carolina coast, you see \na lot of investment along the shoreline. You see houses, big houses, \nnice houses. You see hotels, you see restaurants, you see roads and \ninfrastructure, you see an entire seafront economy.\n  I met down there with the North Carolina Coastal Federation at their \nCoastal Education Center in Wilmington. This is a bipartisan group. It \nhas joined together in concern over the exposure of their coastal \ncommunities, their homes, to rising seas. What would my colleagues here \nin the Senate tell this bipartisan group in North Carolina about \nclimate change? What would they tell the United States Conference of \nMayors, a bipartisan group, about climate change? Do not worry, it is \nnot real; run along now, do not concern yourself.\n  Good luck with that. People know better.\n  King Canute could not decree that the tide not come in. Republicans \nin Congress cannot legislate away the changes we are seeing in our \noceans. When I was down in Florida, fishermen there told me about the \nnorthward migration of species they are used to catching in Florida, \nspecies such as redfish and snook, moving north because of warming \nocean temperatures.\n  Fishermen in South Carolina told me snook are now being caught off \nthe coast of Charleston. I have heard that redfish are being caught as \nfar north as Cape Cod. I believe that because Rhode Islanders are \ncatching tarpon and grouper off the shore of Rhode Island. I have had \nRhode Island fishermen tell me they are catching fish their fathers and \ngrandfathers never saw come up in their nets.\n  As one Rhode Island fisherman told me, ``Sheldon, it's getting weird \nout there.''\n  It is not just Rhode Island. The Maine legislature just established a \nbipartisan commission to study and address the harm from ocean \nacidification to ecosystems and to their shell fisheries--again, \nbipartisan.\n  Once you leave this building, people are taking bipartisan action. It \nis only here that the polluters hold such sway.\n  In Virginia, which is also a coal State, a bipartisan group, \nincluding Republican U.S. Representatives Scott Rigell and Democratic \nGovernor Terry McAuliffe, are working together to prepare communities \nsuch as Hampton Roads, VA, for several feet of sea level rise.\n  A State commission that was first assembled under the administration \nof our Virginia colleague Tim Kaine, back when he was Governor, has \nreconvened to address the threat of climate change in the oceans.\n  These Virginia leaders are not wasting time quarreling and denying \nbasic science. They are working to protect commerce and homeowners in \ntheir communities threatened as the seas continue to rise. While our \nRepublican colleagues in Congress try their best to ignore the problem \nof carbon pollution, there are very serious conversations going on \noutside these walls.\n  For example, former President George W. Bush's Treasury Secretary \nHank Paulson invoked ocean warming and sea level rise in a recent \neditorial he wrote, calling for a fee on carbon pollution. Here is the \ncover of this week's Newsweek: ``Deep end. What rapid changes in oceans \nmean for Earth.''\n  This would not be the first one. Last year, National Geographic came \nout with this issue entitled ``Rising Seas.''\n  Now perhaps my colleagues on the other side who pretend that climate \nchange is a hoax will agree that Newsweek is part of the hoax; National \nGeographic is part of the hoax; U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops is \npart of the hoax; the U.S. Navy is part of the hoax. We are bedeviled \nin this Chamber by preposterous ideas. What the Newsweek cover article \nhighlights is the unprecedented effects of pumping all of that excess \ncarbon into our oceans, ranging from coral bleaching to dissolving \nlarval shellfish, to the disappearance of entire species.\n  BloombergView just published a recent editorial titled ``Climate \nChange Goes Underwater.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this document be printed in the Record \nat the end of my comments.\n  This is not wild speculation. This is good old-fashioned reporting of \nthings that are happening around us that people see. I have talked \nbefore about the humble pteropod, so let's talk a little about the \npteropod, a funny type of snail which is about the size of a small pea.\n  The pteropod is known sometimes as the sea butterfly because its \nsmall foot has adapted into two little butterfly-like wings which \npropel it around in the ocean. These images show what can happen to the \npteropod shell when the creature's underwater environment becomes more \nacidic and therefore lacks the compounds that are necessary for this \nlittle creature to make its delicate shell. It is not good for the \npteropod. This is the pteropod in action with the little butterfly \nwings that help it to swim. Here is a clean shell from proper water. \nHere is a dissolving shell from exposure to acidified ocean water. This \nobviously is not good for the pteropod.\n  Recent research, which was led by NOAA scientists, has found that \nocean acidification off our west coast, in what is called the \nCalifornia current ecosystem, is hitting the pteropod especially hard.\n  Let me take a minute and read from the publication of this report in \nthe Proceedings of the Royal Society, a respected publication.\n\n       The release of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the \n     atmosphere from fossil fuel burning, cement production and \n     deforestation processes has resulted in atmospheric \n     CO2 concentrations that have increased about 40% \n     since the beginning of the industrial era.\n\n  Now, the measure of that--we have always had atmospheric carbon \nconcentrations between about 170 and 300 parts per million--we have \nbroken 400. April was the first month when we were consistently, on \naverage, above 400 parts per million.\n  When you think that the 170 to 300 parts per million range has lasted \nfor thousands of years, for millennia, for longer than our species has \nbeen on the planet, the fact that we are suddenly outside of that range \nis a signal that ought to call our attention. That is what they are \nreferring to.\n  Continuing:\n\n       The oceans have taken up approximately 28% of the total \n     amount of CO2 produced by human activities over \n     this time-frame, causing a variety of chemical changes known \n     as ocean acidification (OA).\n\n  The rapid change in ocean chemistry is faster than at any time over \nthe past 50 million years.\n  They go on to say, toward the end of the report, that one of the \nchokepoint areas, what they call the first bottleneck: ``The first \nbottleneck would primarily affect veligers and larvae''--which are \nearly stages of the shell before its shell has hardened. The larvae is \nlittle, and the veliger is when it has kind of a shroud around it, but \nnot yet a shell. It helps it to move and to consume food.\n  Continuing:\n\n       The first bottleneck would primarily affect veligers and \n     larvae, life stages where complete shell dissolution in the \n     larvae can occur within two weeks upon exposure to \n     undersaturation.\n\n  They also note that:\n\n       Significant increases in vertical and spatial extent of \n     conditions favouring pteropod shell dissolution are expected \n     to make this habitat potentially unsuitable for pteropods.\n\n  So if the California current ecosystem habitat becomes unsuitable for \npteropods, we have a little problem on our hands because pteropods are \nfood for important fish like salmon, like mackerel, like herring. \nPteropods are the base of the food chain. No pteropods means crashed \nsalmon fisheries, crashed mackerel fisheries, crashed herring \nfisheries, crashes throughout polar and subpolar fisheries.\n  Dr. William Peterson is an oceanographer at NOAA's Northwest \nFisheries Science Center. He is the coauthor of the study, and he said: \n``We did not expect to see pteropods being affected to this extent in \nour coastal region for several decades.''\n  These ecosystems, these ocean ecosystems, are crumbling before our \neyes and yet this Congress hides behind denial. In the face of inertia \nin Congress and in the face of the relentless truculence of the \ndeniers, the Obama administration is trying to do what it can to push \nresponsible policies.\n  Last month Secretary of State John Kerry held the State Department's \n``Our Ocean'' Conference and I attended that conference for 2 days. One \nof the presenters there was Dr. Carol Turley\n\n[[Page S4324]]\n\nof the Plymouth Marine Laboratory. She described her research on ocean \nacidification, including using this graph of ocean acidity over the \npast 25 million years. That is today minus 25 million years, today \nminus 20 million years, minus 15 million years, minus 10 million years, \nminus 5 million years, and now.\n  Look at how little variation there has been in ocean pH across that \n25-million-year time scale. Remember, we have been on the planet around \n200,000 years. We go back to about here.\n  The rest of this is geologic time. That is a long span of time. If we \nput that against what is happening now, look how sudden that change is \nin ocean pH, the basic acidity of the oceans.\n  Why is this happening? We know that human activity releases gigatons \nof carbon every year. That is undeniable. We know that carbon dioxide \nacidifies seawater. That is basic chemistry. You can do that in a high \nschool lab.\n  We know the ocean's pH is changing in unprecedented ways in human \nhistory. No one in their right mind can say this is natural \nvariability.\n  This acidification of our seas will have devastating effects on \necosystems such as tropical coral reefs, which, as Dr. Turley pointed \nout, are home to one in every four species in the marine environment. \nIf you wanted to drive a bulldozer through God's species on this \nplanet, it would be hard to do much better than allowing this rampant \nocean acidification.\n  My colleague and cochair of our Senate Oceans Caucus, Senator Lisa \nMurkowski, and I have had the chance to address the oceans conference \ntogether. She told the conference that the waters off her Alaskan \nshores are growing more acidic.\n  I agree with Senator Murkowski that we need to understand what ocean \nacidification means for our fisheries and ocean ecosystems much better \nthan we do now.\n  Secretary Kerry delivered a clear challenge. On this planet, with all \nof its many peoples, we share nothing so completely as we share the \noceans. And if we are going to honor our duty to protect the oceans, to \nhonor our duty to future generations, we are going to have to work \ntogether. These are painfully clear warnings. The facts speak volumes.\n  The denial propaganda has shown itself to be nonsense, to be a sham, \nwhich ought to come as no surprise because the machinery that produces \nthe climate denial propaganda is the same machinery that denied tobacco \nwas dangerous, the same machinery that denied there was an ozone hole, \nthe same machinery that has always fought public health measures for \nindustry, and has always been wrong. It has always been wrong because \nit is not its job to be right. It is its job to protect industry and \nallow them to continue to pollute and make money. That is its job. So \nit ought to come as no surprise that the argument it makes about \nclimate change is nonsense and is a sham. It is time to unshackle \nourselves from that machinery.\n\n  History is going to look back at this, and it will not be a shining \nmoment for us. History will reflect that the polluters are polluting \nour democracy with their money and their influence just as badly as \nthey are polluting our oceans and our atmosphere with their carbon.\n  We have to wake up. It will disserve our grandchildren and their \ngrandchildren, and it will disgrace our generation to have allowed this \ndemocracy to miss this issue and to fail to act because of the \npropaganda machinery that has over and over again proven itself to be \nwrong. Our ocean economies, our ocean heritage, are all at stake.\n  As Secretary Kerry put it, it is our ocean, and it is our \nresponsibility. Let us please wake up before we have completely \ndisgraced ourselves.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Bloomberg View, June 29, 2014]\n\n                     Climate Change Goes Underwater\n\n                            (By The Editors)\n\n       When it comes to climate change, almost all the attention \n     is on the air. What's happening to the water, however, is \n     just as worrying--although for the moment it may be slightly \n     more manageable.\n       Here's the problem in a seashell: As the oceans absorb \n     about a quarter of the carbon dioxide released by fossil-fuel \n     burning, the pH level in the underwater world is falling, \n     creating the marine version of climate change. Ocean \n     acidification is rising at its fastest pace in 300 million \n     years, according to scientists.\n       The most obvious effects have been on oysters, clams, coral \n     and other sea-dwelling creatures with hard parts, because \n     more acidic water contains less of the calcium carbonate \n     essential for shell- and skeleton-building. But there are \n     also implications for the land-based creatures known as \n     humans.\n       It's not just the Pacific oyster farmers who are finding \n     high pH levels make it hard for larvae to form, or the clam \n     fishermen in Maine who discover that the clams on the bottom \n     of their buckets can be crushed by the weight of a full load, \n     or even the 123.3 million Americans who live near or on the \n     coasts. Oceans cover more than two-thirds of the earth, and \n     changes to the marine ecosystem will have profound effects on \n     the planet.\n       Stopping acidification, like stopping climate change, \n     requires first and foremost a worldwide reduction in \n     greenhouse-gas emissions. That's the bad news. Coming to an \n     international agreement about the best way to do that is \n     hard.\n       Unlike with climate change, however, local action can make \n     a real difference against acidification. This is because in \n     many coastal regions where shellfish and coral reefs are at \n     risk, an already bad situation is being made worse by \n     localized air and water pollution, such as acid rain from \n     coal-burning; effluent from big farms, pulp mills and sewage \n     systems; and storm runoff from urban pavement. This means \n     that existing anti-pollution laws can address some of the \n     problem.\n       States have the authority under the U.S. Clean Water Act, \n     for instance, to set standards for water quality, and they \n     can use that authority to strengthen local limits on the \n     kinds of pollution that most contribute to acidification hot \n     spots. Coastal states and cities can also maximize the amount \n     of land covered in vegetation (rather than asphalt or \n     concrete), so that when it rains the water filters through \n     soil and doesn't easily wash urban pollution into the sea. \n     States can also qualify for federal funding for acidification \n     research in their estuaries.\n       Such research can hardly happen fast enough. It's still not \n     known, for instance, exactly to what extent acidification is \n     to blame for the decline of coral reefs. And if the chemical \n     change in the ocean makes it harder for sea snails and other \n     pteropods to survive, will that also threaten the wild salmon \n     and other big fish that eat them?\n       Better monitoring of acidification would help scientists \n     learn how much it varies from place to place and what makes \n     the difference. This calls for continuous readings, because \n     pH levels shift throughout the day and from season to season. \n     Engineers are designing new measuring devices that can be \n     left in the water, and it looks like monitoring will \n     eventually be done in a standardized way throughout the \n     world.\n       In the meantime, researchers are finding small ways to give \n     local populations of shellfish their best chance to survive--\n     depositing crushed shells in the mudflats where clams live, \n     for instance, to neutralize the sediment, or planting sea \n     grass in shellfish habitats to absorb CO2. Such strategies, \n     like pollution control, are worthwhile if only to help keep \n     shellfish populations as robust as possible in the short \n     term, perhaps giving natural selection the opportunity to \n     breed strains better suited to a lower-pH world.\n       These efforts also give humans more time to learn about \n     ocean acidification. And maybe they will help their political \n     leaders better understand the urgency of international \n     cooperation on limiting greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

We have all been impressed with the enthusiasm and \ndirection he brings to the Walt Disney Company, and some of my most \ninteresting times have been with him talking about it.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to share with others his report, and I ask \nconsent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, July 7, 2014]\n\n      Disney's Iger on the Future of Leisure: Technology Built on \n                              Storytelling\n\n                          (By Robert A. Iger)\n\n       In 1956, the year after Disneyland opened, Walt Disney was \n     asked to imagine what entertainment would be like a half-\n     century into the future.\n       As one of the world's great innovators, Walt had just \n     introduced people to a new form of leisure entertainment--the \n     theme park. But when it came to predicting the future, Walt \n     said that was beyond his powers, given the rapid pace of \n     change in the entertainment industry.\n       One thing was certain, Walt said: The centuries-old human \n     need for great storytelling would endure for generations to \n     come, enhanced by new technologies that would bring these \n     tales to life in extraordinary ways.\n       Walt was better at predicting the future than he realized. \n     Six decades later, technology is lifting the limits of \n     creativity and transforming the possibilities for \n     entertainment and leisure. Today's digital era has unleashed \n     unprecedented innovation, giving rise to an array of new \n     entertainment options competing for our time and attention.\n       As Walt also predicted, people's need to be entertained \n     with storytelling has endured: We gravitate to the universal \n     stories that bind us--tales of adventure, heroism and love, \n     tales that provide comfort and escape. Great storytelling \n     still remains the bedrock of great entertainment.\n       In the years ahead, this fusion of technology and \n     creativity will allow us to deliver experiences once \n     unimaginable. What will that future look like? Like Walt, I'm \n     hesitant to make predictions. But a few things seem certain \n     to me.\n       To start, the 20th-century concept of ``one size fits all'' \n     no longer applies, as innovators around the world create \n     tools that allow us to customize entertainment and leisure \n     experiences to fit our own tastes and schedules and share \n     them instantly with friends, family and an ever-growing \n     digitally connected global community. In short, we are \n     creating what I like to call technology-enabled leisure.\n       Mobile storytelling, and mobile entertainment, will \n     dominate our lives, and offer rich, compelling experiences \n     well beyond what is available today. Where someone is will no \n     longer be a barrier to being entertained; the geography of \n     leisure will be limitless. One of the most exciting \n     developments I see on the\n\n[[Page S4326]]\n\n     horizon is technology that will immerse us into entertaining \n     worlds, or project those worlds and experiences into our \n     lives. In essence, entertainment will be immeasurably \n     enhanced with both virtual-reality experiences and augmented-\n     reality experiences. Bringing us into created worlds and \n     bringing created worlds into our world will fundamentally \n     explode the boundaries of storytelling, unburdening the \n     storyteller in ways we can't yet imagine.\n       The challenges? Technology can be an invasive force, \n     competing for our attention and eroding the time we have for \n     ourselves and our families. Few of us would give up the tech \n     tools that keep us productive and informed; even fewer can \n     remember the last time we completely unplugged on vacation. \n     The more ubiquitous technology becomes in our lives, the more \n     diligent we must be to ensure it doesn't overwhelm or \n     diminish our leisure time.\n       Ultimately, technology is about connecting, not cocooning; \n     it's a tool that should empower us to reach more people and \n     bind us closer together, rather than encourage us to \n     disengage from one another. Even as we use technology to \n     create more individualized experiences, social interaction is \n     still a basic need, a fundamental part of our humanity.\n       That's why we value entertainment ``events'' that create \n     treasured memories, strengthen personal connections and \n     deliver shared experiences, whether at the movies, in a theme \n     park, or at a sports stadium. This is entertainment that \n     cannot be time-shifted or duplicated; you have to be there, \n     immersed in the moment.\n       An experience is enhanced when shared with others, becoming \n     something to be savored and remembered long after it's over. \n     These social events enrich our lives, and our need for them \n     will never change.\n       The human love of storytelling, whether individualized or \n     shared, will also be a constant. Although I can't predict the \n     precise future of entertainment, I share Walt Disney's \n     optimism and his belief that whatever lies ahead, it will be \n     defined by great storytelling. Just like it always has been.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/09/senate-section/article/S4326-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           FINANCIAL AID SIMPLIFICATION AND TRANSPARENCY ACT\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I recently spoke to Senate interns \nregarding the Financial Aid Simplification and Transparency Act. I ask \nunanimous consent that my full speech be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Financial Aid Simplification and Transparency Act\n\n       Thank you for coming. We know it's the pizza more than \n     anything else that brought you here, but to some extent it \n     may be the dreaded federal student application form. What we \n     would like to do today is tell you a story. We will call this \n     a ``teaching moment.'' I think that may have been Senator \n     Bennet's phrase, but it is a teaching moment for you as to \n     how legislation is supposed to work in the United States \n     Senate. And I think it may be a teaching moment for senators, \n     about how to do our jobs.\n       We are going to tell you a story of how we got to where we \n     are and tell you what our proposal is. And then we are going \n     to invite the experts to tell us what kind of students we \n     senators have been in terms of listening to them and then \n     coming up with something. Then we will ask you what you \n     think. Then we are going to put this out for our committee on \n     which we serve, which Senator Harkin is the chairman of, \n     which is working on the reauthorization of Higher Education \n     with our colleagues to see if we can get co-sponsors and make \n     a difference in something. So what I will do is begin the \n     story, and I will just take a few minutes. Then I will turn \n     it over to Senator Bennet, and he will tell you more about \n     exactly what the proposal is. First, let me introduce the \n     three experts: Ms. Kim Cook, executive director of the \n     National College Access Network, Dr. Judith Scott-Clayton, \n     assistant professor of economics and education at Teachers \n     College at Columbia University, and Ms. Kristin Conklin, \n     founding partner at HCM Strategists, LLC.\n       Here's why they are here. Several months ago at one of the \n     hearings of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \n     Committee, those three, and one other, who is from Harvard \n     Graduate School of Education, testified before us. I am down \n     on the Republican side and Michael is on the Democratic side. \n     It looked to me like we had the same reaction, because they \n     were talking about this federal student application form, \n     which is 106 questions, with 68 pages of explanations that \n     you have to fill out every year you apply for a grant or a \n     loan.\n       It gets audited during the year, and, of course, you would \n     probably make a mistake on one of those questions, so you \n     might not get your money. It is so discouraging to people who \n     apply for it that many who should do not. One of the \n     community college representatives said that a quarter of the \n     community college students do not even fill out the form, and \n     they are probably the ones who we most want to have the \n     opportunity to do that.\n       So what we heard the four say was you could eliminate all \n     those questions except two and get 90 or 95 percent of all of \n     the information that you need.\n       Of course I am the first one to wonder, ``Is that just a \n     bizarre outlier? Is that just one witness with a weird \n     proposal?'' But every single one of the four said that. Then \n     they went on to make some other very common sense \n     recommendations about being able to fill it out earlier in \n     your high school year, suggestions about over-borrowing, \n     about simplifying the loan and student repayment process--all \n     of which made a lot of sense.\n       So, at the end of the hearing, I said, ``Would four of you \n     please write a letter to us on the things that you agree \n     with?'' By the time I got down to see them, they said, ``We \n     won't write you four letters, we'll write you one.'' So they \n     did.\n       Michael and I began working together to see if we could \n     take their recommendations and put it in a piece of \n     legislation. In doing that, we wanted to show the proper \n     respect to our colleagues, so we let our chairman, Senator \n     Harkin, know about it. We mentioned it to Arne Duncan, so he \n     would know what we are doing, because we would like in the \n     end to have Republican support, and the president's support, \n     and the House of Representatives' support. We are not here to \n     make a political point. We are here to get a result. And then \n     we thought about what would be the best way to introduce it. \n     Senator Bennet said, ``Why don't we invite the interns to \n     come over for lunch? Why don't we lay it out to them? Why \n     don't we ask the experts who suggested it to us what they \n     think?''\n       Next week, then, we will introduce it and see what is going \n     on and how we can improve it over the next few weeks. And \n     then maybe when you fill out the form in your next year of \n     college, it will be the size of a postcard instead of the \n     size of that. That thing takes, if you add it up, 20 million \n     students filling that out every year, and the form itself \n     says it takes at least three hours. If you add up the amount \n     of money and time spent on that, you get into billions of \n     hours wasted, you get into hundreds of millions of dollars \n     that might be spent on construction, instead of hiring staff \n     people at the college to help you fill these things out. You \n     might encourage a lot more people, who are eligible and who \n     need the money, to get the surest step toward improving their \n     lives.\n       Of course, the College Board says that a college four-year \n     degree is worth a million dollars in increased earnings over \n     your lifetime. It is one sure ticket to a better life that we \n     know about. Finally, I want to say that it has been a great \n     pleasure to work with Michael. I am a pretty good Republican, \n     he's a pretty good Democrat, but that does not make any \n     difference. The reason we are here is that the Senate is a \n     place where you are supposed to have extended debate about \n     important subjects until you come to a consensus, and then \n     you get a result. That is the way you govern a complex \n     country. So what we hope is that this is just a small example \n     of one part of the Higher Education reauthorization process \n     that will help make life simpler.\n       Michael, there is one other thing that I should say. You \n     may ask, how did this happen? How did this long thing happen? \n     It wasn't any evil-doer who did it. What happened was the \n     Higher Education Act was authorized in 1965. In my opinion, \n     what happened was it got reauthorized eight times by \n     different groups of senators and congressman, different group \n     of regulators wrote things.

Mr. President, I wish to honor the memory of one of the \nworld's most courageous humanitarians: Raoul Wallenberg. Seventy years \nago today, Raoul Wallenberg arrived in Budapest, risking his own life \nto save the lives of tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews from the \natrocities of the Holocaust.\n  Raoul Wallenberg emerged as a champion of those who were persecuted \nduring one of the darkest chapters of human history. Mr. Wallenberg \nserved on the War Refugee Board, an independent government agency \nestablished in 1944 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and tasked with \nthe ``immediate rescue and relief of the Jews of Europe and other \nvictims of enemy persecution.'' Through his courageous work on the War \nRefugee Board, Mr. Wallenberg prevented the deportation of tens of \nthousands of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Wallenberg risked \nhis own life and livelihood in order to save Jewish people through a \nvariety of means by issuing thousands of protective documents for them; \nby securing their release from deportation trains, death march convoys, \nand labor service brigades; and by establishing the International \nGhetto of protected houses.\n  While the Holocaust showed us that human beings are capable of \ncommitting unspeakably evil acts, heroes like Raoul Wallenberg proved \nthat we are also capable of bravery, selflessness, and goodness.\n  It is only fitting that we passed legislation in 2012 bestowing one \nof America's highest civilian awards, the Congressional Gold Medal, to \none of the greatest heroes this world has known. That actual medal is \nbeing awarded to Raoul Wallenberg's family in a ceremony today to honor \nhis legacy.\n  American citizenship is not a requirement for receiving the \nCongressional Gold Medal; but if it were required, Wallenberg would be \neligible. He received honorary U.S. citizenship in 1981 thanks to the \nefforts of former Congressman Tom Lantos (D-CA, 12th) who, as a 16-\nyear-old in 1944, escaped from a Nazi forced labor camp outside of \nBudapest and hid with his aunt in a safe house Wallenberg had \nestablished.\n  Throughout the world, streets have been named after Raoul Wallenberg \nincluding one here in Washington, where the U.S. Holocaust Museum is \nlocated. Monuments bearing his name are testaments to Raoul \nWallenberg's heroism and to the thousands of lives he saved during the \nHolocaust. Awards are given in his name to honor humanitarians around \nthe world. The most important reminders of all that he accomplished are \nthe human ones the descendants of those who survived the Holocaust, \nthanks to Raoul Wallenberg's heroism. Raoul Wallenberg left this earth \ntoo soon but he accomplished more in his short life than most of us \ncould ever hope to.\n  We can honor Mr. Wallenberg by trying to live with the courage and \nconviction that he demonstrated in his short time. By doing so, we can \ndo right by him, and we can do right by all those whose lives were lost \nor forever changed by the Holocaust.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/09/senate-section/article/S4327-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4327-S4328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                 Second Lieutenant Tobias C. Alexander\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wish to remember the life and sacrifice \nof a remarkable young man, Army 2LT Tobias C. Alexander. Along with one \nother soldier, Toby died May 20, 2012 of injuries he sustained when his \nunit was attacked with improvised explosive devices in Tarin Kowt, \nAfghanistan, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  Toby was born June 8, 1981 in Wesel, Germany and graduated from Eglin \nHigh School in 1999.\n  Toby entered the Active Duty Army in August 2002 as a signal intel \nanalyst. He deployed to Afghanistan in 2007 in support of Operation \nEnduring Freedom with the Combined Joint Special Operations Task \nForce--Afghanistan (3rd Special Forces Group, Airborne). He obtained \nthe rank of sergeant first class.\n  In 2011 he earned a bachelors' degree in interdisciplinary studies \nfrom Cameron University where he was a part of the Reserve Officer \nTraining Corps. After receiving his commission, he attended the Field \nArtillery Basic Officer Leader Course B at Fort Sill, OK and was then \nassigned to the 1st Battalion, 14th Field Artillery, 214th Fires \nBrigade. He served as a platoon leader for Alpha Battery before being \nselected for the Security Forces Advisory Team, SFAT, which was \nresponsible for the training of Afghanistan's national security forces. \nHe deployed for his second tour to Afghanistan in June 2011.\n  His friend, Myles Mendez, said ``He was the guy you went to if you \nneeded to know something, so a lot of people were always going to him \nwith `What's this? What's that? Can you help me?' He was the go-to \nguy.''\n  ``I honestly don't think that he would have had it any other way. I \nthink if he had to choose to go out, I think he would have wanted to \nhave it serving his country. He was a patriot.''\n  On May 30, 2012, the family held funeral services at Cameron Baptist \nChurch in Lawton, OK.\n  He is survived by his wife Amanda, his children: Angelicia, Kevin and \nLexie, and his parents Bill and Heike Alexander.\n  Today we remember Army 2LT Tobias C. Alexander, a young man who loved \nhis family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.\n\n\n                Army Private First Class Jon R. Townsend\n\n  Mr. President, I also wish to remember Army PFC Jon R. Townsend. \nAlong with three other soldiers, Jon died September 16, 2012 in Zabul \nprovince, Afghanistan, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom due to \ninjuries sustained due to enemy small arms fire.\n  Jon was born October 28, 1992 and was raised in Claremore, OK. Two \ndays after he graduated from Claremore-Sequoyah High School in 2011 he \nleft for Army basic training at 17. His friends and family watched as \nhe transformed--downing 5 dozen eggs a week--from an average kid into a \nbulked-up recruit.\n  After completing initial training, Jon was assigned to the 1st \nBattalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment, 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd \nInfantry Division, based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA. He deployed \nto Afghanistan in December 2011.\n  His mother said that Jon believed in the mission and was particularly \nfond of the children he encountered. He asked her to send him care \npackages with treats that he could give his ``babies,'' and he'd use \nhis wet wipes to clean the children. ``Jon loved life and wanted to \nshare it with everybody,'' she said. ``He wanted to make everybody \nhappy.''\n  In February 2012, he went home on leave from Afghanistan and married \nhis high school sweetheart, Brittany Carden. They had 3 days together \nas a married couple before he departed back to Afghanistan.\n  ``I'm not mad. . .Jon did this because he loved his country,'' his \nmother said. ``He wanted to make it safe, and (joining the military) \nwas the only way he knew how.''\n  On September 28, 2012, the family held a service at First Baptist \nChurch and Jon was laid to rest in Lone Chapel Cemetery in Claremore, \nOK.\n  Jon is survived by his wife Brittany Townsend; Lois Harrison, granny; \nKaren (Katy Harrison) Nelson, mother; Aunt Honee Sue (Harrison) \nGrumbein and spouse Keith Grumbien and their children: Kobe, Kalvin, \nand Katelyn of Foyil; respected father-like figure Roland Long of \nFoyil; Jeremy Nelson, brother, and spouse, Courtney and their children: \nAustin, Jeremiah, Keegan and Xelia Nelson; Andrew Bingham; and Caleb \nand Myah Smith; Jennifer (Nelson) Tucker and spouse Paul Tucker and \nchildren: Tanner and Addison; Nancy (Roberts) Carden, mother-in-law; \nJames L. Carden, Jr., father; Cherish (Carden) Moye, sister, and \nhusband Brent Moye; and James Larry Carden, III, brother; and faithful \nfour-legged friend, Teddy. He was preceded in death by his father \nRobert\n\n[[Page S4328]]\n\nWayne Townsend, cousin Shawn Mersa, maternal grandfather (Bud) or \nCarroll Harrison, Jr., Sharon Rice (Harrison) aunt.\n  Today we remember Army PFC Jon R. Townsend, a young man who loved his \nfamily and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.\n\n\n                       Hospitalman Eric D. Warren\n\n  Mr. President, as well I would like to pay tribute to the life and \nsacrifice of Navy HM Eric D. ``Doc'' Warren. Eric died May 26, 2012 of \ninjuries he sustained from an improvised explosive device in Sangin \ndistrict, Helmand Province, Afghanistan, in support of Operation \nEnduring Freedom.\n  Eric was born November 22, 1988 and was a resident of Shawnee, OK. As \na child, he was active in Cub Scouts, little league sports, and earned \na black belt in Tae Kwon Do. Eric was also active in his church youth \ngroup, football, wrestling, and drama.\n  After graduating from McLoud High School, he enlisted in the Navy, \ngraduated from Corpsman School and completed Fleet Marine Force \ntraining as a combat corpsman. He was then assigned to 1st Battalion, \n8th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine Expeditionary \nForce, Camp Lejeune, NC.\n  He was deployed to Afghanistan in January 2012 for his third tour of \nduty.\n  ``When he was home last time, I shook his hand and he hugged my neck \nand whispered in my ear ``pray for me,'' Reverend Ron Baldridge said. \n``I prayed for him every day.''\n  Eric was a skinny kid with a mischievous streak who took pleasure in \nchallenging his pastor and youth minister, Reverend Baldridge \nexplained. Kevin Spurgin, youth minister at Eric's church said \nHospitalman Warren knew the possible consequences of being in one of \nthe most dangerous areas of Afghanistan, but any fears he may have had \nwere overcome by pride for the job he was doing there.\n  His father, Marvin, said his son never put himself first and the only \nenemy he knew was at war. ``He was real passionate about being with his \nguys over there,'' said Marvin, pausing to wipe away his tears. ``He \nwanted to make sure they were safe.''\n  On June 5, 2012, the family held a funeral service at Downtown \nPentecostal Holiness Church in Shawnee, OK. There was a 60-second \nstanding ovation for Eric during his funeral service to commemorate \nHospitalman Warren's service to his country, and the ultimate sacrifice \nhe and his family made.\n  Eric is the son of Donna Beth and Marvin Warren Jr., who adopted 11-\nyear-old Eric Warren after marrying his mother. His birth father is \nWilliam Burris, according to his obituary.\n  Today we remember Navy HM Eric D. ``Doc'' Warren, a young man who \nloved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for \nfreedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/09/senate-section/article/S4328-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4328-S4329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         CHICKASAW COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State. It has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Chickasaw County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to successfully acquire financial assistance from \nprograms I have fought hard to support, which have provided more than \n$4.2 million to the local economy.\n  Of course, one of my favorite memories of working together is the \nsuccess Alta Vista has had in accessing farm bill funds for important \nprojects such as obtaining a fire truck, wastewater treatment, and \nconservation activities.\n  Among the highlights:\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Chickasaw County has received $980,307 in Harkin grants.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Chickasaw County has received more than $2 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Chickasaw \nCounty's fire departments have received over $1 million for firefighter \nsafety and operations equipment.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the ADA \nAmendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow citizens \nwith disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, independent \nliving and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter century since \npassage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in communities everywhere \nI go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed-captioned television, but \nin the full participation of people with disabilities in our society \nand economy, folks who at long last have the opportunity to contribute \ntheir talents and to be fully included. These changes have increased \neconomic opportunities for all citizens of Chickasaw County, both those \nwith and without disabilities. And they make us proud to be a part of a \ncommunity and country that respects the worth and civil rights of all \nof our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Chickasaw County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Chickasaw \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa.

But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Dallas County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Dallas County worth over $2 million \nand successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I have \nfought hard to support, which have provided more than $28 million to \nthe local economy.\n  Of course, one of my favorite memories of working together is their \nterrific work to improve wellness both at worksites and to provide \nopportunities for physical activity in the community, under the \nterrific leadership of Shelley Horak.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces. I am so proud that Americans have better access to clinical \npreventive services, nutritious food, smoke-free environments, safe \nplaces to engage in physical activity, and information to make healthy \ndecisions for themselves and their families. These efforts not only \nsave lives, they will also save money for generations to come thanks to \nthe prevention of costly chronic diseases, which account for a whopping \n75 percent of annual health care costs. I am pleased that Dallas County \nhas recognized this important issue by securing more than $150,000 for \ncommunity wellness activities.\n  Main Street Iowa: One of the greatest challenges we face--in Iowa and \nall across America--is preserving the character and vitality of our \nsmall towns and rural communities. This isn't just about economics. It \nis also about maintaining our identity as Iowans. Main Street Iowa \nhelps preserve Iowa's heart and soul by providing funds to revitalize \ndowntown business districts. This program has allowed towns like Adel \nto use that money to leverage other investments to jumpstart change and \nrenewal. I am so pleased that Dallas County has earned $45,000 through \nthis program. These grants build much more than buildings. They build \nup the spirit and morale of people in our small towns and local \ncommunities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation.

In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Dallas County has received $1,283,316 in Harkin grants. \nSimilarly, schools in Dallas County have received funds that I \ndesignated for Iowa Star Schools for technology totaling $244,341.\n  Disaster mitigation and prevention: In 1993, when historic floods \nripped through Iowa, it became clear to me that the national emergency-\nresponse infrastructure was woefully inadequate to meet the needs of \nIowans in flood-ravaged communities. I went to work dramatically \nexpanding the Federal Emergency Management Agency's hazard mitigation \nprogram, which helps communities reduce the loss of life and property \ndue to natural disasters and enables mitigation measures to be \nimplemented during the immediate recovery period. Disaster relief means \nmore than helping people and businesses get back on their feet after a \ndisaster, it means doing our best to prevent the same predictable flood \nor other catastrophe from recurring in the future. The hazard \nmitigation program that I helped create in 1993 provided critical \nsupport to Iowa communities impacted by the devastating floods of 2008. \nDallas County has received over $1.6 million to remediate and prevent \nwidespread destruction from natural disasters.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Dallas County has received more than $4 million \nfrom a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Dallas County's \nfire departments have received over $1.5 million for firefighter safety \nand operations equipment.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf.

That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Grundy County has received $95,000 in Harkin grants. Similarly, \nschools in Grundy County have received funds that I designated for Iowa \nStar Schools for technology totaling $85,475.\n  Disaster mitigation and prevention: In 1993, when historic floods \nripped through Iowa, it became clear to me that the national emergency-\nresponse infrastructure was woefully inadequate to meet the needs of \nIowans in flood-ravaged communities. I went to work dramatically \nexpanding the Federal Emergency Management Agency's hazard mitigation \nprogram, which helps communities reduce the loss of life and property \ndue to natural disasters and enables mitigation measures to be \nimplemented during the immediate recovery period. Disaster relief means \nmore than helping people and businesses get back on their feet after a \ndisaster, it means doing our best to prevent the same predictable flood \nor other catastrophe from recurring in the future. The hazard \nmitigation program that I helped create in 1993 provided critical \nsupport to Iowa communities impacted by the devastating floods of 2008. \nGrundy County has received over $2 million to remediate and prevent \nwidespread destruction from natural disasters.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Grundy County has received more than $2.8 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Grundy County's \nfire departments have received over $382,000 for firefighter safety and \noperations equipment.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the \nADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow \ncitizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter \ncentury since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in \ncommunities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed \ncaptioned television, but in the full participation of people with \ndisabilities in our society and economy, folks who at long last have \nthe opportunity to contribute their talents and to be fully included. \nThese changes have increased economic opportunities for all citizens of \nGrundy County, both those with and without disabilities. And they make \nus proud to be a part of a community and country that respects the \nworth and civil rights of all of our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Grundy County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Grundy \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/09/senate-section/article/S4330-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/09/senate-section/article/S4330-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/09/senate-section/article/S4330-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4330-S4331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               2014 NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY--PM 49\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit the 2014 National Drug Control Strategy, a \n21st century approach to drug policy that is built on decades of \nresearch demonstrating that addiction is a disease of the brain--one \nthat can be prevented, treated, and from which people can recover. The \npages that follow lay out an evidence-based plan for real drug policy \nreform, spanning the spectrum of effective prevention, early \nintervention, treatment, recovery support, criminal justice, law \nenforcement, and international cooperation.\n  Illicit drug use and its consequences challenge our shared dream of \nbuilding for our children a country that is healthier, safer, and more \nprosperous. Illicit drug use is associated with addiction, disease, and \nlower academic\n\n[[Page S4331]]\n\nperformance among our young people. It contributes to crime, injury, \nand serious dangers on the Nation's roadways. And drug use and its \nconsequences jeopardize the progress we have made in strengthening our \neconomy--contributing to unemployment, impeding re-employment, and \ncosting our economy billions of dollars in lost productivity.\n  These facts, combined with the latest research about addiction as a \ndisease of the brain, helped shape the approach laid out in my \nAdministration's first National Drug Control Strategy--and they \ncontinue to guide our efforts to reform drug policy in a way that is \nmore efficient, effective, and equitable. Through the Affordable Care \nAct, millions of Americans will be able to obtain health insurance, \nincluding coverage for substance use disorder treatment services. We \nhave worked to reform our criminal justice system, addressing unfair \nsentencing disparities, providing alternatives to incarceration for \nnonviolent, substance-involved offenders, and improving prevention and \nre-entry programs to protect public safety and improve outcomes for \npeople returning to communities from prisons and jails. And we have \nbuilt stronger partnerships with our international allies, working with \nthem in a global effort against drug trafficking and transnational \norganized crime, while also assisting them in their efforts to address \nsubstance use disorders and related public health problems.\n  This progress gives us good reason to move forward with confidence. \nHowever, we cannot effectively build on this progress without \ncollaboration across all sectors of our society. I look forward to \njoining with community coalitions, faith-based groups, tribal \ncommunities, health care providers, law enforcement agencies, state and \nlocal governments, and our international partners to continue this \nimportant work in 2014. And I thank the Congress for its continued \nsupport of our efforts to build a healthier, safer, and more prosperous \ncountry.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, July 9, 2014.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/09/senate-section/article/S4331-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:49 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1528.

to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                          Senate Memorial 1174\n\n       Whereas, a reliable and affordable energy supply is vital \n     to Florida's economy and job growth, as well as the overall \n     interests of its citizens, and\n       Whereas, Florida supports an all-inclusive energy strategy \n     because it is in the best interest of the state and the \n     nation, and\n       Whereas, the United States has an abundant supply of coal \n     that provides economic and energy security benefits, \n     including affordable and reliable electricity, and\n       Whereas, carbon regulations for existing coal-fueled \n     electric generating units could threaten the affordability \n     and reliability of Florida's electricity supplies, and\n       Whereas, such regulations impose additional financial \n     burdens on electric generating units that have invested in \n     pollution controls to meet the recent mercury regulations of \n     the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and\n       Whereas, such burdens risk the closure of electric \n     generating units resulting in substantial job loss, and\n       Whereas, carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fueled electric \n     generating units in the United States represent only 3 \n     percent of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, and\n       Whereas, the United States Energy Information \n     Administration projects that carbon dioxide emissions from \n     the nation's electric sector will be 14 percent below 2005 \n     levels in 2020, and\n       Whereas, the United States Energy Information \n     Administration projects that carbon dioxide emissions from \n     the nation's coal-fueled electric generating units will be 19 \n     percent below 2005 levels in 2020, and\n       Whereas, on June 25, 2013, the President of the United \n     States directed the United States Environmental Protection \n     Agency to issue standards, regulations, and guidelines to \n     address carbon dioxide emissions from new, existing, \n     modified, and reconstructed fossil-fueled electric generating \n     units, and\n       Whereas, the President of the United States has recognized \n     that states will play a central role in establishing and \n     implementing carbon standards for existing electric \n     generating units, and\n       Whereas, the Clean Air Act requires the United States \n     Environmental Protection Agency to establish a procedure \n     under which\n\n[[Page S4334]]\n\n     each state must develop a plan for establishing and \n     implementing standards of performance for existing fossil-\n     fueled electric generating units within the state, and\n       Whereas, the Clean Air Act expressly allows states, in \n     developing and applying such standards of performance, to \n     take into consideration, among other factors, the remaining \n     useful life of an existing fossil-fueled electric generating \n     unit to which such standards apply, and\n       Whereas, the existing regulations of the United States \n     Environmental Protection Agency provide that states may adopt \n     less stringent emissions standards or longer compliance \n     schedules than the agency's guidelines based on factors such \n     as unreasonable cost of control, physical impossibility of \n     installing necessary control equipment, or other factors that \n     make less stringent standards or longer compliance times \n     significantly more reasonable, and\n       Whereas, it is in the best interest of electricity \n     consumers in Florida to continue to benefit from reliable, \n     affordable electricity provided by coal-based electric \n     generating units: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Florida: That \n     the Congress of the United States is urged to direct the \n     United States Environmental Protection Agency, in developing \n     guidelines for regulating carbon dioxide emissions from \n     existing fossil-fueled electric generating units, to:\n       (1) Respect the primacy of Florida and rely on state \n     regulators to develop performance standards for carbon \n     dioxide emissions which take into account the unique \n     policies, energy needs, resource mix, and economic priorities \n     of the state.\n       (2) Issue guidelines and approve state-established \n     performance standards that are based on reductions of carbon \n     dioxide emissions determined to be achievable by measures \n     undertaken at fossil-fueled electric generating units.\n       (3) Allow Florida to set less stringent performance \n     standards or longer compliance schedules for fossil-fueled \n     electric generating units.\n       (4) Give Florida maximum flexibility to implement carbon \n     dioxide performance standards for fossil-fueled electric \n     generating units;

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Colorado urging the United States Congress to pass \n     comprehensive federal legislation authorizing banks and \n     credit unions to serve legal marijuana and hemp businesses; \n     to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                      Senate Resolution No. 14-003\n\n       Whereas, All one hundred members of the Colorado General \n     Assembly took an oath to uphold the United States \n     constitution and the Colorado constitution; and\n       Whereas, Colorado voters recently approved Amendment 64, a \n     constitutional amendment to legalize the sale and consumption \n     of recreational marijuana in Colorado, with 55.23 percent of \n     the vote, or approximately 1.38 million votes, in favor of \n     legalization; and\n       Whereas, Hemp has long been recognized for its varied \n     industrial uses, was sold and used commercially in the \n     earliest days of our country's history, and was recognized as \n     a valuable cash crop by George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, \n     and Benjamin Franklin; and\n       Whereas, Federal laws, including the ``Controlled \n     Substances Act'', the ``Bank Secrecy Act'', and the \n     ``Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act'', prohibit banks \n     from providing financial services to marijuana and hemp \n     businesses; and\n       Whereas, Directives from federal regulatory agencies such \n     as the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, and \n     the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency also prohibit \n     bankers from accepting deposits from marijuana or hemp \n     businesses; and\n       Whereas, The ``USA PATRIOT Act'' directs financial \n     institutions to establish Enhanced Due Diligence policies, \n     procedures, and controls where necessary to detect and report \n     instances of suspected money laundering, which has led to the \n     adoption of Know Your Customer procedures; and\n       Whereas, Know Your Customer procedures require banks and \n     credit unions to verify the identity of their customers and \n     determine that the source of their funds is legitimate by \n     obtaining information about the nature of an account holder's \n     business, customers, and sources of funds; and\n       Whereas, Banks and credit unions that comply with the Know \n     Your Customer rules will be required by anti-money laundering \n     laws and regulations to file recurring suspicious activity \n     reports documenting the financial activities of a legal \n     marijuana business, including filing a currency transaction \n     report each time a marijuana business makes a deposit of more \n     than $10,000 and reporting cash that smells like marijuana; \n     and\n       Whereas, Marijuana remains classified as a schedule I \n     controlled substance at the federal level, the strictest \n     classification under the ``Controlled Substances Act'', and \n     the production of industrial hemp remains highly restricted \n     at the federal level; and\n       Whereas, The United States attorney general recently \n     announced guidance for financial institutions that wish to \n     provide banking services to legal marijuana businesses in \n     what has become known as the Cole Memo; and\n       Whereas, This guidance greatly adds to the reporting and \n     compliance requirements already demanded of banks and credit \n     unions, including ensuring that the marijuana businesses to \n     which they provide services do not sell to minors, transfer \n     marijuana to a state where its sale is illegal, involve \n     themselves with organized crime, sell illegal drugs, \n     encourage the use of marijuana on federal property, or \n     encourage drugged driving; and\n       Whereas, The United States Treasury's Financial Crimes \n     Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, in coordination with the \n     United States Department of Justice, also issued a memo \n     outlining expectations for compliance with the ``Bank \n     Secrecy Act'', including verifying the legitimacy of a \n     marijuana business's license and registration, developing \n     an understanding of the norm for marijuana business \n     transactions and monitoring each business for deviation \n     from the norm, monitoring publicly available sources for \n     adverse information on the business and any related \n     parties, and monitoring for suspicious activity on an \n     ongoing basis; and\n       Whereas, In April 2014, United States Senators Chuck \n     Grassley and Dianne Feinstein sent a letter to the director \n     of FinCEN, questioning FinCEN's legal authority to provide \n     banks guidance on violations of federal law and noting the \n     possibility that a financial institution might complete a \n     suspicious activity report regarding a marijuana business \n     customer, and then that specific report could be used against \n     the financial institution as evidence of the institution \n     being complicit in the act of money laundering; and\n       Whereas, Financial institutions face a significant \n     challenge in verifying that a marijuana business is in \n     compliance with all of the guidelines issued by the \n     Department of Justice and FinCEN and face uncertainty about \n     whether they would be reasonably protected from prosecution \n     or actions by regulatory agencies, now or in the future, on \n     the basis of guidance in non-binding memoranda; and\n       Whereas, The above-mentioned guidance is a directive to \n     federal prosecutors to avoid prosecuting financial \n     institutions that comply with the Cole Memo and FinCEN \n     guidance but does not limit punitive actions from federal \n     regulatory agencies, including several that operate outside \n     of the executive branch, such as the FDIC and the Federal \n     Reserve, whose regulatory actions could be just as damaging \n     to a financial institution's operations as prosecution; and\n       Whereas, The guidance is not enforceable in court, provides \n     neither a safe harbor from prosecution nor legal defense in \n     court, and can only be considered temporary, short-lived \n     guidance as it could be reversed by a future administration; \n     and\n       Whereas, The guidance from the United States Department of \n     Justice cannot override federal laws or regulations, which \n     still characterize acceptance of a deposit from a marijuana \n     business as money laundering; and\n       Whereas, Neither the United States Department of Justice \n     guidance nor the FinCEN memo provide adequate regulatory and \n     legal certainty for financial institutions to provide banking \n     services to the legal marijuana industry; and\n       Whereas, Under federal law, banks and credit unions that \n     conduct business with legal marijuana businesses will still \n     be in violation of the ``Bank Secrecy Act'', the ``Annunzio-\n     Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act'', and the ``USA PATRIOT \n     Act'', and any bank or credit union that chooses to serve \n     marijuana businesses effectively puts its regulatory status \n     at risk; and\n       Whereas, Colorado and Washington have already legalized \n     retail marijuana shops, and several other states will be \n     considering full legalization at the ballot in the 2014 \n     elections; and\n       Whereas, Twenty states have already legalized the sale and \n     consumption of medical marijuana for limited medical uses; \n     and\n       Whereas, The medical, retail, and hemp agricultural \n     businesses that are legally permitted to operate under state \n     laws in dozens of states are forced to operate as all-cash \n     businesses, including paying for capital investments such as \n     hydration and lighting equipment in cash, compensating \n     employees in cash, and renting or purchasing warehouses and \n     other real estate with large down payments in cash; and\n       Whereas, The medical, retail, and hemp agricultural \n     businesses can accept neither credit nor debit cards from \n     customers because electronic payments are handled through the \n     banking system; and\n       Whereas, Both the state of Colorado and its local \n     municipalities use bank accounts to audit sales tax \n     collections, and a lack of accounting information that is \n     typically available for such audits could mean that Colorado \n     governments are under-collecting tax revenue; and\n       Whereas, The storage and transfer of large amounts of cash \n     necessary for the legal operation of marijuana businesses has \n     already made these businesses a target for crime and could \n     attract the involvement of organized criminal enterprises; \n     and\n       Whereas, Colorado is unable to address this problem by \n     chartering a state bank or credit\n\n[[Page S4335]]\n\n     union because all financial institutions are interconnected \n     through federal banking laws and regulations that govern \n     national and international commerce: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Sixty-ninth General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado:\n       (1) That the ability of the federal executive branch to \n     facilitate a reasonable regulatory structure for the \n     marijuana industry is limited as long as federal law \n     categorizes marijuana as an illegal substance.\n       (2) That the best solution to the problem of a lack of \n     financial services for the legal marijuana industry will be \n     comprehensive federal legislation authorizing banks and \n     credit unions to serve legal marijuana and hemp businesses; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Resolution be sent to all \n     members of the Colorado delegation to the United States \n     Congress, the speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the United States Senate majority leader, \n     the United States Senate majority leader pro tempore, and the \n     president of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-292. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of North Carolina urging the \n     United States Congress and the President of the United States \n     to reauthorize the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program; to the \n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                       House Resolution No. 1261\n\n       Whereas, insurance helps protect the United States economy \n     from the adverse effects of the risks inherent in economic \n     and development while also providing the resources necessary \n     to rebuild physical and economic infrastructure, offer \n     indemnification for business disruption, and provide coverage \n     for medical and liability costs from injuries and loss of \n     life in the event of catastrophic losses to persons or \n     property; and\n       Whereas, the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, \n     produced insured losses larger than any natural or manmade \n     event in history, with claims paid by insurers to their \n     policy holders eventually totaling some $32.5 billion, making \n     this the second most costly insurance event in United States \n     history; and\n       Whereas, the sheer enormity of the loss, combined with the \n     possibility of future attacks, produced financial shockwaves \n     that shook insurance markets causing insurers and reinsurers \n     to exclude coverage arising from acts of terrorism from \n     virtually all commercial property and liability policies; and\n       Whereas, the lack of terrorism risk insurance contributed \n     to a paralysis in the economy, especially in construction, \n     tourism, business travel, and real estate finance; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress originally passed the \n     Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107-297 (TRIA), \n     in which the federal government agreed to provide terrorism \n     reinsurance to insurers and reauthorized this arrangement via \n     the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005, Pub. L. \n     109-144, and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program \n     Reauthorization Act of 2007, Pub. L. 110-160 (TRIPRA); and\n       Whereas, under TRIPRA the federal government provides such \n     reinsurance after industry-wide losses attributable to annual \n     certified terrorism events exceed $100 million; and\n       Whereas, coverage under TRIPRA is provided to individual \n     insurers after the insurer has incurred losses related to \n     terrorism equal to 20% of the insurer's previous year earned \n     premium for property-casualty lines; and\n       Whereas, after an individual insurer has reached such a \n     threshold, the insurer pays 15% of residual losses and the \n     federal government pay the remaining 85%; and\n       Whereas, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program has an annual \n     cap of $100 billion of aggregate insured losses, beyond which \n     the federal program does not provide coverage; and\n       Whereas, TRIPRA requires the federal government to recoup \n     100% of the benefits provided under the program via \n     policyholder surcharges to the extent the aggregate insured \n     losses are less than $27.5 billion and enables the government \n     to recoup expenditures beyond that mandatory recoupment \n     amount; and\n       Whereas, without question, TRIA and its successors are the \n     principal reason for the continued stability in the insurance \n     and reinsurance market for terrorism insurance to the benefit \n     of our overall economy; and\n       Whereas, the presence of a robust private-public \n     partnership has provided stability and predictability and has \n     allowed insurers to actively participate in the market in a \n     meaningful way; and\n       Whereas, without a program such as TRIPRA, many of our \n     citizens who want and need terrorism coverage to operate \n     their businesses all across the nation would be either unable \n     to get insurance or unable to afford the limited coverage \n     that would be available; and\n       Whereas, without federally provided reinsurance, property \n     and casualty insurers will face less availability of \n     terrorism reinsurance and will therefore be severely \n     restricted in their ability to provide sufficient coverage \n     for acts of terrorism to support our economy; and\n       Whereas, unfortunately, despite the hard work and \n     dedication of this nations's counterterrorism agencies and \n     the bravery of the men and women in uniform who fought and \n     continue to fight battles abroad to keep us safe here at \n     home, the threat from terrorist attacks in the United States \n     is both real and substantial and will remain as such for the \n     foreseeable future: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives:\n       Section 1. The members of the House of Representatives of \n     the State of North Carolina urge the United States Congress \n     and the President of the United States to reauthorize the \n     Terrorism Risk Insurance Program.\n       Section 2. The Principal Clerk shall transmit certified \n     copies of this resolution to the President of the United \n     States, the Speaker and clerk of the United States House of \n     Representative, the President Pro Tempore and the Secretary \n     of the United States Senate, the members of the North \n     Carolina Congressional delegation, and the news media of \n     North Carolina.\n       Section 3. This resolution is effective upon adoption.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-293. A substitute concurrent resolution adopted by the \n     Legislature of the State of Missouri memorializing the need \n     to preserve natural resources and provide recreational \n     development and other improvements for the public use; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n        Senate Substitute for House Concurrent Resolution No. 9\n\n       Whereas, in 1959, Senate Resolution No. 33 and House \n     Resolution No. 19, recognizing the importance of the \n     extraordinary manifestations of nature and recreational \n     attributes of the Current and Jacks Fork Riverways , \n     requested Congress to enact legislation to preserve the \n     natural resources and provide recreational development and \n     other improvements for the public use; and\n       Whereas, in 1964, Congress answered Missouri's request by \n     enacting legislation to establish the Ozark National Scenic \n     Riverways; and\n       Whereas, the riverways within the Ozark National Scenic \n     Riverways are, and remain, public highways of the State of \n     Missouri, subject to concurrent jurisdiction between the \n     State of Missouri and the United States under Missouri Senate \n     Bill No. .362 enacted in 1971; and\n       Whereas, in 2005, the National Park Service began \n     researching for the purpose of drafting a new general \n     management plan for the Ozark National Scenic Riverways; and\n       Whereas, the National Park Service is advocating the \n     ``Preferred Alternative'' option of the general management \n     plan; and\n       Whereas, the goal of the ``Preferred Alternative'' option \n     of the general management plan is to shut down public access \n     points to riverways, eliminate motorized boat traffic from \n     certain areas, further restrict boat motor horsepower in \n     other areas, close several gravel bars, and propose that \n     additional areas be designated as federal wilderness; and\n       Whereas, the ``No-Action Alternative'' option of the \n     general management plan is an appropriate balance between \n     resource preservation and opportunities for recreational use; \n     and\n       Whereas, the general management plan will guide decisions \n     related to the Ozark National Scenic Riverways for the next \n     15 to 20 years; and\n       Whereas, tourism is one of the most critical components of \n     our rural economy; and\n       Whereas, thousands of hikers, campers, boaters, hunters, \n     fishermen, and horseback riders visit these areas annually \n     generating irreplaceable tax revenue; and\n       Whereas, any further limitations on the access to these \n     riverways would severely impact this local economy;\n       Whereas, the Missouri Conservation Commission is charged \n     with the control, management, restoration, conservation, and \n     regulation of bird, fish, game, forestry, and all wildlife \n     resources of the state, including hatcheries, sanctuaries, \n     refuges, reservations, and all other property owned, \n     acquired, or used for such purposes; and\n       Whereas, in September of 2009, the Missouri Department of \n     Conservation recommended that ``hunting, fishing, and \n     trapping continue to be allowed through the Ozark National \n     Scenic Riverways except in highly developed areas where a \n     reasonable safety zone for public protection may be required: \n     Now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the members of the Missouri Senate, Ninety-\n     seventh General Assembly, Second Regular Session, the House \n     of Representatives concurring therein, hereby strongly urge \n     the United States Department of the Interior National Park \n     Service to pursue one of the following three options in \n     regard to the Ozark National Scenic Riverways:\n       1. Choose the ``No-Action Alternative'' option of the \n     general management plan;\n       2. Enter into negotiations with the State of Missouri, \n     Department of Conservation for the return of the Ozark \n     National Scenic Riverways to the State of Missouri so that \n     the land will continued to be used for its original and \n     intended purpose; or\n       3. Enter into a contract with the State of Missouri, \n     Department of Conservation for the management, operation, and \n     maintenance of the Ozark National Scenic Riverways; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved That the Chief Clerk of the Missouri House of \n     Representatives be instructed to prepare properly inscribed \n     copies of this resolution for the President Pro Tempore of \n     the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, the Secretary of the United States \n     Department\n\n[[Page S4336]]\n\n     of the Interior, each member of the Missouri Congressional \n     Delegation, the Director of the National Park Service, the \n     Superintendent of the Ozark National Scenic Riverways, the \n     Director of the Missouri Department of Conservation, and \n     Governor Jay Nixon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/09/senate-section/article/S4336-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. CARPER, from the Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs, without amendment:\n       H.R. 1376.

Mr. President, this a very important piece of legislation. \nMost of the nuclear weapons program workers are in Nevada, at the \nNevada test site. At one time we had 12,000 people working there on a \nweapons program and many of them got sick because we didn't know the \ndangers of nuclear weapons. We had many of them sitting above ground \nand soldiers and workers would be out there with stuff floating around. \nPeople can drive out there, if they can get through all the security \ncheckpoints, but they have bleachers still there that were set up to \nwatch the nuclear weapons go off. Then we had about 1,000 nuclear \ndevices at the Nevada test site that were detonated above ground, in \ntunnels, in shafts. So there truly does need to be a day of \nremembrance, and I congratulate those Senators who have moved this \nforward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/09/senate-section/article/S4364-4", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4364-S4365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HONORING THE LIFE AND CAREER OF CHARLES ``CHUCK'' NOLL\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I had a conversation with the Republican \nleader on Monday, and we went over the things we have to do this work \nperiod. We have a lot to do. One of the things we are trying to do--\nbecause we have so much going on around the country; namely, in our \nStates--is we want to try to balance what we do and, frankly, we have \nsome people running for office. But we have made great progress this \nweek so far. We have been able to reach agreement on a number of things \nthat we believe are important.\n  So having said that--and I have gone over what we are going to do in \nthe next few days--I think it would be appropriate to announce to \neveryone that we are going to not have any votes on Monday. We have \nwork we are going to have to do here Monday, but we are not going to \nhave any votes. I think it is important Senators know that. We were \nplanning on having a number of votes on Monday. I think that is not \nnecessary now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/09/senate-section/article/S4365-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JULY 10, 2014\n\n  Mr. REID.
