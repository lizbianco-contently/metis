Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate CW2 \nRoger Capps on receiving the Defense of Freedom Medal, honoring his \nservice and sacrifice while working in Afghanistan. It gives me great \npleasure to see a member of the Nevada family being recognized with \nthis prestigious medal.\n  In April of 2013, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Capps, then a traditional \nlieutenant colonel, was transporting military equipment across \nAfghanistan for Columbia Helicopters. During the trip, he was struck by \nan insurgent-shot bullet that had entered the helicopter by a rare \nopening in the bulletproof flooring, ultimately shattering his femur \nand pelvis. Though he will not receive a Purple Heart because he was \nworking as a civilian that day, he will receive this unique Defense of \nFreedom Medal presented to civilian employees who are killed or wounded \nwhile working in support of the Department of Defense. His service \nremains invaluable to this great Nation.\n  Even after this difficult day, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Capps \nmaintained a positive spirit. While recovering from his injuries, he \nreassessed his military future, ultimately opting to utilize his \npiloting skills. In May, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Capps resigned his \ncommission and transferred to the warrant officer corps. He now serves \nour Nation flying Chinook helicopters for the Army Guard.\n  I extend my deepest gratitude to Chief Warrant Officer 2 Capps for \nhis bravery in serving the United States of America. His unwavering \ncommitment to serving our Nation demonstrates his genuine selfless \ncharacter and love for his country. His actions represent only the \ngreatest of Nevada's values, including dedication, courage, and a \nspirit to persevere in the most difficult times.\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I recognize \nthat Congress has a responsibility not only to honor these brave \nindividuals who serve our Nation but also to ensure they are cared for \nwhen they return home. I remain committed to upholding this promise for \nour veterans and servicemembers in Nevada and throughout the Nation. \nChief Warrant Officer 2 Capps' sacrifice warrants only the greatest \nrespect and care in return.\n  Throughout his tenure, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Capps has demonstrated \nunparalleled bravery and positivity. I am both humbled and honored by \nhis service and am proud to call him a fellow Nevadan. Today I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in congratulating Chief Warrant Officer 2 Capps \non his much-deserved accolade and wish him well in all of his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/24/senate-section/article/S6935-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6935-S6937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     NOMINATION OF FRANK ROSE AND OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE FROM THE \n  DEPARTMENT OF STATE ON PROPOSED EUROPEAN UNION CODE OF CONDUCT FOR \n                         OUTER SPACE ACTIVITIES\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned by proposals \nfor arms control plans related to missile defense and outer space arms, \nincluding the EU Code of Conduct for Outer Space activities, which the \nObama administration has embraced. These plans were confirmed by Rose \nGottemoeller, Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security, during a House subcommittee hearing last week. \nI firmly believe any international agreement on a code of conduct for \nspace should be submitted for Senate advice and consent as part of its \ntreaty powers, and not be an ``executive agreement'' that sidesteps \nthat process.\n  I have engaged with the State Department to ensure that this \nagreement will not be a unilateral act and that it will be fully \npresented to Congress before moving forward. I strongly believe, given \nthe importance of this issue, that the U.S. Senate should be consulted \nas part of their advice and consent role in any decision to move \nforward.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record at the end of my remarks official \nletters and correspondence with the nominee, Deputy Assistant Secretary \nof State, Frank Rose that demonstrate three important points. First, \ndue to serious ongoing concerns related to national security, the \nadministration has not pursued plans to propose the negotiation of a \ndebris-generating ASAT testing moratorium at this time; second, that \nany decision to subscribe to a code in the future will not in any way \nconstrain our national security-related activities in space or ability \nto protect the U.S. or allies; third, and most importantly, that the \nSenate will be given access to the details surrounding any plan once \nand if any format is determined, and again before any agreement is \nentered.\n  Space is vital to our national security, and we must maintain the \nability to use satellites and various missile capabilities. In \nparticular, space is of critical importance to our national \nintelligence and warfighting capabilities. The development of anti-\nsatellite capabilities by countries such as China and Russia is well \ndocumented, as in the example of China successfully testing a direct-\nascent, anti-satellite SC-19 missile against one of its own satellites.\n  It is vital that the United States ensure we are not restricting \nactivity in ways that put our security at risk. Members of Congress \nhave been clear in their view that they see ample disadvantage to such \na code for the United States; according to assessments by the uniformed \nmilitary, implementation of this code would result in real world \noperational impacts. Congress has previously voted to limit \ninternational agreements concerning outer space activities. Section 913 \nof the fiscal year 2013 National Defense Authorization Act, H.R. 4310, \nstates that any agreement will have no legally binding effect or basis \nfor limiting the activities of the United States in outer space, and it \nrequires certification that any such agreement will be equitable, \nenhance national security, and have no militarily significant impact on \nthe ability of the United States to conduct military or intelligence \nactivities in space.\n  There are several key areas that the administration must resolve \nbefore moving forward on pursuing any decision. Pentagon officials have \nlong expressed concern that the arms initiative will be exploited by \nstates such as China and Russia to constrain U.S. missile defenses, \nwhile both states continue to develop their own advanced missile \ndefenses. In 2007, the Department of Defense concluded that the \nprogress in addressing the vulnerability of U.S. space assets has not \nkept pace with growing threat capabilities; consequently, the \nvulnerability of our space assets continues to grow. Additionally, a \nprevious U.S. Commission to Assess United States National Security \nSpace Management and Organization released a report that predicted that \nfuture warfare in space was a ``virtual certainty'' and urged the \nUnited States to begin to develop the means both to deter and defend \nagainst attacks on its space assets, and to mount offensive operations \nto deny the use of space to potential adversaries. To do otherwise, the \ncommission warned, would invite a ``space Pearl Harbor.''\n  Further troubling, a 2014 Department of Defense report noted that \nChina is ``developing a multi-dimensional program to improve its \ncapabilities to limit or prevent the use of space-based assets by \nadversaries during times of crisis or conflict,'' including \n``destroying or capturing satellites and other sensors.'' To protect \nagainst these types of attacks, the Department of Defense's ongoing \npolicy is aimed at retaining the capabilities to respond at the time \nand place of our choosing. Any effort to move forward must address our \nnational security needs and Congressional concerns.\n  Therefore, any State Department effort to move forward with a code or \na debris-generating ASAT testing moratorium should fully overcome \nexisting concerns and ensure the plan does not undermine current \nDepartment of Defense policy, U.S. capabilities, or congressional \nconcerns. Our growing dependence on space makes it fundamental to U.S. \nnational security interests. I remain extremely concerned by what \nappears to be previous endeavors by the administration to avoid \naddressing space policy concerns and potential administration efforts \nto bypass Congress.\n  While I am pleased at the assurances that Mr. Rose has provided and \nthat relevant offices will engage with Congress if a path forward is \nagreed upon,\n\n[[Page S6936]]\n\nI remain extremely concerned about the decision to negotiate a measure \nusing past measures such as the European Union's Code of Conduct as a \nstarting point. Russia has demonstrated its willingness to break its \nagreements, as seen with the ongoing violation of the 1987 \nIntermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty. We need to improve our \ncapacity to understand what is going on in space, and we need to ensure \nwe are adequately capable of deterring the growing number of countries \nthat are pursuing weapons capable of targeting U.S. satellites.\n  While necessary, the development of transparency and confidence-\nbuilding measures and behavioral norms promoting responsible space \noperations should not come at the expense of America's national \nsecurity. The President's own Space Policy released in 2010 states: \n``The United States will employ a variety of measures to help assure \nthe use of space for all responsible parties, and, consistent with the \ninherent right of self-defense, deter others from interference and \nattack, defend our space systems and contribute to the defense of \nallied space systems, and, if deterrence fails, defeat efforts to \nattack them.'' With a growing number of states acquiring the ability to \ndegrade or destroy U.S. space capabilities, the probability that space \nsystems will come under attack in a future crisis or conflict is ever \nincreasing. The State Department cannot have the attitude that they are \ngoing to go it alone. The United States cannot afford it.\n  The material is as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 12, 2014.\n     Mr. Frank Rose,\n     Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Space and Defense \n         Policy,\n     U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Rose: We write to \n     ask for your clarification regarding the Administration's \n     space arms control posture. Like you, we are deeply concerned \n     by the rising threats of anti-satellite weapons in the hands \n     of states like the People's Republic of China. That said, we \n     believe the Administration would do better to focus on real \n     solutions to these threats, as opposed to more feel good \n     measures like the European Union's (EU) Code of Conduct for \n     Outer Space activities or other similar measures.\n       We are concerned by proposals for outer space arms control, \n     including the EU Code of Conduct for Outer Space activities, \n     which the Administration has embraced. We see no advantage to \n     such a Code for the United States; according to assessments \n     by the uniformed military, implementation of this code would \n     result in real world operational impacts. The product of this \n     equation demands the opposition of the entire United States \n     government.\n       With the languishing of that Code, we fear a new threat to \n     our ability to protect U.S. outer space capabilities, and, \n     perhaps even to develop our missile defenses. We seek your \n     understanding of the Administration's position on space arms \n     control, specifically, the ``debris generating kinetic energy \n     ASAT testing moratorium'' which, as we have been informed, \n     you proposed to U.S. allies. We are unfamiliar with any such \n     proposal having been coordinated with the Department of \n     Defense or the uniformed military, and therefore we ask for \n     your answers to the following questions:\n       1) Please indicate the date, and by which Department \n     official, the State Department Circular 175 request was \n     signed. What was the scope of this Circ-175 and has the \n     Department determined if this moratorium would be submitted \n     to the Senate for its advice and consent?\n       2) If this Circ-175 will not be submitted to the Senate, on \n     what basis would such an international agreement be \n     negotiated and to what end?\n       3) Please detail the potential implications for United \n     States space and missile defense activities. How would such \n     an agreement protect our ability to fully develop our missile \n     defenses, including our test and targets program?\n       4) Please further detail how such agreement will ensure \n     full freedom of action for the United States to take needed \n     defensive and other action in space.\n       5) Please provide the Joint Staff assessment of impacts to \n     military operations you obtained before discussing this \n     moratorium with our allies.\n       6) Please detail the specific allies with which you have \n     discussed this moratorium and the respective dates of \n     discussion. Please further detail which State Department \n     official authorized these discussions.\n       We appreciate your prompt responses to these questions.\n           Sincerely,\n     David Vitter,\n       United States Senator.\n     Doug Lamborn,\n       Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 17, 2014.\n       Dear Senator Vitter: Thank you for your letter of November \n     12 regarding the Administration's efforts to enhance the \n     security and sustainability of the outer space environment.\n       The Administration is deeply concerned about the \n     development of anti-satellite (ASAT) capabilities by \n     countries like China and Russia. In response to this \n     increasing threat, the Department of State is pursuing a \n     comprehensive approach to space security, including the \n     development of bilateral and multilateral transparency and \n     confidence building measures (TCBMs) such as the \n     International Code of Conduct, development of international \n     long-term sustainability guidelines by the UN Committee on \n     the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, and other measures. The \n     Administration believes that pragmatic TCBMs like the Code \n     are a much more effective way to ensure the long-term \n     security of the space environment as compared to \n     fundamentally flawed space arms control proposals like the \n     Russian-Chinese sponsored Prevention of Placement of Weapons \n     in Outer Space Treaty.\n       The United States has made clear to our partners that we \n     will not enter into a code of conduct, or other agreement, \n     that in any way constrains our national security-related \n     activities in space or our ability to protect the United \n     States and our allies. We have worked closely with our \n     colleagues in the Defense Department and Intelligence \n     Community to ensure that the Code does not have any adverse \n     impact on U.S. operations, including the development and \n     testing of missile defenses. The Department, in coordination \n     with the interagency, provided a series of briefings to \n     Congress on the Administration's decision-making process \n     regarding our willingness to work with our European allies to \n     help craft a Code that would benefit U.S. national security. \n     We are available to provide updates at any time.\n       The Administration has been clear that we are open to space \n     arms control proposals. However, any such proposal would need \n     to meet the criteria as outlined in the President's 2010 \n     National Space Policy (NSP)--that it be effectively \n     verifiable, equitable, and in the interests of the United \n     States and its allies. At this time, the Administration has \n     made no decision to propose the negotiation of a debris-\n     generating ASAT testing moratorium, and therefore, no C-175 \n     request has been signed. If a decision were made to move \n     forward with a proposal in the future, we would work closely \n     with the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community to \n     ensure there were no adverse operational impacts from our \n     efforts, especially on our missile defense and space systems. \n     Furthermore, while we discuss a wide variety of space \n     security issues with allies--including the potential for a \n     Code of Conduct and ways to address the development of ASAT \n     systems--we have not made a specific proposal to allies for \n     negotiation of a debris-generating ASAT testing moratorium.\n       The Department is fully committed to closely coordinating \n     all diplomatic space security proposals within the U.S. \n     interagency. We would not table a proposal that had not \n     received full U.S. Government approval and took into account \n     all agencies' perspectives.\n       Should you wish to have further discussions on this issue, \n     the Administration would be happy to assemble an interagency \n     team to meet with you to provide further background on our \n     efforts, and answer any additional questions you may have.\n       We hope this information is useful. Please do not hesitate \n     to contact us if we can be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Julia Frifield,\n     Assistant Secretary, Legislative Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 10, 2014.\n       Dear Senator Vitter, In response to follow-up questions \n     from your staff, we would like to provide the following \n     clarifications about our efforts to promote the security and \n     long-term sustainability of the outer space environment.\n       As I noted in my letter of November 12, 2014, the \n     Administration is seriously concerned about the development \n     of anti-satellite capabilities by countries like China. We \n     believe that effective diplomatic efforts are a critical tool \n     in the United States' comprehensive response to countering \n     this threat. At the same time, we recognize your concerns and \n     want to assure you that we share them. We have made every \n     effort to ensure that our diplomatic efforts to promote the \n     security and sustainability of outer space do not have an \n     adverse impact on our national security activities, \n     especially on our missile defense and space systems.\n       The administration has no plans to propose the negotiation \n     of a debris-generating ASAT testing moratorium at this time. \n     Moreover, there has been no consideration as to what format \n     we would seek for any proposed debris-generating ASAT testing \n     moratorium. As a result, no C-175 package has been prepared.\n       Currently, our diplomatic focus is on the development of an \n     International Code of Conduct on Outer Space Activities. At \n     this time, the European Union is considering its next steps \n     on the Code. As we stated in 2012, the United States has \n     decided to work with the European Union and other nations to \n     help develop a code which can help maintain the long-term \n     sustainability, safety, stability and security of outer space \n     by establishing guidelines for the responsible use of outer \n     space. Since the text of the Code has not been finalized, the \n     Administration has\n\n[[Page S6937]]\n\n     made no decision on whether to subscribe to the code. Only \n     after the text is finalized and open for subscription will \n     the Administration consider whether to subscribe to the Code. \n     Such a decision will be made only after it received full U.S. \n     Government approval that takes into account perspectives from \n     all departments and agencies.\n       As former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated in \n     January 2012, the United States will not sign-up to a Code of \n     Conduct that any way constrains our national security-related \n     activities in space or our ability to protect the United \n     States or our allies. If the United States were to make a \n     decision to subscribe to a Code in the future, it would be \n     implemented in a way that is fully consistent with this \n     statement.\n       Let me also assure you that we are in close contact with \n     our Department of Defense and Intelligence Community \n     colleagues on the development of the Code to ensure the Code \n     does not have any adverse impacts on U.S. operations, \n     including the development and testing of missile defenses.\n       Should you wish to have further discussions on this issue, \n     we would be prepared to assemble an interagency team to meet \n     with you or your staff. Please do not hesitate to contact us \n     if we can be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Julia Frifield,\n     Assistant Secretary, Legislative Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 11, 2014.\n       Dear Senator Vitter: I wanted to follow-up with regarding \n     the conversation I had with your staff regarding a potential \n     debris generating anti-satellite (ASAT) testing moratorium \n     and the European Union's proposed International Code of \n     Conduct for Outer Space Activities.\n       As Assistant Secretary of State Julia Frifield noted in her \n     December 10, 2014, letter to you, the Administration has no \n     plans to propose the negotiation of a debris-generating ASAT \n     testing moratorium at this time. Should we determine to \n     pursue such an agreement in the future, I pledge to keep you \n     and your staff informed, including on the form of which a \n     potential agreement might take.\n       With regard to the Code of Conduct, it is my understanding \n     that there are no implementation issues for the Department of \n     Defense related to the current draft of the Code. That said, \n     only after the text of the Code is finalized will we have a \n     full understanding of any potential implementation issues. \n     Therefore, we continue to be in close contact with our \n     colleagues at the Department of Defense and the Intelligence \n     Community to ensure that our efforts to promote the security \n     and sustainability of outer space do not have an adverse \n     impact on our national security activities, especially on our \n     missile defense and national security space systems.\n       Before a final decision is made to subscribe to the Code, \n     the Department, along with our interagency colleagues, will \n     make sure to provide a briefing, including relevant materials \n     such as the text of the Code and other materials, to you and \n     the relevant committees on the terms of the agreement, its \n     implementation, and any other issues of interest.\n       I appreciate your interest in these issues. Please do not \n     hesitate to reach out to me or my staff in the future with \n     any questions you may have.\n           Regards,\n\n                                                Frank A.

Pentagon officials have \nlong expressed concern that the arms initiative will be exploited by \nstates such as China and Russia to constrain U.S. missile defenses, \nwhile both states continue to develop their own advanced missile \ndefenses. In 2007, the Department of Defense concluded that the \nprogress in addressing the vulnerability of U.S. space assets has not \nkept pace with growing threat capabilities; consequently, the \nvulnerability of our space assets continues to grow. Additionally, a \nprevious U.S. Commission to Assess United States National Security \nSpace Management and Organization released a report that predicted that \nfuture warfare in space was a ``virtual certainty'' and urged the \nUnited States to begin to develop the means both to deter and defend \nagainst attacks on its space assets, and to mount offensive operations \nto deny the use of space to potential adversaries. To do otherwise, the \ncommission warned, would invite a ``space Pearl Harbor.''\n  Further troubling, a 2014 Department of Defense report noted that \nChina is ``developing a multi-dimensional program to improve its \ncapabilities to limit or prevent the use of space-based assets by \nadversaries during times of crisis or conflict,'' including \n``destroying or capturing satellites and other sensors.'' To protect \nagainst these types of attacks, the Department of Defense's ongoing \npolicy is aimed at retaining the capabilities to respond at the time \nand place of our choosing. Any effort to move forward must address our \nnational security needs and Congressional concerns.\n  Therefore, any State Department effort to move forward with a code or \na debris-generating ASAT testing moratorium should fully overcome \nexisting concerns and ensure the plan does not undermine current \nDepartment of Defense policy, U.S. capabilities, or congressional \nconcerns. Our growing dependence on space makes it fundamental to U.S. \nnational security interests. I remain extremely concerned by what \nappears to be previous endeavors by the administration to avoid \naddressing space policy concerns and potential administration efforts \nto bypass Congress.\n  While I am pleased at the assurances that Mr. Rose has provided and \nthat relevant offices will engage with Congress if a path forward is \nagreed upon,\n\n[[Page S6936]]\n\nI remain extremely concerned about the decision to negotiate a measure \nusing past measures such as the European Union's Code of Conduct as a \nstarting point. Russia has demonstrated its willingness to break its \nagreements, as seen with the ongoing violation of the 1987 \nIntermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty. We need to improve our \ncapacity to understand what is going on in space, and we need to ensure \nwe are adequately capable of deterring the growing number of countries \nthat are pursuing weapons capable of targeting U.S. satellites.\n  While necessary, the development of transparency and confidence-\nbuilding measures and behavioral norms promoting responsible space \noperations should not come at the expense of America's national \nsecurity. The President's own Space Policy released in 2010 states: \n``The United States will employ a variety of measures to help assure \nthe use of space for all responsible parties, and, consistent with the \ninherent right of self-defense, deter others from interference and \nattack, defend our space systems and contribute to the defense of \nallied space systems, and, if deterrence fails, defeat efforts to \nattack them.'' With a growing number of states acquiring the ability to \ndegrade or destroy U.S. space capabilities, the probability that space \nsystems will come under attack in a future crisis or conflict is ever \nincreasing. The State Department cannot have the attitude that they are \ngoing to go it alone. The United States cannot afford it.\n  The material is as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 12, 2014.\n     Mr. Frank Rose,\n     Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Space and Defense \n         Policy,\n     U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Rose: We write to \n     ask for your clarification regarding the Administration's \n     space arms control posture. Like you, we are deeply concerned \n     by the rising threats of anti-satellite weapons in the hands \n     of states like the People's Republic of China. That said, we \n     believe the Administration would do better to focus on real \n     solutions to these threats, as opposed to more feel good \n     measures like the European Union's (EU) Code of Conduct for \n     Outer Space activities or other similar measures.\n       We are concerned by proposals for outer space arms control, \n     including the EU Code of Conduct for Outer Space activities, \n     which the Administration has embraced. We see no advantage to \n     such a Code for the United States; according to assessments \n     by the uniformed military, implementation of this code would \n     result in real world operational impacts. The product of this \n     equation demands the opposition of the entire United States \n     government.\n       With the languishing of that Code, we fear a new threat to \n     our ability to protect U.S. outer space capabilities, and, \n     perhaps even to develop our missile defenses. We seek your \n     understanding of the Administration's position on space arms \n     control, specifically, the ``debris generating kinetic energy \n     ASAT testing moratorium'' which, as we have been informed, \n     you proposed to U.S. allies. We are unfamiliar with any such \n     proposal having been coordinated with the Department of \n     Defense or the uniformed military, and therefore we ask for \n     your answers to the following questions:\n       1) Please indicate the date, and by which Department \n     official, the State Department Circular 175 request was \n     signed. What was the scope of this Circ-175 and has the \n     Department determined if this moratorium would be submitted \n     to the Senate for its advice and consent?\n       2) If this Circ-175 will not be submitted to the Senate, on \n     what basis would such an international agreement be \n     negotiated and to what end?\n       3) Please detail the potential implications for United \n     States space and missile defense activities. How would such \n     an agreement protect our ability to fully develop our missile \n     defenses, including our test and targets program?\n       4) Please further detail how such agreement will ensure \n     full freedom of action for the United States to take needed \n     defensive and other action in space.\n       5) Please provide the Joint Staff assessment of impacts to \n     military operations you obtained before discussing this \n     moratorium with our allies.\n       6) Please detail the specific allies with which you have \n     discussed this moratorium and the respective dates of \n     discussion. Please further detail which State Department \n     official authorized these discussions.\n       We appreciate your prompt responses to these questions.\n           Sincerely,\n     David Vitter,\n       United States Senator.\n     Doug Lamborn,\n       Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 17, 2014.\n       Dear Senator Vitter: Thank you for your letter of November \n     12 regarding the Administration's efforts to enhance the \n     security and sustainability of the outer space environment.\n       The Administration is deeply concerned about the \n     development of anti-satellite (ASAT) capabilities by \n     countries like China and Russia. In response to this \n     increasing threat, the Department of State is pursuing a \n     comprehensive approach to space security, including the \n     development of bilateral and multilateral transparency and \n     confidence building measures (TCBMs) such as the \n     International Code of Conduct, development of international \n     long-term sustainability guidelines by the UN Committee on \n     the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, and other measures. The \n     Administration believes that pragmatic TCBMs like the Code \n     are a much more effective way to ensure the long-term \n     security of the space environment as compared to \n     fundamentally flawed space arms control proposals like the \n     Russian-Chinese sponsored Prevention of Placement of Weapons \n     in Outer Space Treaty.\n       The United States has made clear to our partners that we \n     will not enter into a code of conduct, or other agreement, \n     that in any way constrains our national security-related \n     activities in space or our ability to protect the United \n     States and our allies. We have worked closely with our \n     colleagues in the Defense Department and Intelligence \n     Community to ensure that the Code does not have any adverse \n     impact on U.S. operations, including the development and \n     testing of missile defenses. The Department, in coordination \n     with the interagency, provided a series of briefings to \n     Congress on the Administration's decision-making process \n     regarding our willingness to work with our European allies to \n     help craft a Code that would benefit U.S. national security. \n     We are available to provide updates at any time.\n       The Administration has been clear that we are open to space \n     arms control proposals. However, any such proposal would need \n     to meet the criteria as outlined in the President's 2010 \n     National Space Policy (NSP)--that it be effectively \n     verifiable, equitable, and in the interests of the United \n     States and its allies. At this time, the Administration has \n     made no decision to propose the negotiation of a debris-\n     generating ASAT testing moratorium, and therefore, no C-175 \n     request has been signed. If a decision were made to move \n     forward with a proposal in the future, we would work closely \n     with the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community to \n     ensure there were no adverse operational impacts from our \n     efforts, especially on our missile defense and space systems. \n     Furthermore, while we discuss a wide variety of space \n     security issues with allies--including the potential for a \n     Code of Conduct and ways to address the development of ASAT \n     systems--we have not made a specific proposal to allies for \n     negotiation of a debris-generating ASAT testing moratorium.\n       The Department is fully committed to closely coordinating \n     all diplomatic space security proposals within the U.S. \n     interagency. We would not table a proposal that had not \n     received full U.S. Government approval and took into account \n     all agencies' perspectives.\n       Should you wish to have further discussions on this issue, \n     the Administration would be happy to assemble an interagency \n     team to meet with you to provide further background on our \n     efforts, and answer any additional questions you may have.\n       We hope this information is useful. Please do not hesitate \n     to contact us if we can be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Julia Frifield,\n     Assistant Secretary, Legislative Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 10, 2014.\n       Dear Senator Vitter, In response to follow-up questions \n     from your staff, we would like to provide the following \n     clarifications about our efforts to promote the security and \n     long-term sustainability of the outer space environment.\n       As I noted in my letter of November 12, 2014, the \n     Administration is seriously concerned about the development \n     of anti-satellite capabilities by countries like China. We \n     believe that effective diplomatic efforts are a critical tool \n     in the United States' comprehensive response to countering \n     this threat. At the same time, we recognize your concerns and \n     want to assure you that we share them. We have made every \n     effort to ensure that our diplomatic efforts to promote the \n     security and sustainability of outer space do not have an \n     adverse impact on our national security activities, \n     especially on our missile defense and space systems.\n       The administration has no plans to propose the negotiation \n     of a debris-generating ASAT testing moratorium at this time. \n     Moreover, there has been no consideration as to what format \n     we would seek for any proposed debris-generating ASAT testing \n     moratorium. As a result, no C-175 package has been prepared.\n       Currently, our diplomatic focus is on the development of an \n     International Code of Conduct on Outer Space Activities. At \n     this time, the European Union is considering its next steps \n     on the Code. As we stated in 2012, the United States has \n     decided to work with the European Union and other nations to \n     help develop a code which can help maintain the long-term \n     sustainability, safety, stability and security of outer space \n     by establishing guidelines for the responsible use of outer \n     space. Since the text of the Code has not been finalized, the \n     Administration has\n\n[[Page S6937]]\n\n     made no decision on whether to subscribe to the code. Only \n     after the text is finalized and open for subscription will \n     the Administration consider whether to subscribe to the Code. \n     Such a decision will be made only after it received full U.S. \n     Government approval that takes into account perspectives from \n     all departments and agencies.\n       As former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated in \n     January 2012, the United States will not sign-up to a Code of \n     Conduct that any way constrains our national security-related \n     activities in space or our ability to protect the United \n     States or our allies. If the United States were to make a \n     decision to subscribe to a Code in the future, it would be \n     implemented in a way that is fully consistent with this \n     statement.\n       Let me also assure you that we are in close contact with \n     our Department of Defense and Intelligence Community \n     colleagues on the development of the Code to ensure the Code \n     does not have any adverse impacts on U.S. operations, \n     including the development and testing of missile defenses.\n       Should you wish to have further discussions on this issue, \n     we would be prepared to assemble an interagency team to meet \n     with you or your staff. Please do not hesitate to contact us \n     if we can be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Julia Frifield,\n     Assistant Secretary, Legislative Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 11, 2014.\n       Dear Senator Vitter: I wanted to follow-up with regarding \n     the conversation I had with your staff regarding a potential \n     debris generating anti-satellite (ASAT) testing moratorium \n     and the European Union's proposed International Code of \n     Conduct for Outer Space Activities.\n       As Assistant Secretary of State Julia Frifield noted in her \n     December 10, 2014, letter to you, the Administration has no \n     plans to propose the negotiation of a debris-generating ASAT \n     testing moratorium at this time. Should we determine to \n     pursue such an agreement in the future, I pledge to keep you \n     and your staff informed, including on the form of which a \n     potential agreement might take.\n       With regard to the Code of Conduct, it is my understanding \n     that there are no implementation issues for the Department of \n     Defense related to the current draft of the Code. That said, \n     only after the text of the Code is finalized will we have a \n     full understanding of any potential implementation issues. \n     Therefore, we continue to be in close contact with our \n     colleagues at the Department of Defense and the Intelligence \n     Community to ensure that our efforts to promote the security \n     and sustainability of outer space do not have an adverse \n     impact on our national security activities, especially on our \n     missile defense and national security space systems.\n       Before a final decision is made to subscribe to the Code, \n     the Department, along with our interagency colleagues, will \n     make sure to provide a briefing, including relevant materials \n     such as the text of the Code and other materials, to you and \n     the relevant committees on the terms of the agreement, its \n     implementation, and any other issues of interest.\n       I appreciate your interest in these issues. Please do not \n     hesitate to reach out to me or my staff in the future with \n     any questions you may have.\n           Regards,\n\n                                                Frank A.

Mr. President, I also wish to pay tribute to a \nman I have admired throughout my career in this Chamber, Senator Tim \nJohnson of South Dakota. I am proud to call Tim my friend.\n  Long before Senator Johnson and I crossed paths in the Senate, we \nwere both studying at Michigan State University--I was an undergrad \nwhile Senator Johnson was doing postgraduate studies. In fact, his \nparents retired in the East Lansing area. I know that Senator Johnson \nconsiders the University of South Dakota to be his alma mater, but I \nwill always think of him as a fellow Spartan.\n  All of us here are committed to public service, to defending the \nConstitution and to protecting our Nation against foreign threats, but \nfew of us have had our commitment tested as Senator Johnson has.\n  In 2004 Senator Johnson learned that he had prostate cancer, but he \nwas determined to beat it and to continue representing the people of \nSouth Dakota. ``I wish this was something that wasn't happening to \nme,'' he said. ``But I will deal with it head on,'' and he did. He had \nsurgery, then he made a full recovery, and was soon back to work.\n  In 2006 we were all shocked to learn that Senator Johnson suffered a \nbrain hemorrhage--and for weeks we hoped and prayed for him and his \nfamily. Incredibly, he again made a full recovery--and he again came \nback to work.\n  That is commitment. That is a Senator with a deep appreciation for \nthe privilege of serving the people of South Dakota. That is Tim \nJohnson\n  Despite the personal health issues Senator Johnson experienced, he \nsucceeded in leading passage of the Safe and Fair Deposit Insurance Act \nof 2005, a law that 3 years later was critical to keeping America's \ndeposits safe during a time of great economic turmoil. As chair of the \nSenate banking committee we have relied on his leadership and judgment \nin reducing risk in the financial sector and in ensuring that Dodd-\nFrank reforms were implemented effectively.\n  I will miss our work together to improve the health care of American \nveterans, and I will miss the opportunity I have had through the years \nto work with Senator Johnson on empowering small family farms to \ncompete in the modern marketplace and to help ethanol producers expand \ntheir place in our Nation's renewable energy future.\n  Knowing how important it was for ranchers to be able to tell \nconsumers their meat products came from the U.S.A., Senator Johnson has \nbeen a champion of country of origin labeling since going back to the \n2002 farm bill, and since then he has helped to strengthen and fully \nimplement the law, a mission that carried over to the 2014 farm bill \nthat I authored as chair of the agriculture committee.\n  In addition, Senator Johnson has been a forceful advocate for the \nGrain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration rules that \nensure that family farmers and ranchers are able to compete on a level \nplaying field.\n  I know how much Senator Johnson has loved policymaking, so I know he \nmust have agonized over this decision. But I also know that the love \nand devotion he has for his family comes first, and now he will be able \nto spend more time with his wife Barbara, his two sons, his daughter, \nand all his grandchildren.\n  Tim, thank you for being such a strong, resilient, and resourceful \npartner and friend through the years. I wish you a happy and successful \nretirement with your family.\n\n\n                             Mary Landrieu\n\n  Mr. President, at the end of this session of Congress, the Senate \nwill be bidding farewell to my colleague and dear friend, Senator Mary \nLandrieu, who has served the people of Louisiana with such devotion \nover the last 18 years.\n   I don't think it is possible to overstate the magnitude of the \nchallenges that she has faced on behalf of her constituents. Hurricane \nKatrina may have been the most horrible natural disaster our country \nhas ever experienced--and Senator Landrieu's native city of New Orleans \nwas ground zero.\n  No one was more engaged in the recovery effort that followed that \ncalamity. Senator Landrieu fought tenaciously to secure the funds it \nwould take to repair and revitalize the gulf coast with infrastructure \nimprovements that would protect the coast against another major event.\n  In the 10 years since Katrina, Senator Landrieu has been a champion \nfor homeowners who were struggling to afford flood insurance, most \nrecently by winning passage of the Homeowner Flood Insurance \nAffordability Act, this past March.\n  Of course, just as the gulf coast appeared close to making a full \nrecovery, it was struck by another disaster--the Deepwater Horizon \noilspill. Again, Senator Landrieu was on the vanguard of that recovery, \nwinning passage of the RESTORE Act so that the vast majority of the \nfines collected by the U.S. Government would go back to the gulf coast \nto help pay for the cleanup. It is the single biggest investment in \nenvironmental restoration in American history.\n  These were the moments when the people of Louisiana needed Mary \nLandrieu most--and she delivered as only she can.\n  At the same time, Senator Landrieu has always understood that the oil \nand gas industry is vital to her State's economy, and so it was a major \nmilestone when she became the first woman to chair the Senate energy \ncommittee.\n   She fights so hard for Louisiana, but over the years of working with \nher, I have learned how much she is driven by a deep feeling of \ncompassion, not just\n\n[[Page S6938]]\n\nfor those displaced by hurricanes or those whose livelihood was \njeopardized by the Deepwater Horizon but for the children of her State \nand our country who were given up for adoption or placed in foster \ncare.\n   Senator Landrieu knows the joys of adopting firsthand, having \nadopted her two children, Connor and Mary Shannon, and she wants other \nparents to feel that joy. So she sympathizes with parents who wish to \nadopt a child but who are struggling to do so--especially since she \nknows there are children desperate for parents but who remain wards of \nthe State. By matching those parents with that child, she knows that \nshe can create a true family.\n  So she has led the efforts in the Senate to improve child welfare \nsystems internationally and to make it easier for American parents to \nadopt children in other countries. She has pushed for Federal funds to \ncreate foster care mentoring programs, so that children who are in the \nfoster system have better guidance during the most critical years of \ntheir social development.\n   I know I speak for other Members of this Chamber when I say that we \nwill do our very best to continue the momentum that Senator Landrieu \nhas created for finding a permanent, loving home for every American \nchild.\n   I will deeply miss having her with us but I have absolutely no doubt \nthat Mary Landrieu will find new ways to express her devotion to the \npeople of Louisiana and our country. It is not just a tradition in her \nfamily; it is her singular passion. I thank her for her amazing service \nhere and I look forward to all the great achievements that are in her \nfuture.\n\n\n                               Mark Udall\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to express my gratitude to a dear colleague and \nfriend who has been a champion for our national parks and for \npreserving the natural splendor of our Western lands: Senator Mark \nUdall.\n   Just as the Great Lakes are part of my DNA, the Rocky Mountains are \npart of Senator Udall's. He likes to quote the saying that we did not \ninherit this earth from our parents but that we are borrowing it from \nour children--and that is the perspective that has guided him as Chair \nof the Senate National Parks Subcommittee.\n   He has worked to expand national parks and to revitalize our natural \nresources. Recognizing that our dependence on fossil fuels poses a \nthreat to our land, water and wildlife, Senator Udall has been a leader \nin pushing for investments in renewable energy. I know how proud he was \nthat Colorado was the first State to pass a voter-approved renewable \nenergy policy. A key to making it happen was Senator Udall teaming up \nin a bipartisan way with the speaker of the Colorado House.\n   When Colorado was struck by floods, forest fires, and beetle \ninfestations, Senator Udall fought to make sure the State had the \nFederal resources to contain the damage and aid the recovery.\n   We learn a lot about our leaders during a time of crisis, and time \nand again, Senator Udall has proven the strength of his character and \nhis convictions.\n   In the wake of the mass shooting in Aurora, CO, Senator Udall threw \nhis support behind a ban on combat weapons, as well as an amendment to \nexpand background searches for gun purchases. It was a bold position to \ntake politically, but the Udall family has a long tradition of taking \nbold positions whose wisdom is borne out by history: His grandfather \nissued a court decision that recognized Native Americans' right to \nvote; his uncle challenged discrimination by Washington's football \nteam; and his father helped integrate the University of Arizona.\n   It is fitting that in Senator Udall's last full week with the Senate \nhe gave a stirring speech on the floor, demanding transparency in the \nway that our Nation treats suspected terrorists. Senator Udall has also \nbeen one of the Senate's most vocal advocates for civil liberties, \narguing passionately that our government's conduct must always respect \nboth our values and the Constitution.\n   Personally, I have had the honor of working alongside Senator Udall \nas co-Chair of the Congressional Caucus on Parkinson's Disease, teaming \nup on behalf of the National MS and Parkinson's Disease Registries Act. \nThis past month we joined forces on an amendment that ensures women in \nthe military will have access to quality health services, with a \nspecific focus on maternity and preventive care.\n   I will miss our talks and our collaborations. But leaving the Senate \nwill allow Senator Udall to become an even more avid outdoorsman. While \nhe has already climbed Mt. Everest and the 100 tallest peaks in his \nhome State of Colorado, I have no doubt that he will soon conquer new \nand exciting challenges in the great outdoors.\n   And from listening to his farewell address, it is already apparent \nto me that Senator Udall has achieved a clarity that will serve him \nforever after. ``As a lifelong mountain climber,'' he said, ``I have \nlearned far more from the mountains I did not summit, than those that I \ndid.''\n   I know I speak for many of us here when I say that I have learned a \ngreat deal from Senator Udall, and I thank him for serving Colorado and \nour Nation in the U.S. Senate--and for being a great friend. Happy \ntrails, Senator.\n\n\n                               kay hagan\n\n  Mr. President, I also wish to pay tribute to my dear friend and \ncolleague, Senator Kay Hagan from North Carolina.\n  Kay Hagan has quite a collection of hats. There is the hat she wore \nas a lawyer in Greensboro. She wore one hat as a banker, another as a \nState legislator helping to write North Carolina's State budget. And \nwhen she excelled in each of these roles, the voters of North Carolina \ngave her another hat to wear, as their U.S. Senator.\n  Kay Hagan joined us in January 2009, which was a difficult time for \nour Nation's economy. With her background in the banking sector and her \nknowledge of the housing finance system, she got right to work on \nrebuilding our economy, with a stronger foundation.\n  At the same time, she never allowed herself to be distracted from the \nneeds specific to her North Carolina constituents. She recognized that \nNorth Carolina workers and small businesses were being threatened by \nunfair trade practices abroad, and she sought to address it.\n  She recognizes how vital military bases are to North Carolina's \neconomy and to its culture, so she worked to protect them from cuts and \nclosures. She was a leader for military families who care for disabled \nchildren, seeking to provide payments for them from the Survivor \nBenefit Plan. And it was Senator Hagan who stepped up to help families \nat Camp Lejeune get access to health care, following one of the worst \ncases of water contamination in American history.\n  With two daughters of her own, Senator Hagan knows about the demands \nof balancing child care with a career, and as Chair of the Senate \nSubcommittee on Children and Families, she called attention to the need \nfor paid leave. Senator Hagan and I share important health care \npriorities: She cosponsored a bill to improve the care of mothers and \nbabies by establishing higher quality standards for maternity care \nthrough Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. And she \nhas been a valuable ally on the HOPE for Alzheimer's Act, which would \nhelp doctors detect this disease earlier and provide more support for \nthose taking care of a family member with Alzheimer's.\n  I had the distinct honor of teaming up with Senator Hagan earlier \nthis year to help pork farmers get disaster assistance after a deadly \nvirus devastated their livestock. And we worked together to sound the \nalarm on student loan debt and to try to stop interest rates on Federal \nloans from rising.\n   We both come from States where hunting, fishing, and wildlife are \nimportant components to residents' quality of life. So I was pleased \nthis past year to help Senator Hagan push for her Bipartisan \nSportsmen's Act, which sought to expand access to Federal lands while \ntaking significant steps toward conserving the land we use for \nrecreation.\n  I deeply regret that I will not be able to work with Senator Hagan in \nthe next Congress. But knowing how dear public service is to her, and \nhow deeply that tradition is established in her family, I have no doubt \nthat she will find new ways to serve the people of her beloved home \nState, and our Nation.\n\n[[Page S6939]]\n\n  Senator Hagan, thank you for your service and thank you for being a \nwonderful friend. I wish you the very best of luck in all your future \nendeavors.\n\n\n                             Mary Landrieu\n\n Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the many \naccomplishments of my friend, Senator Mary Landrieu, my colleague from \nLouisiana, during her 18 years here in the U.S. Senate.\n  Senator Landrieu was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1996. Prior to \nserving in the Senate, she had already served the people of her State \nfor 16 years--first as a State legislator, and later as a State \ntreasurer. Altogether Senator Landrieu's service to the people of \nLouisiana has spanned nearly 34 years of commitment to the people of \nLouisiana.\n  Mary served her constituents with utter conviction, dedication, and \npersistence--qualities that her colleagues in the U.S. Senate use to \ndescribe her.\n  However, Senator Landrieu's dedication can be described in other ways \nas well.\n  In her farewell remarks last week, Senator Landrieu discussed how \nfaith and family helped drive her. She draws tremendous strength from \nher faith, and also her large and supportive family--a family that \nknows a thing or two about the ups and downs of politics.\n  Her father, Moon Landrieu, served as a judge, State representative, \nNew Orleans city councilman and Secretary of the U.S. Department of \nHousing and Urban Development. Her brother, Mitch Landrieu, was \nLouisiana's Lieutenant Governor, and both her father and brother have \nserved as mayors of New Orleans--her father during an era of renewal, \nand her brother during an era of rebuilding.\n  Mary has clearly stepped up to the plate during the devastation of \nHurricane Katrina and the horrendous BP oil spill. Those are the kinds \nof challenges that none of us expect when we enter public life--but \nthey are the challenges which show our communities what we are made of.\n  Senator Landrieu rose to both challenges. She has worked as hard as \nany Senator has ever worked to see that her constituents were taken \ncare of. She has pushed hard on Federal agencies to help rebuild, and \npassed legislation to help with Gulf restoration. She has also fought \nto see that flood insurance rates remain affordable--not just for those \nin Louisiana, but across the country.\n  Her efforts have earned the respect of everyone she has worked with, \nand she earned the opportunity to serve as Chair of the Senate Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee as well as the Senate Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship Committee. I know that the issues she championed \non these two committees were important to her constituents and I admire \nher advocacy for jobs in her State and more opportunities for small \nbusinesses.\n  Of course, Senator Landrieu's work extended beyond these two \ncommittees. For years, she worked on adoption, education, conservation, \nand other issues that were near and dear to her heart.\n  All of us will miss Mary's drive, tenacity, and willingness to work \nwith others to get things done. She will continue to be a tough and \nrelentless fighter for Louisiana no matter what her next challenge will \nbe.\n  Aloha, Mary, a hui hou, ``until we meet again.''\n\n\n                               MARK PRYOR\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about my colleague, Senator \nMark Pryor of Arkansas, who will be ending his tenure in the Senate at \nthe end of this Congress.\n  The Pryor name is synonymous with public service in Arkansas. Mark's \nfather, David, served Arkansas in the U.S. House, as Governor, and in \nthe U.S. Senate. In fact, Mark succeeded his father in the U.S. Senate \nafter serving in the State legislature and as attorney general.\n  Throughout his two terms in the Senate, Mark has been a workhorse and \nnot a showhorse. As he noted in his farewell remarks, he is not one to \nattend many press conferences. But he certainly has done a lot of work \non behalf of the people of Arkansas. In 12 years in the Senate he has \nworked to get 70 laws passed--many on a bipartisan basis.\n  His work improves the lives of Americans and our youth each day--from \nhis work in consumer product safety, access to health care, veterans \nissues, and more. He has fought to protect Medicare, and to support \nArkansas' farmers, small businesses, and middle class families.\n  That may be why in his 2008 reelection to the Senate he earned more \nvotes than any statewide elected official in Arkansas history.\n  Senator Pryor told us in his farewell to look inside our desks and \nsee the names written in the drawer, to see the predecessors who have \ncome before us. These names can serve as a reminder of what we all are \nhere for and what large shoes we must fill, as well as how we must \ncollaborate to get things done.\n  Mark has spoken about the fact that politics is about people--both \nthe people we serve and the people we serve with.\n  While there are many good people serving here, we will all miss the \nwork ethic, warmth, and charm that Mark brought to the Senate during \nhis service.\n  It has been an honor serving as his colleague.\n  Aloha, Mark, a hui hou, ``until we meet again.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/24/senate-section/article/S6938-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. CORKER, from the Committee on Foreign Relations, \n     without amendment:\n       S. 2078.

DINGELL\n\n Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an \namazing colleague from my home State of Michigan, who has served in \nCongress for 59 years, the longest tenure of any Member in history: the \ndean of the House, John D. Dingell.\n  In fact, his service to our Nation goes back even further: In 1938 he \nworked as a congressional page and on December 8, 1941, he was on the \nfloor to hear President Roosevelt declare that the bombing of Pearl \nHarbor was a day that would live in infamy. In fact, a 15-year-old John \nDingell helped record that speech.\n  Three years later he served America in Europe in the fight against \nNazi Germany. He would have been in the Battle of the Bulge if he \nhadn't been hospitalized with meningitis. Then he joined the fight in \nthe Pacific, making preparations to be in the first wave of American \nsoldiers for the ground invasion of Japan--except that the Japanese \nsurrendered before it could happen.\n  So John Dingell proved his patriotism long before he joined Congress \nin 1955, following the death of his beloved father, who preceded him as \nRepresentative for Michigan's 15th Congressional District.\n  It is hard to imagine, but Congressman Dingell was a Member of \nCongress before Medicare and Medicaid existed. In fact, he helped vote \nthose programs into law. When he joined Congress, the Interstate \nHighway System did not exist. Alaska and Hawaii were not yet States.\n  Congressman Dingell is not merely a witness to history. He is a maker \nof it. His original family name, translated into Polish, meant \n``blacksmith,'' and this is a man who hammered out our Nation's laws, \nforging a stronger Union that could weather the challenges of the \nfuture.\n  I would like to list all of Congressman Dingell's accomplishments, \nbut I would be accused of staging a filibuster. For the sake of \nbrevity, I will list only the most exceptional moments in Congressman \nDingell's legendary career.\n  Perhaps his most courageous vote occurred in 1964, in favor of the \nCivil Rights Act. Advisers told him that vote would destroy his chances \nat reelection, but he had more faith in his constituents--and he \nrefused to compromise the principles of social justice.\n  Health care was a great passion--one he inherited from his father. \nJohn Dingell, Sr., introduced a bill for universal health care in 1943, \nand though it failed, he continued to fight for it until the end of his \nlife, and John Dingell, Jr., adopted that cause from his first day as \nhis father's successor, proposing a bill to reform the health care \nsystem in every Congress since 1955. He has always believed that every \nAmerican should have access to health care. So I know that voting for \nthe Affordable Care Act was one of Congressman Dingell's proudest \nmoments in Congress.\n  As a boy he lived through America's Great Depression, and as a \nCongressman he helped to overcome America's great recession.\n  He witnessed the rise of the automobile industry and saw how those \nunionized workers powered the rise of\n\n[[Page S6940]]\n\nAmerica's middle class. Then we fought together to make sure that \nAmerican autos and American workers could compete with foreign \ncompetition on an even playing field. Congressman Dingell recognized \nthat this was the key to a new golden age of American cars and trucks. \nWe are seeing that today.\n  While scientific consensus was still forming about threats pollution \nposed to our air and animals, John Dingell wrote the Endangered Species \nAct in 1973 and the major expansion of the Clean Air Act in 1990. In \n2001, he created the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge--the \nvery first of its kind in North America--and in the years since he has \nworked to expand refuge protection to more acres.\n  He loves Michigan dearly. He understands the connection our people \nhave to manufacturing, to agriculture and to the land and Great Lakes \nthat power our tourism industry and our Michigan way of life.\n  Even during the years he spent chairing the House Committee on Energy \nand Commerce, when Congressman Dingell was one of the most powerful \nMembers of Congress, you could still find him waving to the crowd from \nthe open top of a Ford Mustang convertible at Dearborn's Memorial Day \nParade or at a booth at the Monroe County Fair, always with that same \nbig smile. As Tip O'Neill once said, ``All politics is local,'' and \nlocal people are what John Dingell loves about politics.\n  The people of his district never doubted his dedication. That is why \nthey would still put ``Dingell for Congress'' signs on their lawn, long \nafter his district boundaries had changed. If a piece of Southeast \nMichigan was ``Dingell Country'' once, then it was Dingell Country \nforever.\n  And now he feels great pride--and his constituents feel great \ncomfort--knowing that the district will remain in his family's hands. \nHis beloved wife Deborah, who has been his closest confidant and \nunderstands him more intimately than anyone, will carry on his legacy \nlong into the future. So if you go back to Congressman John Dingell, \nSr., it means that Southeast Michigan has been under the Dingell name \nfor 81 years--and counting.\n  While Congressman Dingell will no longer be in Congress, we can still \nfollow him on Twitter.\n  Even at age 88, he is constantly evolving, charging boldly into the \nfuture, driven by a very simple principle: We are put on this earth to \nhelp people.\n  John D. Dingell, Jr., has helped many people and yet he will insist \nthat he has received much more than he has been given. He claims to be \nthe ``luckiest man in shoe leather,'' and we are lucky that he has \nserved Michigan and our Nation, so long and so faithfully.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/02/senate-section/article/S6940-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING CARE CHEST OF SIERRA NEVADA\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 25th \nanniversary of Care Chest of Sierra Nevada, an organization that \nsupplies free medical equipment to Northern Nevadans in need. As a \nprovider of services to underserved communities, Care Chest has long \nbeen a vital nonprofit in Nevada, and I am proud of the work they do on \nbehalf of the Silver State.\n  Founded in 1990, Care Chest began as a grassroots effort to reuse and \nrecycle medical equipment. Today, this organization helps improve the \nquality of life for those who otherwise could not afford the rising \ncost of health care supplies. Twenty-five years later, Care Chest has \nserved over 100,000 people in Northern Nevada. Last year alone, Care \nChest served nearly 9,000 Nevadans and distributed over 16,000 medical \nitems. Free of charge services provided by Care Chest include emergency \nprescriptions, diabetic supplies, respiratory items, and liquid \nnutritional products. Care Chest has dedicated its efforts to the \nunderserved communities in Northern Nevada, as 69 percent of its \nclients in 2013 were uninsured while 55 percent were below the poverty \nline.\n  As Nevada's unemployment rate remains one of highest in the Nation \nand as health care costs continue to rise, I recognize the unique role \nthat Care Chest has played in working to address the needs of its local \ncommunity by offering health care services to those in need. As a \nlifelong Nevadan and member of the Senate Committee on Finance and the \nSenate Special Committee on Aging starting in the 114th Congress, I am \nproud of the work Care Chest does on behalf of the Reno community and \nits senior citizens.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in recognizing \nCare Chest of Sierra Nevada, an organization whose mission is both \nnoble and charitable. I am humbled and honored to recognize Care Chest, \nand I wish them the best of luck in their 25th year of service to the \nState of Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/02/senate-section/article/S6940-2", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING THE WELLS FUTURE FARMERS OF AMERICA\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I wish to recognize and \ncongratulate the Wells, NV, Future Farmers of America chapter for \nwinning a national title in the Western National Rangeland Career \nDevelopment Event. As a lifelong Nevadan and advocate of agriculture \neducation, I am proud to celebrate this victory for Wells and for the \nSilver State.\n  As a rancher, I recognize the role the Future Farmers of America \norganization plays in preparing students for a future in agriculture. \nThe Western National Rangeland Convention, hosted in Elko, NV, brought \n14 teams from five States to compete in various categories including \nplant identification, rangeland biodiversity, habitat evaluation, and \nstocking management. With nearly 6 million acres of farmland in the \nSilver State, these are invaluable skills for future Nevada farmers.\n  I am especially proud to recognize team members Wyatt Gibbs, Deseret \nJohnson, DeMar Gale, Chelsea James, and Justin Sorenson for \nrepresenting the Wells community as leaders in rangeland farming \ntechniques. Under the leadership of adviser Don Noorda, the Wells \nFuture Farmers of America chapter proudly brought home Nevada's first \nnational title. As ranch owners, my wife Lynne and I understand the \nimportance of agriculture education. Management of our State's \nrangelands has been one of my top natural resources priorities in the \nU.S. Senate. Recently, I was instrumental in the enactment of the \nGrazing Improvement Act, which will provide much needed security to \nlivestock producers all across the West.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in recognizing \nthe Wells Future Farmers of America, a group of driven young adults \ndedicated to Nevada's agriculture and rangeland. Their commitment to \nNevada's agricultural future is commendable, and I wish them the best \nof luck in all of their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/02/senate-section/article/S6940-3", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6940-S6941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH OF JAMES CLEVELAND \n                            ``JESSE'' OWENS\n\n  On Tuesday, December 16, 2014, the Senate adopted S. Res. 226, with \nits preamble, as amended, as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 226\n\n       Whereas James Cleveland ``Jesse'' Owens was born on \n     September 12, 1913 in Oakville, Alabama;\n       Whereas Jesse Owens, the youngest of 10 children of \n     sharecroppers and the grandson of a slave, moved with his \n     family at the age of 9 to Cleveland, Ohio as part of the \n     Great Migration;\n       Whereas as a student at Fairmount Junior High School, Jesse \n     Owens broke junior high school world records for the high \n     jump and the broad jump;\n       Whereas Jesse Owens attended East Technical High School in \n     Cleveland, Ohio where, as a member of the track team, he \n     placed first in 75 of the 79 races he entered during his \n     senior year, set the world record in the 220-yard dash, and \n     tied the world record in the 100-yard dash;\n       Whereas Jesse Owens, the ``Buckeye Bullet'', matriculated \n     at the Ohio State University in 1933 after attracting \n     national attention as a high school athlete;\n       Whereas while attending classes, training, and breaking a \n     number of track and field records, Jesse Owens worked various \n     jobs, including as an elevator operator at the Ohio State \n     Capitol, a waiter, a gas station attendant, and a library \n     employee;\n       Whereas due to his race, Jesse Owens was barred from living \n     on campus at the Ohio State University, denied service at \n     restaurants near the University, and forced to stay in \n     segregated hotels;\n       Whereas on May 25, 1935, in a 45-minute period during the \n     Big Ten Track and Field Championships in Ann Arbor, Michigan, \n     Jesse Owens, competing with an injured back, tied the world \n     record in the 100-yard\n\n[[Page S6941]]\n\n     dash and set new world records in the long jump, the 220-yard \n     dash, and the 220-yard low hurdles;\n       Whereas as of the 2012 Summer Olympics, only two men had \n     surpassed the long jump record Jesse Owens set in 1935;\n       Whereas at the 1936 Summer Olympics, Jesse Owens won 4 gold \n     medals, tied the world record in the 100-meter dash, and set \n     new Olympic records in the 200-meter race, the long jump, and \n     the 400-meter relay;\n       Whereas Jesse Owens' resilience and heroic performance at \n     the 1936 Summer Olympics exposed the struggle against racial \n     bigotry and publicly defied Adolf Hitler's intention of \n     proving that ethnicity was a predetermining factor for \n     achievement;\n       Whereas the record-breaking performance by Jesse Owens at \n     the 1936 Summer Olympics was never recognized by the 32nd \n     President of the United States or the 33rd President of the \n     United States, but was later recognized in 1955 by the 34th \n     President of the United States, who referred to Jesse Owens \n     as an ``Ambassador of Sport'';\n       Whereas following his Olympic career, Jesse Owens resumed \n     his commitment to public service by spending much of his time \n     working with community groups such as the Boys Clubs of \n     America, chronicling his personal story to magnify the \n     importance of equality and civil rights;\n       Whereas during the 1950s, Jesse Owens worked with the \n     Department of State to promote democracy abroad as an \n     Ambassador of Goodwill during the Cold War and advocated for \n     socioeconomic equality, individuality, freedom, and love of \n     country;\n       Whereas Jesse Owens was awarded the Presidential Medal of \n     Freedom by the 38th President of the United States in 1976 \n     and the Living Legend Award by the 39th President of the \n     United States in 1979, and was posthumously awarded the \n     Congressional Gold Medal by the 41st President of the United \n     States in 1990;
