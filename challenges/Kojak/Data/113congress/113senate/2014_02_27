Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 309, the \nChild Care and Development Block Grant Act.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 309, S. 1086, a bill to \n     reauthorize and improve the Child Care and Development Block \n     Grant Act of 1990, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, the Senate will be in a period of morning business \nfor one hour. The majority will control the first half and the \nRepublicans the final half.\n  Following morning business the Senate will resume consideration of S. \n1982, the veterans benefits bill.\n  I filed cloture on the substitute amendment and the underlying bill. \nAs a result the filing deadline for first-degree amendments is 10:30 \nthis morning and for second-degree amendments it is 1:30 p.m.\n  At 2 p.m. there will be a series of votes in relation to the veterans \nbill. We also expect to consider the nomination of Michael Connor to be \nDeputy Secretary of the Interior today.\n\n\n                          Protecting Veterans\n\n  Mr. President, there are lots of issues on which Democrats and \nRepublicans will always disagree. That is OK. But, historically, \nDemocrats and Republicans have been able to agree on one issue: \nCongress should do everything in its power to protect those who risk \ntheir lives to protect our country.\n  I had hoped this work period would be more bipartisan; that the \nSenate could tackle issues and would be able to stop the political \ngames we have seen so often from the minority.\n  That is why I scheduled floor time for a bill to expand health care \nand job training for veterans of the Armed Forces--a very, very \ncomprehensive bill, worked on by the Veterans Affairs' Committee, led \nby Senator Sanders. The bill is loaded, as Senator Sanders and I \ndiscussed yesterday in detail, with Republican provisions that he put \nin the bill.\n  Democrats and Republicans alike should be able to support this bill, \nwhich is sponsored, as I have indicated, by Senator Sanders from \nVermont.\n  Democrats were even willing to work with our Republican colleagues to \nconsider relevant amendments to this legislation. So it was \ndisappointing--but, sadly, not surprising--when Republicans almost \nimmediately injected base partisan politics into a debate over a bill \nthat should--should--be bipartisan, insisting on an unrelated amendment \non Iran that they knew would kill the bill.\n  I do not know what they say to the 26 veterans groups. Millions of \nveterans really supported this bill and did everything they could to \nhelp the chairman of the committee, the junior Senator from Vermont, to \nmove this bill forward. But they did it on an unrelated amendment on \nIran that they knew would kill the bill. I do not know all the reasons, \nbut we had a number of speeches, especially one from Dr. Coburn, the \njunior Senator from Oklahoma, who came to the floor and had questions \nabout the bill.\n  I did not agree with all of his assertions, but he has a right to \ndispute\n\n[[Page S1188]]\n\nwhat is in the bill, and he wanted to offer amendments to the bill. We \nagreed he should be able to offer amendments to the bill, but the \nRepublicans, I guess, are in turmoil internally and did not want him to \nbe able to offer any amendments that they may have to vote for or vote \nagainst, so they figured the way to do it is to just kill the bill.\n  I hope all the veterans groups have witnessed this contortion the \nRepublicans have done to defeat this bill--because it will be defeated. \nThat was their aim from the very beginning.\n\n  Like our support for veterans, the Senate's Iran sanctions policy has \nhistorically been solidly bipartisan. The idea of Iran obtaining a \nnuclear weapon is unthinkable. Democrats and Republicans always worked \ntogether on this policy. Iran should not have nuclear capability. We \nall agree on that--I hope so at least. I know on this side of the aisle \nwe do. But it seems Republicans are trying to erase that history and \npoliticize an issue that has historically been above partisanship.\n  They are trying now--the Republicans--to mislead the American public \nby saying that a bipartisan majority supports moving forward with new \nsanctions right now. Of course, it is wrong. Absolutely, of course, it \nis wrong.\n  In fact, many Senators, including some who have cosponsored the new \nsanctions bill, believe we should not move forward with the bill at \nthis time or on this important bill for veterans. It should not be used \nas an effort to kill this veterans bill.\n  But in addition to that, 10 committee chairs wrote a letter to me \nsaying: Do not do anything now. They are some of the biggest supporters \nof Israel there are. But we also have Israel's strongest supporter, \nAIPAC, also agreeing it is not the time now to bring a sanctions \npackage to the floor. AIPAC was unequivocal in its request for a delay \non additional sanctions. In fact, this is what they said: ``Stopping \nthe Iranian nuclear program should rest on bipartisan support and . . . \nthere should not be a vote at this time on the measure.''\n  Many veterans groups have also come out against including the Iran \namendment on this bill, including virtually every veterans organization \nbut especially the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, \nconsisting of millions and millions of veterans. We also have the Iraq \nand Afghanistan Veterans of America saying: Do not do it at this time. \nWe need help. We, the veterans, need help. This legislation would give \nus that help. Here is specifically what the American Legion said:\n\n       Sanctions against Iran have no place in a U.S. Senate \n     debate over legislation that aims to expand health care, \n     education opportunities, employment and other benefits for \n     veterans.\n\n  But Iran should make no mistake. We know that. If they fail to comply \nwith the current interim agreement or fail to make progress toward a \ncomprehensive agreement eliminating their nuclear weapons development \nefforts, Congress will act without hesitation to pass additional \nsanctions. We have said that time and time again.\n  That decision will be made in the interest of our national security, \nnot on a partisan ploy. There is too much at stake to play politics \nwith our Nation's Iran policy. Likewise, Republicans should stop \nputting American veterans at risk and help Democrats pass this crucial \nlegislation.\n  Shame on the Republicans for bringing base politics into a bill to \nhelp the veterans. I have learned that the Republicans here in the \nSenate have many different ways of saying no, but, as always, it is \njust plain obstruction, I am sorry to say, again, on a bill to help \nmillions of veterans.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                                The IRS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today is an important day. It is the \nlast day of the so-called comment period when Americans can officially \nregister their opinions on the IRS's latest effort to suppress free \nspeech. So far, nearly 100,000 comments have come through--100,000. \nNearly every one I have seen is opposed.\n  Just to put things in perspective, that is basically the largest \nnumber of comments ever--ever--for a rule like this. Even the head of \nthe IRS said he saw more comments on this proposal than ever before \n``on any regulation,'' and that was 70,000 comments ago; 70,000 \ncomments ago the Commissioner of the IRS said this was the most \ncomments he had seen on any regulation.\n  So people are certainly making their voices heard--and loudly--and \nthe message they are broadcasting is pretty clear: Leave the First \nAmendment alone. Leave it alone. Get out of the censorship and \nharassment business. Stick to the job you are actually supposed to be \ndoing.\n  Let's be clear. The folks who are logging opinions like these run \nstraight across the political spectrum.\n  Labor unions are upset. Business organizations are upset. Civil \nliberties activists are upset. Taxpayer groups are upset. Grassroots \ngroups right across the political map are upset at what they view as an \nassault on their First Amendment rights. All you have to do is read \ntheir own words.\n  One group of primarily left-leaning First Amendment advocates said \nthe new regulation would ``impose serious burdens on free speech and \nhinder the democratic processes it serves.''\n  An official with the ACLU described the IRS's proposed regulation as \ncreating ``the worst of all worlds.'' The proposal, he wrote, could \n``seriously chill legitimate issue advocacy from nonprofits on [both] \nthe right and left,'' and would ``disproportionately affect small, poor \nnonprofits that cannot afford the legal counsel to guarantee \ncompliance. . . . ''\n  Here is what one labor union had to say:\n\n       Given the history of misuse and abuse of the IRS' immense \n     powers in the not-so-distant past, it is disappointing and \n     disturbing that this fundamental principle has been forgotten \n     and that this . . . [regulation] is the IRS' proposed \n     response to its recent missteps.\n\n  So left, right, center--folks understand what a threat this rule \nposes to the most cherished of civil liberties.\n  They also realize that a group the administration favors today could \neasily become a group the IRS targets tomorrow. That is why this fight \nis so important, why it is so inappropriate to hand this kind of power \nto any administration. I do not care what party the President is in. \nThat is why I, along with several of my colleagues, recently sent a \nletter to the new Commissioner of the IRS explaining in some detail why \nthe agency's proposal was such a bad idea, a terrible idea.\n  In that letter we also reminded the Commissioner of something else: \nThe ball is in his court on this one. The ball is in his court. He \ncould stop this rule tomorrow. And given the comments he made about \nrestoring integrity to the IRS when the Senate voted to confirm him, \nthat is exactly what we expect of him. In fact, that was essentially \nthe mandate on which he was confirmed.\n  So here is the choice before him. This is the choice the Commissioner \nof the IRS has. He can either fulfill that mandate to the American \npeople by restoring integrity to an agency they no longer trust, he can \nbe a hero and say no to those who are pressuring him to crack down on \nthe First Amendment rights of ordinary citizens--that is what the IRS \nCommissioner told Richard Nixon. He said: I am not going to cooperate \nwith your efforts to target your enemies--or he can serve political \nmasters over in the White House, and he can implement regulations that \nwould erode our most fundamental civil liberties, regulations that \nwould almost certainly lead to the harassment of conservative groups \ntoday and, quite possibly, the harassment of left-leaning groups in the \nfuture. In fact, a recent letter Representative Camp received from the \nTreasury Department appears to suggest that unions in particular have a \nlot to fear from this proposal.\n  So, look. Now is the time to act. America's free speech advocates are \nstanding with one voice. Thousands upon thousands made their voices \nheard in the opinion process. I suspect millions more are right there \nwith them in spirit. Some who oppose this rule picked the President in \nthe last election. Some voted for his opponent. Some may have even cast \na ballot for another person entirely. But what unites us is our love of \nthe liberties that have allowed Americans to disagree civilly for \ncenturies.\n  Commissioner Koskinen, do the right thing. Stop this regulation.\n\n\n                                  Iran\n\n  Later today the Senate will vote on the motions related to S. 1982, a \nbill\n\n[[Page S1189]]\n\nthat was not considered in committee, that greatly expands spending \nwithout any realistic offset and would vastly overwhelm the Veterans' \nAdministration health care system. It is shameful that Senate Democrats \nwould seek to score political points by rushing to the floor a bill \nwhich the committee did not consider and which could otherwise have \nbeen handled in a bipartisan manner through the regular order.\n  Unfortunately, it has become standard practice around here for the \nmajority to pursue partisan legislation in a sort of ``take it or leave \nit'' manner, so it is unsurprising that nobody other than the majority \nleader and the committee chairman have been allowed the opportunity to \namend the bill. Senators on both sides have been shut out of the \nlegislative process. For example, we cannot even vote on the ranking \nmember's veterans amendment--legislation I support--which will not add \nto the deficit. I am a cosponsor of this legislation, which provides \nfull COLA restoration for servicemembers entering the military in 2014, \nprovides advanced appropriations for VA mandatory accounts, improves \nservices and benefits for victims of military sexual trauma, enhances \nbenefits for survivors and dependents of disabled veterans, encourages \nthe hiring of veterans, and, unlike the Sanders bill, is fully paid \nfor.\n  As for the Iran sanctions language in the Burr amendment, as I noted \nyesterday, there is significant disagreement between the President and \nmany Members from both parties in both the House and the Senate \nconcerning the best way to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear \nweapon.\n  The Iranian regime has carried out its best attempt at a charm \noffensive to forestall not only the implementation but the legislative \nconsideration of even tougher sanctions should the regime fail to \nfulfill its commitments according to November's interim agreement.\n  The interim agreement included a Joint Plan of Action, agreed to by \nIran. According to that Joint Plan of Action, the U.S. administration, \nacting consistent with the respective roles of the President and the \nCongress, will refrain from imposing new nuclear-related sanctions. The \nagreement is spelled out clearly to the Iranians: Acting consistent \nwith our respective roles. The Iranians can read the plain language and \nunderstand that this Congress did not agree to renounce additional \nsanctions. We did not agree to do that. Yet the majority leader is \ndetermined not to allow a single vote on the Kirk-Menendez bill, which \ncould be fully debated by this body prior to a vote. We will not have \nthat debate, apparently, nor will we vote on any amendments related to \nthe bill before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, lest we forget, more than 30,000 brave \nAmericans are still serving in harm's way in Afghanistan. Hundreds of \nthousands of men and women in uniform are serving around the world. \nThey all volunteered. In return for their volunteerism, we made a \nnumber of promises. The ability to maintain the strongest and most \ndedicated military force in the world depends on our Nation's ability \nto keep those promises.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of the legislation being debated this week, S. \n1982, which is perhaps the most significant veterans legislation to \ncome before Congress in many years. This legislation has the strong \nsupport of virtually every veterans organization in the country, \nincluding the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the \nDisabled American Veterans, the Vietnam Veterans of America, and the \nIraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. These organizations support \nthe bill because it renews our promise to our veterans.\n  I am very fortunate to represent the State of New Mexico, which has \none of the highest rates of military volunteerism in the Nation. New \nMexico, a small State of 2 million people, is home to more than 170,000 \nveterans, and 2,000 New Mexicans endured the Bataan Death March during \nWorld War II.\n  New Mexico is home to many of our Nation's finest military \ninstallations: Kirtland Air Force Base, the Air Force's sixth largest \nbase, with over 100 partners and a strategic role in ensuring our \nNation's safe, secure, and reliable nuclear weapons complex; Cannon Air \nForce Base, the fastest growing Air Force base in the country, leading \nthe fight in special operations; Holloman Air Force Base, an \nindispensable Air Force base with unparalleled airspace now and into \nthe future; and White Sands Missile Range, the largest military \ninstallation in the Nation, with a testing and training environment \nthat is unmatched anywhere in the world.\n  Additionally, New Mexico's National Guard employs roughly 3,800 full-\ntime and part-time military personnel.\n  Collectively, there are 18,000 military personnel serving today in \nNew Mexico. Volunteerism is not simply a career choice for New \nMexicans; it is a way of life. It is ingrained in our State's rich \nhistory of putting community and country first.\n  The bill before us today renews our promise to all of them and to all \nof those who are willing to lay down their lives for their country. It \nprovides benefits to all generations of veterans and their families, \nand it eliminates the cost-of-living adjustment penalty on military \nretirees.\n  The legislation incorporates bills and ideas from both Democrats and \nRepublicans to address the disability claims backlog, including one of \nmy own. Across New Mexico I have heard from too many veterans who are \nfrustrated with the delays they experience in receiving their \ndisability benefits.\n  Last June Senator Heller of Nevada and I introduced the Veterans \nBenefits Claims Faster Filing Act, which requires the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs to ensure that every veteran is informed of the vast \ndifferences in times for processing compensation claims when filing a \nfully developed claim versus a non-fully developed paper claim.\n  It takes, on average, 113 days for veterans to receive a final \ndisability rating if they file a fully developed claim online. Compare \nthat to over a year if they file a non-fully developed paper claim. \nFiling claims online through the Fully Developed Claims Program \naccelerates turnaround time and makes processing more efficient. Doing \nso also provides an additional year of retroactive benefits as an \nincentive to veterans who file a fully developed claim.\n  The Faster Filing Act and other legislative efforts represent a \ncollective effort to reduce the backlog and ensure that our veterans \nreceive the benefits they have earned.\n  I am also proud to have cosponsored legislation introduced by my \ncolleague from Alaska Senator Begich to provide advanced appropriations \nfor all--all--VA spending accounts. This would ensure that veterans \nreceive uninterrupted access to the benefits they have earned, even in \nthe midst of a government shutdown such as the one that so \nirresponsibly occurred last fall. It is unacceptable that veterans \nwould fall victim to the partisan politics of a government shutdown. \nThe legislation today includes a fix to ensure that never happens \nagain.\n  The bill also helps put veterans back to work. It reauthorizes a 2-\nyear extension for the Veterans Retraining Assistance Program, which \nretrains unemployed veterans for high-demand occupations. It requires \nthe VA to establish a 3-year program to provide young veterans under 30 \nthe opportunity to serve in an internship that would pair veterans with \nprivate sector employers so they can gain civilian work experience.\n  The bill expands the VA's successful caregivers program to provide \ncaregiver benefits to veterans of all generations, in a similar manner \nas post-9/11 veterans.\n\n[[Page S1190]]\n\n  America's service men and women consider our Nation's principles \nimportant enough to defend them against all enemies and at any cost. \nThey volunteer to do so. But volunteerism only works if we fulfill our \npromises. Few sacrifices are as selfless as those our military men and \nwomen make in defense of this Nation. We owe them more than a debt of \ngratitude; we owe them action in both our words and our deeds. This \nbill backs our word with action. It fulfills our promises. I hope we \nsee it pass this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, on Tuesday I came to the floor to talk \nabout one issue that we are rarely divided on in this building; that \nis, our duty to keep the promises we have made to provide not only care \nbut opportunity to all those who have honorably served in our Nation's \nArmed Forces.\n  The comprehensive veterans legislation that is now before us is \nreally the test for many Members of Congress. Can we all put politics \naside for the good of our Nation's veterans to keep that promise? Can \nwe show these heroes that despite our differences, we will work as \ndiligently toward getting them the benefits and care they have earned \nas they worked for our Nation?\n  Now, unfortunately, some of our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle are indicating they would now prefer to put politics over \npromises, under the guise of an alternative to this bill. Given what we \nhave seen recently on other bills--supported, by the way, by a majority \nof Americans--we should not be surprised, but I truly did think and \nhope this bill would be a different story because it contains ideas \nfrom both Democrats and Republicans and because this is an issue which \nhas historically united this body and because we have all pledged to do \nwhatever it takes on behalf of our veterans.\n  So once again where we are today is that some of our colleagues have \ndecided to use unrelated issues to sour this entire effort for our \nveterans and their families who stand to benefit the most from this \ncomprehensive legislation we are offering.\n  With their alternative bill they have now proposed to strip away \nlife-changing programs for veterans who are looking to take the skills \nthey learned on the battlefield to the boardroom. With this \nalternative, they have decided to halt the expansion of opportunities \nfor our caregivers who are integral to the health and well-being of \nsome of our most vulnerable heroes.\n  But among these and many other examples of the Republican effort to \nderail this landmark legislation, there is one issue I find most \negregious; that is, their shameful opposition to provide our \ncatastrophically wounded heroes with access to reproductive services \nthey so desperately need to start a family.\n  This shouldn't be a political issue. This is about giving veterans \nwho have sacrificed everything every option we have to help them \nfulfill a simple dream of starting a family.\n  As we all know, our men and women in uniform have become increasingly \nsusceptible to reproductive, spinal, and traumatic brain injuries due \nto the changing weapons of war. But as we know, thanks to modern \nmedicine, many of these servicemembers are being kept alive and they \nare returning home. In fact, as of the new year, there are 2,348 \nservicemembers who are living with reproductive, urinary or pelvic \ninjuries as a result of this war. Similar to so many of our veterans, \nthese men and women come home and want to return to their lives. They \nwant to find employment and, importantly, they want to start a family.\n  Yet what they find when they go to the VA is that the fertility \nservices that are available don't meet their extremely complex needs. \nIn fact, veterans who suffer from these injuries find that the VA is \nspecifically barred from providing more advanced assisted reproductive \ntechniques such as IVF. They are told, despite the fact that they have \nmade such an extreme sacrifice for all of us, we cannot provide them \nwith the medical services they need simply to start a family.\n  These are families such as SSG Matt Keil and his wife Tracy. Despite \nreturning home from Iraq as a quadriplegic, Staff Sergeant Keil and \nTracy started talking about exploring the possibility of starting a \nfamily together, but because his injuries prevented him from having \nchildren naturally, Tracy turned to the VA and began to explore her \noptions for fertility treatments. But because of that VA ban they were \ntold no and turned away. They were out of options, and the Keils \ndecided this was important enough to them that they were willing to pay \nout-of-pocket, out of their own pockets, for IVF treatment in the \nprivate sector to the tune of $32,000 per round of treatment.\n  Thankfully, Staff Sergeant Keil and Tracy welcomed twins Matthew and \nFaith into the world after only one round of treatment.\n  Tracy said after their birth:\n\n       The day we had our children something changed in both of \n     us. This is exactly what we had always wanted, our dreams had \n     arrived.\n       The VA, Congress and the American people have said \n     countless times that they want to do everything they can to \n     support my husband or make him feel whole again and this is \n     your chance.\n       Having a family is exactly what we needed to feel whole \n     again. Please help us make these changes so that other \n     families can share in this experience.\n\n  Tracy and Matt aren't alone. There are many men and women out there \nwho share this common thread of a desperate desire to fulfill their \ndream of starting a family, only to find that the catastrophic wounds \nthey sustained while defending our country are now preventing them from \nseeing that dream through.\n  It shouldn't be that way. Unfortunately, Republicans are indicating \nthey will not join us today in overturning this absurd and antiquated \nban. Apparently, they would rather our Nation's heroes spend tens of \nthousands of dollars of their own money in the private sector to get \nthe advanced reproductive treatments they need to start a family. They \ndon't see the problem in letting our veterans' marriages dissolve \nbecause of the stress of infertility, in combination of course with the \nstress of readjusting to life after such a severe injury, driving \nrelationships to a breaking point.\n  Any servicemember who sustains this type of extremely serious injury \ndeserves a lot more. We came very close actually to making this bill a \nreality in the last Congress. In fact, Tracy Keil, whom I just talked \nabout, watched from the gallery when we unanimously passed this \nlegislation--unanimously.\n  But I am, once again, imploring Republicans to stand and explain to \nour men and women in uniform--who I know are paying very close \nattention to this debate--why they now want to turn their backs on the \ncatastrophic, reproductive wounds that have become a signature of these \nwars.\n  Only yesterday I spoke to a crowded room of heroes from Disabled \nAmerican Veterans and told them the heartbreaking story of the Keil \nfamily that I just shared and why this legislation is so important. If \ntheir cheers and applause are any indication, I would say they \nwholeheartedly agree our women veterans deserve this, our male veterans \ndeserve this, and certainly our military families deserve this.\n  I am on the floor to ask my colleagues a simple question: Are you \nwilling to tell those brave men and women who didn't ask those \nquestions when they were put in harm's way that you are going to let \npolitics get in the way of our commitment to them?\n  The catastrophic wounds we have seen from injuries in Iraq and \nAfghanistan have meant that our veterans' dreams to start a family have \nbeen put on hold because of the tremendous cost of IVF services. We \nbelieve that is a cost of war, and we believe the VA absolutely should \ncover it, and it is unacceptable to let unrelated issues stand in the \nway.\n  Even the major veterans service organizations and their leaders have \nsaid to us that issues such as the Iran sanctions--that the other side \nwants to offer--have no place in this comprehensive veterans \nlegislation, people such as American Legion Commander Daniel Dellinger, \nwho said: ``Iran is a serious issue that Congress needs to address, but \nit cannot be tied to S. 1982, which is extremely important as our \nnation prepares to welcome millions of U.S. military servicemen and \nwomen home from war,'' or IAVA founder and CEO Paul Rieckhoff, who \ncalled this\n\n[[Page S1191]]\n\ncomprehensive legislation ``a game changer that will change the \ntrajectory for millions of veterans for decades to come.''\n  As serious and as timely as they may be, unrelated issues such as \nIran sanctions are just calculated attempts to dismantle our bipartisan \neffort to expand health care, education opportunities, employment, and \nbenefits for our Nation's heroes. We can't allow our commitment to them \nto lapse or get caught up in separate issues of political \ngrandstanding.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont and all of his staff for their \ntireless work on this comprehensive legislation they have brought to \nthe floor. I truly hope our colleagues will reconsider opposing this \ncommonsense and important step to give those who have sacrificed \neverything the reproductive treatments they need to start a family.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak about the \nwidening dimensions of the slaughter in Syria. A country of 23 million \npeople, a proud country, is being transformed before our eyes into \nskeletons, refugees, and ghosts.\n  Three million Syrians have fled to neighboring countries. That number \nwill likely exceed 4 million by the end of the year. Nearly 7 million \nSyrians are refugees within their own country, driven from their homes \nby the atrocities of the Assad regime. More than 130,000 innocent \npeople have lost their lives during the 3-year civil war. We are \nwitnessing one of the greatest humanitarian crises since World War II, \nand it can be stopped.\n  Last summer my Committee on Armed Services colleague Senator Angus \nKing of Maine and I visited Turkey and Jordan to explore the dimension \nof the refugee crisis in both of those nations. We visited refugee \ncamps and talked to government leaders and NGOs about the damaged lives \nand the stressed communities that result from this unprecedented \ndisplacement of Syrians.\n  Last week the Senator from Maine and I visited Lebanon to see the \nscale of the Syrian crisis in that country. In a country of only \nslightly more than 4 million people, there are already over 1 million \nSyrian refugees who have fled into Lebanon over the last 3 years, one \nin four. Think of the scale of that refugee crisis. If we were to \nreceive in the United States war refugees at that scale, it would be 75 \nto 80 million people, nearly one in four.\n  In Lebanon last week we met with government leaders, NGOs, and the \nU.N. High Commissioner on Refugees. What we learned is staggering. The \nLebanese people have been unbelievably resilient and welcoming, almost \nbeyond the point of belief. The water and health infrastructure of that \nNation is strained to the breaking point.\n  The Lebanese economy, already fragile, is teetering. Schools in \nLebanon now operate on double shifts with Lebanese children in the \nmorning and refugee children in the afternoon, accommodating tens of \nthousands of refugee children, with more coming every day.\n  The decision by the Lebanese terrorist militia Hezbollah to go all in \nto support the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad has led to a wave of \nextremist bombings against Hezbollah-connected sites and leaders within \nLebanon in which many civilians are casualties. Senator King and I \nwitnessed a bombing in downtown Beirut while we were there, seeing it \nmiles away. Many in our group saw the explosion, saw the smoke rise. We \nfelt certain that our meetings would be canceled that day, but one of \nthe most grim aspects of our trip is a bombing, a suicide bombing that \nkilled 5 people and injured nearly 100, caused no one to change their \ndaily routine. That is what life is in Lebanon largely because of the \nSyrian civil war.\n  The crisis extends beyond Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon. Refugees are \nstreaming into nearby Iraq by the thousands--30,000 in 1 day in \nAugust--exacerbating the deterioration of that country's stability and \ndrawing it deeper into sectarian conflict.\n  This photo is on the Iraq border with Syria, and we see these \nrefugees stretching into the distance in the hills beyond. This is what \nis happening with all of the neighboring countries to Syria.\n  The United States is the largest provider of assistance to the \nrefugees who have fled outside of Syria. We have provided $1.3 billion \nin aid thus far, $340 million in Lebanon alone, but getting relief into \nSyria is the next challenge.\n  The conditions in Syria are even worse than the conditions I \ndescribed in Lebanon. Nearly 7 million Syrians are displaced within \ntheir own country, more than 9 million Syrians need humanitarian aid, \nbut they have not been able to receive basic humanitarian aid, food, \nand medicine due to the actions of the Bashar al-Assad regime and also \ndue to the complicity of the regime's patron, Russia.\n  The denial of humanitarian aid is a war crime, pure and simple. \nThousands are dying of starvation. Cases of tuberculosis, polio, \ntyphoid, and other diseases are expanding at an exponential rate. None \nof this is an accident. The Assad regime is using forced starvation and \nforced sieges as a weapon to destroy the Syrian people.\n  Last month I met in the Senate with Syrians who had survived the \nchemical weapons attacks carried out by the Assad regime in August of \n2013. They described in gruesome detail what they and their families, \nmany young children, endured in August. But the most shocking moment of \nthe interview came when a 22-year-old survivor, who had fled Syria \nthrough Lebanon, said if she had to pick, she would rather die a death \nbecause of chemical weapons than be hit by a barrel bomb or starved to \ndeath because death by chemical weapons would be quicker.\n  In recent weeks nothing has epitomized the brutality of the regime \nmore than the use of these barrel bombs. The bombs are crude weapons. \nThey are simple oil drums that are filled with shrapnel and explosives. \nHelicopters often deliver the weapons, and helicopters often hover over \nneighborhoods for minutes to just scare everyone who knows what is \ncoming. The barrel bombs drop. They explode shrapnel and level \nneighborhoods.\n  This is an example of a neighborhood in Aleppo. At one point hundreds \nwere killed when barrel bombs were dropped on Aleppo earlier this \nmonth. We see the size and scope of the devastation and see families \nand their children fleeing the area in the aftermath of a barrel bomb, \nand this is going on every day in Syria. Secretary Kerry has rightly \ncalled these barrel bomb attacks unacceptable and barbaric.\n\n  The primary architect of these crimes is Bashar Assad, but he has a \npatron who funds and supports what he does and who has the ability to \nstop the atrocities. Russia is Assad's principal support, and since the \nstart of the Syrian civil war Russia has shown it is complicit in these \nwar crimes. But it is also capable of stopping them.\n  In the United Nations Russia has used its veto power and threat of \nveto on the Security Council numerous times to block international \naction to help the Syrian people. Three of these vetoes were used to \nblock basic humanitarian aid. What possible reason could any civilized \nnation have to deny war victims food and medical supplies?\n  But Russia has shown it can be persuaded or shamed into taking action \nto promote the basic safety of the Syrian citizens. In August, with the \nthreat of U.S. military action to punish the Assad regime for use of \nchemical weapons against its own civilians, Russia realized it could no \nlonger be the sole global apologist for this atrocity. So it persuaded \nSyria to admit to the crime, acknowledge the existence of a stockpile, \nand commit to the complete destruction of these inhumane weapons. While \nthat process has been slow, the weaponry has not been used since Russia \nrealized the world would not tolerate such a clear violation of \ninternational law.\n  Similarly, after repeatedly blocking U.N. action to deliver \nhumanitarian aid in Syria, Russia decided, in the midst of the Sochi \nOlympics, it could\n\n[[Page S1192]]\n\nno longer stand in the way of basic humanitarian aid. The eyes of the \nworld were on it and it knew it could no longer be seen as the sole \nobstacle blocking people from receiving food and medicine. So it \nfinally agreed to U.N. Security Council Resolution 2139 calling for the \nprovision of humanitarian aid inside Syria.\n  When Russia could no longer comfortably block progress, when the eyes \nof the world were on it in the middle of the Olympics last week, it \nfinally joined with the rest of the world in calling on Syria to allow \naid to its people. In the aftermath of that resolution, the real test \nlies ahead, because those were words on paper and now we must see \nwhether the aid will be delivered.\n  This is the situation in Syria today. This is a recent photo from a \nsuburb of Damascus that has been under siege by the Assad regime \nwithout access to food and basic medical care. Witness this photo. Look \nat the destruction; look at the rubble; look at the throng of hungry \npeople stretching to oblivion in the distance. See the hunger in their \nfaces and bodies, and look at the questions in their eyes. It is \nincumbent upon the Syrian regime to allow unhindered access of \nhumanitarian aid to all Syrians. Opposition groups have that same \nobligation.\n  In conclusion, let me say a final word about Russian responsibility \nto respond to these poor Syrian people. When the Russian Government and \nits people see this picture, it should remind them of their own \nhistory. During the siege of Leningrad during World War II, the Nazis \ndeliberately used these same techniques and tactics--forced starvation \nand siege--as a tactic of war to cause horrible deprivation to the \nRussian population of that city. Russians should look in the eyes of \nthese victims of intentional starvation and grapple with their \nresponsibility to them.\n  Russia can cause the Assad regime, just as it did in August, to open \naccess so these people can have food and medicine. Russia has finally \nagreed to words on paper at the U.N., but the world will watch the \nactions of this nation.\n  One final thought. When Senator King and I were traveling last week \nin the Middle East, we went to other countries as well. In one country, \nwhere we are engaged in a back-and-forth over the provision of U.S. \nmilitary assistance, where we are raising what we think are legitimate \nquestions about some democracy reforms this nation needs to undertake \nif we are to be better and better partners, a leader of that nation \nsaid to me: If the United States won't provide assistance, then we will \nfind a way to make Russia our partner.\n  Well, to anyone who thinks making Russia your partner is a good \nthing, you ought to look at this photo too, because this is what has \nbecome of Syria choosing Russia as its principal partner. Is this the \nkind of partner you want?\n  We must keep the spotlight on these atrocities; we must keep the \nspotlight on Assad's responsibility; we must keep the spotlight on \nRussia's complicity to bring an end to these atrocities and work with \nother nations to find a resolution to the Syrian civil war.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, first of all, I want to say I am glad \nSenator Kaine has been here talking about this important issue today--\nthe tragedy of Syria, the tragedy of the barrel bombs, this hideous way \nto kill people where you fly over with helicopters and first terrorize \npeople who are wondering where you are going to drop these weapons, and \nthen basically shove them out the side door of a helicopter, and the \nRussian complicity in this.\n  We are seeing even today that Russia is beginning to flex its muscles \nas it relates to the people of Ukraine. I had the Prime Minister from \nGeorgia in to see me on Monday, and of course the day the Olympics were \nover the Russians were there the next day, more aggressively, \npartitioning off that part of Georgia they have seized in the last \ncouple of years, the same argument they could easily try to make in \nUkraine.\n  Ukraine, of the Soviet satellite states, is the one that has \npotentially the most future positive impact on Russia, if they could \nget it back. The countries of the West, the countries of the European \nUnion, and the United States should be aggressively uniting and trying \nto reinforce the desire for people in Ukraine to want to have economic \nfreedom and want to have personal freedom, and sending the strongest \npossible message against those who work against that, whether they are \nin Russia or whether they were complicit in the activities of Ukraine.\n  With this sudden moving around of Russian troops today, unannounced \nuntil just the last few hours that they would be maneuvering, it is \nusually no coincidence the Russians are moving troops around at a time \nof crisis on their borders. We should be very vigilant in sending the \nmessage of freedom, the message of supporting people who want freedom.\n  My concern about Syria is that our policy hasn't worked there either \nand, frankly, our policy hasn't worked in such a way that it makes it \nhard for us now to say there will be consequences for Russia if \nsomething happens in Ukraine. We need to be sure the world knows, when \nthe United States talks about consequences, that there will be \nconsequences, they will be meaningful, they will be certain, and that \nthings such as are happening in Syria can't be allowed to continue, and \nworse things, such as those happening in Ukraine, can't be allowed to \nhappen.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  I came to the floor today to talk about health care again. I heard \nthe leader's comments over the weekend--Senator Reid's comments--where \nhe is referring to the President's health care plan. He said: There are \nplenty of horror stories being told. Then Senator Reid said: They are, \nall of them, untrue. All of them are untrue.\n  I don't think anybody has come to the floor more frequently than I \nhave in the last 2 months, 3 months, 10 weeks. I believe I have been \ncoming to the floor every week, the 10 weeks we were in session, with \nstories from Missourians. We call them. We talk to them about it. We \nsay: Senator Blunt is going to the floor and he is going to talk about \nwhat you have talked to us about. He would like to mention your first \nname, where you are from, but if you don't want him to do that, he \nwon't do that. In virtually every case, they say: We told you these \nstories because we want other people to know. We want people to know \nhow we are being affected by the President's health care bill.\n  They seem to have plenty of facts backing them up, way beyond Senator \nReid's assertion that all of them are untrue. They are not all untrue. \nIn fact, I have every reason to believe they are all true, and there \nare many more stories out there to be told.\n  Today I wanted to talk about the changes in Medicare Advantage and I \nhad to have some discussion with our team, and they asked: Well, how \nmany of these stories are you not going to tell this week if you just \ntell the stories about Medicare Advantage? If you are in agreement with \nSenator Reid's view of the world, I guess you think the active \nimagination of Missourians is running wild, because they are contacting \nour office constantly telling us about higher premiums, higher \ndeductibles, insurance they used to have that worked and insurance that \ndoesn't work, and it doesn't work because the Federal Government, \nwithout thinking through the goal of trying to be sure more people had \naccess to insurance, didn't think about all of the unintended \nconsequences.\n  The latest broken promise--I am afraid it won't be the last; I wish \nit would be the last broken promise, but it won't be the last, I \nsuspect--relates to the 15 million people in America who have Medicare \nAdvantage--something they liked and something they are not going to be \nable to have, in many cases, the way they used to have it. This is \nanother application of that promise of if you like your insurance, you \ncan keep it. Well, all the 15 million Americans who have Medicare \nAdvantage, many of them, are going to find they can't keep it. And \nbefore this is over, all of them may find out they can't keep it.\n  The President's health care plan has already cut hundreds of billions \nof dollars from Medicare--not to save Medicare but to fund the new \nprogram. Everybody knows Medicare is one of the\n\n[[Page S1193]]\n\ngreat challenges we have going forward. How are we going to maintain \nMedicare? Only in Washington would you be able to get by with saying: \nMedicare is in real trouble, so let's cut it to start another program. \nThis is the only place in America you wouldn't be laughed off the city \ncouncil dais or off the legislative floor if you said: We have this one \nprogram that is in big trouble. We are not going to do anything to \nreform it, we are just going to cut it so we can start another program. \nYet that is what has happened here.\n  We have already cut Medicare by $300 billion--that is Medicare \nAdvantage--and on top of this cut to Medicare Advantage we now see that \nplans are being changed, and they are being changed in significant \nways.\n  Why did we have Medicare Advantage for States such as mine--the State \nof Missouri--with lots of rural areas, lots of rural hospitals, without \nalways having competitive health care providers? Medicare Advantage \nprovided the competition. It was that competition that made Medicare \nAdvantage and Medicare Part D work and made them work at much less cost \nthan anybody had anticipated. The marketplace works if you focus on a \ncompetitive marketplace rather than trying to run health care to be \nsure there is competition out there. That is what Medicare Advantage \ndid. In our State, 1 out of 4 people on Medicare is on Medicare \nAdvantage--237,000 Missourians on Medicare Advantage.\n  On February 14, I joined my colleagues in urging CMS not to make any \nmore cuts to Medicare Advantage. There were 40 of us who signed that \nletter, and 19 of the 40 Senators who signed that letter were \nDemocrats, with 21 Republicans. So there is a pretty bipartisan sense \nthat something must be happening out there to hurt these programs. That \nis true, not untrue.\n  Why would we continue to do that? I don't know. So I have joined the \nRepublican leaders in a letter this week calling on Secretary Sebelius \nto stop moving forward with these misguided policies that do things \nthat impact people on Medicare Advantage; that do things that impact \npeople who had health insurance with a deductible they could afford but \nnow no longer have.\n  The administration's proposals continue once again to contradict the \npromise that if you had health care you liked, you could keep your \nhealth care policy; that if you had doctors you liked, you could keep \nyour doctors. More and more people are seeing that is not true.\n  These many stories I have heard I firmly believe to be true, not \nuntrue, no matter what the majority leader of the Senate might have \nsaid. Let me share a few of those today as I move toward the conclusion \nof what I want to talk about today.\n  Darcie from Kansas City, MO, is a registered nurse and works with \nMedicare patients daily. She sees firsthand the effect the rising \nexpenses on Medicare Advantage are having on people she deals with. \nThis is a quote from her letter:\n\n       Our seniors and other Medicare Advantage members should \n     not, as they already do, have to make choices between paying \n     for medicines and other healthcare related expenses or food \n     or housing expenses.\n       I hope you are able to see the bigger picture, as I do, as \n     a 30-year-old professional nurse who is on the frontlines \n     each and every day taking care of these individuals and their \n     families.\n\n  This sounds truthful to me.\n  Edward and his wife, from Saint Peters, MO, live on a fixed income. \nHe said:\n\n       My wife and I are retired seniors living on a fixed income. \n     I have Medicare Advantage, which is provided by Mercy--a \n     Missouri based health insurance company. I am told I will \n     lose coverage next year due to ObamaCare cuts. Why must the \n     cost of ObamaCare--which Missourians did not want--be paid by \n     cuts to seniors? Please change the ObamaCare law to leave \n     Medicare Advantage alone.\n\n  Again, 19 Democrats and 21 Republicans signed a letter last week \nasking the same question. This letter didn't even say: Go back and \nreverse what you have done. Just stop making these cuts being made \nright now.\n  Ronald from Raytown, MO, says his copay has increased as a result of \nthe administration's cuts to Medicare Advantage plans.\n\n       Please protect our Medicare Advantage plans. As you know, \n     Medicare is presently underfunded. I do not appreciate those \n     that permit Obama to willfully take [hundreds of billions of] \n     dollars that we seniors have paid into Medicare and use those \n     monies to fund ObamaCare. I am counting on you to protect our \n     Medicare Advantage plans and realize that the less government \n     involvement in our Medicare Advantage plans, the more \n     efficient the plan. As a result of ObamaCare, my copay has \n     increased.\n\n  My guess is Ronald knows whether or not his copay has increased. In \nspeaking with him, I am certainly persuaded that the facts he is \npresenting--like the other people we are talking about today--are \nabsolutely true.\n  Jennifer from Blue Springs, MO, says:\n\n       My husband and I are both on Medicare already . . . the co-\n     pays for our ``Medicare Advantage'' plans have doubled and, \n     in some cases, tripled from 2013 to 2014 . . . [and that is \n     why I'm responding with a nightmare story].\n\n  The other thing Jennifer said is she and her husband are retired. \nThey are musicians, and they had a business where they would go to \nnursing homes and play gospel music just for their expenses. She points \nout that because of the increased health care costs, nursing homes no \nlonger have room in their budget for something that is entertaining, \nsuch as live gospel music. The reverberations of what happens when the \ngovernment decides that the government is better prepared to manage not \njust Medicare and Medicaid--as if we didn't have enough challenges \nalready--but 16 percent or 17 percent of the economy are seen out there \nevery day.\n  I certainly believe there have to be some people who are benefiting \nfrom this, but the numbers don't suggest that the overall benefit is \nnearly as good as the overall damage: people losing insurance at \ngreater numbers than people getting insurance; premiums going up more \nthan going down; deductibles rising.\n  It would be nice for those who supported this to convince people that \nall these stories are untrue, but I think too many people have true \nstories to tell for their neighbors and their friends not to realize \nwhat is happening because of this government interference with a health \ncare system that was working instead of doing the handful of things we \ncould have done to make the best health care system in the world work \nbetter. They were there. They were offered. The President knew they \nwere there. That is not the course we followed, and the course we are \nfollowing is not leading to a place where most Americans want to be.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to come to \nthe floor to speak about a different subject but one which is imminent \nand necessary for us to consider; that is, the current Iranian \nsanctions issue.\n  Back in 2007, when Iran had ``only'' about 700 centrifuges spinning \nto enrich uranium, we--and by ``we,'' I mean nearly the entire \ninternational community--determined that the behavior by the Iranian \nregime was simply too dangerous to tolerate. The U.N. Security Council \nbegan the process of passing a series of resolutions demanding that \nIran stop enriching uranium entirely. The United States, led by many \nhere in the Senate, began the very careful and painstaking process of \namassing an international coalition to back increasingly tough \nsanctions, all aimed explicitly at forcing the Iranian regime to end \nenrichment activities.\n  The reason for this was because we believed a nuclear weapons-capable \nor -armed Iran posed an imminent threat not just to the Middle East but \nto the world community. That was the consensus agreed to by the world \ncommunity and supported by resolution after resolution from the \nSecurity Council of the United Nations and by proclamations by not only \nour country but by countries around the world.\n  The entire effort had, for some years, been devoted entirely to \nending uranium enrichment activities. The consensus was that nuclear \nweapon possession or capability posed unacceptable\n\n[[Page S1194]]\n\nconsequences. Now that goal is nowhere in sight. Neither the interim \nagreement currently being employed, nor the administration, nor any of \nthe negotiating partners even refer to these resolutions or this \nmultiyear strategy of achieving the objective we set out to accomplish. \nThe objective was that Iran would cease enrichment of uranium, which \ncould be used to achieve nuclear weapons capability. This goal has \nsuddenly been totally abandoned.\n  The current interim agreement explicitly concedes to the Iranians \ntheir right to continue enrichment activities with only meager \nlimitations, all of which can be reversed by the mullahs in Iran in an \ninstant. The mullahs in Iran boast publicly of this great negotiating \nvictory for them, which goes against everything we have been trying to \ndo for the past 6 or 7 years.\n  It seems unassailable that Iran came to the negotiating table at long \nlast directly as a consequence of the hardship that was achieved by \nthese international economic sanctions that were imposed on this \nregime. They resisted coming to the negotiating table until these \nsanctions really started to hit home.\n  But what is equally clear is that the regime wants sanctions relief \nand has sought this interim deal to accomplish it--and unfortunately, \nwe have given it to them. And what do we get in return? What we get in \nreturn is having negotiated away our very core purpose for doing this \nin the first place. Instead of using our leverage to continue the \nprogress we had made to bring Iran to cease uranium enrichment, we \nblunted our very best leverage and our very best tool. Instead of \npressing our long-term advantage, we have begun to relieve the pressure \non Iran to cease their efforts to gain nuclear weapon capability. And \nwhy have we abandoned our goal to stop uranium enrichment? Because the \nIranian negotiating team has told us they would never tolerate an end \nto their long, expensive path to an enrichment industry.\n  So here is my central conviction on this matter: If those on the \nother side of the table tell us in advance that our long-held \nconviction and purpose is asking too much, instead of meekly complying \nwith their request, then we must increase pressure until they change \ntheir minds, not abandon our own goal because it is perceived as too \ntough.\n  So what have we bought with this interim agreement? According to the \nBipartisan Policy Center, of which I used to be a part, the main \npractical consequence of this claimed ``freezing'' is that the time \nIran now needs to produce a critical mass of highly enriched uranium--\n20 kilograms--with current centrifuges has gone from an estimated 59 \ndays to 63 days. What did we gain from the agreement? Four days--four \ndays longer that it will take Iran, once they flip the switch, to get \nhighly enriched uranium, which allows them nuclear capability.\n  It seems clear that among Iran's principal objectives now is to break \napart the strong international consensus we have worked so hard over so \nmany years to forge. Prospects for Iran to do so look pretty darned \ngood. Clearly Iran has not lived up to what they agreed to do or what \nwe asked them to do. But there seems to be no prospect in place for our \nreturning to sanctions unless the Senate, on a bipartisan basis--and \nthere is bipartisan support for this--is able to impose the next round \nof sanctions should this interim agreement not achieve its objectives. \nYet we are currently being blocked from bringing this legislation to \nthe floor.\n  I repeat: This is bipartisan legislation led by Senator Menendez of \nNew Jersey and those who have been actively engaged and involved. But \nnow we are being asked to stand down. We are not even given a chance to \nexercise our vote on this, which we are attempting to add to the \npending legislation here. Again, delay, delay, delay is putting us in a \nposition of essentially conceding to the Iranians what they want and \ngiving them the opportunity to continue to pursue their quest for \nnuclear weapons capability.\n  Obviously, for them, it is just fine if they can turn the protracted \nuncertainty and gradual sanctions relief into a series of lesser \nagreements. But for us, more interim agreements will mean our allies \nwill become accustomed to these gradual changes and the increasing \ncommerce in Iranian oil. They will become less inclined to again \nreverse course almost regardless of Iranian actions. Following that \nprolonged process, we confront a stronger Iran but a weaker \ninternational coalition opposed to Iranian nuclear ambitions. Iranian \nambitions and capabilities will grow, our efforts to halt the Iranian \nquest for nuclear capability will diminish, and we will then be left \nwith a choice of containing or taking military action against a \nnuclear-capable, if not nuclear-armed, Iran.\n  The President has said repeatedly that ``containment'' is not an \noption. It is not for me either. Since he also said military force is \nan option, it seems clear to me this current course is more likely to \nbring us to that stark point than to a negotiated settlement.\n\n  We must be determined to do what we can in the Senate to prevent us \nfrom reaching that point. Not only must we refocus our government and \nother friendly governments on the need to eliminate Iran's nuclear \ninfrastructure in any final agreement--no matter how difficult that \nmight be--we must also oppose Iran's likely intentions to prolong the \nnegotiation process intended to continue to weaken our coalition.\n  The Nuclear Weapons Free Iran Act that I have cosponsored will give \nus great leverage in doing that. It will make it clear that the Senate \nwill not support playing Iran's game any longer than we already have.\n  I deeply regret that we are not being given the opportunity to debate \nthis issue before the American people and among ourselves, that we are \nnot allowed to have a vote in the Senate as to whether our current \npolicy that this administration is pursuing is the right policy to \nachieve the goal which we all agreed to.\n  The last four Presidents--two Democrats and two Republicans--have \ndeclaratively said: A nuclear-capable Iran is unacceptable. President \nObama has stated that over and over. Yet here we are engaged in a \nprocess that advances that prospect.\n  We are put at a disadvantage, and we are giving away the one tool \nthat has brought Iran to the negotiating table. They have trumpeted \npublicly about how they have outsmarted us and outnegotiated us and \nachieved what they wanted to achieve and diminished our opportunity to \nachieve what the world community wants to achieve. We will rue the day \nthat we almost had Iran to the point where we could have achieved our \ngoal but stepped back and conceded to their promise and commitment to \ncontinue to enrich, to continue to add centrifuges, and to continue \ntheir pursuit of nuclear weapons capability.\n  If Iran is armed with nuclear weapons, it will pose unimaginable \nconsequences to us. There has been total agreement on that among the \nworld's Nations. Yet here we stand at the moment of decision--right \nwhen we, in a sense, had them where we wanted to get them, and we \nconceded that.\n  I deeply regret that we have not been able to move forward with these \nadditional sanctions to be employed if--in this first interim \nagreement--Iran does not live up to the objectives and goals which we \nhave demanded.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 2 \np.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I am thrilled that we are here at this \nmoment debating benefits for our veterans. Our veterans have stood up \nfor America by fighting for us overseas, and when they come home we \nneed to be standing up for them. Over time we have come to recognize \nthat there are a number of shortfalls in the way we address our \nbenefits for veterans that need to be corrected, and that is what this \nbill is all about.\n  Yesterday we had a motion to close debate on whether to debate this \nbill, and that was successful, so here we are at this moment. Let's \nrecognize that America has been at war for more than 12 years, that \nmore than 6,000 Americans have lost their lives in service to our \ncountry, that more than 50,000 Americans have been wounded in combat.\n  At some point 2\\1/2\\ million Americans have left their homes and \ntheir families to serve their country in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many of \nthese men and women have served more than 1 deployment, and 400,000 men \nand women have served more than 3 deployments. They have gone back to \nthe theater of war repeatedly, with sacrifices on a personal level, \nsacrifices for their family and sacrifices for their health. They have \ngone into perilous situations on behalf of our Nation. Today we need to \nmake sure the benefits promised are there, and where the benefits are \ninsufficient, that they are improved.\n  I am hearing there is a possibility there may be an effort today to \nblock this bill--this bill on behalf of our veterans. I certainly hope \nthat will not be the case. How can we explain that the ongoing partisan \npolitics that have so poisoned and paralyzed our Nation are more \nimportant than addressing the benefits of our veterans--our service men \nand our service women--who have fought for our country. Today is not a \nday for partisan politics. It is a day for keeping faith with those who \nhave served our Nation.\n  I will address a particular provision that is in this bill today. The \nbill takes on many issues, one of which is to work very hard to shorten \nand eliminate the big lag in time that occurs when our veterans apply \nfor benefits. Benefits delayed are, for a period of time, benefits \ndenied. The Department of Veterans Services has made progress with more \nprogress to come. This bill will make a difference in eliminating the \nbacklog and will address the needs of our veterans in a timely fashion, \nand timeliness is very important.\n  There is another provision in this bill that I particularly want to \nemphasize because it comes out of conversations that occurred 6 years \nago when I was talking to folks about running for the Senate. People in \nOregon said: We need to take care of our Gold Star families--our \nfamilies who are striving and struggling to be on their feet after they \nhave lost a servicemember in combat. This is a challenge, of course, \nfor the children and it is a challenge for the spouses.\n  A veteran brought up the fact that we needed to provide much better \neducational benefits. I am very pleased to have a bipartisan sponsor, \nSenator Heller of Nevada, because there is nothing about helping our \nveterans that should be a partisan issue. There is nothing about \naddressing the needs of our Gold Star families who have lost a member \nof the family in combat that should be a partisan issue.\n  Mr. Robert Thornhill, a veteran, talked to me in 2008, right before I \ncame to this Chamber, about this issue of educationed benefits for the \nchildren and for the spouses. When the primary wage earner for a family \nis struck down in battle, the rest of the family needs a lot of help \nregaining their feet, and that means educational opportunities for the \nchildren. But let's not forget that the spouse who has to take over \nmajor financial responsibilities also needs educational benefits.\n  Shortly before I came here, the post-9/11 GI bill went into effect \ncreating the Machine Gunnery Sergeant Fry Scholarship. That scholarship \nfulfilled the vision that Robert Thornhill and I had talked about, and \nit went even further to include housing and book stipends and support \nfor attendance at private universities, but it only did so for the \nchildren of the fallen.\n  Mr. Thornhill followed up with me. He noted that we need to take on \nand extend these benefits to spouses as well. Over the long term \nchildren need help going to college, but in the short term spouses \noften have to be retrained to adopt their new role as the major \nbreadwinner for the family.\n  For several years I have been advocating that we fulfill this vision \nof taking care of the educational opportunity issues for our Gold Star \nfamilies. Education is a powerful tool to rebuild a family's financial \nfoundation, but it has to be affordable.\n  There is a provision in this bill that Mr. Thornhill championed, a \nprovision that is fundamental to fairness for our spouses of those who \nhave fallen, and it is a provision that is fundamental to the future \nsuccess of our Gold Star families.\n  This provision--this Spouses of Heroes Education Act--is one element \namong a number that our Committee on Veterans' Affairs has so ably \nassembled to address shortfalls in the programs that assist those who \nhave stood for our country.\n  Let us not forget what we are working to do: to keep faith with those \nwho have served our country. Let us set aside the petty, partisan, \npoisonous games and let's hold the faith and keep our veterans in mind.\n  Let's get this bill done. Let's get it to conference with the House. \nLet's get it to the Oval Office. Let us keep faith with those who have \nstood for our country.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am delighted the Senate is talking \nabout our veterans. I am disappointed the bill before us did not go \nthrough the entire committee process. I am grateful that Senator Burr, \nthe ranking member, has brought forward a side-by-side bill which I \nwish to discuss for a moment. I am particularly glad the Burr bill \nbrings up the Iran sanctions issue. I know the administration has kind \nof backed away from the sanctions because of some things that have \nhappened recently and does not want a sanctions bill to pass the \nSenate.\n  I have followed closely what has happened in the Middle East. I \nrecall back to 1979 when Georgians were held hostage in the American \nEmbassy in Tehran for 444 days. I have a lot of experience with that \npart of the world and I think there are some things of which we should \nbe reminded.\n  This bill, the Burr bill that includes the veterans' benefits, also \nincludes nuclear weapons sanctions on Iran and most of the provisions \nof the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act. In particular, three things \nincluded are important to note.\n  No. 1, it reimposes existing sanctions suspended under the interim \nagreement if Iran cheats on its commitment, drags its feet in \nnegotiations, or threatens the West with long-range missiles or \nterrorism.\n  No. 2, it ensures the final agreement must require Iran to dismantle \nits illicit nuclear infrastructure to prevent Iran from being able to \nproduce nuclear weapons.\n  No. 3, it threatens to impose additional economic sanctions in the \nfuture should Iran cheat on its commitment or fail to agree to the \nfinal deal that dismantles its nuclear infrastructure.\n  I have watched the television set. I have seen the international \nreports. I have listened to what the Iranians are saying since we have \nhad this interim agreement, and here is what it says: Iranian President \nHassan Rouhani pledged that under no circumstances--and that is a \ndirect quote--would Iran agree to dismantle a single centrifuge in a \nfinal nuclear agreement.\n\n[[Page S1196]]\n\n  This is what he is saying now and we are talking about getting to a \nfinal agreement months from now.\n  Second, during Iran's national day celebrations in which American \nflags were burned, Rouhani declared: ``We will permanently continue to \nprogress our nuclear technology.''\n  Third, former Iranian top nuclear negotiator Hossein Mousavian told \nIranian media in a recent interview that the Islamic Republic will \nnever--I underscore never--agree to dismantle portions of its nuclear \ninfrastructure.\n  Iran nuclear negotiator Majid Takhte Ravanchi reiterated Iran would \nnot accept the closure of ``any of its nuclear sites.''\n  Next, an Iran official on February 12 set aside the idea of \npotentially altering a nuclear reactor so that other nations would fear \nthe production of atomic bomb fuel.\n  Finally, Iran will determine its needs regarding uranium enrichment \non its own, the country's chief nuclear scientist said on February 25, \nand will not--and I underscore not--accept foreign powers dictating its \nenrichment policy.\n  Iran is advancing its nuclear ballistics testing system and it has \nfired nuclear missiles to test its capability. Iran has deployed two \nships in the Atlantic as a show of force on the United States of \nAmerica. They continue in every way possible to be a surrogate fighter \nin Syria, empowering the Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, and \nthey continue to cause the disturbances throughout the Middle East.\n  Why should we not as a Congress of the United States, in talking \nabout our veterans, include within that talk a clear shot across the \nbow to the Iranians that America will not stand for them laughing at us \nor poking their finger in our face when we talk about a nuclear-free \nIran?\n  We do not need a nuclear armed Iran in the Middle East for a plethora \nof reasons. Most importantly, if they get one, there will be a nuclear \narms race in a very unstable part of the world. It is the home of \nterrorism. It is the home of the biggest fear the United States of \nAmerica has, and our best ally, Israel, lies in the path of Iranian \nresistance. So it is important the sanctions be reinstated and that we \nhave conditions on the Iranians so that if they violate their promises \nor they look the other way on their commitments or they do what they \nare saying on their own national television networks today, they \nunderstand there will be a consequence to their actions.\n  I remember 1979. I remember when ``Nightline'' became a television \nshow because for 444 days Americans were held hostage in Tehran. I \nremember that just the day before President Reagan was sworn in as \nPresident of the United States, President Carter finally negotiated a \nrelease of the hostages in Iran, for one simple reason: Iran knew that \nonce President Carter was out of office and President Reagan came into \noffice, he would follow through on what he said, and that is he would \ndo whatever it took to free the hostages.\n  There is only one thing the Iranians understand. They understand \nsomeone who will fight and stand up to them, someone who will take them \non, and somebody who will not settle for their looking the other way on \nthe agreement they made. It is critical and important the Senate of the \nUnited States send a clear message to the Iranians that we will not be \nlied to, we will not be misled, and we expect them to live up to the \ncommitments they have promised to live up to. If they don't, there will \nbe consequences for their actions.\n  The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are already \npointing out that the economy of Iran is now improving, with the \ninterim agreement we currently have. We have no certainty on a final \nagreement that is coming in the next few months. We have no certainty \nthe Iranians are going to do what they say they are going to do anyway. \nIf we sit here passively saying it will be all right, if we don't let \nthem know there will be conditions if they violate the sanctions, if we \ndon't let them know we mean business, then America will have turned its \nback on the most dangerous enemy we have, and that is the enemy of \nterrorism and the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n  I appreciate our veterans and the sacrifice they have made to try and \nfree us from terrorism. I appreciate the volunteers who have sacrificed \ntheir sacred treasure and their families and their own personal blood \nand their own personal life trying to defend America and liberate the \npeople of Iraq and the people of Afghanistan. I don't want us to turn \nand leave the Middle East. I want to let the Middle East know, and its \nbiggest ogre, the Nation of Iran, that we will not stand for a nuclear \nweapon in Iran. If they continue to try and progress toward that, there \nwill be sanctions that will be crippling. America will not turn its \nback on Iran; we will stand toe to toe with them and say this will not \nstand.\n  I commend Senator Burr for his leadership in including that in this \nportion of the veterans bill, as well as those members of the Foreign \nRelations Committee and the other 57 Members of the Senate who have \nsigned the Iran sanctions bill. It is my hope and plea that sometime in \nthe weeks ahead, before the Iranians think we have no teeth left at \nall, that we will do the right thing on the floor of the U.S. Senate \nand enhance the conditions of sanctions against the Nation of Iran if \nthey lie to us or fail to keep the promises they have made in the \ninterim agreement and the ultimate permanent agreement we make.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we have a lot of challenges before this \nNation and this Congress. I believe the most critical challenge is how \nwe handle financial matters that have been entrusted to us, how we \nhandle the budget and spend the debt we are approving in America, and \nare we able--do we have the will, do we have the integrity--to stand up \nand put this Nation on a sound fiscal path.\n  I would note to all my colleagues that the week before last before \nthe Budget Committee, our own Congressional Budget Office Director Mr. \nDoug Elmendorf repeated once again--which is absolutely accepted by \nvirtually every economist in America--this country remains on an \nunsustainable debt course. This is an unsustainable path we are on. He \nindicated and said flatly we could, indeed, face a fiscal crisis, \nsomething like 2007, perhaps, something like Greece, because our debt \nis so large and growing at such a pace. We have never been here before. \nWe are in the red zone on the tachometer. We are in the danger area, \nand we need to get out of it.\n  So I would say to my colleagues, isn't this true? Does anybody doubt \nit? Does anybody deny it? Then why don't we respond in an appropriate \nway?\n  I was shocked, deeply disappointed, amazed, and saddened that this \nheadline appeared earlier in the week in the Washington Post. This is \nwhat it said: ``With 2015 budget request, Obama will call for an end to \nera of austerity.''\n  What does this mean? Every Member of this Congress knows what it \nmeans. It means the President of the United States is no longer \ninterested in fiscal responsibility. He is saying: We no longer need to \ntighten our belt. He is saying he is going to attack anybody who \nsuggests more spending is bad. He is going to say that he is going into \nthis election with the idea that he is going to promise, promise, \npromise more and more spending, more debt, and he is not concerned \nabout it. That is what it means. I am not exaggerating. I think every \nMember of this body knows exactly what that signal was.\n  So we will see the budget. It will be out next Tuesday, and we will \nhave a hearing in the Budget Committee, of which I am the ranking \nRepublican, on Wednesday. But I suspect and am confident it will do \njust like his last two budgets. It would increase spending $1 trillion \nabove the amount of spending we agreed to in 2011 and reaffirmed \nessentially with the Ryan-Murray bill that he signed about 2 months ago \ninto law.\n  We cannot do this. This is how we destroy a country, how we weaken an \neconomy. I cannot--I do not have words to express it.\n\n[[Page S1197]]\n\n  I will say one more point. Economists are telling us that our \neconomic growth today is below what it otherwise would be because of \nthe size of the debt this country faces right now--not in the future, \nright now. It is a wet blanket on economic growth. The Rogoff-Reinhart \nstudy talks about the slower growth, and we have consistently seen \nprojections for growth not being met.\n  Director Elmendorf, in his testimony--I asked him about it 2 years \nago. He predicted 2013 would allow us to see 4.6-percent economic \ngrowth. It came in at 1.9 percent--a stunning miss, well below. Below \n2-percent growth means you are not creating jobs, you are not creating \nwealth, you are basically stagnant with an increasing population.\n  We need to be at 4.6 percent. We need some of that kind of growth. \nOne reason we are not is bigger government, more taxes, more \nregulations, and more debt.\n  We are not going to get out of it until we get off that path.\n  So now we have a veterans bill before us. Nobody, I do not believe, \nis more committed to veterans in this body than I have been, and so \nmany of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle want to do the right \nthing for veterans. But it is an audacious thing we are seeing here \ntoday.\n  Let's review some of the history.\n  Two months ago, every Senate Democrat--every Senate Democrat--voted \nfor a bill to cut military pensions for our soldiers, our military \nretirees, and even our disabled veterans. It was in their bill.\n  Senate Democrats then blocked--not once but twice--my efforts, other \nRepublican efforts to restore those cuts by closing a tax credit \nloophole for illegal immigrants.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague and friend, Senator Sanders, in the \nChamber. I am going to get to the point. I will do it now because I \nknow he has a busy agenda, and I think I know how the script will all \nplay out.\n  I say to Senator Sanders and colleagues, the pending measure before \nus today, S. 1982, the Comprehensive Veterans Health and Benefits and \nMilitary Retirement Pay Restoration Act of 2014--which is a good title \nfor a bill--would cause the aggregate level of budget authority and \noutlays for fiscal year 2014, deemed pursuant to section 111 of Public \nLaw 113-67, to be exceeded. Therefore, I raise a point of order under \nsection 311(a)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Alabama for \naccommodating my schedule. I will have more to say on this issue later \nthis afternoon. But let me at this point simply say: Mr. President, \npursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the \nwaiver provisions of applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all \napplicable sections of that act and applicable budget resolutions for \npurposes of the pending bill, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, Mr. President, reclaiming the floor, now you have \nit in stark clarity. This bill proposes to spend more than we agreed to \nspend passing the Ryan-Murray Act a few weeks ago. President Obama \nsigned it 2 months ago. The ink is hardly dry on it, and here we have \nanother bill to raise that, to raise the spending again. And it will \nnot be the only one. We are going to see bill after bill after bill, \nand it is part of the President's strategy.\n  What is it? The era of austerity is over. He signed Ryan-Murray. He \nsigned the Budget Control Act. But he had no intention of complying \nwith it. He will not support enforcement of it. That is a failure of \nleadership of a monumental proportion. It is a stunning event.\n  I do not know why we have a Congress, why we pass laws that say we \nare only going to spend so much money and then we waltz in, just a few \nweeks later, and spend billions more than we agreed to. And, oh, we \nwill just waive the budget we just passed. Oh, this is important. But \neverybody knew when we passed the limits on spending that there were \ngoing to be important bills.\n  I am actually shocked, even by Senate and congressional standards, \nhow blase this body has been about these laws. I thought at least \npeople would pretend to honor them. There is no pretense here. And it \nis a failure of responsibility in this body if such spending were to \npass.\n  So our colleagues voted to cut the retirement pay of veterans, which \nI opposed and Republicans opposed. That was already in law--a \ncommitment we made to military people that if they served 20 years, \nthey get this retirement benefit.\n  They waltzed in to save $6 billion, supposedly, and they were going \nto reduce their pension benefits. I did not feel, No. 1, it was \nnecessary. There were other ways to save money. And I felt we had ways \nto save the money in a different way and offered legislation to that \neffect. So the attempts to fix it were blocked twice.\n  What was in the Ryan-Murray bill was fiscally responsible--bad policy \nbut responsible fiscally. This bill is not. This bill increases, \ncreates new veterans programs, new spending for veterans, and it is not \npaid for in any way. It is all borrowed money. We are already in debt, \nso when we enter and commit ourselves to additional obligations above \nwhat we have agreed to, every penny of that is borrowed, every penny of \nthat will add to the debt of our country.\n  This bill busts the caps we agreed to. These are caps we all voted \nfor--or at least our colleagues did, the Democratic colleagues, because \nI did not vote for the Ryan-Murray bill. I thought it eroded the Budget \nControl Act more than I wanted it to and it raised the caps. But it \nkept them in place. It eased pressure in several areas where the shoe \nwas pinching badly. It eased that pressure. But that is not enough now? \nWe have to have more?\n  It is using the veterans as a political tool, in my view. I do not \nthink our veterans want their programs to be enhanced if every penny of \nmoney that is going to enhance those programs is added to the debt of \nthe United States of America.\n  This is eight times at least since the Budget Control Act was passed \nthat we have seen efforts to bust it. So our military men and women who \nworked tirelessly, selflessly, for the good of this country, have \nalways put duty first. Shouldn't we put duty first?\n  This massive Federal budget of ours is filled with waste, filled with \nprojects that cannot be defended intellectually. It was our duty to get \nrid of wasteful pet projects and do the right thing for our veterans.\n  I say to my colleagues, for example, you could have closed the tax \ncredit loophole for illegal immigrants that is costing America billions \nof dollars. The cut to the veterans pension was about $6 billion over \n10 years. Annually, according to the President's own inspector general \nat his own Department of Treasury, we are losing $4 billion a year in \nimproper tax credit payments to illegal aliens. Why don't we fix that? \nThe inspector general asked that we fix that. It would save $20 billion \nover 10 years. No, sir. What do they tell us? We are not doing anything \non immigration.\n  Well, the first thing you should do to create a lawful system of \nimmigration in America is to quit rewarding people financially who come \nillegally. That is the first thing. For Heaven's sakes, what is wrong \nwith that? Is that immoral?\n  We had an instance in which there was a trailer, I believe in \nIndiana. A number of people lived there. No children. They claimed 19 \nchildren and got refunds from the United States of America of $30,000--\nall of which were not proper, none of which were proper.\n  That is what the inspector general was talking about. You are not \nentitled to come to America illegally--have children in some other \ncountry--and then demand that we give you a tax credit, which is the \nequivalent of a direct check from the U.S. Treasury. A tax credit is \nnot a deduction. It is a check from the U.S. Treasury.\n  But, oh no, we will not even discuss that. That is a nonstarter. So \nit looks like politics trumps helping veterans. So if we had had a plan \nto fix the veterans retirement, that could have all worked together on \na good basis. Here we have now another veterans bill that is not going \nto work. Are there no programs, are there no spending plans out\n\n[[Page S1198]]\n\nthere that could not be trimmed, eliminated or reconfigured that could \nhelp us honor the commitments we have made to our veterans? There \nsurely are. Lots of them. We have seen a lot of them offered.\n  So I challenge any of our colleagues, Senate Democrats, to come to \nthe floor and name one program they are willing to terminate in order \nto help fund our veterans adequately. Come down and let's hear it. \nThere is a circling of the wagons in this administration. What did the \nPresident mean when he said: The era of austerity is over, as the \nWashington Post reported? What did me mean? He meant that we are not \ncutting anything else. He meant that he is going to propose, as he has \nin the past, new spending programs, not fewer spending.\n  We can't even get amendments up on this legislation. The majority \nleader has filled the tree. He will not allow us even to vote on \nalternative proposals. We cannot have an honest debate in this Chamber \nover how to legitimately and responsibly meet the needs of veterans or \nany other group, it appears. So really, in effect, the majority leader \nand his caucus will not allow votes on proposals. He will not allow our \nveterans to have a vote really. As long as that is the case, you have \ngot no right to proceed with this legislation, in my opinion.\n  So to those who come to the floor and attack Republicans, saying we \ndo not care about veterans, I will issue this challenge: Tell your \nleader--because he cannot function without your support--tell your \nleader to let us offer some amendments. Let us offer some offsets that \nwould help pay for this. Tell your leader to let this Chamber work its \nwill in the Constitutional and historic way.\n  If you do not, it is clear that your goal is to create a misleading \nheadline and not do what is right for veterans. One more thing, because \nCongress has refused to live within its means, interest on our debt is \nsurging, unbelievably so. It will crowd out this kind of spending, \ndefense spending, education spending, highway spending, throughout our \nwhole government.\n  Let me draw your attention to this chart. This is what Director \nElmendorf told us 2 weeks ago--last week--in his testimony before the \nBudget Committee on the budget of the United States of America. He told \nus that the interest we pay this date, this past year, was $230 \nbillion.\n  The savings from reducing veterans' retirement over 10 years was $6 \nbillion. The Federal highway bill for 1 year is approximately $40 \nbillion. The amount of money we spend on education is around $100 \nbillion. That is all of those programs that we spend it on. The amount \nof money we spend on the Defense Department is about $500 billion.\n  So last year, we spent $230 billion on interest. When we borrow \nmoney, we go into debt. We borrow the money. People loan us the money. \nWe give them Treasury bills, with interest. Look at this chart. This \nyear, 2013, it is $230 billion. Look at the increase Director Elmendorf \ntold us we can expect over the next 10 years. In 2024, 10 years from \nnow, colleagues, interest on the debt will be $870 billion in 1 year.\n  How many good projects are going to have their programs cut to just \npay the interest on the debt? It is the fastest growing item in the \nUnited States budget. What do we have? We want to do something for \nveterans a few weeks after we agree to limit spending. We come right in \nwith a bill to waive the budget limit, spend above that, borrow every \npenny of that money, and increase this interest and debt situation.\n  The Director did not count that. His calculations assume we honor the \nBudget Control Act and the Ryan-Murray spending limit. He assumes we \nare honoring what is in law. But what do we have? A motion to waive. \nSpend above that limit. This whole reckless spending is what Admiral \nMullen meant when he said: The greatest threat to America's security is \nour deficit, our debt. It is going to crowd out other spending. It \nthreatens our economic viability, our growth potential, and it actually \nplaces us at risk for some financial crisis in the years to come.\n  Our voters deserve better. Look at how they tend to maneuver this \nlegislation. It is so absurd sometimes. We should laugh about it if it \nwere not so serious. It is serious. The Sanders bill, the veterans \nbill--we are being told we must vote for it or they will accuse us of \nbeing unkind and unsupportive and unsympathetic to our veterans. That \nday is over. We are not going to be intimidated on this. We are going \nto do the right thing for veterans and America.\n  This bill would exceed the spending limit for the current fiscal year \nthat Congress and the President agreed to just 3 months ago. \nInitially--it gets worse in the outer years--it would clearly add \nanother $260 million in mandatory spending and authorize another $182 \nmillion this year, fiscal year 2014, which we are already in--$182 \nmillion. It gets worse.\n  So we agreed in 2011, August of 2011, to set certain spending limits. \nThe President signed that. Both Houses of Congress voted for it. Come \nJanuary, the President of the United States, who signed that bill, laid \nforth his budget, which would increase spending $1 trillion over the \nlimits that we agreed to in August. So less than 6 months later, he was \ncoming back before Congress completely ignoring the will, the \nestablished law, the Budget Control Act limitations on spending that he \nagreed to.\n\n  He actually bragged about it. This is no way to get our country on a \nsound financial path. It is not any way to do it. Let me point out one \nmore thing. They say that we are cutting spending, that this is \nausterity, that America is cutting its spending. Look at this chart. It \nis just a simple chart.\n  In 2007, before we had the fiscal crisis, we were spending about $2.6 \ntrillion in that year. In 2011, right before we signed this August \nBudget Control Act agreement to limit the growth of spending--only the \ngrowth. It did not limit spending. It limited growth. We were spending \nabout $3.5 trillion. The CBO baseline projects that in 2015, that is \nthe year we are working on now, trying to prepare our budget and so \nforth, we are going to spend even more than we spent then.\n  So the spending is going up. We made a few adjustments to curtail the \ngrowth in spending, which is good, but really not enough to get us on a \nsound path. The reason I assure you that we are not on a sound path, as \nthis chart shows that, is the interest we are going to be paying over \n10 years. This is last year, 2013. This is what they tell us we are \ngoing to be paying in interest in 2024. It goes up every single year. \nWe are on an unsustainable path. You can't get something for nothing. \nJulie Andrews tells us: Nothing comes from nothing. Nothing ever could. \nIt can't.\n  So I am flabbergasted really. The most disappointing thing to me is I \nknow now what we are going to see in the President's budget come next \nTuesday. Any hint at belt tightening is going to be gone. We are going \nto see proposals for massive increases in spending. Oh, not spending, \ninvestments. That is what we are going to see.\n  But we do not have the money. We do not have to damage America. We do \nnot have to destroy our country. This is what we agreed to now. It \nshows continual growth. Under the Budget Control Act, we are going to \nsee growth in spending every year. There is no reduction in spending. \nIt is going to grow every year for the next 10 years. It will not grow \nquite as fast, as if we did not have a Budget Control Act.\n  It looks like, if we continue to have efforts to waive the budget and \njust spend above that, it will be even worse than this. The growth will \nbe even greater.\n  I want to share one point, and I will wrap up. The bill also relies \non a budget gimmick. It claims that it has got some pay-for, that it is \nnot all borrowed money. It claims this pay-for. It is really a gimmick \nthat every honest observer who has commented on it has just mocked it. \nIt is the OCO gimmick. The bill proposes to reduce Overseas Contingency \nOperations programs used to combat terrorism worldwide, Iraq and \nAfghanistan, our OCO, Overseas Contingency Operations.\n  Every penny of that is borrowed. It is not in the regular budget. It \nis spent above that as emergency spending, war spending. That is how it \nhas been done. For good or ill, that is the way it is done. At least \nwhile I am troubled by the President's policies with regard to Iraq and \nAfghanistan, the costs are coming down. They are projected to come down \nevery year until we basically eliminate those costs.\n\n[[Page S1199]]\n\n  It claims that reducing the amount of money we borrow to fund the war \nand support our military is somehow now available to spend on whatever \nthe project of the day is. Today it is veterans. It will be something \nelse tomorrow. They have tried this before. It is ludicrous. It is like \nclaiming credit today for the end of Vietnam. We are not borrowing \nmoney to fight the war in Vietnam, so we can spend that money.\n  This is how a great Nation goes broke. They want to do this to the \ntune of $18 billion. That is what it is going to take to fund Senator \nSanders' bill. The problem is, the money was never going to be spent at \nthis rate. It is not a real savings. Every piece of legislation that \nthe majority has tried to move since January has exceeded the levels \nthat we reached in the December agreement: unemployment insurance, the \nfarm bill, flood insurance, and now the veterans bill. All of them \nspend above what we agreed to.\n  Colleagues, these measures represent critical needs. I know we want \nto do something about all of them, and acknowledge that people have \nsuffered and are suffering under the policies that promised to do so \nmuch good but have not.\n  The solution is not to abandon fiscal discipline. The solution is not \nto breach the agreements we reached only a few weeks ago to have some \nmodest limitation on the growth of Federal spending.\n  This approach has been widely derided as a gimmick. The Congressional \nBudget Office says this is not real money that can be spent. Of course \nit is not.\n  Mr. Elmendorf followed up with a letter to Congressman Paul Ryan. \nBudget director Mr. Elmendorf wrote:\n\n       Establishing caps on discretionary appropriations in the \n     future would not affect spending under current law and would \n     not offset changes in direct spending or revenues. Further, \n     appropriations for war-related activities have declined in \n     recent years and may decline further as military operations \n     in Afghanistan wind down. Caps on OCO appropriations that are \n     lower than baseline projections might simply reflect policy \n     decisions that have already been made and that would be \n     realized even without such funding constraints. Moreover, if \n     policymakers believed national security required \n     appropriations above the capped amounts in future years, they \n     would almost certainly provide emergency operations that \n     would not, under current law, be counted against the caps.\n\n  It points out that this is an unacceptable way to count money.\n  Experts on the Federal budget have said the same. Maya MacGuineas, a \ncapable observer with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, \nsaid:\n\n       Using the war gimmick to offset other costs or to count \n     toward deficit reduction would send a message to the American \n     public and our investors that we are not serious about \n     controlling the debt. In fact, it would send the message that \n     not only are we not serious, but we are going to try to trick \n     everyone that we're actually doing something productive on \n     the deficit. That's the height of irresponsibility.\n\n  Maya MacGuineas--respected on both sides of the aisle, a person \ncommitted to getting this Nation to fiscal responsibility--is from the \nCommittee for a Responsible Federal Budget. She said that last \nNovember.\n  So we are not going to go for this. We are not going to waive the \nbudget in this fashion. It is not going to pass, and it should have \nbeen known beforehand when Senator Sanders and Senator Reid sought to \npush this bill through that it was never going to pass because there \nare enough Senators in this body who have enough strength of will to \nhonor the commitment we made a few weeks ago in the Ryan-Murray \nlegislation. We are not going to use some bogus gimmick to justify \nbusting the budget. The deal is over, nada. It is not going to happen. \nAnd I will defend my commitment to veterans and seeing that they are \ntreated fairly in this country.\n  There are a lot of positive things we need to be doing in America. \nThis is certainly not one them. We need to figure out how to run this \ngovernment on the spending increases to which we have already agreed. \nIn fact, we need to reduce those increases more than we have.\n  Otherwise, we are placing at risk our economy today, job creation \ntoday, and the future of our children.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. I rise this morning to speak about two issues. The first \nwill be on the matter that is before us, the veterans legislation.\n  I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this legislation. I \ncommend the work of Chairman Sanders and others who have brought us to \nthis point. We know we have a challenge ahead of us to pass this \nlegislation.\n  The good news is that these issues are bipartisan. Both parties have \na real concern about what happens to our veterans and what happens to \nour veterans' families. We often have different pathways to get there, \nbut I do think we have a bipartisan concern.\n  Perhaps it is appropriate to start with a reflection on what I think \nour obligation is as Members of the Senate, but it is our obligation as \ncitizens as well.\n  Years ago I heard it expressed--we often express it by using the word \n``worthy.'' When we consider what our veterans have done for us, it is \nimportant that we express gratitude in so many different ways. \nSometimes that is one-on-one expressing to a veteran: We appreciate \nyour service. And when there is a parade or another demonstration of \npublic support for our veterans, that is important.\n  But the question we have to ask ourselves both as elected officials \nand as citizens is the following: Are we doing everything we can to \nprove ourselves worthy of the valor of our veterans? The answer to that \nquestion--depending on what year it is or depending on what time period \nit is, we will get different answers to that question.\n  Most of the time we like to believe that the Congress is worthy of \nthe valor of those veterans, that we are doing everything we can to \nhelp them. But we have to be honest with ourselves and say that there \nare substantial periods of time when this body and the other body--both \nthe Senate and the House--have not been worthy of the valor of our \nveterans because we haven't done enough to help veterans and their \nfamilies.\n  We hope, we pray this can be one of those moments when we prove \nourselves worthy of the valor of those veterans who served their \ncountry. They didn't ask the price; they didn't put down conditions; \nthey just served their country, and they asked us to enact legislation \nand policy that is commensurate with the sacrifice and the commitment \nthey made to their country. It is about keeping promises, and I hope we \ncan be in one of those moments right now.\n  As many across the country know, the bill improves VA health care \ncoverage. It reauthorizes important job-training programs for \nunemployed veterans and provides instate tuition assistance benefits \nfor all post-9/11 veterans through the GI bill.\n  We know that when we look at the unemployment data, some of the \nhighest percentages for any sector or category are post-9/11 veterans--\na much higher unemployment rate than the overall unemployment rate and \nan even higher unemployment rate than all of their fellow veterans.\n  In this case, for this bill, hundreds of people across Pennsylvania \nhave reached out to my office, urging that the Senate pass this bill. \nIt has the support from various veterans service organizations, \nincluding the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the American \nLegion, and the VFW, just to name a few.\n  I wish to address a couple of provisions in the bill, ones that are \nparticularly significant to Pennsylvania and some of the work we have \nbeen doing.\n  The VA health care system in Pittsburgh had a terrible tragedy not \ntoo long ago where several veterans lost their lives while in the care \nof the VA health care system. There was a Legionnaires' outbreak. \nLegionella was the problem in the water system, and that terrible \ntragedy was obviously a devastating loss for those families. Not only \nthe city of Pittsburgh but all of southwestern Pennsylvania was \naffected. We are thinking of them today when we reflect upon some of \nthe provisions in this bill.\n  Veterans and their loved ones need to feel confident and secure in \nthe care they receive at all health care facilities. The failures--and \nthere is no other way to describe them--that occurred at the VA in \nsouthwestern Pennsylvania surrounding this outbreak of Legionnaires' \ndisease is, in a\n\n[[Page S1200]]\n\nword, unacceptable. Frankly, that is not a strong enough word to \nexpress the outrage I know people felt across southwestern Pennsylvania \nand beyond, so I worked and it led to the introduction of legislation. \nPortions of what we worked on are included in this bill, and we are \nvery pleased about that.\n  Specifically, the bill requires the VA to implement local and State \nreporting requirements of infectious diseases. The bill also requires \nthat the VA develop performance measures to assess whether the veterans \nintegrated service networks and medical centers are complying with \nthese requirements. We are pleased that is part of the legislation.\n  Mr. President, I wish to highlight a part of the legislation that is \nvery important to me.\n  Fortunately, it includes the Corporal Michael J. Crescenz Act, which \nSenator Toomey and I introduced last year. The bill renames the VA \nmedical center on Woodland Avenue in Philadelphia after Corporal \nCrescenz. He was the city of Philadelphia's only Medal of Honor \nrecipient from the Vietnam war. I will give a description of why he was \nawarded the Medal of Honor for his service in Vietnam. We know it is \nthe highest honor that can be granted to any soldier.\n  In this case, for his actions in Vietnam on November 20, 1968, his \nMedal of Honor citation states that he gave his life when he ``left the \nrelative safety of his own position, seized a nearby machine gun and, \nwith complete disregard for his safety, charged 100 meters up a slope \ntoward the enemy's bunkers which he effectively silenced. . . . As a \ndirect result of his heroic actions, his company was able to maneuver \nfreely with minimal danger and to complete its mission, defeating the \nenemy.''\n  We are grateful that his family will have some measure of peace of \nmind that his sacrifice and his service are remembered.\n  I thank Chairman Sanders for including this in the bill, and I know \nSenator Toomey joins me in that note of gratitude.\n  (The further remarks of Mr. Casey are printed in the Record under \n``Morning Business.)\n  Mr. CASEY. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I come to floor today as a cosponsor \nof the legislation that is being considered now in the Senate, the \nComprehensive Veterans Health and Benefits and Military Retirement Pay \nRestoration Act of 2014.\n  The package of reforms included in this bill will help provide our \nNation's veterans, to whom we owe so much, more job opportunities, \ngreater health care access, improved educational programs, and \nincreased oversight of the disability claims backlog, which is a real \nchallenge that so many of our veterans are facing.\n  I thank the leadership of Senator Sanders, who chairs the Senate \nVeterans' Affairs Committee. This bill includes provisions that have \nbeen sponsored by both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate, which \nis why more than 20 veterans service organizations have endorsed the \nlegislation, including the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign \nWars, the Disabled American Veterans, and the Iraq and Afghanistan \nVeterans of America.\n  As the heroes of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan return home, they \ndeserve our utmost gratitude and appreciation. Many of our returning \nveterans served multiple tours of duty, sacrificing so much to protect \nthis Nation. They deserve nothing less than access to the best health \ncare, the best education, and the best opportunities for employment.\n  Medical care for injured servicemembers is at the heart of the VA's \nmission. We have a basic responsibility to care for the men and women \ninjured while protecting this country. This legislation addresses one \nof the most common requests from our veterans: expanded access to the \nVA's dental care program.\n  I was meeting with some folks recently who told me one of the biggest \nreasons our men and women serving in the military on Active Duty are \nnot able to be deployed overseas is because they do not have some of \nthe basic dental care they need. Anyone who has suffered from dental \nissues knows it can be completely debilitating. So simply put: Veterans \nshould not have to suffer because of a lack of capacity to support this \nbasic medical need.\n  The bill also contains provisions that will help expand treatment \noptions for young men and women who have sustained major injuries that \nmay prevent them from starting a family. Starting a family is one of \nthe most rewarding joys of life, and we should do everything possible \nto make sure our military men and women are able to overcome any \nreproductive challenges they may face.\n  Access to mental health care and counseling, both for our returning \nservice men and women and their families, is also critically important. \nWhen our brave heroes deal with these kinds of health issues, their \nfamilies are also affected. This legislation would expand mental health \nresources available to veterans and their family members.\n  One of the most significant reforms that is included in this \nlegislation is moving the entire Department of Veterans Affairs to an \nadvanced appropriations cycle. This means that Congress would pay the \nVA's bills 1 year in advance, making it absolutely certain there will \nbe no gaps in funding for veterans programs.\n  Several years ago Congress moved the Veterans Health Administration \nto a 1-year advanced appropriation. The intent was to provide increased \nbudget certainty and protection for the hospitals, community clinics, \nand other health care providers taking care of our wounded veterans. By \nfunding the Veterans Health Administration in advance, Congress made \nsure that budget delays would no longer affect veterans health \ncare. But the rest of the Department of Veterans Affairs, including the \nVeterans Benefits Administration, does not receive that advanced \nappropriation. That means during last year's government shutdown \nveterans were at risk of not receiving their disability payments, and \nsome personnel involved in decreasing the disability claims backlog \nwere not working. Veterans should not have to wait longer or be put at \nrisk of losing their benefits because of political disagreements here \nin Congress, and this bill will ensure that will not happen again in \nthe future.\n\n  As I have talked with New Hampshire veterans over the past year, this \nadvanced appropriations process has consistently been one of their top \nrequests. I am very glad to see it is included.\n  The bill also takes important steps to help create job opportunities \nfor veterans. It reauthorizes parts of the VOW to Hire Heroes Act, \nincluding a joint program between the VA and the Department of Labor \nwhich provides 12 months of training for high-demand occupations to \nunemployed veterans. So far, this program has provided job retraining \nbenefits to more than 50,000 eligible veterans.\n  The legislation also includes programs which help veterans train for \nnew careers and identify and apply for existing job openings. It will \naward grants for hiring veterans as first responders and would cut \nredtape for veterans seeking licenses for skills they have developed \nduring their military service.\n  We should do all we can to get our veterans in the workforce. There \nare far too many veterans, particularly post-9/11 vets, who have not \nbeen able to get jobs and are experiencing so many of the unfortunate \nconsequences of being out of the workforce.\n  This is why I have filed amendments to this bill which will create \nnew tax incentives for businesses to hire veterans, and will make it \nmore affordable and easier for veteran-owned small businesses to \nparticipate in Small Business Administration loan programs.\n  I have also filed amendments to address the backlog at the Board of \nVeterans Appeals, which is one of the really unfortunate situations we \nhave for our veterans. We have veterans in New Hampshire who have been \nwaiting up to 4 years to have their appeals heard before the board.\n  Finally, another amendment I filed to the bill is in memory of my \nfriend\n\n[[Page S1201]]\n\nCharlie Morgan. Charlie was a member of the New Hampshire National \nGuard 197th Fires Brigade. After the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, \nshe became one of the first servicemembers in the country to come \nforward and talk about the challenges of keeping her family and her \nprivate life secret while she served in the military.\n  What also prompted Charlie to come forward was, in addition to those \nchallenges, she was also dealing with breast cancer. Sadly, we lost \nCharlie last year to breast cancer. She was just 48 years old.\n  I met Charlie while she was serving as a chief warrant officer in the \nNew Hampshire National Guard, but she had actually enlisted in the Army \nin 1982. After serving on active duty, Charlie joined the Kentucky \nNational Guard in 1992, because that is where she was living then. But \nshortly after the 9/11 attacks, she joined the 197th Fires Brigade of \nthe New Hampshire National Guard.\n  I have said it before and I will say it again today: There is a very \nspecial place in this Nation's history for those who step forward to \ndefend this country and protect the very same freedoms denied to them \nout of uniform. Charlie Morgan never gave up the fight for her civil \nrights, and neither will we.\n  My amendment is cosponsored by Senators Mark Udall, Blumenthal, \nGillibrand, and the Presiding Officer, Senator Baldwin. It ensures that \nall veterans and their families--no matter where they live, no matter \ntheir sexual orientation--get the benefits they have earned by putting \ntheir lives on the line for our country.\n  My bill passed the Veterans' Affairs Committee last July by a voice \nvote. I hope, first of all, we will get an amendment process on this \nveterans bill which allows me and so many of my colleagues to offer \nrelevant amendments which I think would improve the bill we are hoping \nto consider. I hope my colleagues will support all of my amendments but \nparticularly this important Charlie Morgan amendment because our \nveterans deserve nothing less.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I rise today to talk about the Iran \nsanctions legislation, but first I want to talk about the veterans \nlegislation we are on, and why it is so important that we include the \nIran sanctions provision.\n  I believe we all want to make sure we take care of our veterans. We \nwill have on the floor two bills today which deal with our veterans, \none offered by Senator Sanders of Vermont and another offered by \nSenator Richard Burr of North Carolina.\n  I am asking the majority leader to allow an open process so we can \ncraft a good bill for our veterans. This means allowing amendments. \nThis means allowing a vote on both bills. I believe that with an open \nprocess--with an open amendment process, by allowing votes as I have \ndescribed--we can in fact build the kind of bipartisan support, the \nkind of bipartisan consensus we need to pass this legislation. There \nare provisions in the bills which I think have broad bipartisan \nsupport, which is why it is so important we have this open process.\n  One such provision which can help us build that kind of bipartisan \nsupport is the Iran sanctions provision in the legislation. It is \nsponsored by Democratic Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey and also \nRepublican Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois, and it is cosponsored by 57 \nother Senators, including myself. So we are talking about a piece of \nlegislation within the Burr bill which has 59 Senators cosponsoring the \nlegislation.\n  If this legislation is put on the floor included as part of the Burr \nbill, it is pretty much guaranteed we can pass it. It has 59 \ncosponsors. If we pick up one more vote, we pass the bill. It is good \nfor our veterans and it is also very important for our national \nsecurity.\n  Let me talk about the Iran sanction provision for a minute.\n  Right now the Obama administration is trying to negotiate an \nagreement with Iran to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, \nand while the administration is negotiating, Iran continues to develop \nits nuclear weapon. While President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry \nnegotiate with President Hassan Rouhani, Iran continues to build a \nnuclear bomb. While the administration and our Secretary of State talk \nwith our allies in Europe about the negotiations with Iran, the Supreme \nLeader and Iran continue to build a nuclear bomb.\n  The reality is the only thing which has brought Iran to the \nnegotiating table is sanctions and only continuing those sanctions will \nget them to stop building a bomb. The sanctions should be reinstated, \nand they should not be lifted until, one, Iran agrees they will not \nbuild a bomb, and we have an open, verifiable transparent process to \nmake certain they are not doing so.\n  Sanctions take time to work. The sanctions we applied more than 1 \nyear ago--particularly the Kirk-Menendez banking sanctions--have had a \nreal impact on Iran's economy. I bring a background as a banker to my \nwork experience, both as a Governor for 10 years, and my work \nexperience here in the Senate. The reality is that the Kirk-Menendez \nbanking sanctions have been extremely effective. It is a well-crafted \npiece of bipartisan legislation which passed this body overwhelmingly, \nwhich is really effective. The reason it is so effective is because it \nprevents any company, any country which wants to do business with the \nU.S. banking system--and countries and companies worldwide have to be \nable to transact with the U.S. banking system, but they are not allowed \nto transact with our banking system if they also do business with Iran.\n  If Iran can't sell its oil because it can't get paid for its oil, \nthey are in a very tough situation. Not only do they not have the \nresources or the funds to build a bomb, their administration--the \nregime--does not have the money to operate their country. So we not \nonly prevent them from building a bomb, but we put the regime itself at \nrisk if they continue to build a bomb. That is why the Kirk-Menendez \nsanctions--those banking sanctions--have been so effective. But they \nwork over time. They work over time.\n  When the sanctions are lifted, the relief is immediate, the relief is \nimmediate because now Iran can sell and get payment for their oil. They \ncan purchase what they need, not only to continue to build a bomb but \nto keep their country and keep the regime in power.\n  When we are talking about sanctions and negotiating an agreement to \nget them to stop building a bomb, it is important that we have a \nprocess that is open, transparent, and verifiable. We need to know that \nthey have stopped building the bomb and are dismantling their nuclear \nweapons enterprise.\n  It is very important to understand that sanctions work over time, but \nwhen sanctions are lifted, the relief is immediate. That is why we \ncannot lift sanctions while we negotiate the agreement. We have to get \nIran to stop first and give us a process to verify that, in fact, they \nhave stopped before we can lift those sanctions.\n  We have the opportunity in this body right here, right now, today, to \naddress that problem. It is incredibly important that we do address \nthis issue. We have 59 sponsors on the legislation. We are one short. \nIf you put it up for a vote, we will have well more than 60 votes. If \nwe impose those sanctions now, we will tell Iran: You stop, and we make \nthem stop. That is the option before us today. That is what we need to \ndo.\n  If we don't do it, what are our options? A military strike? That is \nthe last option. That is what we don't want to have to do. We don't \nwant to have to do a military strike to take out their bomb-making \ncapability. But if we don't act and reimpose those sanctions, that is \nthe option that is left.\n  Today we have a choice. I ask that we be allowed to vote on the Burr \nlegislation, that we be allowed to vote on amendments, and that we be \nallowed to vote to reimpose sanctions on Iran.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following the\n\n[[Page S1202]]\n\ndisposition of S. 1982, the veterans benefits bill, the Senate proceed \nto executive session to consider Calendar No. 561, Michael L. Connor, \nto be Deputy Secretary of the Interior, that there be 2 minutes for \ndebate equally divided in the usual form, and that all other provisions \nof the previous order remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                         Taking Responsibility\n\n  Mr. WALSH. Madam President, in Montana we have a long history of \nbeing represented by true statesmen--larger-than-life figures such as \nSenator Mike Mansfield. These men always served us well, while at the \nsame time defending Montana's principles and freedoms. These statesmen \nnever took their privileges for granted, and they always had the \ncourage to put their differences aside to do what is right for our \ncountry. At a time when privilege seems to be gaining on principle, I \npledge to find the same courage to do what is right.\n  Senator Mansfield called Butte, MT, home. Born and raised in Butte, I \nwas brought up with a great deal of respect for Senator Mike Mansfield. \nIt is a tremendous honor for me to stand today where he stood so many \nyears ago and pledge to you and the people of Montana that I will take \nresponsibility for my actions and that I will have the courage to do \nwhat is right no matter what the consequences.\n  Of course, I would not be where I am today without the love and \nsupport of my wonderful family. My wife of 29 years, Janet, who is here \ntoday, our sons Michael and Taylor, our daughter-in-law April, and our \n9-month-old granddaughter Kennedy have stood by my side through every \nchallenge life has handed us.\n  Last week, while at home, I traveled across Montana as Montana's \nnewest Senator. I had an opportunity to talk to a lot of Montanans who \nbelieve we need more courage in Washington, and I tend to agree.\n  As a public servant, I have sworn an oath to protect and defend \nMontanans, our Nation, and our Constitution.\n  I am no stranger to answering the call to serve. I spent 33 years in \nthe Montana National Guard where I served for 9 of those years as an \nenlisted man before becoming an officer.\n  I also had the honor of leading over 700 of Montana's finest young \nmen and women into combat in Iraq. It was the largest deployment of \nMontana's soldiers and airmen since World War II.\n  In August of 2008, Governor Brian Schweitzer asked me to serve as the \nadjutant general of the Montana National Guard, and I was truly honored \nby the opportunity to continue serving our State and our Nation.\n  I am also extremely proud of my oldest son Michael who is now 28 and \nis following in my path of public service. He is currently serving in \nthe National Guard and is deployed to the Middle East as a C-12 pilot \nand a Black Hawk medivac pilot.\n  Throughout my many years of service, and now with my son's service, \nensuring our veterans and their families have access to the services \nand benefits they have earned is a responsibility I take very seriously \nand very personally.\n  I recently met with student veterans at Montana State University in \nBozeman, MT, where I heard from young men and women who are concerned \nabout their mounting student debt. I also heard from veterans from all \nacross Montana about their frustrations with the long delays in \nprocessing disability benefit claims. I have heard from veterans from \nacross the State who are frustrated with the distances they have to \ntravel to receive care. These failings on behalf of our veterans and \ntheir families cause me grave concern. We must, and I will, fight for \nthem every day I am serving in the Senate.\n  The face of modern war has changed and the VA must keep up with the \nchanging times. Medical care must include robust mental health \nbenefits, and it must also include proper screenings to help mitigate \nthe effect of post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain \ninjuries. As a military commander, I also know firsthand what the \nunseen injuries have done to America's heroes and their families. We \ncan and we must do better.\n  The oath I have taken is one I take very seriously. It is an honor, \nit is a privilege, and a great responsibility that I will work \ntirelessly to fulfill.\n  To honor their service and sacrifice, we must welcome our heroes home \nand help them during their transition from active duty back into \ncivilian life. I know how difficult that transition can be. I have \nexperienced it firsthand, I have witnessed it, and I will take \nresponsibility to improve it.\n  On these and other issues facing our State and our country, I look \nforward to working with my friend and colleague Senator Jon Tester to \nsolve problems not only for our veterans but for all Montanans.\n  Last week Jon and I traveled the State. We heard from members of the \nLittle Shell Tribal Council about the importance of Federal recognition \nand ways to help Indian-owned businesses grow and create jobs. We heard \nfrom tribal nations across Montana about the Land Buy-Back Cooperative \nAgreement Program within the Department of Interior. I made a \ncommitment to Montana's tribal leaders that I would work hard to make \nsure the Federal Government is being responsive and working to move \nthis program forward in a way that works for our sovereign tribal \nnations.\n  We also had the opportunity to speak with business owners in Miles \nCity and Wolf Point, MT, who are working hard to grow jobs while at the \nsame time dealing with infrastructure challenges caused by the oil boom \nin eastern Montana. My job is to bring their voices to the Senate.\n  One additional issue I heard loudly and clearly from every corner of \nMontana is that our government is not doing enough to protect our civil \nliberties. As I have throughout my career, I will continue to fight to \nprotect our civil liberties, our freedoms, and our Montana values. We \nmust do what it takes to protect our Nation and the freedom we enjoy--\nsomething I have dedicated my life to. But we must, and we can, do it \nwithout trampling on the rights we have fought so hard for.\n  Bulk data collection with no transparency, whether by the government \nor by private corporations, is unacceptable. That is why during my \nfirst week in the Senate, I signed on to a bipartisan bill that is an \nimportant first step in this fight.\n  I have also heard loudly and clearly from Montanans that our national \ndebt is unacceptable. Washington has a spending problem that we must \nget under control. There is no better example of privileges gaining on \nour principles. Responsibly cutting our debt and wasteful spending is \none of my top priorities as a Senator, just as it was as Montana's \nlieutenant governor working alongside Governor Steve Bullock.\n  Congress needs the courage to cut spending without doing it on the \nbacks of our veterans, our children, or our seniors. Almost everyone I \ntalked to in Montana told me where they see waste in government, and \nthey all have specific examples. We need to find the courage to stand \nup to special interests and cut that wasteful spending. But we must not \ndo it on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens.\n  Having served for 33 years in the military, I am confident we can \nmake the Defense budget more efficient while at the same time enhancing \nprograms that grow our economy and protect our children and seniors.\n  We should start by reducing waste in contracting and procurement. \nToday we spend millions to have contract security guards check IDs at \nour bases rather than servicemembers, but no one is any safer. I take \nresponsibility to fix this.\n  It is a privilege to be chosen to serve on the Agriculture Committee. \nI am the only member of Montana's delegation to sit on the agriculture \ncommittee. This committee is so important to Montana where our No. 1 \nindustry is agriculture. From livestock disaster assistance to crop \ninsurance, commonsense forest reforms, I look forward to making sure \nthe farm bill works and works efficiently for Montana's farmers and \nranchers.\n  I also look forward to serving on the commerce committee where I will \nfocus on transportation, energy, rural telecommunications, and tourism. \nTourism is Montana's second largest sector. It not only contributes to \nour State's economy, but also helps preserve the outdoor heritage that \nmakes Montana such a slice of heaven.\n\n[[Page S1203]]\n\n  I will bring Montana courage to the Senate where I will fight on \nbehalf of the people of Montana to protect Social Security and Medicare \nin my new role on the aging committee. I am also prepared to help fix \nsome of Washington's problems while serving on the rules committee.\n  I know I only just joined this distinguished body, but I also know \nthere is very real work to be done to get our country on the right \ntrack again. Beginning on day one, I rolled up my sleeves and started \nworking. My purpose here is to have the courage to do what is right for \nthe people of Montana, our veterans, and the United States of America.\n  Thank you for this amazing opportunity and may God bless the United \nStates of America.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Texas Independence Day\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I rise today to commemorate a very \nspecial day in Texas history, and I would say in American history. This \nis a day that inspires pride and gratitude in my State. I rise to \ncommemorate Texas Independence Day, which is celebrated on March 2, \nthis Sunday.\n  I will read a letter that was written 178 years ago from behind the \nwalls of an old Spanish mission that is now in San Antonio, TX. It is \nknown as the Alamo. It is a letter written by 26-year-old Lieutenant \nColonel William Barret Travis. In doing so, I am carrying on a \ntradition started by the late Senator John Tower, who represented Texas \nin this body for more than two decades. This tradition was later upheld \nby his successor, Senator Phil Gramm, and thereafter by Senator Kay \nBailey Hutchison. It is a tremendous honor that this privilege has now \nfallen to me.\n\n  On February 24, 1836, with his position under siege and outnumbered \nnearly 10 to 1 by the forces of the Mexican dictator Antonio Lopez de \nSanta Anna, Travis penned the following letter:\n\n       To the People of Texas and all Americans in the World:\n       Fellow citizens and compatriots--\n       I am besieged by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under \n     Santa Anna. I have sustained a continual bombardment and \n     cannonade for 24 hours and I have not lost a man. The enemy \n     has demanded a surrender at discretion. Otherwise, the \n     garrison are to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken.\n       I have answered the demand with a cannon shot, and our flag \n     still waves proudly from the walls.\n       I shall never surrender or retreat.\n       Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism \n     and everything dear to the American character, to come to our \n     aid with all dispatch.\n       The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily and will no \n     doubt increase to three or four thousand in four or five \n     days.\n       If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain \n     myself for as long as possible and die like a soldier who \n     never forgets what is due to his own honor and that of his \n     country.\n       Victory or death.\n       Signed: William Barret Travis.\n\n  As we have since learned, in the battle that ensued, all 189 \ndefenders of the Alamo gave their lives. But they did not die in vain.\n  The Battle of the Alamo bought precious time for the Texas \nrevolutionaries, allowing General Sam Houston to maneuver his army into \nposition for a decisive victory in the battle of San Jacinto. With this \nvictory Texas became a sovereign nation and an independent republic.\n  For nine years the Republic of Texas thrived, as I said, as a \nseparate nation. Then, in 1845, it agreed to join the United States as \nthe 28th State.\n  Many of the Texas patriots who fought in the revolution went on to \nserve in the Congress. I am honored to hold the seat originally held by \nthen-General Sam Houston but later the president of the republic and \nU.S. Senator for Texas. More broadly, I am honored to have the \nopportunity to serve 26 million Americans that call Texas home because \nof the sacrifices made by these brave patriots 178 years ago.\n  May we always remember the Alamo, and may God continue to bless Texas \nand these United States.\n\n\n                             IRS Intrusion\n\n  Madam President, I will spend the rest of my time on a separate topic \nabout which many Americans are greatly concerned, and I am one of them.\n  It has been more than nine months since we first found out that the \nIRS was deliberately targeting certain political organizations for \ntheir political beliefs. At first, the Obama administration \nacknowledged that any abuse by the IRS was unacceptable. But then, in \nsubsequent days and months, it has tried to play down the scandal and \nblame it on a few rogue operators in the Cincinnati Field Office. Yet \nthe more we have learned, the more we realize the abuses involved \nsignificant coordination with the IRS headquarters here in Washington, \nDC.\n  Because of these abuses, millions of Americans now worry that the \nInternal Revenue Service and their own Federal Government have been \ncorrupted, and we have become more like a banana republic. This damage \nto the public confidence and the public trust is immeasurable, and much \nof the damage may end up being irreversible.\n  Of course, the right response when the administration and Congress \nlearned of these abuses would have been to clean house at the agency \nand give the American people ironclad assurances this would never, ever \nhappen again. Of course, the right response would have been \naccountability, firing people, and strong support for congressional \ninvestigations on a bipartisan basis and the adoption of new safeguards \nagainst potential future abuses.\n  Instead, we have seen that the investigations, most notably led in \nthe House of Representatives, have been met with whitewash, and there \nhave been active efforts to prevent Congress from actually uncovering \nthe full story. That is a shameful response, and it is dishonest. \nUnfortunately, it is about to get worse.\n  The Obama IRS is now proposing a new political speech rule that would \nforce many 501(c)(4), or grassroots organizations, to dramatically \nchange their activities or else form formal political action \ncommittees. If the groups are forced to register as political outfits, \nthey will be subject to new campaign finance rules, which, of course, \nmay be the whole point.\n  As the Wall Street Journal noted earlier this week:\n\n       The purpose of this disclosure is to set up donors as \n     political targets for boycotts and intimidation so that the \n     costs of participating in politics will be too steep.\n\n  I might note the Supreme Court of the United States addressed this \nconcern in a very important case decades ago, NAACP v. Alabama, where \nthey held that under the First Amendment to the Constitution, the NAACP \nwas not required to disclose its membership list because, at the time, \nsadly, they were worried about intimidation and targeting of their \nmembers. So the Supreme Court of the United States said that under the \nFirst Amendment of the Constitution and the freedom of association \nincluded there, the NAACP did not need to disclose its membership list \nbecause of this bona fide threat.\n  These are not contrived concerns today. Back in 2012, donors to the \nMitt Romney presidential campaign found themselves publicly attacked \nand slandered for daring to support Governor Romney and participating \nin the political process. For that matter, something even more sinister \nhappened to one Idaho businessman by the name of Frank VanderSloot. In \nApril of 2012, Mr. VanderSloot was one of 8 Romney donors who were \ncondemned by an Obama campaign Web site and called ``less than \nreputable.'' Shortly thereafter, a Democratic opposition researcher \nbegan searching for Mr. VanderSloot's divorce records. Meanwhile, the \nIRS decided to audit 2 years worth of tax filings for Mr. VanderSloot \nand the Labor Department announced a separate audit of the workers \nemployed on his cattle ranch. Coincidence? I suspect Mr. VanderSloot \nwas targeted because of his political activities. It was a deeply \ntroubling question in 2012, and it is even more troubling today, given \nall we have learned about the IRS targeting since that time.\n  I offer as my next example the experience of one of my constituents, \nCatherine Engelbrecht in Houston, TX. Ms. Engelbrecht is a Texas \nbusinesswoman\n\n[[Page S1204]]\n\nwho founded both the King Street Patriots and an organization called \nTrue the Vote. She was mainly concerned about the integrity of the \nballot and training people to participate in the process and express \nthemselves more effectively through that process. But she found herself \ntargeted by multiple Federal agencies, including the IRS, the FBI, the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and OSHA, none of which had \never contacted her family's businesses before her involvement in \ngrassroots activism. As Ms. Engelbrecht recently told a House committee \ninvestigating:\n\n       We had never been audited, we had never been investigated, \n     but all that changed upon submitting applications for the \n     nonprofit statuses of True the Vote and King Street Patriots. \n     Since that filing in 2010, my private businesses, my \n     nonprofit organizations, and family have been subjected to \n     more than 15 instances of audit or inquiry by federal \n     agencies.\n\n  Make no mistake. The proposed IRS rule would make it even harder for \npeople such as Ms. Engelbrecht to participate in the political \nprocess--something that is her constitutional right--and it would \nstrongly discourage other similarly interested and concerned citizens \nfrom exercising their rights. In other words, it would strike at the \nvery heart of self government, and at the very heart of the American \ndemocracy.\n  The IRS was meant to be a tax collection agency, period--not to be \nthe police of political speech and political activity. But now we know, \nafter the Affordable Care Act was passed--now more commonly called \nObamaCare--we now know the IRS is in charge of enforcing ObamaCare by \ncollecting the penalties for people who don't buy government-approved \nhealth insurance. But, still, that is apparently not enough of a job \nfor the IRS, even though the work they are already doing they are not \ndoing very well. With this now 501(c)(4) rule, the IRS would \neffectively become a campaign finance regulator.\n  As the advocates for this rule are aware, we already have an agency \nresponsible for enforcing campaign finance rules. It is called, \nstrangely enough, the Federal Election Commission, and it is a strictly \nbipartisan institution, as it should be. If the President and my \nfriends across the aisle want to change campaign finance laws, they \nshould either draft legislation or make their case to the Federal \nagency that has the jurisdiction to deal with them: The election \ncommissioners at the Federal Election Commission. But turning the IRS \ninto a de facto arm of the FEC is just more political overreach, and it \nis going to be ripe for abuse. Indeed, not only would the proposed \n501(c)(4) rule further distract the IRS from its core mission, it would \ntrample the First Amendment, intimidate people from exercising their \nrights of free speech, and it would weaken our participatory democracy.\n  I also note the rule would not cover the political activities of some \nother tax-exempt organizations. I am sure this was just an oversight. \nLabor unions are exempted. So why, if the Treasury is proposing this \nrule--why, if this is going to be given to the IRS--would we carve out \nsome of the largest donors and participants in the political process in \nAmerica today, which is organized labor? Not for reasons of fairness, I \nsuppose but, rather, because the proponents of this rule basically want \nto tilt the scale in their favor, once again, and they want to suppress \nthe speech and the political activity of people they disagree with--\nwhich is un-American.\n  Not surprisingly, the IRS has received tens of thousands of comments \non the rule, and most of these comments have been critical. This \nmorning in the Senate Judiciary Committee, my colleague Senator Cruz \nread a comment from the American Civil Liberties Union that was \ncritical of this rule. I don't agree with a lot of the policies of the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, but they are absolutely right in this \ninstance. Given the tremendous importance of this issue, including the \npotential consequences and damage to First Amendment rights, we need to \nmake sure this rule is not implemented as proposed. I urge all of my \nconstituents in Texas and all Americans and everyone within the sound \nof my voice to continue making their voices heard and to continue to \nurge President Obama and the IRS commissioner to stop this dangerous \nIRS power grab.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I come to the floor today in support \nof S. 1982, the Comprehensive Veterans Health and Benefits and Military \nRetirement Pay Restoration Act of 2014.\n  I believe we must keep the promises we have made to our veterans. We \ncan do this by giving them the same quality of service they gave us, \nand by providing them with the care they deserve. That is why I support \nthis bipartisan bill.\n  The bill contains a number of provisions that will improve the lives \nof the men and women in uniform and our veterans by:\n\n       Restoring the full cost-of-living adjustment for all \n     military retirees;\n       Reforming the system for processing veteran's disability \n     claims to reduce the existing backlog;\n       Providing in-State tuition assistance for post 9/11 \n     veterans pursuing a college degree;\n       Expanding programs designed to help veterans find a job;\n       Requiring new services for survivors of sexual assault: and\n       Improving health care services related to mental health, \n     traumatic brain injury and other conditions.\n\n  In addition to supporting this bill, as the Chairwoman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, I have put money in the Federal checkbook to \nimprove the veteran's health care system so that wounded and disabled \nwarriors get the care and benefits they need. I have worked to ensure \nveterans suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, PTSD, or a \nTraumatic Brain Injury, TBI, receive better diagnosis and treatment \nthrough the Defense Department and the VA.\n  I have also led the charge to reduce the backlog in processing \nveteran's disability claims. I brought Secretary Shinseki to Baltimore \nto create a sense of urgency to end the backlog by 2015. I used my \npower as Chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee to convene a \nhearing with the top brass in the military and members of the Committee \nto identify challenges and get moving on solutions. I cut across \nagencies to break down smokestacks and developed a 10-point Checklist \nfor Change enacted as part of the FY2014 Omnibus Appropriations bill. \nThis plan includes better funding, better technology, better training \nand better oversight of the VA.\n  We made a sacred commitment to honor those who served by giving them \nthe benefits they've earned. This legislation is a significant step in \nthe right direction, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the Veterans Benefits Act, S. 1982, \npurports to place caps on future years' expenditures for Overseas \nContingency Operations, ``OCO'', ostensibly to pay-for the added \nexpenditures authorized by the bill.\n  OCO is an emergency expenditure. Therefore, it does not count against \nthe statutory budget caps. How much OCO, if any, will be needed in any \ngiven year is a determination made year by year in an appropriations \nbill and can only be made in that year, when we know what national \nsecurity contingencies our military will actually face.\n  If OCO caps could be used to pay for this bill, there would not be a \nneed to waive the budget points of order against the bill. So, my vote \nto waive budget points of order is not a vote to use OCO caps as an \noffset, because they cannot be so used. Instead, my vote is a vote in \nfavor of the worthwhile expenditures for veterans' benefits that S. \n1982 authorizes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Veterans \nAffairs' Committee, I want to thank many people for helping me bring \nforth the legislation we are going to be voting on this afternoon.\n  I thank those people who have come down to the floor to speak on \nbehalf of our veterans. That includes Majority Leader Reid, who has \nbeen so helpful throughout, Senators Murray, Blumenthal, Heinrich, \nPryor, Durbin, Merkley, Walsh, Shaheen, and Casey. I suspect I have \nleft out some Members.\n  I thank my entire staff at the Veterans Affairs' Committee--Steve \nRobertson, Dahlia Melendrez, Travis Murphy, Kathryn Monet, Kathryn Van \nHaste, Elizabeth Austin, Carlos Fuentes, Ann Vallandingham, Rebecca\n\n[[Page S1205]]\n\nThoman, Jason Dean, Shannon Jackson, Shanna Lawrie, and Rafael \nAnderson--for their help on this effort.\n  I thank the 28 cosponsors of this important legislation. I will not \nread their names. They know who they are, and I thank them very, very \nmuch.\n  As I indicated earlier, this legislation is not Bernie Sanders' \nlegislation. This is legislation that, by and large, comes from the \nhearts and souls of the veterans of this country.\n  As chairman of the committee, I thought it was my obligation to \nlisten to what the veterans of our country were saying about their \nproblems and their needs and how we might go forward, and that is what \nI and others on the committee did. We listened. That is the reason why \nthis legislation is being supported by virtually every veterans \norganization in the United States of America, representing millions and \nmillions of veterans. I thank them for their support--and not only for \ntheir support but for their help in crafting this legislation: the \nAmerican Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, \nJewish War Veterans, Vietnam Veterans of America, Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, Wounded Warrior \nProject, Gold Star Wives, Student Veterans of America, Air Force \nSergeants Association, American Ex-Prisoners of War, Association of the \nUnited States Navy, Commissioned Officers Association of the U.S. \nPublic Health Service, National Guard Association of the United States, \nEnlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States, Fleet \nReserve Association, Marine Corps League, Marine Corps Reserve \nAssociation, Military Officers of America Association, Military Order \nof the Purple Heart, National Association of Uniformed Services, Non \nCommissioned Officers Association, Retired Enlisted Association, \nAmerican Military Retirees Association, National Coalition for Homeless \nVeterans, National Association of State Veterans Homes, and many other \nveterans organizations. Thank you very much for your support for this \nlegislation.\n  It is no secret that Congress today is extremely partisan and to a \nsignificant degree dysfunctional. That is why the approval rating of \nCongress is somewhere around 15 percent. There are problems facing the \nAmerican people, and we cannot address those problems. The American \npeople are profoundly disgusted with what we do and, in fact, with what \nwe do not do.\n  I had hoped from the bottom of my heart that at least on this issue--\nthe need to protect and defend the veterans of this country and their \nfamilies, others who have given so much to us--we could rise above the \nday-to-day rancor and the party politics we see here on this floor \nalmost every single day.\n  We will, in fact, see within a short while whether we will rise to \nthe occasion, whether we will, in fact, stand with the veterans of this \ncountry, or whether once again we are going to succumb to the same-old, \nsame-old politics that we see almost every day.\n  Let me very briefly touch upon some of the objections my Republican \ncolleagues have made to this bill. Some of them--not a whole lot, by \nthe way, but some have come to the floor and they have objected to this \nbill. So let me respond to some of their concerns.\n  Some of my Republican colleagues have said they cannot vote for this \nbill because they could not get the opportunity to offer an amendment \non the Iran sanctions situation.\n  Mr. President, you know what. The issue of Iran sanctions is an \nimportant issue, but it has nothing to do with the needs of veterans. \nIn case people do not understand it, this is a comprehensive veterans \nbill, and while Iran sanctions may be important, they have nothing to \ndo with what we are discussing today. That is not just my opinion. Far \nmore importantly, we have the opinion of the largest veterans \norganization in this country, which represents over 2 million veterans, \nand that is the American Legion. Here is what Daniel M. Dellinger, the \nnational commander of the American Legion, said just yesterday on this \nissue:\n\n       Iran is a serious issue that Congress needs to address, but \n     it cannot be tied to S. 1982--\n\n  This veterans legislation--\n\n     which is extremely important as our nation prepares to \n     welcome millions of U.S. military servicemen and women home \n     from war. This comprehensive bill aims to help veterans find \n     good jobs, get the health care they need and make in-state \n     tuition rates applicable to all who are using their GI Bill \n     benefits. This legislation is about supporting veterans, pure \n     and simple. The Senate can debate various aspects of it, and \n     that's understandable, but it cannot lose focus on the matter \n     at hand: helping military personnel make the transition to \n     veteran life and ensuring that those who served their nation \n     in uniform receive the benefits they earned and deserve. We \n     can deal with Iran--or any other issue unrelated specifically \n     to veterans--with separate legislation.\n\n  That is Mr. Dellinger, the national commander of the largest veterans \norganization in this country. I thank him very much because he is \nexactly right, and he reflects what the overwhelming majority of the \nAmerican people believe: Deal with the issue at hand.\n  But it is not just the American Legion I want to thank. The Iraq and \nAfghanistan Veterans of America tweeted the other day:\n\n       The Senate should not get distracted while debating & \n     voting on the vets bill. Iran sanctions, Obamacare, etc. \n     aren't relevant to S. 1982.\n\n  They are absolutely right. Let's talk about veterans' needs.\n  Now, some other Republican colleagues, in objecting to this bill, \nhave said they cannot vote for it because it is not bipartisan enough \nand it has not been fully marked up in committee.\n\n  Well, that is not quite true. Almost all of the provisions in this \nbill did come out of the committee. In fact, two of the major \ncomponents of this bill--two separate omnibus bills--were passed by a \nunanimous vote. You cannot get much more bipartisan than when you have \ntwo major provisions in a bill passing with all Republicans and \nDemocrats voting for it. That is pretty bipartisan where I come from.\n  Furthermore, this legislation contains a number of provisions \nauthored and supported by Republican members of the Veterans Affairs' \nCommittee. In fact, to the best of my knowledge, there are 26 separate \nprovisions that Republican members have authored or cosponsored.\n  This legislation also includes two key provisions that were passed in \na bipartisan way by the Republican House of Representatives. With \nalmost unanimous votes, the House passed a provision that we have in \nthis legislation that would authorize the VA to enter into 27 major \nmedical facility leases in 18 States and Puerto Rico. In other words, \nthis was a new provision that I did add to this bill, was not discussed \nin committee but, in fact, has overwhelming bipartisan support. The \nsecond provision we added to the bill not discussed in committee also \npassed the House with broad support, and that deals with the very \nimportant issue of ensuring that veterans can take full advantage of \nthe post-9/11 GI bill and get instate tuition in the State in which \nthey currently live.\n  So to as great a degree as possible I have tried to make this bill a \nbipartisan bill. That is where we are.\n  Now, other Republicans have come to the floor and they have objected \nto this bill because they argue that by expanding VA health care to \nveterans currently not eligible for it--veterans who in some cases are \ntrying to get by on $28,000, $30,000 a year in this tough economy; and \nit is true, we do expand VA health care to those veterans who do not \nhave a whole lot of money--the Republicans who object say, well, that \nwould open the floodgates for millions or tens of millions--I think \nsomebody said 22 million veterans--every veteran in America would be \neligible for VA health care, that the health care system would be \nswamped and health care, especially for those most in need, would \ndeteriorate because so many people came into the system.\n  As I mentioned yesterday, this is absolutely untrue. No new veteran \nwould be added into VA health care until the VA had the infrastructure \nto accommodate those new veterans. So we are not opening the door for \nmillions of new veterans--not true--and, as currently is the case, \nthose with service-connected disabilities would continue to get the \nhighest priority service, as they currently do and which, in my view, \nshould always be the case. Those who were injured in war are the top \npriority, and those folks must always be the top priority, and that is \ncertainly the case in this legislation.\n  Then last but not least there is the objection that we are going to \nbe dealing with in about 45 minutes--the vote\n\n[[Page S1206]]\n\nwe will be having--and that is that some of my colleagues basically \nsay: Senator Sanders, this bill is just too expensive and we just \ncannot afford to pass it. This bill costs $21 billion--that is a lot of \nmoney, I do not deny it--and that is just too much money, and we cannot \nafford to pass this bill, which helps millions of veterans.\n  I want to respond to that point in two ways. First, I want to address \nit from an inside-the-beltway, more technical perspective, and then I \nwant to talk to the American people about the cost of war and what we \ncan afford and what we cannot afford.\n  In terms of the funding of this bill, the Congressional Budget \nOffice--the nonpartisan scorekeeper--has estimated that mandatory \nspending in this bill will total $2.88 billion over the next 10 years--\n$2.88 billion. All of this mandatory spending is completely offset. Let \nme repeat that. All of this mandatory spending is completely offset, \nnot by OCO funds, but through more than $4.2 billion in actual savings \nfrom the programs within the jurisdiction of the Senate Veterans' \nAffairs Committee. As a result, CBO has determined that overall \nmandatory spending in this bill will be reduced--will be reduced--by \nmore than $1.3 billion.\n  That is what the CBO said. In addition, this bill authorizes $18.3 \nbillion in discretionary spending. We have 4.2 in mandatory, more than \noffset, and then we have 18.3 billion in discretionary spending over \nthe next 5 years.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, there is no rule in the Senate that \nan authorization of funding has to be offset. That is what the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs is. We are an authorizing committee. We \nare not an appropriations committee. In essence, the discretionary \nspending provisions in this legislation are just recommendations on how \nmuch additional funding we believe is needed for our Nation's veterans. \nIt will be up to future legislation in the Appropriations Committee, as \nis always the case, to approve or disapprove of these recommendations.\n  In other words, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, an authorizing \ncommittee, has made a recommendation. The final word, as is always the \ncase when we spend money, rests with the Appropriations Committee. The \ndiscretionary spending authorized under this bill is, in fact, paid for \nby using savings from winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, \notherwise known as the OCO fund.\n  Again, these are recommendations. The Appropriations Committee has \nthe final word. CBO estimates that spending for Overseas Contingency \nOperations will total a little over $1 trillion over the next decade. \nSpending as a result of this legislation to improve the lives of \nmillions of our veterans will be less than 2 percent of that $1 \ntrillion. So anybody who comes down to the floor and says this bill is \ngoing to take away from the needs of our men and women in Afghanistan \nor elsewhere is simply inaccurate.\n  One trillion dollars is what is in the fund for the next 10 years. We \nspend less than $20 billion of that fund. Some people say, well, yes, \nthat is fine. But OCO funding has to go into ammunition, it has to go \ninto planes, it has to go into tanks. That is where it goes.\n  That is not quite the case. Let me give you an example of how we have \nspent past overseas contingency operation funds.\n  Since 2005, the Defense Department has used OCO funding for childcare \ncenters, for hospitals, for traumatic brain injury research, for \nequipment, and schools. In 2010, $50 million of OCO funds were used for \nthe Guam Improvement Enterprise Fund. To my mind, if we can use money \nfor the Guam Improvement Enterprise Fund--I do not know much about \nthat--I do believe we should be able to use some of the OCO funds to \nprotect the needs of men and women who made enormous sacrifices \ndefending our country.\n  Last year OCO funds were allocated to a number of countries around \nthe world: Egypt, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Lebanon, Somalia, South \nSudan, and many other countries.\n  This year $28 million in OCO funding is being used for the TRICARE \nhealth care program. In other words, we are using a tiny percentage, \nless than 2 percent of the funds in the OCO fund, to protect veterans. \nWe have seen over the years OCO funding used in a whole lot of other \nareas.\n  I happen to believe that what we are trying to do with OCO funds \nfalls well within the definition of what that fund is supposed to be \nused for. If we are supposed to be using that fund for military \npurposes, then we take care of the military personnel who served our \ncountry--totally legitimate, totally consistent.\n  That is kind of the technical, inside-the-beltway explanation for why \nI think the funding mechanism we have chosen and the approach we have \ntaken is legitimate. But let me get actually to the far more important \nreason as to why this bill should be passed and it should be paid for; \nthat is, very simply, this bill in a small way attempts to pay back and \nhelp veterans and their families for the enormous sacrifices they have \nmade for this country, sacrifices which in the deepest sense can never, \never be fully paid back.\n  This is what this bill does. This bill helps Members of Congress, on \nMemorial Day or Veterans Day, when they go out and they meet with \nveterans and their families, that if a Member of Congress, Member of \nthe Senate bumps into a young veteran who is in a wheelchair, who \nbecause of a war-related injury is unable to have a baby and start a \nfamily that he or she wanted, some of those injuries, maybe the spinal \ncord, some of them may have taken place in the genital region, but for \nwhatever reason--we have over 2,000 veterans in this country today who \nare unable to naturally have babies. Many of them want families. If a \nMember of the Senate wants to look that veteran in the eyes and say to \nhim or her that they think we cannot afford to help that individual who \nsacrificed so much for this country have a family, well go do that. \nTell that individual that you think we cannot afford to help him or \nher, but when you do that, I hope you will also tell him why you voted \nto give $1 trillion in tax breaks to the top 2 percent at a time when \nthe wealthiest people in this country are doing phenomenally well. \nVirtually all of my Republican colleagues thought it was appropriate to \nprovide huge tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires.\n  So when you speak to that young veteran who can no longer have a \nchild and you are going to explain why we cannot afford to help that \nfamily, tell them it was OK to vote for tax breaks for the Koch \nbrothers or the Walton family, but we do not have enough money to help \nthem start a family.\n  If you as a Senator see a 70-year-old woman or 75-year-old woman \npushing a wheelchair for a veteran who lost his legs in Vietnam, tell \nthat woman, have the courage, have the honesty to tell that woman we \ncannot extend the caregiver benefits to her that we have, quite \nappropriately, for the post-9/11 veterans. Tell that woman who may be \ntaking care of that disabled vet 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, who \nlives under enormous stress, that we do not have the resources to help \nher with a modest stipend; we do not have the resources as the U.S. \nGovernment to maybe have a nurse come in once a week to relieve her. We \ndo not have the resources to give her some technical help for herself, \nfor her husband. Explain to her that we cannot afford to do that.\n  But then in the same breath, if you please, explain how you can \nsupport a situation where one out of four corporations in this country \ndoes not pay a nickel in Federal income taxes. It is OK for General \nElectric, some of the largest corporations in the world in a given \nyear, not to pay a penny in Federal income tax, but we somehow do not \nhave the money to give a little bit of help to a 70-, 75-year-old wife \nwho is working 24/7 to give support to their loved ones.\n\n  I say to my follow Senators: If you happen to meet a veteran who is \ntrying to get by on $28,000, $30,000, $35,000 a year, and you notice \nthat the teeth in his mouth are rotting, if you notice that person may \nnot have health insurance, one of the million veterans in this country \nwho have no health insurance, I want you to go up to that veteran and \nhave the courage, the honesty, to tell them that you believe the United \nStates of America does not have the money to take care of his needs, to \nget him VA health care, to help him fix his teeth.\n  But explain to him why you may have voted for more than $100 billion \nin tax breaks for the wealthiest three-tenths of 1 percent because you \nthink we should repeal the estate tax that only applies to the \nwealthiest three-\n\n[[Page S1207]]\n\ntenths of 1 percent, the wealthiest of the wealthy. You are prepared to \nvote, and virtually all Republicans are, to give millionaire and \nbillionaire families, the wealthiest of the wealthy, the top three-\ntenths of 1 percent, $100 billion in tax breaks, but we are not \nprepared, we supposedly do not have the money to get VA health care for \nsomeone making $28,000, $30,000 or dental care for someone whose teeth \nare rotting in his mouth.\n  You go explain that. Have the honesty, the courage, guys, to say: \nYes, tax breaks for billionaires, but we do not have the resources to \nget you into VA health care. I want you to explain to a young woman who \nleft the military, maybe broken in spirit because she was raped or \nsexually assaulted while in the military, tell her America does not \nhave the resources to get her, through the VA, the proper care she \nneeds to get her life back together after her sexual assault. Tell her \nthat.\n  If you happen to meet a young man who was eligible for the post-9/11 \nGI bill, who today cannot afford to go to college where he lives \nbecause he is not eligible for in-state tuition and there is a gap \nbetween what the GI education bill pays and what is required in the \nState he is living in of $10,000, he cannot afford it, cannot go to \ncollege, explain to him that we do not have the money to help him.\n  If you bump into an old veteran--we have heard some discussion in the \nlast couple of days that the VA lacks adequate health care facilities, \nwe do not have enough around the country. This legislation that we are \nvoting on right now, that in fact was already passed in the House, \nprovides for the VA to enter into leases for 27 medical facilities all \nacross this country in 18 different States.\n  Tell him, tell that 70-year-old veteran or the 80-year-old veteran \nwho wants access to primary health care near where he lives that we do \nnot have the resources to provide that primary care, but we can spend \nbillions of dollars rebuilding the infrastructure in Afghanistan, where \nmost of that money is stolen by a corrupt leadership.\n  Maybe, colleagues, one of you will see a young veteran, one of \nhundreds of thousands of veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan who are \ndealing with PTSD or traumatic brain injury or maybe it is a young man \nwho has come back who just cannot find a job in this very tough \neconomy. Go up to him and say: Yes, tax breaks for the rich are great; \ncorporations not paying taxes, that is OK, but I do not believe we \nshould be providing help to you.\n  The bottom line is what we believe in. It is not just speeches we \ngive on Memorial Day and on Veterans Day. I know my colleagues give \ngreat speeches.\n  The question is, and the more important issue is, not your fine \nrhetoric, but are you prepared to vote for programs that help human \nbeings in need. Speeches are great, but action is better and far more \nimportant.\n  This is about who we are as a people. It is about what our priorities \nare. In my view, at the very top of our priority list has to be to \nprotect and defend those people who protect and defend us, those people \nwho have given much more than we can ever repay.\n  There are gold star wives who want to go to college, and we allow \nthat in this bill. They lost their husbands. They are trying to take \ncare of their kids. They want a new shot at life. They need a college \neducation. We say they should have that. I don't think that is asking \ntoo much.\n  Enough of the rhetoric, enough of the speeches, enough about how \neverybody loves the veterans. Now is the time for action. I implore all \nof my colleagues to overcome this vote, to give us the votes that we \nneed to go forward to protect those who have protected us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent for Senator McCain, Senator \nAyotte, and me to engage in a colloquy for approximately 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. My colleagues will be here in a moment. I will start. \nThank you for recognizing me.\n  Senator McCain has arrived.\n  The time has come, colleagues, for us as a body to provide some \noversight that is missing when it comes to the death of four Americans \nat the Benghazi consulate on September 11, 2012. I will try not to get \nemotional.\n  The bottom line is all of us very much appreciate those who serve in \nharm's way in the State Department and in the military. When bad things \nhappen that can cost someone their life, that is sometimes the \nconsequence of service.\n  But when the system breaks down, it is utter and complete failure, \nnothing responsible happens to those who allow the failure, and when we \nreally don't know the truth about how the system has failed, then they \nhave died in a fashion that is unacceptable.\n  I am urging my colleague, the Democratic leader, to form a joint \nselect committee of the relevant committees, the Armed Services \nCommittee, the intelligence committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, \nand any other committee that is relevant, to get to the bottom of what \nhappened in Benghazi.\n  I have come to conclude that this issue is not going away. It will \nnot die out because four Americans lost their lives.\n  We have compiled an event timeline that I think does the following. \nThe story told by Susan Rice and the President himself shortly after \nthe attack on September 16, and for a couple of weeks later, has \nabsolutely collapsed. It is not credible. It is a fabrication. It was a \nmanipulation of the intel 7 weeks before an election, and I think it is \nabundantly clear that the information coming from Libya never suggested \nthere was a protest and identified this as a terrorist attack from the \nvery beginning. On September 16, 5 days after the attack U.N. \nambassador Susan Rice assured the Nation that the consulate was \nsubstantially, significantly, and strongly secured.\n  There is absolutely nothing in the talking points about that. Clearly \nthat was not the case. Why did she say that?\n  Her story about a protest caused by a hateful video being the most \nlikely cause of the attack is not based on any facts or any reporting \nfrom Libya. We will walk through the timeline, but the head of the CIA \nin Libya on September 15 sent a message, an email, a cable, to the No. \n2, Mike Morell, in the CIA in Washington, saying this was not--not--a \nprotest that escalated into an attack.\n  That story line about a protest was misleading. It was false, it was \npolitically motivated, in my view. The No. 2 at the CIA, Mike Morell--\nhis testimony before the House and the Senate is highly suspect. He \ntestified on November 14 or 15, 2012, to the Senate and House \nintelligence committees.\n  There was one episode where Mr. Clapper, the Director of National \nIntelligence said: He did not know who changed the famous talking \npoints. The talking points originally identified Al Qaeda as being \ninvolved, identified this as a terrorist attack and were completely \nchanged in the protest story line, not mentioning Al Qaeda at all.\n  Mike Morell, in May of 2013, admitted to changing the talking points. \nBut when Director Clapper said: We don't know who changed the talking \npoints. Mike Morell was sitting right by him and never said a word.\n  About 10 days later, Susan Rice asked to meet with me, Senator \nMcCain, and Senator Ayotte to explain her side of the story. This was \nNovember 24 or 25; I can't remember the date. But Mike Morell \naccompanied her, and we had a meeting in the classified portion of the \nCapitol, the secure portion of the Capitol.\n  One of the first questions I asked Mr. Morell was: Who changed the \ntalking points?\n  He said: We believe the FBI changed the talking points.\n  Senator McCain asked him: Why did the CIA not know about the contents \nof the FBI interviews of the survivors on September 15, 16, and 17? Why \ndidn't the CIA pick up a phone and call the FBI agents interviewing the \nBenghazi survivors in Germany on the September 15, 16, and 17, days \nafter the attack?\n  Mike Morell said: The FBI basically would not share that information \nbecause it was an ongoing criminal investigation.\n  My mouth dropped. When the meeting was over I ran back to my office, \ncalled the FBI, and reported to them that the No. 2, the acting \ndirector at that time, Mike Morell, has claimed\n\n[[Page S1208]]\n\nthat your agency, the FBI, changed its talking points, deleting all \nreferences to terrorism and Al Qaeda.\n  They went ballistic. They also denied that their agents ever withheld \ninformation from the CIA because it was an ongoing investigation. The \nFBI literally went ballistic on the phone. Hours later we got a call \nfrom the CIA saying the acting director misspoke: We may have changed \nthe talking points, but we don't know why.\n  In light of this, it is now time for a joint select committee to be \nformed. How can we get to the bottom of the truth of what happened in \nBenghazi if no one has ever talked to Susan Rice about why she said \nwhat she said. Now is the time to recall Mike Morell to ask him \nquestions about the validity of his testimony, the accuracy of his \ntestimony to Congress.\n  There are a lot of people who think this is no big deal, apparently, \nparticularly in the Congress on the other side. There are a lot of \nAmericans who feel as if their government has not been straightforward \nand honest with them about what happened in Benghazi.\n  The role of the Congress is to provide oversight. I will conclude \nwith this thought. When the war in Iraq was going fully, when Abu \nGhraib became a disaster, when Guantanamo Bay tactics became exposed \nand they were outside of our values, Senator McCain and I joined with \nDemocrats to get to the bottom of it. After 9/11, the Bush \nadministration originally did not want the 9/11 Commission to be \nformed.\n  Senator McCain and Senator Lieberman led the charge. We are doing no \nmore now than we did then. We just need willing partners.\n  I cannot say to any family member or anyone who served our Nation in \nharm's way that we know the truth about what happened in Benghazi at \nthis stage.\n  I can say this. We know what was told to us as a nation does not hold \nany water, and we know that people have manipulated the facts 7 weeks \nbefore an election.\n  I am still not comfortable with the fact that nobody could provide \nhelp to these people for over 9 hours. Before the attack, not one \nperson who allowed the security to deteriorate to the point of where it \nbecame a death trap in Benghazi, to the point it became a death trap--\nnot one person--has been fired. That is unacceptable.\n  With that, I will turn it over to my colleague Senator McCain and \neventually Senator Ayotte.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with the Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from New \nHampshire, who are on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. My colleague from South Carolina laid out many of the \nsalient facts according to how they transpired and didn't transpire.\n  I will go forward a bit to last Sunday where on ``Meet the Press,'' \nAmbassador Rice was asked by David Gregory:\n\n       When you were last here, Ambassador Rice, it was an \n     eventful morning on the story of Benghazi and the horrible \n     attack on our compound there. We haven't seen you in a while. \n     As you look back at your involvement in all of that, do you \n     have any regrets?\n       David, no. Because what I said to you that morning, and \n     what I did every day since, was to share the best information \n     that we had at the time.\n\n  The Senator from South Carolina has just outlined the fact that the \ninformation he had at the time was drastically different from that \nwhich was articulated that Sunday morning following the attack on our \nembassy and the death of four great Americans. So it was not the \ninformation that we had at the time.\n  Then she said:\n\n       And that information turned out, in some respects, not to \n     be 100% correct. But the notion that somehow I or anybody \n     else in the administration misled the American people is \n     patently false.\n\n  The American people were misled. They were misled because she said, \nright after the attack, on ``Face the Nation,'' that it was ``based on \nthe best information we have to date''--I quote from her statement back \nthen, a few days after the attack--but based on the best information of \nwhat their assessment is:\n\n       What happened in Benghazi was in fact initially a \n     spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired hours before \n     in Cairo, almost a copycat of the demonstrations against our \n     facility in Cairo, prompted by the video.\n\n  We know now for sure, and we knew then, before Ambassador Rice went \non that Sunday show, that it was not because as the Senator from South \nCarolina just pointed out, the station chief sent a message immediately \nfollowing saying that this was not--repeat, not--a spontaneous \ndemonstration. I will submit that for the record.\n  Somehow we have Ambassador Rice saying this was a hateful video that \nsparked this demonstration. It says: Whether there were Al Qaeda \naffiliates, whether they were Libyan-based extremists, is one of the \nthings we have to determine. But, again, she said: Sparked by this \nhateful video. There was no involvement of the hateful video.\n  I hate to quote myself, but I was on that same program, and \nimmediately after she spoke I said:\n\n       Most people don't bring rocket-propelled grenades and heavy \n     weapons to a demonstration. That was an act of terror and for \n     anyone to disagree with that fundamental fact I think is \n     really ignorant on the facts.\n\n  We know now that we now have facts that she was absolutely wrong. Of \ncourse, the question also remains what in the world was Susan Rice \ndoing speaking that morning? What was she doing there? She had nothing \nto do with it. She was the Ambassador to the United Nations. And \nSecretary Clinton was ``exhausted,'' I believe was the rationale given \nwhy she wasn't on every Sunday morning show.\n\n  So the fact is we knew at the time Susan Rice said--and this is what \nit really was all about. It was all about a Presidential campaign and \nthe narrative of bin Laden is dead, al-Qaeda is on the run, because \nthen Susan Rice, in response to Bob Schieffer, said: President Obama \nsaid, when he was running for President, that he would refocus our \nefforts and attentions on Al-Qaeda. Then she said--get this--we have \ndecimated Al-Qaeda; Osama bin Laden is gone. He also said we would end \nthe war in Iraq responsibly. We have done that.\n  Is there anybody here who thinks the war in Iraq has been ended \nresponsibly?\n  He has protected civilians in Libya, and Qadhafi is gone.\n  Obviously, we have not decimated Al-Qaeda. Al-Qaida is not on the \nrun. In fact, Al-Qaeda is increasing everywhere across the Middle East \nand North Africa. Anybody who believes when the black flags of Al-Qaeda \nare flying over the city of Fallujah, where 96 brave Americans, marines \nand soldiers died, and 600 were wounded, that things were ``ended in \nIraq responsibly,'' obviously that is not the case.\n  I think we have to understand the timing of all this. It was all part \nof a Presidential campaign. The President of the United States, in \ndebate with Mitt Romney, said: Oh, I called it an act of terror. He \ndidn't call it an act of terror. He didn't. In fact, 10 days later, at \nthe U.N., he was still talking about hateful videos that sparked \nspontaneous demonstrations. The American people were badly misled.\n  I yield for my colleague from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Perhaps the Senator from New Hampshire could walk us \nthrough some of the reasons we now know the story line of a protest \ncaused by a video doesn't hold water.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank the Senator from South Carolina and the Senator \nfrom Arizona for everything they have done on this important issue and \nto get to the truth.\n  Frankly, I will quote the Senator from Arizona from last weekend, \nwhen he was asked what Ambassador Susan Rice said on ``Meet the \nPress,'' because I agree with his sentiment: I am speechless.\n  I am speechless because when Ambassador Rice was asked on ``Meet the \nPress,'' do you have any regrets about what you said on every single \nSunday show on September 16 of 2012, she said she didn't have any \nregrets. She said: What I said to you that morning, and what I did \nevery day since, is to share the best information we had at the time. \nThe information I provided, which I explained to you, was what we had \nat the moment.\n  Actually, that is not the full picture and the information they had \nat the moment. That is why I think the word ``speechless'' applies. The \nfact she would have no regrets about misleading the American people is \ndeeply\n\n[[Page S1209]]\n\ntroubling. Because we know that immediately after he heard about the \nattacks, GEN Carter Ham, who was the commander of U.S. Africa Command \nat the time, told Secretary of Defense Panetta this was a terrorist \nattack. In fact, Secretary Panetta testified before the Armed Services \nCommittee, as did the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Chairman \nDempsey, they knew at the time it was a terrorist attack.\n  But apparently, when Ambassador Rice went on to tell the story about \nthis being the result of a hateful and heinous video and protest that \nstarted in Cairo, she missed that testimony and this incredibly \nimportant information held by key security leaders in our government.\n  We also know on September 12, 4 days before she appeared on the \nSunday shows, the day after the attacks, according to testimony given \nbefore the House Oversight and Governmental Reform Committee given last \nMay, Beth Jones, who was then the Acting Assistant Secretary of State \nfor Near East Affairs, sent an email on behalf of our government to the \nLibyan Ambassador in Washington, DC, which said the following:\n\n       The group that conducted the attacks, Ansar al-Sharia, is \n     affiliated with Islamic terrorists.\n\n  This was 4 days before Ambassador Rice went on all the Sunday shows \nand said this was in response to a hateful and offensive video.\n  That was not the case.\n  Let's go further. This wasn't the best information they had at the \ntime. This raises questions as well about the role of Mike Morell, who \nat the time was the Deputy CIA Director. I was part of the meeting with \nMike Morell and Ambassador Rice at the time, and one of the things I \nlearned in that briefing also troubled me a great deal about the \nrepresentation Ambassador Rice made on those Sunday shows, including \nher statement that she has no regrets, apparently, and the claim they \nhad the best information at the time.\n  One of the things that goes out is called the Presidential daily \nbrief. In fact, Ambassador Rice had a very important position in our \ngovernment at the time. I still wonder why she was the person who was \nsent out on every Sunday show with regard to the attacks on our \nconsulate in Benghazi, but the daily intelligence briefing at the time \nactually contained references to the potential involvement of Al-Qaeda \nin these attacks. Yet somehow, when she went on the Sunday shows, she \nfelt she could make the statement that Al-Qaeda has been decimated and \nthen blamed the attacks on our consulate on this hateful video, further \ncontradicting the information we had at the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 20 minutes has expired.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute to wrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank the Chair.\n  I will defer to my colleagues, but the bottom line is this: We are \nspeechless by what Ambassador Rice said last Sunday. We need to have \nher testimony before the Congress to get to the bottom of why these \nmisrepresentations were made. Mr. Morell needs to be brought back \nbefore the Congress, and ultimately we need a select committee.\n  I defer to my colleague from South Carolina to wrap up.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank my colleagues.\n  Now is the time for us to move forward to set the stage for a vote; \nis that correct?\n  Well, I will say, No. 1, as to the amendment of Senator Burr, it \ntakes care of veterans similar to what Senator Sanders is proposing, \nbut it pays for it in a more responsible way. Unlike the proposal of \nSenator Sanders, we have an additional element in the Burr amendment \nthat not only takes care of veterans but it deals with a national \nsecurity imperative, which is the Iran sanctions legislation. This is \nbipartisan in nature, with 59 cosponsors, including 17 Democrats. This \nwould reimpose sanctions at the end of the 6-month negotiating period \nif we do not have an acceptable outcome regarding the Iranian nuclear \nprogram; we need to dismantle the reactor, remove the uranium, and stop \nenrichment.\n  That is the goal of the Iran sanctions legislation, and I am very \npleased Senator Burr would bring that before the body. I am urging my \ncolleagues to allow us to vote on Iran sanctions. The sanctions are \nliterally crumbling.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All Republican time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. With that, I understand Senator Burr and others on our \nside have filed an amendment which would impose additional sanctions \nagainst the Government of Iran if it violates the interim agreement \nwith the United States, and I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending motion so I may offer amendment No. 2752.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Reserving the right to object, I do find it interesting \nthat, in the midst of this important debate about the needs of our \nveterans, my Republican colleagues are on the floor of the Senate and \nhave virtually nothing to say about veterans.\n  This bill is not about Benghazi. This veterans bill is not about Iran \nsanctions, it is not about Hillary Clinton. It is about protecting the \nneeds of our veterans. So the amendment of Senator Burr does not go \nanywhere near as far as we need to go in terms of veterans issues. It \nbrings the Iran sanctions issue into a debate where it should not be \nbrought.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. In addition to Burr amendment No. 2752, there are many \namendments on our side of the aisle waiting to be offered.\n  Parliamentary inquiry: Is it correct that no Senator is permitted to \noffer an amendment to this bill while the majority leader's amendments \nand motions are pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. In addition to the Burr amendment No. 2752, there are \nmany amendments on our side of the aisle waiting in the queue to be \noffered.\n  Further parliamentary inquiry: If a motion to table the Reid motion \nto commit is successful, would there be an opportunity to offer a \nmotion to commit the bill to the Veterans' Affairs Committee to be \nreported back as a fully amendable bill with the Iran sanctions bill \nincluded?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the motion to table is agreed to, there \nwould be an opportunity for Senators to offer another motion to \nrecommit with instructions to which the Senator's amendment could be \noffered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, in order to offer amendment No. 2752, the \nIran sanctions amendment, I move to table the pending Reid motion to \ncommit and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs. \nGillibrand), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson), and the Senator \nfrom Michigan (Ms. Stabenow) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this budget point of order we are now \ngoing to vote on tells us in a very significant way who we are as a \npeople. If you vote for this budget point of order, you are saying that \nin this great country we do not have the resources to help our veterans \nwith their health care, education, and to be able to deal with sexual \nassault. We need to help older veterans get the nursing care and build \nnew medical facilities that they desperately need.\n  I personally--and I have to say this honestly--have a hard time \nunderstanding how anyone can vote for tax breaks for billionaires, \nmillionaires, and large corporations and then say we don't have the \nresources to protect our veterans. We should not be supporting this \npoint of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, my only wish is that we had been on the \nSenate floor debating reforms within the system so we could fulfill and \nkeep the promises we made to our veterans who are currently in that \nsystem.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will resume legislative session.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Madam President, I would like to speak about an issue, but \nfirst I would like to yield to the minority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2011\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am here in support of what our colleague from \nArizona is going to be talking about shortly. It is basically this. We \nhave a White House that is busily at work trying to quiet the voices of \nthose who oppose them by doing the following: They are proposing a new \nregulation directed at 501(c)(4) organizations that have been active \nfor over 50 years in expressing themselves about the issues of the day \nin our country. This regulation actually predates the IRS abuses we saw \nduring the 2012 election.\n\n[[Page S1211]]\n\n  I have spoken a number of times--including a couple of major speeches \nat one of the think tanks here in town--about what a threat it is to \ncitizens when the heavy hand of the IRS comes down on them because they \nspeak up against policies of the government.\n  This regulation that Senator Flake is going to speak about here in a \nfew minutes that we would like to see delayed for a year has generated \n120,000 comments. I would say to my friend from Arizona that I am told \nthere has been no regulation in the history of the IRS that has even \napproached 120,000 comments. Is that the understanding of the Senator \nfrom Arizona?\n  Mr. FLAKE. That is. In fact, to give some kind of scale here, the \nKeystone Pipeline, which has been extremely controversial for months \nand months, has generated about 7,000 comments--7,000 comments for an \nissue such as that. This has generated north of 100,000.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think it is reasonable to assume that the reason for \nthat is there are groups out there all across America, on the right, on \nthe left, and in the center who have taken a look at this new \nregulation and understand that it is the Federal Government using the \nheavy hand of the IRS to try to shut them up, to make it impossible for \nthem to criticize the government or people like the Senator from \nArizona and myself. It is none of the business of the government to be \nquieting the voices of the American people.\n  I know our Democratic friends are upset because some conservative \ngroups have been very active. I do not recall the same sense of outrage \nover the last 50 years when groups on the left were actively involved.\n  I would say to my friend from Arizona, since these comments are \ncoming from all over, it appears, does it not, that there is a lot of \ncollateral damage here, that the administration may have wanted to \ntarget their enemies, but they are hitting some of their friends as \nwell?\n  Mr. FLAKE. That is correct. Many of the organizations that have \nsounded alarm bells here are organizations such as the ACLU, the Sierra \nClub, and others, social welfare organizations that advocate for policy \nas well, that are concerned that this goes too far.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The final thing I would say to my friend from Arizona \nis that we have a new Commissioner of the IRS. He has an opportunity, \ndoes he not, to clean up an agency that is already in a lot of trouble \nbecause of the IRS scandals, because of the new responsibilities they \nhave been given to enforce ObamaCare? This is an agency in trouble \nalready before it wades into a political thicket such as this, \nparticularly when it appears as if this whole regulation really \noriginated at the White House, not at the IRS.\n  I am reminded that the Commissioner of the IRS during the Nixon \nadministration was asked by the White House to help target President \nNixon's enemies, and the Commissioner of the IRS said: No. No.\n  I wonder if my friend from Arizona agrees with me that the \nappropriate response from the new Commissioner of the IRS--responsible \nfor cleaning up this troubled agency--to the White House ought to be, \nno, I am not going to participate in your effort to quiet the voices of \nyour political foes.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I would certainly agree. If the IRS wants to establish or \nre-establish credibility that has been lost, then the Commissioner \nshould say to the White House: I will act independently here.\n  To go forward with this rule, after what has gone on, would simply be \ngoing in the other direction and would be seen--and I think justifiably \nso--to be working hand in glove with the White House to stifle free \nspeech.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I commend the Senator from Arizona for his leadership \non this very important issue. I do not think there is anything more \nimportant to our democracy than First Amendment freedom of speech. The \nlast thing an agency whose principal responsibility is to collect \nrevenue for the Federal Government--the last thing an agency like that \nneeds to be involved in is quieting the voices of the critics of this \nadministration--or any other administration, for that matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I thank the Senator from Kentucky. I certainly echo his \ncomments. I do rise today to urge the Senate to pass legislation to \nprevent the IRS from trampling on free speech rights, particularly \nthose of 501(c)(4) organizations.\n  The Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act--it is a \nmouthful, I know--is sponsored by Senator Roberts from Kansas and \nmyself. It would prohibit for 1 year the finalization of a proposed IRS \nregulation that would specifically limit the advocacy and educational \nactivities of these groups.\n  This bill would also prevent additional targeting of 501(c)(4) \norganizations by restoring the IRS standards and definitions that were \nin place before the agency started targeting conservative groups back \nin 2010.\n  Last spring we learned that the IRS was targeting conservative groups \napplying for 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status, thanks to a report by the \nagency's inspector general. Since this discovery several IRS employees, \nincluding the Acting Commissioner, have resigned. Investigations by the \nHouse of Representatives, the Senate, and the Department of Justice are \nongoing.\n  Nevertheless, on November 29 the IRS published a proposed rule that \nwould restrict the activities of 501(c)(4) organizations, limit their \nspeech, and curtail their civic participation. This rule singles out \nthe same groups that were previously targeted by the IRS and threatens \nto limit their participation in a host of advocacy and educational \nactivities, even nonpartisan voter registration and education drives. \nThese activities have a clear role in promoting civic engagement and \nsocial welfare, which is the precise purpose for which 501(c)(4) \norganizations are structured.\n  Unfortunately, this proposed rule would suppress these organizations' \nvoices by forcing them to quit these activities or be shut down.\n  While this administration may be focused on quieting its conservative \ncritics, even liberal groups have denounced the rule and called \nattention to the detrimental impact on free speech by organizations of \nall ideologies. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, this \nrule ``will produce the same structural issues at the IRS that led to \nthe use of inappropriate criteria in the selection of various \ncharitable and social welfare groups for undue scrutiny.''\n  In response to the Obama administration's claim that these tax groups \nhave become confusing in the aftermath of a Citizens United decision, \nNan Aron of the Alliance for Justice Action Campaign has commented that \n501(c)(4) organizations ``weren't invented in the last election cycle; \nthey've been around for generations. Their purpose isn't to hide \ndonors, it's to advance policies.''\n  Even the Sierra Club has hammered the IRS rule.\n  As of this morning, I believe it is at least 94,000 comments the \nminority leader mentioned, and it may be north of 100,000 now, on the \nproposed rule have been submitted. This marks the largest number of \ncomments ever submitted to any rulemaking. Let me repeat that. This is \nthe largest number of comments ever submitted to any rulemaking.\n  As I said before, to put it in perspective, the Keystone Pipeline \nproposed rule we have heard so much about has registered just over \n7,000 comments. That is compared to somewhere near 100,000 comments \nhere. Clearly the public sees through this administration's veiled \nattempt to quash free speech and to shut down opposition to its \npriorities.\n  Yesterday the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed this \nsame legislation, identical legislation in the House, by a vote of 243-\n176. Already, this legislation in the Senate has 40 Senate cosponsors. \nIt clearly deserves the consideration and support of the full Senate.\n  However, this legislation has not been permitted to come up for \ndebate in the full Senate. Earlier today Democrats on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee voted to oppose it, stalling further consideration. \nI suppose the veto threat issued by the President may have had \nsomething to do with that. This veto threat is unfortunate. It is \nclearly a disproportionate response to legislation aimed at protecting \nfree speech rights of conservatives and liberals alike.\n\n[[Page S1212]]\n\n  This bill is simple. It only suspends new IRS rulemaking related to \n501(c)(4)s until the ongoing investigations are completed. It simply \nsuspends for 1 year. That is prudent and necessary.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of free speech rights by \nthese groups by approving this legislation to prevent the finalization \nof the IRS's rule or any other that seeks to continue to target groups \nbased on ideology.\n  Madam President, with that, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 2011, that the \nbill be read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to object, Madam Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. This bill is clearly within the jurisdiction of the Senate \nFinance Committee, because it changes the Tax Code. For many months \nbefore I became the Chair of the committee, the Finance Committee \nstaff, on a bipartisan basis, worked very hard and very comprehensively \nin a thoughtful way to address this issue, interviewing 28 IRS \nemployees and reviewing approximately 500,000 pages of documents.\n  It is my hope--and again, I have been the Chair of the committee for \nonly a little bit over 1 week--it is my hope and expectation that our \nreport will be ready for release next month or in early April.\n  The Finance Committee, as I have indicated, is the committee of \njurisdiction. It has the technical resources, the expertise, and \nexperience to best fashion the appropriate remedies. My view is these \nmatters are simply too important to be handled on the floor without the \nopportunity for the Finance Committee to address these issues, examine \nthem in hearings, and to have meaningful debate.\n  The Senator from Arizona believes that the new rules from the IRS are \nnot fair because they limit the public debate. I want to indicate to \nhim and to our colleagues that I don't take a back seat to anybody in \nterms of promoting public debate. Free speech and fair treatment for \nall Americans--all Americans--in the political process is absolutely \ncentral to what I believe government ought to be all about.\n  I have tried, with our colleague from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, to \nshow that even in these difficult, polarizing political times, the \nparties can come together. Senator Murkowski puts it very well in terms \nof what the future ought to be all about. It truly embodies our \ncampaign disclosure bill--which, I would mention, is the first \nbipartisan campaign finance bill in the Senate since the days of \nMcCain-Feingold.\n  Senator Murkowski says it best when she says that what she wants, \nwith respect to the rules for political debate in this country, is the \n``even-steven'' rule. She wants to make sure the same principles that \napply to the NRA apply to the Sierra Club, so that all Americans, in \nthe course of political debates, are treated fairly. Also, we both \nbelieve that shining a light on the dark money that pulses through the \nAmerican political system is not going to inhibit free speech. To the \ncontrary, it is going to enhance the public's right to know about who \nis behind the political ads that bombard them during the political \nseason without accountability or transparency.\n  I agree with Justice Scalia when he said:\n\n       Requiring people to stand up in public for their political \n     acts fosters civic courage, without which democracy is \n     doomed.\n\n  So there are two reasons for my objection. First, the Finance \nCommittee is the committee of jurisdiction that ought to have the \nopportunity to address these questions, and I want to assure my friend \nfrom Arizona--whom I have worked with many times on issues--that having \njust become the Chair, I intend to work very expeditiously on this \nmatter, particularly with Senator Hatch.\n  Second, I point out to my colleagues on the floor there is a \nbipartisan opportunity in the days ahead to address many of these \nissues. It is embodied very eloquently by Senator Murkowski, who says: \nIf we are going to be serious about promoting the widest possible \ndebate in this country and treating everyone fairly, we do it in accord \nwith that even-steven principle.\n  For those reasons, I object at this time to the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. If I could, I want to respond to a few of the Senator's \nitems.\n  The Senator is correct, it falls under the Finance Committee's \njurisdiction. That is part of the reason why I bring this forward. The \nFinance Committee is undergoing an investigation that is not yet \ncomplete, so I think it would be prudent to forestall the \nimplementation of new rules by the IRS while the Finance Committee \ninvestigation is ongoing. I think we all agree we shouldn't move \nforward on imprecise or incomplete information. That is why we are \nsimply saying we are not proposing a rule, we are saying simply delay \nthe new rule until investigations can be completed.\n  Also, with regard to the issue of fairness, I should note that this \napplies to 501(c)(4) organizations, nonprofit organizations. There are \nother organizations that are also nonprofit but are not included in \nthis proposed rulemaking--for example, labor unions. They offer, under \na nonprofit status as well, a 501(c)(5). They are not included here.\n  The Senator correctly says we should be concerned about fairness for \nall groups that are under this kind of nonprofit umbrella. That is \nconcerning to a lot of people as well, because those organized under \n501(c)(4) status are targeted here when those organized under (c)(5) \nstatus are not, when they have some of the same restrictions on what \nthey can do. So we would be imposing new rulemaking and new rules on \nsome organizations and not others. That is one concern and another \nreason to forestall new rulemaking until we have more complete \ninformation about what is going on at the IRS.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/27/senate-section/article/S1212-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1212-S1223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I come to the floor this afternoon to take some time to \ntalk about a law this Chamber passed in 2009. I wish to talk a little \nbit about what it means to serve in this body, what our \nresponsibilities are, and why our constituents sent us here in the \nfirst place.\n  I have served in the Senate for more than 20 years and I have seen my \nshare of controversial legislation. I have seen Democratic bills that \nRepublicans couldn't stand; I have seen Democratic bills that Democrats \nwouldn't vote for; and I have seen bills that pretty much everybody \nopposed. But what I have seen in the last 4 years since the Affordable \nCare Act was passed by Congress and signed by the President is \nsomething new altogether.\n  Since the day that law passed, I have seen some of my Republican \ncolleagues set reason, and some of their basic duties as public \nofficials, completely aside, all in opposition of a law that means \nmillions of Americans have access to affordable, quality health \ninsurance they couldn't get before. It is a law that means millions of \nyoung people, many of them fresh out of college, are able to stay on \ntheir families' insurance plans. It is a law that says it is illegal \nfor insurance companies to charge women more money just because they \nare women. It is a law that has provided millions of Americans with \naccess to free preventive screenings and health care such as \ncolonoscopies, mammograms, and flu shots. It is a law that says if you \nare an American and you have a preexisting condition, it is illegal for \nan insurance company to turn you away.\n  Since 2009, I have seen some of my colleagues simply refuse to \nacknowledge those facts about the law. I have watched them time and \ntime again not listen to or hear stories of people in their own States \nwhose lives have been changed by the Affordable Care Act and others who \nsimply need access to get the benefits that are theirs. Some of my \ncolleagues have even passed laws that make it harder to get covered \nunder the Affordable Care Act.\n  One of our responsibilities as Senators, as public servants, is to \nhelp our\n\n[[Page S1213]]\n\nconstituents access the Federal benefits that are available to them, \nparticularly when it comes to health care. That might mean, perhaps, \nputting someone in touch with a navigator to help make sure they are \ngetting the most affordable health insurance plan. It may be helping \nthem become aware of an enrollment event in their State where they can \nlearn how to get covered.\n  But our responsibilities don't end there. We also have to have an \nopen, honest discussion about what the Affordable Care Act means for \nour constituents and talk about ways to improve it.\n  Instead, what we have seen is some of our colleagues who have spent \nthe better part of 4 years try to turn this law into a bogeyman and \ntrying to score cheap political points on an issue that can literally \nmean the difference between life and death.\n  I can understand why some of our colleagues disagree with parts of \nthis law, and I have heard from some people who had challenges, \nhonestly. We have to look and say can we fix this in a way that makes \nit work better for you. But what I can't understand is why anyone \nelected to Congress would decide to simply ignore real-life stories of \ntheir own constituents whose lives were changed the day this law took \neffect.\n  I can't understand why anyone would ignore an opportunity to make \nthis law better, because that is not why we were sent here. We were \nsent here to listen to our constituents and fight to make sure our laws \nwork for them.\n  I want to give some examples from my home State of Washington about \npeople whose lives have been changed by the Affordable Care Act, people \nwhose stories have been pretty much ignored in Washington, DC. I know \nlater this afternoon several of my colleagues will be doing the same \nthing, so I hope everybody can turn off Fox News for a little while, \nnot listen to Rush Limbaugh, and listen to some real stories of real \nlive Americans who have been impacted by this law. I encourage them to \ngo home and listen to some of the men and women in their own States, \nbecause the stories I am going to share are not unique.\n  I will start with the story of Susan Wellman from Bellingham, WA. She \nis self-employed and has had to pay for individual health insurance. \nEvery year she has watched her health care costs rise higher and \nhigher. It reached the point where she was paying $300 monthly premiums \nwith an $8,000 deductible. All were what she described as ``paying for \nnothing.'' So as soon as she could, Susan got access to health care \nthrough our Washington State exchange, and she was so happy to have \nthat chance. She spoke on the phone with a real-live person, and she \nwas able to sign up for an affordable plan in just a few minutes. Now \nSusan is on a plan that costs her $125 a month instead of $300--$125 \ninstead of $300--and it is a plan that has a $2,000 deductible, not an \n$8,000 deductible, and she says it actually pays for things.\n\n  Guess what. She can now afford to go to a doctor not just in the case \nof an emergency but for a physical or a mammogram that could save her \nlife, not to mention thousands of dollars in health care costs. That \nkind of preventive care is good for Susan, and it is good for her \nfamily. It is also good for this country because when more people have \naccess to preventive care, it makes health care cheaper for every \nsingle one of us.\n  Another person I have heard from whose life was changed by the \naffordable health care act is a man named Don Davis. He is 59 years \nold, and he actually goes by ``Reverend Don.'' He is a pastor in \nSeattle, and he is also a volunteer at the Boys and Girls Club. As the \npastor of his church, he doesn't get any health care through his job. \nHe doesn't even have a salary. That meant for a long time that Reverend \nDon didn't have health insurance. So when he was hospitalized back in \n2008 for severe headaches, he was only able to receive an MRI through \ncharity care. That MRI showed that Reverend Don had several brain \ntumors, but when the doctors wanted to do more testing and provide more \ncare, he didn't have the insurance to pay for that. This is a man who \nhas asked for nothing in life, who woke up every day willing to give to \nothers, but he couldn't get the basic care he needed when he got sick.\n  Reverend Don is healthy today. He is serving his community. Because \nof the Affordable Care Act, he now also has health insurance. He signed \nup with a navigator at the local YWCA. Now, if he gets a headache, he \ncan afford to go to the doctor. So because of the Affordable Care Act, \nReverend Don can afford to dedicate his life to people in his community \nand he doesn't need to worry that the cost of the health care he needs \nmight be denied him.\n  Finally, I want to talk about a couple in Bellingham, WA, named Rod \nBurton and Sarah Hill. Rod is one of millions of Americans who have had \nthe utterly maddening experience of being denied insurance because of a \npreexisting condition. In Rod's case his preexisting condition was a \ncongenital heart defect. Under our old system Rod was deemed \nuninsurable by most insurance plans from the moment he was born. So for \na long time Rod found himself forced into purely catastrophic insurance \nwith a very high premium that wouldn't cover much of anything. That \nchanged for him with the Affordable Care Act.\n  Despite his heart defect, Rod was able to get a plan that covers him \nand his wife, and they found out they were eligible for tax credits to \nhelp pay for it. So today both Rod and Sarah are covered through a \nsilver plan with lower premiums than the plan that only covered Rod if \nthe worst happened.\n  I know we have a number of other colleagues who are here to speak, \nand I note some of them are here to tell stories from their own States, \nbut I would like to note that I only told three stories today of people \nwho are benefiting from the Affordable Care Act. These are only 3 \npeople among the 400,000 others in my home State of Washington who have \nnow signed up for care through the exchange, Washington \nHealthplanfinder, and they are only 3 people among the 4 million people \nwho have signed up across the country. For the most part, their stories \nare not unique. Millions of other Americans face the same kind of \nhealth care problems they do. It is time that we stop ignoring that \nreality. It is time that we do our job and help our constituents get \nthe health care coverage they deserve and can now get under this law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                       IRS 501(c)(4) Regulations\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I understand Senator Schumer wants to \nspeak in a little while, so I will try to hurry my remarks as quickly \nas I can.\n  I rise today to speak once again on the proposed IRS regulations \ntargeting grassroots 501(c)(4) organizations. I have already come to \nthe floor to discuss this issue, and I expect I will be here several \nmore times in the coming months as these proposed rules continue to \nmove through the regulatory pipeline at the IRS.\n  The public comment period for these proposed regulations ends today. \nAs of this morning, the IRS had received over 100,000 comments on this \nproposal, the vast majority of them negative. This is an all-time \nrecord. In fact, the number is more than five times greater than the \nprevious record for comments on a proposed IRS regulation. By contrast, \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline--another item of enormous public interest--\nreceived just over 7,000 comments.\n  With all this public attention, the obvious question is, Why? Why has \nthis proposal generated so much criticism from the American people? I \nthink the answer is quite simple: The American people see this proposal \nfor what it is--an attempt to silence this administration's critics and \nkeep them on the sidelines of the democratic process.\n  I would like to take a few minutes to describe in detail just what \nthis regulation does.\n  Under the Internal Revenue Code, a 501(c)(4) organization is a \nnonprofit organization, the exempt purpose of which is the ``promotion \nof social welfare.'' The phrase ``promotion of social welfare'' has \nlong been defined as ``promoting in some way the common good and \ngeneral welfare of the people of the community'' or ``bringing about \ncivic betterments and social improvements.''\n  Such organizations may engage in political activity for or against \ncandidates for public office so long as their primary activity falls \nunder the category of promoting social welfare.\n  Under current regulations, activities such as voter registration or \n``get out\n\n[[Page S1214]]\n\nthe vote'' drives are correctly treated as promoting social welfare, \njust like the distribution of voter guidelines outlining candidates' \npositions on issues that are, in the view of the organization, \nimportant to the public.\n  The proposed regulations would re-categorize these types of \ncandidate-neutral activities as not consistent with the exempt purpose \nof promoting social welfare. This is important because over the past \nfew days, in an effort to justify these regulations, the administration \nhas communicated to Members of Congress that they are not banning these \ntypes of activities; they are just putting them in different \ncategories. But lost in their justifications are some important \ndistinctions. It is easy to get lost in the weeds, which is probably \nwhat the administration is hoping for. So let's break this down.\n  Traditionally speaking, in order to keep their tax exemption, \n501(c)(4) organizations have had to limit their involvement in \n``political activities'' to around 49 percent or less of their overall \nactivities. In other words, they can be directly involved in the \npolitical process so long as the majority of their activities are \ndevoted to social welfare.\n  What this proposed regulation would do is redefine the parameters of \nwhat is considered political activity, moving a number of activities \nfrom the social welfare category to the political category. As I said, \nunder this regulation, simply stating where candidates for public \noffice stand on issues important to a specific 501(c)(4) organization \nwould be considered political activity. In fact, even mentioning a \ncandidate's name in a communication within a specified period before an \nelection--even if the communication does not say whether the \norganization supports or opposes the candidate--would be considered \npolitical activity. As I mentioned, the same could be said for voter \nregistration drives or ``get out the vote'' initiatives even if the \nefforts are obviously and legitimately nonpartisan.\n  Basically, this proposed regulation would instantly categorize so \nmuch run-of-the-mill behavior as partisan political activity that many \nexisting 501(c)(4) grassroots organizations would have to stop \npromoting their causes altogether. And that is precisely what the \nadministration wants. They do not want 501(c)(4)s educating the public \non the issues of the day or telling voters where candidates stand on \npolitical issues. Sure, they are fine with these groups promoting \nsocial welfare so long as that promotion does not include criticism of \nthis administration or its policies that are harmful to the general \nwelfare of their communities.\n  It would be one thing if the IRS was an agency with clean hands when \nit came to dealing with critics of this administration. But, as we have \nseen, that is simply not the case. Indeed, over the last few years we \nhave seen a record of harassment and intimidation of conservative \ngroups applying to the IRS for tax-exempt status. The agency is under \ninvestigation in three separate congressional committees for its \nactions in the run up to the 2010 and 2012 elections.\n  Put simply, the credibility and the political independence of the IRS \nare very much in question. A reasonable person would think that, rather \nthan further damaging the IRS's reputation, the administration would \ninstead focus on rebuilding it in the aftermath of the targeting \nscandal. Sadly, there don't appear to be too many reasonable people \nworking in the Obama administration, at least not when it comes to this \nset of issues.\n  We need to call this what it is: an affront to free speech and the \nright of all American citizens to participate in the democratic \nprocess. This is an attempt by the administration to marginalize its \ncritics and silence them altogether.\n  Republicans have been very vocal in our opposition to this proposed \nregulation. We have spoken out in a variety of venues. But make no \nmistake, it is not just Republicans and conservatives who oppose this \nnew rule. A number of left-leaning organizations have spoken out \nagainst it as well. The ACLU, for example, submitted a scathing comment \nletter to the IRS arguing that the proposed regulation would ``produce \nthe same structural issues at the IRS that led to the use of \ninappropriate criteria in the selection of various charitable and \nsocial welfare groups for unfair scrutiny.'' The ACLU argued further \nthat social welfare groups should be free to participate in the \npolitical process because that kind of participation ``is at the heart \nof our representative democracy. To the extent it influences voters, it \ndoes so by promoting an informed citizenry.'' We have seen similar \ncomments from groups such as the Sierra Club. Leaders of labor unions \nhave also publicly weighed in about the overly broad nature of the \nproposed regulation.\n  Put simply, when you have a proposal that is drawing unanimous \nopposition from Republicans in Congress and is being criticized by the \nACLU and Big Labor, there is a pretty decent chance it is not good \npolicy. Quite frankly, that characterization is probably too charitable \nfor this particular proposal.\n  This proposed regulation needs to be stopped in its tracks. Yesterday \nthe House of Representatives passed legislation that would do just \nthat. If enacted, the House bill would delay the implementation of the \nproposal for one year. I am an original cosponsor of the Senate \ncompanion bill to this legislation, which was introduced by Senators \nFlake and Roberts.\n  Sadly, I think I know where my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle stand on this issue, and I expect those of us here in the Senate \nwho support the right of all Americans to participate in the political \nprocess are likely to be disappointed with regard to this particular \nlegislative effort. Still, even if this legislation dies here in the \nSenate, that will not be the end of the line.\n  Earlier this month, when I came to the floor to talk about this \nissue, I called on IRS Commissioner Koskinen to use his authority to \nblock these regulations. I expect him to do so. When questioned about \nthis proposal, he has consistently deferred, usually saying he was not \nthe Commissioner when it was drafted and published. Fine. But he is the \nCommissioner now, and now that he is the Commissioner, he is in a \nposition to stop the proposed regulation from going final and acquiring \nthe force of law. This proposal cannot take effect unless Commissioner \nKoskinen personally approves and signs the final regulation clearance \npackage. That being the case, I call on him today to do the right \nthing--to not sign it when it reaches his desk. In fact, he ought to \ndecry it for what it is.\n  In an ideal world, the administration would simply withdraw this \nproposal and leave this issue alone. However, we are not living in such \na world. That being the case, if the administration continues its \neffort to push through this proposed rule, the IRS Commissioner can and \nshould use his authority to stop it from taking effect. After all, that \nis one reason Congress gives the IRS Commissioner a 5-year term. The \nCommissioner is supposed to be free from political pressure when making \ndecisions and implementing our Nation's tax laws.\n  In light of that fact, I want to implore Commissioner Koskinen to use \nthe power he has been granted to restore the IRS's credibility and make \nit clear to the American people that his agency, the IRS, will no \nlonger be used as simply another political arm of this or any future \nadministration. I hope he will do so because it is the right thing to \ndo, and I am calling on him to do it.\n\n  I have faith in Commissioner Koskinen. I believe he is an honest man. \nI don't think he has any other choice but to stop these obnoxious \nregulations which people from the left to the right consider to be \nbreaches of free speech and are wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                          Affordable Care Act\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, over the next several months the \nAffordable Care Act is going to become less important as a Republican \ncampaign issue because more and more Americans--from young adults all \nthe way through seniors--are going to realize the benefits it has to \noffer. It is happening already.\n  Every day there are more positive stories about people getting \ncheaper coverage, better coverage or coverage for the first time. Let \nme say, in my State of New York the initial rollout of ACA has been a \nbig success. We didn't have the problems of a Web site because we did \nour own, and because we have a lot of competition, as was intended on \nthe exchanges, people are getting very good offers and a large number \nof people are getting their costs reduced.\n\n[[Page S1215]]\n\n  I will tell one story. A friend of mine goes to a hairdresser in a \nconservative neighborhood in New York. The person who owns the beauty \nshop is very conservative, and when the ACA first rolled out she was \nvery upset. She said: Look. I have looked at that Web site. I am a nice \nperson. I pay for health care for my eight employees. It is going to \ncost me hundreds of dollars more for each employee. I don't even know \nif I can afford to stay in business. That person talked to all of her \nfriends, I think she blogged on her Web site, and talked all about it.\n  I spoke to my friend a few weeks ago. Guess what. This same person \nactually got health care on the New York Web site which reduced the \ncost of health care for employees by a couple of hundred dollars each. \nShe was very happy. Of course, I asked my friend to make sure she puts \nthat on her Web site and tells all of her conservative friends about \nthat.\n  But this story is going to be repeated over and over. There are going \nto be millions of seniors who realize they can get a free checkup and \nkeep their health good. There are going to be millions of young people \nwho realize they can continue their health care and stay on their \nparents' health insurance from age 21 to 26. Millions of people are \ngoing to find out that either, God forbid, someone in their family or \nsomeone in a family they know has a preexisting condition, and now they \ncan get health care. Millions of businesses are going to see the cost \nof health care is actually going up at a much smaller rate than they \nare used to. So all these good things will start mounting and the \npositives about ACA will grow in the public's mind and eventually I \nbelieve it will catch up in the Senate and the House. Then something \nelse too will happen and that is this: Lots of people who are not \naffected directly by ACA have had fear put into their souls. They \nlisten to the rightwing talk radio and they hear: Oh, they may lose all \ntheir health care or their costs will go way up. But what they are \nfinding is it is not happening.\n  I met a firefighter who works for New York City--not a volunteer \nfirefighter--a few months ago. He said: I know ObamaCare is going to \nkill me. It is going to greatly reduce the health care I am getting as \na New York City firefighter.\n  They get very good health care and they should. They are risking \ntheir lives for us. He said: It is going to happen, I hear, in the new \nyear, January 1, 2014.\n  I saw the firefighter a few weeks ago, and he said to me: Hey, I \nstill have my health care and nothing changed. Well, of course nothing \nchanged. All the horror stories which have been launched by so many on \nthe rightwing talk radio and those who just hate ObamaCare, whether it \nworks or not, are starting to fade.\n  So we are seeing two things happen at once: We are seeing the \npositives increase and the negatives decrease and we are seeing it \nparticularly with senior citizens. Because the doughnut hole is filled, \nmillions of our senior citizens are spending much less on prescription \ndrugs than they had to. It is a huge benefit to them. Since ACA was \nenacted, more than 7 million seniors and people with disabilities have \nsaved $9 billion. That is a huge amount of money. To seniors, many of \nwhom are on fixed incomes, that is dramatic savings for them.\n  Something else is happening to our seniors. They are getting free \ncheckups. That does two things. First, it saves money out of their own \npockets but, second, it reduces our health care costs because we all \nknow an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\n  Free checkups are that prevention we need. It will not only save the \nseniors but save our system billions and billions of dollars in the \nyears and decades to come. Somebody who finds a growth on their skin \nand gets it removed before it becomes cancerous, somebody who might get \na colonoscopy, a mammogram or a prostate exam and is saved from \nprostate cancer--all that is going to happen.\n  So the bottom line is very simple: People are learning the positives \nof ACA. The Web site is being improved. More people are signing up. In \nmy State of New York alone, more than 250,000 people with Medicare \nsaved $246 million on prescription drugs. The numbers are higher when \nwe count up to today because that was only the first 10 months, through \nNovember 1 of 2013. The benefits are all over the place.\n  One other thing. This is not our subject of the week, but I think we \nhave to keep mentioning it. We are reducing the budget deficit through \nthe ACA. I know our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are very \ncareful about the budget deficit. Good. They should be. Health care \ncosts are declining and declining significantly. Some is due to the \nrecession, but almost every expert says much is due to the ACA.\n  National health care expenditures, for instance, in 2012 grew by 3.7 \npercent, meaning that the growth from 2009 to 2012 was the slowest \nsince government collected this information in the 1960s. The \npercentage of health care spending for the first time actually shrunk \nfrom 17.3 to 17.2. At the same time, the solvency of Medicare's \nhospital insurance fund increased and costs declined. So this is great \nnews.\n  The bottom line: I know our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nthink they hit political goals when they attack the ACA and call for \nits repeal, but the American people don't want repeal. Secondly, as we \nmove on in time the positives of ACA will become more apparent, the \nnegatives people perceive of ACA will decline, and I believe by \nNovember this issue will not be the political gold mine our colleagues \nthink it is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Schumer for his great \nleadership on this issue and his strong words.\n  I am pleased to join with my colleagues on the floor to speak about \nthe positive impacts of the Affordable Care Act and the impact it is \nhaving on our Nation's health and particularly the health of our \nseniors.\n  We have all heard about the benefits of the Affordable Care Act in \nterms of increasing coverage: Over 4 million people have already signed \nup for the affordable private health insurance through the State and \nFederal exchanges, millions more have signed up for Medicaid coverage, \nand millions more young people are now able to stay on their parents' \ninsurance policies until they are 26--and the numbers are growing.\n  But as important as these figures are, the Affordable Care Act isn't \njust about expanding coverage for the uninsured. It is also about \nimproving the quality of care and the quality of coverage for all \nAmericans, including our seniors.\n  Seniors in this country rely on the Medicare Program--and they should \nrely on the Medicare Program--because Medicare respects a promise that \nwe made as a country to ensure that people who contribute to the \nprogram during their working years will have their health care needs \ntaken care of after the age of 65. We have a duty to keep that promise, \nand we need to build on that promise.\n  To keep the promise of Medicare, we have to make sure the program \nstays afloat. The Affordable Care Act does this by improving the \nquality of care, by coordinating care, and by better delivering under \nMedicare so we reduce waste in the program and we use Medicare dollars \nin a way that improves health outcomes for our seniors.\n  The Republicans have a very different approach to Medicare solvency. \nThey want to reduce benefits, they want to increase premiums and copays \nso it is harder for seniors to afford to go to a doctor, and they even \nwant to end Medicare's guaranteed benefits entirely by turning it into \na voucher system. Think about that: lower benefits, charge more, and \nend Medicare as we know it.\n  These approaches are wrong. They do not reflect our values, and they \nalso don't reflect good policy because cutting Medicare benefits will \nnot stop seniors from having heart attacks, it will not stop seniors \nfrom getting sick. It will just push them into emergency rooms and \nprivate insurance systems--which is more expensive and less efficient \nthan Medicare--or, worse, it will prevent them entirely from getting \nthe medical care they need.\n  Fortunately, the Republican vision is not the law of the land. The \nAffordable Care Act is the law of the land, and it is already showing \nprogress in improving the solvency of Medicare and the quality of care \nfor our seniors.\n\n[[Page S1216]]\n\n  We can already see how the accountable care organizations created \nunder the Affordable Care Act are saving money. The pioneer accountable \ncare organizations--five of which are now operating in Massachusetts--\nhave already saved Medicare nearly $147 million while continuing to \ndeliver high-quality care. New standards for hospital reimbursements \nhave reduced the number of people who need to be readmitted, meaning \nthat for seniors 130,000 fewer Medicare beneficiaries had to check back \ninto a hospital last year.\n  Thanks to these and other changes, the Medicare trust fund will be \nsolvent for nearly 10 years longer than was projected before we passed \nthe Affordable Care Act. The results are clear. When it comes to our \nseniors, the Affordable Care Act is saving money and saving lives.\n  But the Affordable Care Act does more. It builds on the promise of \nMedicare by improving prevention coverage and reducing actual out-of-\npockets for our seniors. Last year over 70 percent of seniors--25.4 \nmillion people in Medicare--visited their doctor and received a \npreventive service, such as a critical colonoscopy or a lifesaving \nmammogram. They received it for free because of the Affordable Care \nAct. Despite high drug prices, the average senior in America saved an \naverage of $1,200 on their prescription drugs in 2013 because of the \nAffordable Care Act closing the doughnut hole in Medicare Part D \nprescription drug coverage. The Affordable Care Act has made these \nchanges--reducing the cost for seniors, expanding benefits and reducing \nwasteful spending at the same time that we have improved the solvency \nof Medicare.\n\n  When I hear Republicans talk about repealing the Affordable Care Act, \nI wonder what alternative universe they are living in. In this real \nworld there should be no confusion about what repealing the Affordable \nCare Act would actually mean for our seniors: higher costs for \nprescription drugs, higher costs for preventive services, reduced \nbenefits, and a Medicare program that would go bankrupt nearly 10 years \nsooner.\n  The Affordable Care Act is working to help seniors with their \nexpenses and to keep the costs of health care down. We need to improve \nand build on the progress the law has made and not argue over tearing \nit down. This should not be about politics. This should be about \nkeeping the promise we made to our seniors. It is about building on \nthat promise, and I will continue to fight for that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleagues--Senator \nWarren, Senator Schumer, and Senator Murray--joining us on the floor \ntoday. I think we will be joined by Senator Stabenow in a few moments. \nI also appreciate that they were at an event we did yesterday in which \nwe were kicking off the Affordable Care Works Campaign. The campaign is \ndesigned to tell what has been untold for much of the last 6 months, \nwhich is the increasing good news about the millions of Americans for \nwhich the Affordable Care Act is working and, indeed for many of them, \nchanging their lives.\n  An announcement was made this week that 4 million Americans have now \nsigned up for the private health care exchanges. There are now over 10 \nmillion Americans all across the country who now have insurance today \nthat didn't have it prior to the passage of the law either because of \nthese private exchanges or increased eligibility of Medicaid or the \nlaw's provision that young men and women under the age of 26 can stay \non their parents' insurance. Over 10 million people all across the \ncountry now have access to insurance that they didn't have before we \npassed this law.\n  As Senator Schumer said, there is even more good news because we now \nknow that the second promise of the act, that it was going to reduce \nthe deficit, is true as well. CBO tells us that from the 10-year period \ncovering the enactment of the law to a decade later, we are going to \nsave about $1.2 trillion beyond what we initially estimated.\n  At current trajectories, we are going to be $250 billion under CBO's \ninitial estimate for Federal health care expenditures on an annual \nbasis. That is a big savings to the American taxpayers. When you \ncombine that with the millions of Americans who have coverage, you can \nsee how the Affordable Care Act is working.\n  There is still work to do. There will be debates on the floor of the \nSenate about ways in which we can change and fix the Affordable Care \nAct. Because we are reordering one-sixth of the American economy, there \nis no doubt there will be bumps along the road, and no doubt there will \nbe places where we can find bipartisan agreements on how we can fix the \nact to make it work even better.\n  The answer from our Republican colleagues has been pretty simple so \nfar. It has been to simply repeal the law. They say they want to repeal \nand replace it, but we have yet to see any evidence of that \nreplacement. I think when the Presiding Officer and I served together \nin the House of Representatives, we probably witnessed about 30 or 40 \ndifferent votes to repeal all or part of the Affordable Care Act, and \nnever once was there a vote to replace that act.\n  The American people don't want this bill repealed so we can go back \nto the days when the insurance companies ran our health care. They \ndon't want to go back to the days when the 10 million Americans who \nhave insurance are uninsured. They want this act to be implemented. \nThey want it to be perfected. They want us to work to make it better. \nBut they are understanding day by day that the Affordable Care Act is \nworking.\n  Specifically for seniors there are some pretty unique benefits, many \nof which have been glossed over. At the outset of the implementation of \nthis act, some pretty important things happened--sometimes while people \nweren't even looking.\n  First, the doughnut hole was cut in half almost overnight. The first \nyear anybody who was in the doughnut hole got a $250 rebate check. The \nsecond year, their drugs--when they were in the doughnut hole--got cut \nby 50 percent. By the end of this decade, the doughnut hole will be \ncompletely eliminated.\n  The average savings for a senior, as Senator Stabenow will talk \nabout, has been $1,200. People often don't know that is because of the \nAffordable Care Act. When you go in and your drugs all of a sudden cost \n50 percent less than they did, there is no stamp on that bill that says \ncourtesy of the Affordable Care Act.\n  The fact is that without the Affordable Care Act, seniors--over the \ncourse of the last 3 years--would have spent $9 billion more on drugs \nthan they have. The number is so big that it is kind of hard to fathom. \nThe Affordable Care Act has saved seniors $9 billion, an average of \n$1,200 per senior.\n  On top of that, when seniors go in to get their annual checkup or for \na cancer screening or tobacco cessation program, those preventive \nhealth care visits are now free. Twenty-five million seniors have \naccess to those programs all across the country.\n  In my State of Connecticut, 76,000 people with Medicare have taken \nadvantage of free annual wellness visits under the health care law. So \nwe are seeing tremendous benefits for seniors all across the country. \nThis is not just about the doughnut hole or preventive health care.\n  In 2012, the Medicare Part B deductible dropped by $22 to $140. That \nis the first time in the history of Medicare that the Medicare Part B \ndeductible has actually been reduced thanks to the efficiencies that \nare being garnered in the Medicare Part B program by the health care \nlaw.\n  Second, Medicare Advantage plans now can't charge more than Medicaid \nfor things like chemotherapy, skilled nursing, and other specialized \nservices, which results in saving thousands of dollars for seniors.\n  In the first 3 years of the Affordable Care Act, Medicare recovered \n$15 billion in fraudulent payments under Medicare because of new tools \ndesigned to root out fraud and waste and abuse in the Affordable Care \nAct. Older Americans who have not yet reached Medicare age are saving \nmoney because the act reduced the amount of discrimination in premiums \nagainst older Americans by saying that insurance companies can't charge \nolder workers more than three times what they charged younger workers.\n  For seniors, in particular, we are trying to make it clear that some \nof the\n\n[[Page S1217]]\n\nunnoticed benefits, such as the fact that nobody is asking you for a \ncopay when you go in for a Medicare checkup and that you are saving \nmoney every time you go into the pharmacy--that didn't happen \nmagically. That didn't happen because of Republican health care \npolicies. It happened because of the Affordable Care Act.\n  Finally, before I turn it over to my colleague Senator Stabenow, I \nwant to address some of the mythology we have been hearing on the floor \nof the Senate in the past few days about Medicare Advantage.\n  There is no doubt that there were reductions in the payment from the \nFederal Government to the Medicare Advantage plans in the Affordable \nCare Act. Why? Because we were overcompensating private health care \ncompanies for running the Medicare Advantage plan. We were giving them \n13 percent more than it cost Medicare itself to run the Medicare \nprogram. That just doesn't make a lot of sense.\n  Private companies were telling us they could do things for the same \nprice or less than the Federal Government. In this case we were paying \nMedicare private insurers a lot more than it costs Medicare to run the \nprogram. So we decided to eliminate that subsidy.\n  Guess what. The news has been pretty remarkable. In fact, 30 percent \nmore seniors are on Medicare Advantage plans today than when we passed \nthe law, and premiums under Medicare Advantage have come down by 10 \npercent during that time. More people are on Medicare Advantage plans, \nthere are less costs in premiums, and the average Medicare participant \nhas 18 different plans to choose from.\n  All of this apocalyptic talk about what was going to happen when we \npassed the Affordable Care Act with respect to Medicare Advantage and \nall this new apocalyptic talk about what will happen when the subsidies \nget further reduced has not come true. We now have cheaper Medicare \nAdvantage plans, more seniors on them, and plenty of across-the-board \navailability.\n  I am really pleased to have been joined here by about a half dozen of \nour colleagues to tell the story about what the ACA has meant for \nseniors.\n  We are going to come to the floor every week. We are going to stand \nwith patients and consumers every week to talk about the benefits for \nseniors, cancer patients, women, and taxpayers all in an effort to try \nto prove to the American people what millions of Americans are finding \nout, and that is that the Affordable Care Act works.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first I thank the Senator from \nConnecticut for his advocacy for seniors, children, families, and small \nbusinesses to have access to affordable and quality health insurance. \nHe has been a powerful voice on this issue.\n  I also congratulate his State of Connecticut and the Governor of \nConnecticut for all of their hard work. I know they are doing a great \njob on their insurance pool--the health care exchange which is \nproviding more affordable health insurance for the citizens in \nConnecticut.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership.\n  I also rise today to talk about the fact that millions of American \nfamilies today have access to more affordable health care. Seniors, \nchildren, small businesses, and others are getting the opportunity to \nhave the health care they are paying for and know they can get the \nhealth care they need even if they have a preexisting condition because \nof the Affordable Care Act.\n  I will take a few moments to talk about what this means for our \nsenior citizens--for people on Medicare. Obviously, Medicare is a great \nAmerican success story and something that I strongly support, as do my \ncolleagues who are speaking today.\n  As part of health care reform, we wanted to strengthen Medicare for \nthe future. We protect the guaranteed benefits under Medicare. We have \nshored up the program so that the trust fund is now solvent until 2026 \nand will be so going forward as other savings occur over the long run. \nIt is working because of some very tangible work we have done to put \nmore money in the pockets of our senior citizens and to create the \nopportunity for them to have access to affordable health care.\n  I often think about the letters and emails I have received from \npeople in Michigan prior to our passing health care reform and the \nkinds of stories that people told me all the time before we \nstrengthened Medicare.\n  I will read one letter from a senior citizen from Warren, MI, who \nwrote to me a letter prior to health care reform talking about the gap \nin coverage in prescription drugs. Under Medicare Part-D, you are \ncovered to a certain point, and then there is a gap and you get no \nhelp. Then if your prescription drug costs are very high, it kicks in \nagain. Some people call that the doughnut hole. It is a gap in \ncoverage.\n  A senior from Warren told me this:\n\n       I cannot afford all of my costly drugs so I have to stop \n     taking one of them (the least risky one) and have to scrounge \n     free samples from my doctor's office for another while paying \n     high retail prices for the other two.\n\n  That was before we passed health reform. Now on average in our \ncountry, seniors have $1,200 more in their pocket since we passed \nhealth care reform which helps them with their prescription drug costs. \nWhy? Because we are closing that gap. That gap is going to go away. \nThere is going to be no more cliff, no more doughnut hole, and no more \ngap in coverage. Right now seniors across the country are saving, on \naverage, $1,200, which is more money back in their pocket.\n  When we think about it in big terms, there are more than 7.3 million \nseniors and people with disabilities who are on Medicare who found \nthemselves in that gap in coverage, and the health care reform law--in \nthe big picture--has saved them about $9 billion--on average $1,200 for \nan individual, but all total so far about $9 billion. That is $9 \nbillion more available to seniors, which puts money back in their \npocket--to do what? Well, to pay the rent, to pay the electric bill. In \na State such as Michigan, to pay the high heating bills because of the \nwinter we have been having; to put gas in the car. Maybe it is to do \nsomething fun with the grandkids and pay for that birthday present. \nMaybe it is doing something else that is needed. Whatever it is, the \nidea is the average person who is retired and on Medicare has over \n$1,000 back in their pocket now because of health reform and what we \nhave been able to do to strengthen Medicare. It is a great thing.\n\n  The problem is that is what Republicans want to take away. That is \nwhat they want to take away. That is what will be taken away if it is \nrepealed; if one of the over 40 different repeal votes were actually to \nhappen, and what the House of Representatives has already done.\n  Let me share another letter from Mary Ann from Rockford who wrote \nlast fall to say she is sick of the efforts to repeal health care \nreform. She says:\n\n       The Affordable Care Act has already helped millions of \n     seniors like myself. From free preventive services to lower-\n     cost prescription drugs, we're saving money.\n\n  We are saving money.\n  Let me talk about another area where seniors are saving money, and \nthat is the annual checkup. We always want folks to have the annual \ncheckup. That checkup used to have copays and deductibles. Today, under \nMedicare, because of health reform, when a senior walks into a doctor's \noffice, how much are they paying for that annual checkup? Zero. Zero, \nbecause of health reform. We don't want any seniors to feel they can't \nget that checkup, they can't get the mammogram they need, they can't \nget that lovely colonoscopy we all look forward to getting. We don't \nwant our seniors to feel they can't get any other kinds of preventive \ncare or cancer screens or flu shots, or whatever it is, because of the \ncopays or deductibles. Today the cost of that checkup for preventive \nservices is zero. If health reform is repealed, that is repealed. That \nis what folks who want repeal are doing; it is what they want to take \naway.\n  So I join with my colleagues who feel strongly that we need to make \nsure we are keeping in place those positives that are making a real \ndifference in the lives of senior citizens, of children, of families. \nIf there are areas going forward that need to be fixed, we need to fix \nthem, and we will. But we certainly do not want to go back to the days \nwhen seniors are spending $1,200 more out of their pocket for their \nmedicine, on average, or when they are paying for the cost of an annual \ncheckup that is absolutely critical they get for their\n\n[[Page S1218]]\n\nlife going forward. I am proud to stand with colleagues saying let's \ntalk together about how we make sure things work going forward, but \nlet's not go back to the time when all of these important services and \nprotections were not in place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                              Free Speech\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Thank you, Mr. President. I come to the floor today to \nalso speak about ObamaCare. But before I do so, I feel the need to \naddress some comments made on the floor of the Senate yesterday that, \nsadly, I find to be extremely distasteful.\n  Yesterday, two prominent citizens were called unpatriotic merely \nbecause they have engaged--legally, I must say--in their First \nAmendment right to participate in the political process. I was \nsaddened, I was dismayed, and I was discouraged to see the floor of the \nSenate used as a venue for such campaign-related attacks.\n  In order to further their own agenda, it has become commonplace for \nmy colleagues--especially across the aisle--to suppress the free speech \nand rights of certain people and organizations. These are simply people \nwith whom they do not agree and who have had the audacity to hold views \ndifferent from this administration.\n  Make no mistake, this is all part of a coordinated plan. I call it \nshaping the battlefield to tamp down--maybe that is not the right word; \nmake that suppress--political opponents in the runup to the general \nelection as of this fall.\n  We have seen repeatedly since the Citizens United decision of 2010 \nMembers of this body trying to rein in conservative groups' ability to \nparticipate in the political process. This campaign is a direct attack, \nI believe, on the rights of these organizations. This campaign created \nan environment in which the Internal Revenue Service found it necessary \nand possible to single out conservative organizations for extra \nscrutiny. And this has made it impossible for conservative groups to \nparticipate in the last two elections, and now they are at it again in \n2014. There is a short phrase which describes this, and I think it is \n``abuse of power.''\n  This is all troubling and shocking enough, but now we have a very \ndirect personal attack against a Kansas company whose political views \nsome find very objectionable. What I find even more offensive is \ndeclaring on the floor the opposing views make them ``liars.'' Our \nConstitution grants every American the fundamental right to engage in \nthe political process, and these folks have done so, fully within the \nbounds of the law.\n  Nothing Charles and David Koch have done or are doing is illegal. \nTheir participation, their statements, their work is very far from un-\nAmerican. Quite the opposite. It is the essence of what it means to be \nan American. Nothing is more fundamental to our Constitution, our way \nof governing, than the freedom of speech.\n  We should be focused on our role and responsibility of governing to \nmake things better for the American people and not using the Senate \nfloor to further any political agenda by making personal attacks on \nprivate citizens.\n  That brings me to what I came here to discuss today.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Roberts pertaining to the introduction of S. 2064 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Thank you, Mr. President. It is good to see my long-time \nfriend from Massachusetts in the Presiding Officer's chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Veterans Benefits\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, President Kennedy, from the Presiding \nOfficer's home State said, if I could paraphrase a bit: A nation \nreveals itself not only by the men and women it produces but also by \nthe men and women it honors, the men and women it remembers.\n  It is our duty to take care of those who served in uniform. Today, \nthis Nation has revealed itself, and the image is shameful. This body \nfailed to consider the important veterans legislation of this \nCongress--the most important veterans legislation of this Congress: the \nComprehensive Veterans Health and Benefits and Military Retirement Pay \nRestoration Act of 2014.\n  I sit on the Senate Veterans Affairs' Committee. I am the first \nSenator from my State ever to sit on that committee for a full term. I \nconsider that an honor. I consider it a privilege to serve those who \nserved us in this Nation.\n  I have worked alongside Republicans and Democrats, as has Chairman \nSanders and Ranking Member Burr. We have produced good legislation \nhere. Next to the post-9/11 GI bill, which Senator Webb worked on 4 or \n5 years ago, it is the most important advancement in veterans \nlegislation and assistance to our Nation's veterans at my time in the \nSenate. That is the good news.\n  The bad news is this debate has been about politics, not about \nveterans. Again, people in Washington want to score political points by \nfilibuster, by obstruction, by blocking good bipartisan legislation, \nsupported by a whole panoply of veterans organizations and community \ngroups.\n  There are those who have concerns who want to add to this bill, \nconcerns that are not related to veterans. To hold up this bill with \nsomething unrelated to veterans is unconscionable.\n  Whether you are in Marblehead, MA, or Mansfield, OH, we all have \nheard our constituents say: Why do they attach these unrelated things \nto legislation instead of voting them up or down on their merits? That \nis what people want to do here. Those who want to filibuster this bill \nare the people who want to add things to the bill that have nothing to \ndo with serving our veterans.\n  This legislation by itself improves vital programs to honor our \ncommitment to those who served in uniform and for those who care for \nour veterans. Whether it is a community-based outpatient clinic in \nZanesville or Chillicothe or Springfield, whether it is a VA center in \nDayton or Chillicothe or Cleveland, we care about those who care for \nour veterans, many of whom are veterans themselves, and we take care of \nthose veterans.\n  This corrects errors in programs and benefits and, as I said, has \nwidespread support in the veterans community. The American Legion, \nVeterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, Vietnam Veterans \nof America, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America all support this \nlegislation.\n  I will not go through a lot of the details we have discussed before \nthat Senator Sanders brought to the floor, but I want to talk about a \ncouple.\n  This bill renews our VOW to Hire Heroes Act by reauthorizing \nprovisions such as the VRAP, the Veterans Retraining Assistance \nProgram. This program retrains unemployed veterans for high-demand \noccupations.\n  I traveled across Ohio throughout 2012 spreading the word about VRAP, \nencouraging our veterans to apply. Ohio veterans applied in larger \nnumbers than our State's population would suggest because of the \noutreach of so many in encouraging people to sign up for VRAP.\n  I met veterans such as Everett Chambers in Cleveland, who used VRAP \nfunds to get retrained as an electrical engineering technician at \nCuyahoga Community College, or Tri-C.\n  I remember meeting a veteran in Youngstown who went back to school \nbecause of VRAP and got the opportunity to work at a health care center \nin information technology.\n  We know VRAP works. It helps our veterans get back to work. It lowers \nthe unacceptably high unemployment rate for recently separated \nservicemembers who have so much to offer employers.\n  This program is aimed for those veterans who are a little bit older \nwho are no longer eligible for the GI bill and those veterans who have \nbeen out of the service for a while. But it does not stop there. It \nadds other important improvements in education benefits, in \nreproductive health, in the delivery of care and benefits to veterans \nwho experienced sexual trauma while serving in the military.\n  Too many Members in this body will say they support the programs in \nthis bill but that finding the money to do so is not possible. So they \nare for the bill,\n\n[[Page S1219]]\n\nthey say, until they are not. Well, there is a disconnect between what \nthey say and what they do. Those same elected leaders--those same \nelected leaders who say: I am for this bill, but we can't pay for it, \nso we can't pass it--those same people want to give tax breaks to \ncompanies that take jobs and factories overseas when we say we cannot \nfind the money to provide a caregiver the support he needs to care for \nhis wife, a veteran. We fight a decade-long war in Afghanistan that \ngoes unpaid for and we cannot find the resources to ensure the very \npeople who fought that war will be cared for.\n  It would be a little more simple than that. When a company closes \ndown in Springfield, or Springfield, MA, and moves to Wuhan, China, or \nShihan, China, they can deduct the cost of the plant shutdown in one of \nthe Springfields and they can deduct the cost of building the new plant \nin Wuhan, China. That is a loophole we could close. It would mean more \ncompanies would stay in Springfield, OH, or Springfield, MA, helping \nour communities, helping our tax base, and it would mean those \ncompanies would not be deducting that move and that money could then be \nused for these veterans programs. But no, they say: We can't find the \nmoney.\n  It is important to end this filibuster and pass this bill.\n\n\n                           Buying Government\n\n  Mr. President, I heard my friend from Kansas talk about what he calls \nthe personal attacks on two I believe he said great Americans, but \nAmericans nonetheless, which they are, and prominent businesspeople in \nKansas and around the country.\n  These two Americans--and this is not personal to me--these two \nAmericans have spent millions of dollars trying to defeat me, as they \nhave tried to defeat a number of people in this Chamber who think \ngovernment has a role in preserving Medicare and government should \nprovide funds for Head Start and government should give tax breaks to \nlow-income people, not just rich people, and government should play a \nrole, as the Presiding Officer has, in a cleaner environment and deal \nwith climate change. But I disagree with these two Americans. I do not \npersonally dislike them or personally know them. But I do know they \nhave spent millions of dollars in ads, millions of dollars in an \nunprecedented way--they and a small number of people--to try to hijack \nour political system.\n  People are sick and tired, first, of the TV ads; second, of the lies \nin the TV ads; and, third, that there are people--a few billionaires--\nwho are trying to buy elections in this country, billionaires who are \nlooking for tax breaks for themselves, billionaires who are looking for \nthe opportunity to weaken environmental laws, billionaires who want to \nkill the union movement in this country.\n  I want to read from one editorial that was printed in, I believe, \nRoll Call or The Hill newspaper talking about some of these ads. Here \nis what this editorial said:\n\n       Were this an ad for Stainmaster carpet, a Koch product-- \n     Koch, this is the family, the brothers--\n       Were this an ad for Stainmaster carpet, a Koch product, \n     Federal Trade Commission guidelines would require the ad to \n     ``conspicuously disclose that the persons in such \n     advertisements are not actual consumers.'' Moreover, the FTC \n     would require them to either demonstrate that these results \n     of ObamaCare are typical or make clear in the ad that they \n     are not.\n       Needless to say, the ad meets none of these requirements, \n     thereby conforming to the legal definition of false \n     advertising.\n\n  That tells you a lot. I rest my case in just those terms. It is never \npersonal. It should never be. It is whom you fight for in this body and \nwhat you fight against. But there are people in this country who think \nthey can buy our government. We have seen that throughout our history. \nWe have seen the oil companies try to do everything they can to at \nleast if not buy government take a long-term lease. We saw the robber \nbarons 100 years ago, including one from my State, Mark Hanna, who used \nto try to control the legislature. They used to say that he wore \nPresident McKinley like a watchfob when he was Governor of Ohio.\n  So we have seen this in the past. We have never seen it in such an \nincredibly big way as we have seen it in the last few election cycles.\n\n\n                              Minimum Wage\n\n  Mr. President, I want to speak about the minimum wage, something this \nChamber, frankly, needs to do. The Presiding Officer in his time in the \nHouse saw, as I did, a number of Members of Congress who would vote to \nraise their own pay but then vote against a minimum-wage increase, \nwhich I find morally inconsistent or worse. But let me make a couple \ncomments about that.\n  In 1991, the average price of gas was $1.15 a gallon, a loaf of bread \naround 70 cents, a dozen eggs about $1. The tipped minimum wage--that \nis the minimum wage for people who work in a diner who get tips, people \nwho push a wheelchair in an airport who rely on tips, a valet, someone \nwho does nail manicures, people who work in jobs where they are \nreceiving tips--the minimum wage in 1991 for those workers at the local \ndiner or the local airport was $2.13 an hour--in 1991.\n  Today, the average price of gas is $3.30 a gallon; a loaf of bread \ncosts $1.35, more or less; eggs are about $2. The tipped minimum wage \nis still $2.13. Its value has fallen by 36 percent in real terms. Think \nabout that--$2.13 an hour.\n  Americans who work hard and take responsibility should be able to \ntake care of their families. That is why I support the Fair Minimum \nWage Act, which would raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour in three \n95-cent increments and then provide annual cost-of-living increases \nlinked to changes in the cost of living. The bill would also gradually \nraise the Federal minimum wage for tipped workers at the diner, the \nvalet, the person doing the manicure from $2.13 an hour to 70 percent \nof the regular minimum wage.\n  In 1980 the minimum wage for tipped workers was 60 percent of the \nregular minimum wage. It is now less than 30 percent of the regular \nminimum wage. In Canada the minimum wage in Ontario is $11; the tipped \nminimum wage is $8.90. The United States is the only industrialized \nnation in the world--except for Canada--where a large number of workers \nmust depend on tips for a large share of their income. So in Canada the \ntipped minimum wage is only slightly less than the minimum wage. In the \nUnited States it is less than 30 percent of the minimum wage. In the \nrest of the world it is 100 percent of the minimum wage.\n  Interestingly, servers in the United States, people who work at \ndiners or restaurants in the United States--when a European comes \nacross the ocean and eats at a restaurant in Cleveland or in \nCincinnati, the European will usually leave a really small tip because \nthey are not used to tipping. The American worker relies on those tips \nfor any kind of a decent wage.\n  Ohio's current tipped minimum wage is a little higher; it is $3.98. \nThat is still not enough. These are men and women who have bills to pay \nand families to support.\n  Most tipped workers do not work at fine dining establishments where \nthe average bill is $50, $60, or $70, so someone is making pretty good \nmoney on tips. A server in a high-class restaurant, an expensive \nrestaurant, can make hundreds of dollars in a night. But for a server \nwho works in a diner where four people come in, get coffee, spend an \nhour there, and have a bill of $6, the tip might be $1. That person has \nworked for an hour. They are not getting to the minimum wage with the \ntipped wage, and, often, neither is the valet or the person at the \nairport who is getting someone off the plane and pushing their \nwheelchair to their connecting flight. They often do not even receive \ntips because so often the person in the wheelchair never thinks about \nit, does not know that these are tipped workers, that they are only \nmaking $2, $3, or $4 an hour. They are working hard.\n  We work hard for the money we make. We are very well paid here. It is \na privilege to serve in the Senate. But when you think about those \nworkers who are working very hard, their minimum wage is $2.13 an hour. \nThere is something not right about that.\n  One more point. The Center for American Progress completed an \nanalysis of 20 years' worth of minimum wage increases in States across \nthe country. They conclude that there is no clear evidence that the \nminimum wage leads to further job loss during periods of high \nunemployment.\n  The opponents of raising the minimum wage say that it is going to\n\n[[Page S1220]]\n\ncause price increases and that there are going to be layoffs. But what \nis interesting is that every time there is a minimum wage bill we are \ndebating, the opponents say: You know, these businesses are going to \nhave to raise their prices or lay people off to pay the minimum wage. \nBut when an executive gets a $1 million bonus, when a CEO gets paid $12 \nmillion and gets a raise to $16 million the next year, I never hear \nthem say: Boy, they are going to have to lay people off to pay those \nexecutive salaries. It is only when it is low-wage workers that my \nfriends on that side of the aisle stand and say: This is going to hurt \nbusiness. This is going to hurt commerce. This is going to hurt \nemployment.\n  Their arguments are weak. Their arguments are, in many cases, a bit \nhardhearted. I wish my colleagues would do what Pope Francis said. \nRecently, Pope Francis exhorted his parish priests to go out and smell \nlike the flock; go out among your parishioners and listen to them and \ntry to understand their lives and try to live like them.\n  Well, a lot of those parishioners are minimum wage workers or \nslightly above minimum wage. Smelling like the flock might help some of \nmy colleagues come to the conclusion that raising the minimum wage is \nimportant to do, is humane, is right for our country.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Ukraine\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to share with my \ncolleagues the tragic events that unfolded these past few weeks in the \nUkraine. Ukraine is an incredibly important country. The recent events \nare tragic, the result of a corrupt government and loss of life.\n  I remember the Orange Revolution that took place in Ukraine, starting \nin November 2004, ending in January 2005. Hundreds of thousands of \nUkrainians took to that protest to protest the corrupt election. They \ndid it in a peaceful way.\n  They not only got the attention of the people of Ukraine but the \nattention of the world. As a result of that peaceful revolution, the \ngovernment stood for new elections, free and fair elections. Democratic \nleadership was elected, and all of us thought the future for Ukraine \nwas very positive.\n  I was in Kiev not long after that Orange Revolution. I had a chance \nto talk to people who were involved, and I talked to the new leaders. I \nsaw that sense of hope that Ukraine at long last would be an \nindependent country without the domination of any other country and \nthat the proud people would have a country that would respect their \nrights, that would transition into full membership in Europe and \nprovide the greatest hope for future generations.\n  They started moving in that direction. As the Presiding Officer \nknows, there were agreements with Europe on immigration. They have been \ninvolved in military operations in close conjunction with NATO. Ukraine \nwas and is an important partner of the United States and for Europe.\n  Then Victor Yanukovych came into power for a second time. Mr. \nYanukovych took the country in a different direction. He was a corrupt \nleader. He had a close involvement with Russia.\n  Today there is some hope. The Parliament has brought in a new interim \ngovernment. Presidential elections are now scheduled for May 25. But \nthere are certain matters that are still very much in doubt. In the \nCrimea, which is a part of the Ukraine which has a large Russian \npopulation, it is unclear as to what is happening there. Pro-Russian \nsympathizers have taken over government buildings. It is not clear of \nRussia's involvement.\n  It is critically important that the international community have \naccess to what is happening in the Crimea and make it clear that Russia \nmust allow the Ukraine to control its own destiny. It is time for the \ninternational community to mobilize its resources to assist Ukraine's \ntransition to a democratic, secure, and prosperous country.\n  The people of Ukraine have had an incredibly difficult history and \nover the last century have been subjected to two World Wars, 70 years \nof Soviet domination, including Stalin's genocidal famine.\n  Our assistance at this time will be a concrete manifestation that we \ndo indeed stand by the people of Ukraine as they manifest their \nhistoric choice for freedom and democracy. Moreover, we need to help \nUkraine succeed to realize the vision of a Europe whole, free, and at \npeace.\n  That is our desire and that is the desire of the people of Ukraine. \nThey are moving on the right path. They critically need our help and \nthat of the international community to make sure Russia does not try to \ndominate this country; that its desire to become part of Europe is \nrealized; that free and fair elections can take place, and the rights \nof their people can be respected by their government.\n  Yesterday I heard from Swiss President and OSCE Chair-in-Office \nBurkhalter and welcomed his engagement and the important role the OSCE \ncan play in Ukraine.\n  As a member of the Commission, I had the honor of chairing the \nHelsinki Commission, which is our implementing arm to the Organization \nfor Security and Co-operation in Europe. A Foreign Minister from one of \nthe member states usually acts as our Chair-in-Office, and this year \nMr. Burkhalter is not only the Foreign Minister of Switzerland, he is \nalso the President of Switzerland. He is the person responsible for the \ndirection of the organization. We had a hearing with him and Ukraine \ntook a good part of our discussions.\n  The guiding principles of the OSCE is if they are going to have a \nprosperous country, if they are going to have a secure country, they \nhave to have a country that respects the rights of its citizens. \nRespecting the rights of its citizens means they are entitled to good \ngovernance. They are entitled to a country that does not depend upon \ncorruption in order to finance its way of life. Those are the \nprinciples of the OSCE. A country with good governance, respect for \nhuman rights, that takes on corruption, is a country in which there \nwill be economic prosperity and a country which will enjoy security. \nThat has been our chief function, to try to help other countries.\n  The meeting yesterday underscored the importance OSCE can play in the \nfuture of Ukraine, and we hope they will utilize those resources so \nUkraine can come out of this crisis as a strong, democratic, and \nindependent country.\n  There has to be accountability. There has to be accountability for \nthose who are responsible for the deaths in Kiev. I mention that \nbecause, yes, there is a moral reason for that. Those who commit amoral \natrocities should be held accountable. That is just a matter of basic \nrights. But there is also the situation when they don't bring closure \nhere, it offers little hope that these circumstances will not be \nrepeated in the future. If future government leaders believe they could \ndo whatever they want and there will be no consequences for their \nactions, they are more likely to take the irresponsible actions we saw \non Ukraine.\n  So, yes, it is important we restore a democratic government in \nUkraine. It is important that government be independent and able to \nbecome a full member of Europe. It is important that government respect \nthe human rights of its citizens, but it is also important they hold \nthose responsible for these atrocities accountable for their actions.\n  The Obama administration took some action this past week. They did \ndeny visas to certain members who were responsible for the Government \nof Ukraine, and they did freeze bank accounts of those who were \ninvolved in the corrupt practices in Ukraine. That was a good first \nstep and I applaud their actions.\n  I remind my colleagues we passed the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law \nAccountability Act as part of the Russia PNTR legislation. I was proud \nto be the sponsor of the Sergei Magnitsky Rule\n\n[[Page S1221]]\n\nof Law Accountability Act. What it does--and it says it was amended to \napply only to Russia--those who are involved in gross violations of \ninternationally recognized human rights will be denied the privilege of \nbeing able to come to America, to get a visa and we will deny them the \nopportunity to use our banking system.\n  Why is that important? Because we found those corrupt officials want \nto keep their properties outside of their host country. They want to \nvisit America. They want to use our banking system. They want their \ncorrupt ways to be in dollars, not in rubles. Denying them that \nopportunity is an effective remedy for making sure they can't profit \nfrom all of their corruption.\n  That legislation was limited to Russia not by our design. The Senate \nForeign Relations Committee and the Senate Finance Committee approved \nthe Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act as a global act \napplying beyond Russia.\n  Sergei Magnitsky was a young lawyer who discovered corruption in \nRussia. He did what he should have done--told the authorities about it. \nAs a result, he was arrested, tortured, and killed because he did the \nright thing.\n  We took action to make sure those responsible could not benefit from \nthat corruption. That was the Sergei Magnitsky bill. We felt, though, \nit should be a tool available universally. We had to compromise on \nthat, and it was limited to Russia.\n  It is time to change that. Along with Senator McCain, I have \nintroduced the Global Human Rights Accountability Act, S. 1933. It has \nseveral bipartisan sponsors. It would apply globally. So, yes, it would \napply to Ukraine. It would have congressional sanctions to the use of \ntools for denying visa applications and our banking privileges to those \nwho are responsible for these atrocities. I believe our colleagues \nunderstand how important that is for us to do.\n  It is interesting that today the State Department issued its Human \nRights Practices for 2013. This is a required report that we request. \nIt gives the status of human rights records throughout the world, \ntalking about problems.\n  I am sure my colleagues recognize that human rights problems are not \nlimited to solely Russia or Ukraine, from Bahrain to China, to \nBangladesh, from Belarus to Ethiopia, to Venezuela, from the Sudan to \nSouth Sudan, Syria, the list goes on and on and on.\n  The report lists all of the gross violations of human rights that \nhave occurred. Unfortunately, this list is too long. I can name another \ndozen countries that are spelled out in this report. Human rights are \nuniversal, and it is our responsibility to act and show international \nleadership.\n  It takes time to pass good laws, as it should, which is why we must \nact with urgency now. The measures contemplated in my legislation have \ngreat corrective power, but they are strongest when deployed in a \ntimely manner, preferably before the outbreak of violence.\n  The year 2013 was a particularly challenging year for human rights \nand we cannot afford to be silent. The Global Human Rights \nAccountability Act serves as an encouragement for champions of \ndemocracy, promoters of civil rights, and advocates of free speech \nacross the globe.\n  As the great human rights defender Nelson Mandela once said: ``There \nare times when a leader must move ahead of the flock, go off in a new \ndirection, confident that he is leading his people the right way.''\n  In this great body, the Senate, we have a responsibility to lead the \nway in accountability for human rights. We have done that in the past. \nWe have shown through our own example and we have shown through our \ninterest in all corners of the world that this country will stand for \nthe protection of basic human rights for all the people. We now have a \nchance to act by the passage of the global Magnitsky law. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in helping enact this new chapter and the next \nchapter in America's commitment to international human rights.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the \nroll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Affordable Care Act\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, yesterday, while relaying to the Senate \nsome anecdotes he believed proved the success of ObamaCare, the \nmajority leader stated this:\n\n       Despite all the good news, there are plenty of horror \n     stories being told. All of them are untrue, but they are \n     being told all over America.\n\n  Well, that statement, quite frankly, shocked me, and I am sure it \nwould have shocked millions of Americans, if they had heard it, who are \nfeeling the detrimental effects of this very unpopular law, the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  I have heard directly from countless Kansans about the devastating \neffects ObamaCare has had on them and their families. Most of the \nKansans I speak with are concerned primarily about what the future will \nhold for their children and grandchildren. What type of life will we as \nparents and grandparents be passing on to future generations?\n  I can assure the majority leader that Kansans are salt-of-the-earth \npeople. They are, most assuredly, not liars. They do not deserve to be \ncalled liars by any Member of this body.\n  Take Philip and his wife from Lenexa who are in their midfifties. \nPhilip has been self-employed for the last 20 years but had maintained \ncoverage through his wife's employer for most of that time. She now \nworks for a much smaller company which can only pay a fraction of the \ncost of their insurance, so it was much cheaper for him to purchase \ninsurance in the individual market starting in 2013. Finding affordable \ncoverage now, in 2014, has been a much greater challenge. He writes:\n\n       With the changes in health insurance due to implementation \n     of the ACA for the next year, we shopped the Kansas exchange \n     for 2014 plans. What we found was shocking.\n\n  They found that for the same level of coverage, they would now have \nto pay a premium more than double what they paid in 2013. On top of the \nhigher premium, they would be faced with double the deductible and \nnearly double the out-of-pocket maximum.\n  In his letter Philip says:\n\n       Frankly, we anticipate a decline in income for the next two \n     years, but still won't qualify for subsidies; this simply \n     makes the ``Affordable Health Care'' unaffordable for us.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       The icing on the cake--my wife's employer has told her they \n     expect to drop their health care coverage for their employees \n     altogether in 2015 because of the added expenses of the ACA! \n     I honestly don't know what we will do; we are not wealthy by \n     any means and have not been able to fund our retirement plan \n     for a couple of years now. We do not have sufficient money to \n     retire at any time soon and ACA will take everything we could \n     afford to save. We hope Congress can come up with a logical \n     and truly affordable option to the ACA soon!\n\n  This is common criticism I have heard many times, and I can assure \nthe majority leader that Philip's story is true.\n  I have also heard from members of the Kansas Disabled American \nVeterans service organization who have shared the difficulty and \nstruggle of veterans having to relinquish their preferred health care \nplans due to cost increases caused by ObamaCare. They are now pursuing \ncare through the VA, which presents a whole other host of new obstacles \nto receiving the care they deserve. So we have veterans who are unable \nto afford health care under the Affordable Care Act now coming to the \nveterans system and being unable to, anytime soon, enroll. In fact, \ntheir biggest concern is they will now have to wait 3 months to 6 \nmonths to get their first appointment.\n  The bottom line is that veterans will either pay more for their \nhealth benefits through ObamaCare and lose their preferred doctors or \nbe forced to join the backlog of veterans seeking care. Neither is a \ngood option for our veterans. Veterans in Kansas and across the Nation \nare feeling the burdens of ObamaCare. They have sacrificed so much for \nour country, and I can assure the majority leader that they are telling \nthe truth.\n  Another example of how ObamaCare is hurting Kansans is from Salina, a \ntown in the middle of our State. The nonprofit YMCA in Salina will be \ncapping the schedules of part-time employees at 25 hours per week to \navoid having to provide them health insurance benefits as part of \nObamaCare. The administrator says:\n\n\n[[Page S1222]]\n\n\n       It is unfortunate. We have a lot of good people who you'd \n     love to have working more hours that we're going to have to \n     make the cut. This is hitting nonprofits hard. A for-profit \n     company, this cuts into their profits, but we don't have \n     profits to cut into.\n\n  This YMCA is not alone in their efforts to trim costs. Numerous \ncompanies and organizations across Kansas are having to cut back the \nhours of part-time employees because of ObamaCare. And I can tell the \nmajority leader once again that those people and those organizations \nare telling the truth.\n  Yesterday afternoon the majority leader came to the floor once again \nand read an opinion column from The Hill newspaper. This article, \nauthored by Mark Mellman, supported the majority leaders' efforts to \ndiscredit the stories being told of Americans who are having very real \nstruggles and those who have lost their health care coverage as a \nresult of ObamaCare. The majority leader read this column on the Senate \nfloor literally word for word; however, he stopped just short of the \nend of the column, and I wanted to finish reading the footnote of the \ncolumn which he chose not to read. It was about the author.\n\n       Mellman is president of The Mellman Group and has worked \n     for Democratic candidates and causes since 1982. Current \n     clients include the Majority Leader of the Senate and the \n     Democrat whip in the House.\n\n  I just wanted to complete the record, that the majority leader is \nreading an article by a Democratic consultant, employed by the majority \nleader, to furnish evidence that what he is saying about the untruths \nof people who are complaining about ObamaCare is based upon fact. Mark \nMellman really is not the person to be quoting as to whether the \nAffordable Care Act is working.\n  I would also point out that ObamaCare has been heavily debated for \nyears now. For 5 years we have been talking about the Affordable Care \nAct. During this time there have been so many broken promises, so many \nfalsehoods, and so many direct lies. We heard them all.\n  ``ObamaCare will lower all of our health care costs.''\n  ``ObamaCare won't cut Medicare.''\n  ``ObamaCare will create jobs.''\n  And who can forget ``If you like your doctor or health plan, you can \nkeep them.''\n  These were lies. These were untruths. They were promises made and \nsummarily broken. This is why so many Americans are outraged. It is \ntime for Washington to stop dismissing their concerns and start \nlistening to them.\n  Another disturbing moment--in fact, I think perhaps the most \ndisturbing part of what the majority leader said--after he read the \ncolumn from The Hill, he said this:\n\n       It is time the American people spoke out against this \n     terrible dishonesty and about those two brothers who are \n     about as un-American as anyone I can imagine.\n\n  This really bothers me. Accusations about who is un-American are \ndeeply troubling, and to me that is an unfortunate comment when we \nrefer to anyone. From the earliest days of our Republic, it has been a \ntactic exerted by those in power to humiliate and discredit those who \ncome from different backgrounds or have a different point of view that \nchallenges the people in power, and it is part of a strategy to \nconvince ordinary Americans that sinister forces are working to \nundermine our country and our institutions. Ironically, by charging \nsome person or group with being un-American or disloyal, the effort to \nstifle an exchange of ideas erodes the very foundation of our \ndemocratic government.\n  These accusations have been leveled during times of war, but they are \njust as prevalent during times of peace. We know of the Alien and \nSedition Acts of 1797, the Know-Nothing Party taking aim at immigrants \nin the 1800s, and the Red Scare after the First World War.\n  In the process leading up to women's suffrage, critics of giving \nwomen the vote belittled them. One even suggested that women were too \nemotionally delicate to take on the task of voting. Thankfully, these \nridiculous assertions could not derail the passage of the 19th \nAmendment guaranteeing women the right to vote.\n  Yet perhaps the most famous example is a Senator using his position \nto charge people as diverse as Hollywood actors and Army generals and \nSecretary of State George C. Marshall of political views which differed \nwith the Senator's. In fact, the Senator believed their views were \ntraitorous. He referred to such people as ``enemies from within.'' Why \nwould a Senator reach such a conclusion? Because those political views \ndisagreed with his own. Maybe it was also for the headlines and \nattention he craved or perhaps he was just paranoid, in search of a \nbogeyman. For more than 5 years this Senator leveled the charges of \n``disloyalty'' without any real evidence. Because of his flippant \nclaims, he did untold damage to so many lives, with very little \nconsequence to himself. Not until enough of his colleagues had enough \nand put an end to his campaign against other citizens did this \nunfortunate episode in our Nation's history come to an end. This tactic \ndidn't end in 1950 and, indeed, it continues today.\n\n  I am disappointed by those who impugn President Obama, questioning \nhis legitimacy and sincerity as he seeks to do what he believes is his \nbest for the country. Yet it is undoubtedly a two-way street. The \nPresident dismissed those who opposed his candidacy in 2008 as people \nwho ``cling to guns or religion'' or have ``antipathy toward people who \nare not like them.''\n  When I served in the House of Representatives in 2009, Speaker Nancy \nPelosi said in the town hall meeting in August of that year that those \nwith concerns about ObamaCare were ``un-American.''\n  No one has the right to determine whose beliefs are American or un-\nAmerican--certainly no one in the House of Representatives or the \nSenate.\n  It is troubling that there is a reflexive reaction in Congress to \nlabel political critics as un-American or disloyal. Recognizing \ndisagreement is part of the decisionmaking process of our democracy, \nand a respectful dialogue between all Americans is critical to a well-\nfunctioning Republic. Certainly anything short of that is not worthy of \nthe Senate floor.\n  I'm weary of repeated attempts to distract the American people from \nthe rollout and poor performance of ObamaCare.\n  This week a New York Times/CBS poll found that only 6 percent of \nAmericans believe that ObamaCare is ``working well and should be kept \nin place as is.'' I ask the majority leader: Does that mean that the \nother 94 percent of Americans surveyed are liars?\n  In fact, ObamaCare is a disaster to our Nation's health care system, \nand it is a disaster to our country's economy. The American people have \nmade their opinions known, and rather than remedy the situation and \naddress their concerns, the majority leader and others are trying to \nchange the conversation and attack the very Americans who have real, \nlife-impacting concerns about their access to health care.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle act as though the majority \nof Americans support ObamaCare. They do not. They never have. We didn't \nlisten to them when ObamaCare was passed. We have not listened to them \nsince. In fact, the same New York Times/CBS poll found that Americans \n``feel things have pretty seriously gotten off on the wrong track'' by \na margin of nearly 2 to 1. This poll was comprised of Republicans, \nDemocrats, and Independents, of which 63 percent feel things have \npretty seriously gotten off on the wrong track.\n  I agree that we are headed in the wrong direction, and I fear--like \nmost Americans--that instead of righting the course, we have a Senate \nmajority leader who will want to distract the hard-working Americans \nbusy with their families, struggling, and living their lives.\n  Speaking of dysfunction, the majority leader is speaking about \ndysfunction in the Senate that he alone has the ability to control. The \npilot of the plane cannot and should not blame the passengers for the \nturbulence.\n  I'm glad the majority leader mentioned the Senate feels like \n``Groundhog Day'' or groundhog year. He is absolutely right. Over and \nover, how many times has the majority leader obstructed the Senate \ndebate and votes on amendments? Over and over we see the same strategy \nfrom the majority leader to run the Senate according to his rules and \nhis alone. He controls the Senate operations. He controls the ability \nto move past ``Groundhog Day,'' and he controls whether or not his \ncolleagues can advocate for amendments and have votes.\n\n[[Page S1223]]\n\n  Republican Senators are not alone in this thinking--although I'm sure \nthe majority leader wishes that it was just the Republicans \ncomplaining. Many Senate Democrats also feel the same way. They too \nhave legislation. They too have amendments they would like to see in \nfront of the Senate that would see the light of day.\n  One such amendment that the majority leader is using in his blame \ngame is a bipartisan amendment offered by Senators Menendez and Kirk, a \nRepublican and Democrat, with 59 Senate cosponsors. There is an \noverwhelming amount of Senate support for this amendment. So why can't \nwe get the issue of Iran's nuclear capabilities to the Senate floor? \nWhy does the Senate majority leader continue to obstruct the Senate \nprocess rather than return to regular order and allow the Senate to \noperate the way it was intended?\n  The dysfunction of the Senate ultimately hurts the American people, \nand the majority leader has the ability to change that. My hope is that \nwe move beyond this time in the Senate's history, that we move beyond \nthe same old, same old, and that we have the opportunity to chart a new \npath forward to restore the Senate to function as it should.\n  I have no interest in serving in a Senate that doesn't do its work. \nNeither the majority leader nor any other Member of this body has the \nability to represent individual Americans' interest at any given \nmoment.\n  We each represent people from our respective States who have \ndifferent points of view. I understand that people have a different \npoint of view depending upon where they live, their background, their \nexperience, and their philosophy. This diversity of opinion is what \nmakes this country and, by extension, the Senate such a force for good \nin the world.\n  These opposing viewpoints are by their very definition American. The \ndiversity and disagreement among ourselves is actually American, not \nun-American. Whether it is the Kansas small business owner who fears \nlosing health insurance or the brave participants of the Seneca Falls \nConvention, Americans have the right to be heard and the right to play \na part in the American political process. No one has the right to call \nthose people un-American.\n  The litmus test for what is or is not American behavior cannot be \nadministered or measured in partisan terms. Yet the bulk of the \ncomments made by the majority leader attempted to do just that.\n  I am disappointed that it is even necessary for me to be on the \nSenate floor to talk about these disparaging comments, but the American \npeople deserve an accountable legislature.\n  Whether you agree or disagree with the direction of our country--if \nyou disagree with the direction it is heading in or you think we are \ndoing OK, you are still an American, and you have the right to voice \nthat opinion without having your allegiance to the United States called \ninto question.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/27/senate-section/article/S1223-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations on \ntoday's Executive Calendar: Nos. 568, 569, 565, and 571.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the nominations be confirmed en \nbloc, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the \ntable with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be \nin order to any of the nominations; that any related statements be \nprinted in the Record; that President Obama be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, Senator Grassley, the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, is unable to be on the floor at this time, and on \nhis behalf I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will read into the Record--maybe tonight, \nbut if not, I will do it Monday--statements made in the past by the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee where he talked in detail \nabout how foolish it would be to have cloture on nominations for \njudges--his exact words.\n  I am disappointed that there has been an objection, but as I \nindicated yesterday, we are in groundhog year. Why would this next week \nbe any different than the rest of this year?\n  They have objected and obstructed--they meaning the Republicans in \nthe Senate--everything. Look at what we just finished--and I mean \nfinished. We just finished a bill that had been worked on for a long \ntime by the junior Senator from Vermont, the chairman of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee.\n  This is a bill that would help veterans. No one disputes the bill \nwould help veterans. All 26 veterans organizations, including the \nAmerican Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, supported that \nlegislation--plus 24 other veterans organizations. So what happens over \nhere with the Republicans? They figured out a way to say no. They \nalways do that. But the way they say no is to obstruct, and that is \nwhat they did on this veterans bill.\n  I hope every veteran in America understands the fact that we had \nsomething that would improve the lives of the fighting men and women \nwho came back from Iraq and Afghanistan, and those Asian veterans from \nVietnam and some from Korea and some from World War II who are still \nwith us. Because of the continual obstruction over here to do anything \nthey can to slow down the Obama administration, they are even willing \nto hurt veterans.\n  This was a bill that didn't take a single penny. It was paid for with \nleftover war money. We agreed to have amendments, but that is just all \nhot air from the Republicans. We would be willing to do these bills if \nthey would allow us to have amendments, and they figured out a way to \nsay no again.\n  So we have to invoke cloture on district court judges that my friend, \nthe ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, has said time and time \nagain should not happen.\n  Either tonight or Monday I will read verbatim into the Record what he \nhas said in the past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/27/senate-section/article/S1223-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   NOMINATION OF DEBO P.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Judicial Nominees\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I filed cloture on the childcare block \ngrant. I have every assurance from my Republican colleagues that this \nvote will not be necessary. I hope that is the case. It would be great \nif we could vitiate that and move and start legislating.\n  I believe that will be the case. Sometimes it is a long time from \ntoday to next Wednesday, when a vote would occur. I really do believe \nit will not be necessary. I hope that is the case.\n  I indicated that I would say a few words about the man that does all \nof the objecting, or a lot of the objecting around here. We had the \nSenator from Kansas, the junior Senator from Kansas come and say he \nobjected to these judges being approved because the senior Senator from \nIowa, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, asked him to do \nso.\n  In recent days Senator Grassley has criticized my management of the \nSenate floor regarding nominations. The ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee has said that I am responsible for the gridlock because of \nfilibuster reform over the overuse of cloture. The past statements and \nrecent actions of my friend, the senior Senator from Iowa, reveal his \nobvious either misunderstanding of what he said in the past or--I will \nleave it at that. There are a lot of terms that I could use, but I will \nnot use them.\n  These are things that he has said in the past that obviously he did \nnot mean at the time or he has forgotten what he said. He once stood on \nthe floor and said he was strongly in favor of up-or-down votes on all \nnominations. He even said, ``Filibustering the nominee into oblivion is \nmisguided warfare and the wrong way for a minority party to leverage \ninfluence in the Senate.''\n  That is what the man who is doing all of the objecting said before. \nHe also said:\n\n       It is just plain hogwash to say that moving to make sure \n     the rule is to give judicial nominees an up-or-down vote will \n     hurt our ability to reestablish fairness in the judicial \n     nominating process. It is not going to hurt minority rights.\n\n  These are direct quotes from him:\n\n       It establishes what we call regular order and as it has \n     been for 214 years. It will be fair both to Republicans and \n     Democrats alike. All the majority leader wants to do is have \n     a chance to vote on those nominees up or down.\n\n  He could be easily talking about me. Maybe in the past he was talking \nabout Senator Frist or Senator Lott. But it does not matter who has \nthis job. That is what he is talking about:\n\n       All the majority leader wants is to have a chance to vote \n     these nominees up or down. If these individuals do not have \n     51 votes, they should be rejected. But if these individuals \n     do have 51 votes, then they should be confirmed. That is \n     according to the Constitution.\n\n  That is what he said. He said it here in May a few years ago, May 23. \nHe also said--this is another quote.\n\n       Let's debate the nominees and give our advice and consent. \n     It's a simple yea or nay when called to the altar to vote. \n     Filibustering a nominee into oblivion is misguided warfare \n     and the wrong way for a minority party to leverage and \n     influence the Senate. Threatening to grind the legislative \n     activity to a standstill if they don't get their way is like \n     being a bully in the schoolyard playground.\n\n  He said that. The senior Senator from Iowa said that. He further \nsaid:\n\n       Let's do our jobs. Nothing is nuclear about asking the full \n     Senate to take an up-or-down vote on judicial nominees.\n\n  I'm not making this up. This is what he said, the man who has the \naudacity to come here to the floor and object, saying what a terrible \nthing it is that we are having up-or-down votes on these judges.\n  He went on to say:\n\n       It is the way the Senate has operated for years. The \n     reality is that Democrats are the ones who are turning Senate \n     tradition on its head by installing a filibuster against the \n     President's judicial nominees.\n\n  That is what he said. He slows down Senate business even on nominees \nhe supports. How do you like that? This week alone, the senior Senator \nfrom Iowa repeatedly voted against cloture on nominations he then \nsupported moments later: Beth Freeman, Northern District of California; \nJames Donato, Northern District of California; James Moody, Eastern \nDistrict of Arkansas; Jeffrey Meyer, Connecticut.\n  He voted to invoke the filibuster rule and then turns right around \nand votes for those judges. His obstruction, though, I am sorry to say, \nis not limited to nominations. When the Senate considered S. 744, the \ncomprehensive immigration bill, Senator Grassley objected to \nconsideration or adoption of Republican or bipartisan amendments on at \nleast four occasions.\n  When challenged, Senator Grassley admitted to violation of Senatorial \ncourtesy. Here is what Senator Leahy said:\n\n\n[[Page S1226]]\n\n\n       Is it not a fact that the first amendment that was brought \n     up here was a bipartisan amendment of mine and Senator Hatch? \n     Shortly thereafter, the Senator from Iowa came with an \n     amendment. Following normal courtesy, I allowed mine to be \n     set aside so he could bring up his. So isn't it a fact that \n     we asked if he might set it aside for some noncontroversial \n     amendments on either side? He told me he could not. The \n     Senator is correct.\n\n  You cannot talk out of both sides of your mouth unless somebody \nunderstands they are listening to what you say both times. The ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, the senior Senator from Iowa, he is \ntalking out of both sides of his mouth. The people of Iowa should check \nthis out and see what he said and what he does.\n  So he can come and criticize all he wants--criticize me. But it \nshould be based upon facts, not standing his own statements on their \nhead. He can't have it both ways.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/27/senate-section/article/S1226-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I wish to discuss the ABLE Act, which is \na piece of legislation that has been the subject of enormous and \nsubstantial bipartisan support both in the Senate and in the House.\n  We know that a lot of families have relied upon and have really \nbenefited from the so-called 529 plans--a section of the IRS Code that \nallows families to save tax-free for education. What we are trying to \ndo with the ABLE Act is to replicate that opportunity so that families \nwho have a loved one with a disability--it may be one disability or it \nmay be more than one, but every family who has a loved one with a \ndisability should have the opportunity to save just as they might for \neducation in a tax-free manner, in a tax-advantaged way.\n  We have been working on this legislation for a number of years. \nSenator Richard Burr, the senior Senator from North Carolina, and I \nhave led this effort in the Senate. As I said, it would build upon that \n529 model for education.\n  The ABLE Act enjoys the support of 63 Senators, 63 cosponsors. In the \nHouse, it is up to 335 Members. That is why we mentioned that over 400 \nMembers of Congress agree. That is why the hashtag #passtheABLEact! is \nimportant to highlight.\n  There are few measures which come before the Senate or the House \nwhich enjoy that kind of bipartisan support. In the Senate there are no \nmore than 5 bills that enjoy the support of 63 or more Senators. We are \npleased about that, but we are not done yet. We still have a long way \nto go to get this legislation done.\n  So as important as it is to highlight the numbers, it is also \nimportant to highlight the people who did the hard work to get us \nthere. I want to commend Members of the House and Senate, but the ones \nwho are worthy of even more substantial commendation would be a lot of \nindividuals, some of whom are here in Washington this week: The \nNational Down Syndrome Society. I was just with folks from the National \nDown Syndrome Society this morning over on the House side. They allow a \nSenator to go across to the House side. Our current Presiding Officer \nknows this, as she served there. Once in a while we get to go over \nthere, and they were kind enough to invite us over there this morning. \nThey have done remarkable work on this legislation and are continuing \ntheir advocacy today, even as we speak. We are grateful for their work.\n  Autism Speaks is another great organization that has done enormous \nwork to bring us to where we are today, and the Arc as well. So many \nAmericans know a lot about the Arc, the National Down Syndrome Society, \nas well as Autism Speaks. So we are grateful for that support, but we \nstill have a ways to go.\n  One of the best ways to ensure this legislation will get over the \ngoal line--I don't want to use too many football analogies here--but if \nwe are getting close, even if we are in the so-called red zone, we are \nnot in the end zone yet. We have a ways to go. But one of the best ways \nto make sure that happens is to talk about the real people that \nlegislation like this would affect.\n  I mentioned the number of supporters we have, but I didn't mention \nthe full name of the bill: Achieving a Better Life Experience. That is \nwhat the acronym ABLE stands for. But I like to think about it in this \nway as well.\n  I have a constituent, Sara Wolff, who is with us here today. She \nknows the rules don't allow me to indicate where she is today, but she \nis very close by, and she is with us today. I am grateful Sara is with \nus because she is a great example of someone who has a disability but \nis very able. She has a disability, but on a regular basis--hour after \nhour, day after day--she finds a way to overcome her disability or to \nmanage it as best she can. She is a remarkable speaker. She gives as \nmany speeches in a week as I give, and I am an elected official. She is \nwell-known in northeastern Pennsylvania where we live. We live in the \nsame county, but I live in Scranton and she lives in Moscow. She works \nfor the O'Malley & Langan Law Offices. She is a law clerk there.\n  But as smart as she is on the law and these issues, probably the most \nsignificant part of her whole personality is the dynamism she brings to \nissues. She is a dynamic person. She does something few of us do well--\neven people who work here as elected officials--because she knows how \nto engage with people. She knows how to deliver a message. She knows \nhow to be candid and direct but to do it in a way that is engaging and \nwarm and friendly. So once in a while I will take instruction from Sara \nWolff. But even more than that, I take inspiration from her.\n  Sara is someone who is very able and talented and committed, but she \nis among the many Americans--Pennsylvanians in my case--asking us to \npass this legislation so that if a family such as hers wants to begin \nto save to help pay for a whole range of services for an individual \nwith a disability, they can do so in a tax-advantaged environment in \norder to save over time, and do it in a manner that doesn't put them at \na disadvantage from a tax standpoint down the road.\n  So Sara is a great example of why the ABLE Act should pass, and she \nis doing more than her share to make sure that it does pass. So I am \ngrateful to Sara Wolff for doing that, and I am especially grateful to \npeople like Sara, who like a lot of us at some point in our lives have \nto overcome a tragedy. Sara lost her mother Connie not too long ago to \na sudden and rapid illness. But she has been able to deal with that \ntragedy and still help us day in and day out to get the ABLE Act \npassed.\n  I will highlight one more story and then I will conclude. Angie Cain \nis a 28-year-old who lives in Indianapolis, IN, and like Sara Wolff she \nlives with Down syndrome. Angie has five different jobs and works 5 \ndays a week. She works paid positions at Kohl's on Mondays and at the \nYMCA on Fridays. On Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays she volunteers \nfor several organizations, including a hospital, a Down syndrome office \nin Indiana, and the Alzheimer's unit of an assisted living facility.\n  Unfortunately, like so many Americans with disabilities, Angie is \nunable to save enough to cover her future needs--the same problem I \njust highlighted--if we don't change the law with the ABLE Act. Under \ncurrent law, she must have less than $2,000 in assets in order to be \neligible for Supplemental Security Income. That doesn't make a lot of \nsense, and that is one of the reasons we have to change the law. Angie \nis, therefore, forced to limit the amount of money she earns and work \nmultiple paid and volunteer positions in order to benefit from the \nsteady benefits that SSI provides.\n  Angie would like to live independently and, at the same time, she \nknows that she has limitations in that regard because without adequate \nsavings and income, because of the current state of the law, she is \nforced to live with her family. She would like to be independent. That \nis something we all yearn for at some point in our lives. Angie's \nfamily is worried about her living and financial situation, especially \ndown the line, years from now, when\n\n[[Page S1227]]\n\nher family may not be with her any longer.\n  Stories such as Angie Cain's story, the story of Sara Wolff, and \nindividuals across the country like Sara and Angie are the reason we \nhave to pass the ABLE Act. They don't need a lot of help. They need \njust a tool, one tool in their toolbox, to be able to reach down and \nhave the opportunity to have their families save in a way that will \nhelp them down the road.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 19 \npercent of Americans live with one or more disabilities, 12 percent \nlive with severe disabilities, and many of them are unsure about their \nability to cover their basic expenses in the future because they are \nunable to build adequate savings.\n  We talk a lot about how folks should save. We encourage people to \nsave for college. We encourage families to do that, and we encourage \npeople to save for all kinds of things. Just the principle itself--to \nsave and to conserve--is a good one to espouse and to advocate. But we \nhave to give, in this instance, families an opportunity to save for a \nloved one with a disability or, in some cases, more than one \ndisability. So whether it is Sara Wolff or Angie or others, we have to \ngive them an opportunity to do that and give their families that \nopportunity.\n  When you see that number of Members of Congress--400--coming \ntogether, I believe it is not simply a question of whether this will \npass but only a question of when the ABLE Act will pass. I hope that \nwill take place in the next couple of months and that we can get every \nsingle Member of the Senate and House to join us.\n  This is one major thing we could do this year to show the American \npeople we get it when it comes to one challenge that a lot of families \nface.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/27/senate-section/article/S1227-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BETSY SCHMID\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 13 months ago, I inherited an awesome \nresponsibility. In the blink of an eye, I had become Chairman of the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee, a position long held by Senator \nDaniel Inouye.\n  It was daunting to step into the shoes of a member of the ``greatest \ngeneration,'' a Medal of Honor recipient, and one of the most respected \nadvocates for the men and women who serve our country in uniform. It \nwas my good luck that the gavel I inherited came with Betsy Schmid, the \nstaff director of the subcommittee.\n  Betsy first came to the Senate in February 2002, on detail to the \nDefense Subcommittee as a Presidential management intern. While it was \nonly a temporary assignment, I believe Betsy would be the first to tell \nyou that she would have done anything to return.\n  Return she did, joining the Defense Subcommittee as professional \nstaff in March 2003. Over the next 8 years, Betsy served as a budget \nanalyst focusing on some of the largest, most complex, and politically \nsensitive programs in the Department of Defense.\n  After years as an outstanding budget analyst, Chairman Inouye \nappointed Betsy to serve as the staff director of the Subcommittee on \nDefense in February 2011. It is a daunting job. The subcommittee \noversees more than half of the Nation's discretionary budget, plus tens \nof billions more for the costs of overseas conflicts.\n  As staff director, Betsy has done an outstanding job of serving me \nthis year, and Senator Inouye before me. But more importantly, her time \nhere was in service to the Senate, the Nation, and our Armed Forces.\n  During her service, she had been handed the unenviable task of \nreducing the defense budget by scores of billions of dollars.\n  Many said that the cuts could not be made without sacrificing major \ncritical military capabilities, but Betsy and her staff proved them \nwrong. Betsy made the numbers work, and there is no doubt in my mind \nthat our Nation is more secure today because we got many of these \nbudgetary decisions right.\n  This is Betsy Schmid's last week with the Subcommittee on Defense. \nShe has been given an offer that she simply could not refuse. I wish \nher well and know she will contribute in important ways, but we will \nmiss her.\n  During her service in the Senate, she has continued the tradition of \nbipartisanship and putting the men and women of the Armed Forces and \nIntelligence Community first. No one has worked harder to achieve these \ngoals, working late nights, weekends, and more than a few holidays to \nserve her country to the utmost of her considerable abilities.\n  So with this distinguished record of public service, I would like to \nprovide my sincere thanks and congratulations to Elizabeth Lynne \nSchmid. I wish her the very best in her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/27/senate-section/article/S1227-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise today in recognition of Black \nHistory Month.\n  First established in 1976 as part of the U.S. Bicentennial, President \nGerald Ford marked the inaugural Black History Month with a call to \n``honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of black Americans in \nevery area of endeavor throughout our history.''\n  The State of Illinois has played a significant role in this ongoing \nstruggle for justice. President Abraham Lincoln led our Nation through \nits bloodiest war to save the Union, abolish slavery, and begin the \nwork we continue to this day to end discrimination.\n  It was Illinois Senator Paul Douglas who raised the Illinois standard \nand joined in lending support for Hubert Humphrey's call for civil \nrights at the 1948 Democratic Convention. Douglas was a stalwart on \ncivil rights as a Senator, defying filibusters and the wrath of his \ncolleagues to make this principled stand in the 1950s and 1960s.\n  It was Illinois Senator Everett Dirksen who worked with Members of \nboth parties to help pass the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964 50 \nyears ago this July. That Dirksen Senate seat would later be filled by \nthree of the nine African-American Senators who have served in this \nbody--more than any other State in the Nation.\n  In 1992, Carol Moseley Braun became the first and only African-\nAmerican woman to serve in the Senate. In 2004, I was joined here in \nthe Senate by Barack Obama, who would of course go on to become the \nfirst African-American President in American history. Roland Burris \nassumed his seat when President Obama moved into the White House.\n  The Senate has since welcomed Senators Tim Scott of South Carolina, \nMo Cowan of Massachusetts, and Cory Booker of New Jersey. This 113th \nCongress marks the first time that two African-American Senators served \nconcurrently.\n  The Senate is changing to better reflect the diversity of this \nNation, but the pace of that change is painfully slow. Our challenge is \nto shape a nation where America's leaders look like America and where \nthe talents of all people are welcomed.\n  We proudly celebrate the tremendous work of the courageous men and \nwomen who have come before us to make this country a better place. \nDuring this month, as we do throughout the year, America continues to \nfight so that we may all live in a fairer and more equal nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/27/senate-section/article/S1227-3", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1227-S1228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SENATE EMPLOYEES' CHILD CARE CENTER\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I wish to recognize the 30th anniversary \nof a special place in our Senate community--the Senate employees' \nchildcare center. The teachers and administrators at the center are \nsome of the unsung heroes of the Senate, and it is a privilege to be \nable to pay tribute to them today.\n  The Senate employees' childcare center opened its doors on February \n27, 1984, as the result of a small group of Senate employees who came \ntogether as parents to create a childcare program for their children \nthat would best meet the unique needs of Senate employees. Although \noperating out of different buildings, the center has been in continuous \noperation since its opening day. In 1989, the center became the first \nchildcare center in Washington, DC, to receive accreditation by the \nNational Association for the Education of Young Children--a hallmark of \nquality in the child care world--and it has remained accredited ever \nsince.\n  Over the years the center has grown in size and has moved locations \nseveral times, but one thing that has never\n\n[[Page S1228]]\n\nchanged is the center's commitment to excellence. Through the dedicated \nefforts of its administrators and faculty, the center provides an \nexceptional level of care and a top-notch early childhood education \nprogram. While adhering to rigorous standards, the center also remains \na warm and close-knit community. It is now a separate nonprofit \ngoverned by a parent board of directors, and all of the parents \nregularly donate their time and their energy--from organizing the \ncenter's library to washing crib sheets and blankets--to ensure that \nthe center runs smoothly. It is a place where everyone knows every \nchild's name and where children rush in the doors in the morning with \nsmiles on their faces because they know they are going to a place where \nthey will be welcomed, where they will learn, and where they will be \nloved.\n  That loving environment is provided by the people who are truly the \nheart of the Senate childcare center--its teachers. Childcare workers \nperform some of the most difficult and most important jobs in our \nsociety. Their job is far more than feeding, diapering, and keeping \nchildren safe. They help develop young minds in the earliest, most \ncritical developmental years. Childcare workers don't do their jobs for \nthe money, and they often don't get the respect they deserve. They do \ntheir jobs because they love children and they love being a part of \nwatching them grow.\n  The center is blessed with a particularly exceptional faculty--many \nof the teachers have been there for decades. They have watched the \nchildren they have cared for grow up, go to college, get married, and \nhave children of their own, and they are still there with open arms and \nloving hearts for the next generation of children that walk through the \ndoor. Though they are not technically public employees, there is no \ndoubt that they are dedicated public servants who make an invaluable \ncontribution to the Senate community.\n  I want to particularly recognize a few of the most longstanding \nfaculty members at the center. Phyllis Green, the lead teacher in the \ncenter's toddler room, has been with the center all 30 years of its \noperation. Parents describe her as a warm, steady, and nurturing \npresence, who has helped countless children discover the world and gain \nnew skills and new independence. Anyone who can spend 30 years with \ntoddlers is truly a remarkable individual, and I applaud ``Ms. \nPhyllis'' for her years of service. Other teachers with longstanding \nservice include the center's beloved assistant director, Bridgette \nWaters, who is marking her 20th year this year, teachers Janet Green-\nTucker, Joan Middleton, Michelle Buckner, and Rosa Woodard, each of \nwhom has served, or will soon serve, 20 years or more with the center, \nand teachers Pia Corona, Tangela Cassell-Johnson, Andrea Henriques, \nKellie Salley, and Mishele Torbati, each of whom has served, or will \nsoon have served, 10 years or more.\n  I would also like to recognize the 9 years of service provided by the \ncenter's departing director, Christine Schoppe Wauls, who will leave \nour community at the end of the month to enjoy her well-deserved \nretirement. Christine, thank you for your years of service to the \nSenate community. Indeed, the entire faculty and staff of the center \ndeserve our respect and gratitude for the important work that they do \neach day.\n  I have often said that when a staffer signs up to work for the \nSenate, their whole family really signs up for public service. Senate \nfamilies make many sacrifices so that a parent--or sometimes both \nparents--can serve the Senate. For the parents who send their children \nto the Senate childcare center, the difficult balancing act of work and \nfamily is made just a little bit easier.\n  It is a great comfort to Senate staffers to know that their children \nare in such wonderful care. It is a great comfort to us as Senators to \nknow that our staff can do their jobs well without worrying about their \nchildren's safety and well-being. We would be a better country if every \nworking American could have the same kind of security and peace of mind \nwhen they go to work each day.\n  So on this, the 30th anniversary of the Senate employees' childcare \ncenter, I offer my congratulations to the center for achieving this \nimportant milestone and my very best wishes for many more years of \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/27/senate-section/article/S1228-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1228-S1229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO SETH HARRIS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nformer Deputy Secretary of Labor, Seth Harris, who recently left the \nDepartment after nearly 5 years of service. In his time serving as both \nDeputy Secretary and Acting Secretary, Seth was an invaluable asset to \nthe Department. He brought to these positions a deep knowledge of both \nthe agency and labor law, and he made significant contributions to the \nDepartment both as a manager and as a policy expert. Perhaps most \nimportant, he brought to these positions the lifelong passion for \nhelping working families succeed that has been the hallmark of his \nimpressive career.\n  Indeed, this was not Seth's first stint at the Department of Labor. \nHe served for 7 years at the Department during the Clinton \nAdministration, under both Secretaries Robert Reich and Alexis Herman. \nDuring this time, he served as counselor to the Secretary of Labor and \nas Acting Assistant Secretary for Policy, among other roles. He then \nmoved to the academy, where he served as a professor of law at the New \nYork Law School and director of its Labor & Employment Law Programs. \nWhile teaching at the New York Law School, his scholarship often \nfocused on a law that is particularly close to my heart--the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act. While teaching, Seth was also a Senior Fellow at \nthe Life Without Limits Project of the United Cerebral Palsy \nAssociation, and was a member of the National Advisory Commission on \nWorkplace Flexibility. When President Obama took office, Seth again \nanswered the call to serve his country, and was confirmed as the \neleventh United States Deputy Secretary of Labor in May of 2009.\n  I can understand why he wanted to return to the Department. As I have \nsaid on more than one occasion, of all the executive agencies, it may \nbe the Department of Labor that touches the lives of ordinary working \nAmericans the most on a day-to-day basis. The Department of Labor \nensures that every American receives a fair day's pay for a hard day's \nwork, and can come home from work safely each night. It helps ensure \nthat a working mother can stay home to bond with her newborn child and \nstill have a job to return to. It helps workers who have been laid off, \nveterans returning from military service, young people with \ndisabilities entering the workforce and those who develop disabilities \nand are trying to reenter the workforce--it helps all of these workers \nto build new skills and aspire to better opportunities for the future. \nIn addition, the Department helps guarantee that hardworking people who \nhave saved all their lives for retirement can enjoy their golden years \nwith security and peace of mind.\n  Yet, despite this important mission, it is safe to say that when Seth \nand the current leadership team arrived at the Department, it was an \nagency suffering from significant neglect. Enforcement activity was \ndown. Vital regulations to protect workers had been weakened or \nrepealed. The agency faced significant management challenges. Not \nsurprisingly, the morale of the agency's career staff was low.\n  It has been heartening to see this critical agency revitalized under \nthe Obama administration. Enforcement statistics are improving. More \nworkers are getting better training so they can find better jobs. \nEmployee morale at the agency is improving. In short, the Department of \nLabor is doing what it is supposed to be doing, and doing it well. As \nDeputy Secretary--the official responsible for overseeing the day-to-\nday operations of the Department--Seth Harris played a key role in \nhelping the Department meet these challenges.\n  In a message to Department staff upon his departure, Seth shared some \nof the agency's accomplishments over the last 5 years. I wanted to \ninclude this list in the Record, because it is an impressive array of \nachievements. To quote his message:\n\n       Last year, we achieved the lowest workplace fatality rate \n     for miners, the fewest number of miners dying in workplace \n     accidents, and the fewest workplace injuries in\n\n[[Page S1229]]\n\n     mines, ever. Over the last five years, we have twice achieved \n     the lowest rate of fatalities in general industry, ever, \n     including last year. And over the last five years, we \n     achieved the lowest fatality rate in the construction \n     industry, ever.\n       Last year, we conducted the largest number of whistleblower \n     investigations, ever. Last year, we helped more miners who \n     suffered retaliation from their employers for raising health \n     and safety concerns than were helped in the entire second \n     term of the Bush Administration or the entire second term of \n     the Clinton Administration. Black lung that cripples and \n     kills miners will become much, much rarer under a new rule we \n     proposed. Hundreds of deaths and thousands of morbid \n     illnesses will be prevented each year under a new rule we \n     proposed to protect workers from exposure to silica.\n       Over the past 5 years, we have returned more than $1.1 \n     billion in wages to the workers from whom they had been \n     stolen. We conducted the largest number of directed Davis-\n     Bacon investigations, ever. And we did the best job, ever, of \n     targeting our wage and hour investigations to the workplaces \n     that had violations, even when the workers felt too \n     threatened and too disempowered to complain. We expanded \n     minimum wage and overtime protections to nearly 2 million \n     home health aides. The people who care for us when we need \n     them most will now get the most basic of worker protections.\n       Last year, we conducted the largest number of pension and \n     health plan investigations over the past five years. During \n     that same period, we recovered more than $1.3 billion in \n     pension and health plan benefits for more than 710,000 \n     participants and beneficiaries through informal resolutions. \n     We also promulgated almost two dozen rules with our \n     colleagues at Treasury and HHS to implement the President's \n     historic health care law.\n       Last year, we assured that the largest percentage of \n     workers exiting Labor Department job training programs got \n     industry-recognized credentials. We also helped hundreds of \n     community colleges work with employers to give tens of \n     thousands of workers skills that employers need right now and \n     will need for years to come. We expanded eligibility for the \n     Trade Adjustment Assistance and unemployment insurance under \n     the President's Recovery Act. And we nursed all 53 \n     jurisdictions administering UI programs through the worst \n     unemployment crisis in seven decades.\n       Last year, we did the best job, ever, of targeting the very \n     small number of union officers and staff who embezzle funds \n     or engage in fraud. We also achieved near record efficiency \n     in concluding investigations of union elections despite the \n     fewest resources available ever.\n       Over the past five years, we have stripped away a mountain \n     of bureaucratic and legal barriers that kept our civil rights \n     agency from finding and remedying discrimination. And we are \n     finding and fixing pay discrimination, in particular, at an \n     accelerating rate. We changed the law so that hundreds of \n     thousands more people with disabilities and veterans will get \n     jobs with federal contractors every year.\n       Last year, we helped the highest percentage of federal \n     employees with disabilities on workers compensation to return \n     to work since we started keeping records on this activity. We \n     also processed workers compensation claims for longshore \n     workers and energy employees at the fastest clip, ever.\n       We have done the best job, ever, of managing the taxpayers' \n     money entrusted to the Labor Department's care. We have had \n     five consecutive years of clean financial audits, and these \n     last two years, we had no material deficiencies in our \n     financial audit. We replaced a 25-year-old financial \n     management system that put us out of compliance with just \n     about every law with a new cloud-based financial management \n     system that helps us comply with every law, and balance our \n     books, and spend the taxpayers' money responsibly.\n       Last year, we did the best job, ever, of paying our bills \n     on time, and we paid the smallest amount of interest for late \n     payments, ever. We paid our small business contractors faster \n     than ever. And the percentage of contracting we are doing \n     with small businesses is the highest, ever.\n       We accomplished all of this by taking seriously President \n     Obama's direction to engage in evidence-based, data-driven \n     management.\n       The Government Accountability Office recently conducted a \n     survey of all managers in 24 executive branch departments and \n     agencies at the GS-13 level and higher. GAO asked these \n     federal managers a long list of questions that amounted to, \n     ``does your agency or department use evidence-based, data-\n     driven decision making?'' The Labor Department beat all 24 \n     federal agencies that were part of the survey. We lead the \n     federal government in Obama-style evidence-based, data-driven \n     management.\n\n  This impressive list of accomplishments reflects an agency that is \nback on track. It is a testament to the hard work of Secretary Solis, \nSecretary Perez, Seth Harris, the DOL leadership team, and the \ndedicated career staff that work for the agency across the country.\n  While he has moved on to new challenges in his professional life, our \nNation owes a great debt of gratitude to Seth Harris for his leadership \nand for his passionate dedication to helping working families. I know \nSeth's work on these issues is far from done, and I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with him in his new roles in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/27/senate-section/article/S1229-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1229-S1230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JEAN MANNING\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, Jean Manning is synonymous with the \nOffice of the Senate Chief Counsel for Employment. Since establishing \nthe Office in 1993 at the direction of the Joint Leadership, Ms. \nManning has provided invaluable counsel to Senate offices to ensure \ntheir compliance with applicable employment laws, including the Equal \nPay Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and numerous \nother laws Congress applied to itself when it passed the Government \nEmployee Rights Act of 1991 and the Congressional Accountability Act of \n1995. Now, after decades of service to the Senate, Jean is retiring. \nWhile her retirement is much deserved after a long career, her wise \ncounsel will be missed throughout this great institution.\n  Ms. Manning, who originally hails from Chicago, began her career as \nshe now ends her career--with public service. After receiving a B.A. in \n1972 from the University of Illinois, she took on the important role of \neducating junior high school students. Ms. Manning left teaching to \nfurther her education, obtaining an M.B.A. and a J.D. from the \nUniversity of Illinois. While pursuing her law degree, Ms. Manning was \na member and Articles Editor of the University of Illinois Law Review, \nin which she published an article about using multiple regression \nanalysis to assess and remedy salary inequity between men and women, a \nsubject about which she has always been passionate. Also while in law \nschool, Ms. Manning was awarded the Rickert Award for Excellence in \nLegal Writing, an honor that anyone who has reviewed Ms. Manning's \nexceptional legal writing will know was well deserved.\n  Following her graduation from law school in 1983, Ms. Manning began \nher legal career in the great State of California, where she honed her \nlegal skills as a labor and employment law litigator at several \nprestigious national law firms. Although she eventually moved to the \nEast Coast in 1992, Ms. Manning still considers California her home. \nShe returns to California several times each year to visit friends and \nfamily. In retirement, she plans to live in northern California during \npart of each year.\n  In the early 1990s, Congress as a workplace underwent a sea change \nwhen all major employment laws became applicable to Congress. The Joint \nLeadership selected Jean Manning as the Senate's first Chief Counsel \nfor Employment to establish and to manage the Office of the Senate \nChief Counsel for Employment. Ms. Manning's goal was to create a \nnonpartisan, legal defense office in the Senate that would provide top-\ntier legal advice and representation to all Senators and Senate offices \nin the area of labor and employment law. Ms. Manning has far exceeded \nher goal. The office she established has a stellar reputation \nthroughout the Senate. On a daily basis, the Office of the Senate Chief \nCounsel for Employment advises and trains all Senate offices of their \nobligations under employment laws. Every year, the Office presents over \n70 legal seminars within the Senate to ensure that Senate managers \nunderstand and adhere to all employment laws when managing their \noffices.\n  Ms. Manning also has tirelessly represented Senate employing offices \nat all levels of the Federal court system, including arguing before the \nUnited States Supreme Court. It is a testament to the high standards \nshe set for herself and her entire office that, since its inception 21 \nyears ago, the Office of the Senate Chief Counsel for Employment has \nnever lost a case.\n  Throughout her Senate career, Ms. Manning has provided Senators, \nofficers and Senate employing offices with unfailingly sound legal \nadvice--even at times when she knew her advice might be unpopular. We \nthank her for her exceptional service to the Senate. The Senate is \nlosing a great legal advocate, educator and source of institutional \nknowledge. The Senate is a better place for Ms. Manning's outstanding \nservice, and she will be missed.\n\n[[Page S1230]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/27/senate-section/article/S1230-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO VIRGINIA RENEE SIMPSON\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today to recognize the \ndedicated career and service to the Congress and the Nation of Renee \nSimpson, who is retiring at the end of this month after over 30 years \nof service in both the Executive and Legislative branches of our \ngovernment. She has dedicated her life to public service helping keep \nour Nation and its citizens secure, and we honor her for her \nlongstanding dedication.\n  Renee is leaving the Senate as a staff member for Audits and \nOversight of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. During her 3 \nyears on the Committee, Renee has been integral to the committee's \noversight of the 16 intelligence agencies. She led reviews of the \nintelligence community's information technology modernization and \nclassification processes, and served as a committee liaison with the \ninspectors general of the intelligence community. Her knowledge and \ninsight helped both identify items of concern and proposals for \nimprovement.\n  In addition to her service with the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence and the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on \nAppropriations, Renee has served as a Legislative Affairs Officer in \nthe Office of the Director of National Intelligence and as the Special \nSenate Liaison for the United States Marine Corps Office of Legislative \nAffairs. But perhaps her most significant assignments and \naccomplishments came during her 24 years of service with the U.S. Naval \nReserves.\n  Ms. Simpson's distinguished military career began as an Operations \nand Readiness Officer for Desert Shield/Desert Storm and her unwavering \ncommitment to service led her to posts around the world, including to \nNATO's Allied Forces Southern Headquarters Command, the U.S. Embassy in \nRome, Italy, the Joint Task Force in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, U.S. Joint \nForces Command, and the Office of the Director of Naval Intelligence in \nWashington, DC.\n  Renee has received numerous awards for her military service including \nthe Defense Superior Service Medal as well as many Navy and Marine \nCorps Commendation and Achievement Medals.\n  Renee is especially close to her family and her priorities and heart \nlie with them in Sanford, NC. Her father, Lester Ray Simpson, is a \nproud Navy veteran of the Korean War who has an appreciation of fine \nattire with just the right bow tie. Her mom, Vivian, remains Renee's \nunending inspiration and role model. And according to Renee, her \nsister, Jane Rae Fawcett, is ``a superstar and the smartest, funniest \nperson I know.'' Finally, her family simply would not be complete \nwithout her anchor of a brother-in-law, Deputy Sheriff Ed Fawcett. \nRenee lives, breathes and loves her family above all else.\n  I am pleased to have the opportunity to publicly thank Renee and to \nnote my appreciation for her dedicated and dignified efforts. We will \nmiss your insight and experience, and your commitment to pursuing the \nright policies to protect our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/27/senate-section/article/S1230-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE SUBCOMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW.

Madam President, no family should be forced to endure the \nloss of a child. In his memoir, President Dwight Eisenhower wrote that \nthe loss of his 3-year-old son in early 1921 was ``the greatest \ndisappointment and disaster in my life, the one that I have never been \nable to forget completely.'' That is why one of the fundamental \nexpectations that Americans have of their government is also one of the \nmost simple: to protect America's children; to ensure that our \ncommunities, our streets, and our families are safe.\n  But sadly, Congress has done little to combat the gun violence that \ncontinues to devastate American children and families. Many have \ncharacterized horrific shootings affecting children in our Nation, such \nas the one which occurred in Newtown, CT, as somehow separate from \nmainstream American society. But recent studies have shown that such \nincidents cannot be viewed in a vacuum. Instead, as a recent Yale \nUniversity study has established, they are part of a wider, disturbing \ntrend of gun violence wounding and killing American children. This \nstudy found that every day in the United States, around 20 children \nsustain firearm injuries serious enough to require hospitalization. In \n6 percent of those cases, the wounds prove to be fatal. Three quarters \nof child hospitalizations examined by the study were the result of \nunintentional or accidental injuries, often cases of children playing \nwith an unsecured firearm.\n  The study's rigorous clinical framework, combined with the reality \nthat it is discussing children, makes for jarring reading. The \nresearchers found, for example, that the most common firearm-inflicted \ninjuries on children are open wounds, fractures, and internal injuries \nto the thorax, abdomen, or pelvis. Injuries to the nerves or spinal \ncord are also frequent. Traumatic brain injury resulting from gun \nviolence is most often found in children younger than 5. These are not \nstatistics of soldiers on a battlefield who volunteered to face danger. \nThese are innocent children, in our communities, right here at home.\n  This cycle of violence touches families around our Nation. Like in \nDetroit, where a recent Detroit News investigation showed that nearly \n500 Detroit children have died in homicides since 2000, mostly as the \nresult of gun violence. That investigation cited, as an example, the \nstory of 12-year-old Kenis Green Jr. Last August, he was shot and \nkilled on his front porch during his uncle's birthday party. In Texas, \nlast October a 5-year-old boy shot himself with a .40 caliber pistol \nthat his babysitter left unattended when she went to take a nap. In \nSouth Carolina, last December a 15-year-old boy accidentally shot and \nkilled a 12-year-old while loading a magazine into a firearm.\n  If almost anything in the world was responsible for sending 20 \nAmerican children to the hospital every day, or was frequently involved \nin teenage suicides, or was inflicting traumatic brain injuries on \ntoddlers, Congress would spring into action to address what can only be \ndescribed as a public health crisis. We would enact comprehensive \nsafety standards to stop the bloodshed. But when firearms are \nresponsible for these horrific effects, inexplicably, we do nothing.\n  I urge my colleagues to recognize this crisis and to act to protect \nour children from gun violence. I urge my colleagues to take up and \npass gun safety measures already pending in this Congress to keep \nfirearms out of\n\n[[Page S1231]]\n\nthe wrong hands and to make our society safer. We owe our children \nnothing less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/27/senate-section/article/S1231-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BROWN UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, today I want to recognize an extraordinary \nuniversity, deeply rooted in the history of Rhode Island, Brown \nUniversity. Brown is celebrating its 250th anniversary. Brown \nUniversity's founding in 1764 makes it the seventh oldest institution \nof higher education in the United States, predating even the American \nRevolution. The university originally began as a small school located \nin Warren, RI, known as the College of Rhode Island. As Brown grew, it \nmoved to College Hill in Providence in 1770, where it has thrived to \nthis day and was renamed a few years later to acknowledge a $5,000 gift \nfrom Nicholas Brown, a member of the class of 1786.\n  Since its founding, Brown University has played an important role in \nRhode Island and our Nation's history. Indeed, it was the first Ivy \nLeague institution to admit students of all religions. Brown remains \ncommitted to diversity and access. Over 20 years ago, Brown established \nthe Leadership Alliance, a national academic consortium of leading \nresearch universities and minority-serving institutions with the \nmission to develop underrepresented students into outstanding leaders \nand role models in academia, business, and the public sector. Brown \nstands out for its willingness to openly delve into its past while \nstaying focused on the future, and it has made a vital commitment to \ncollege access through its need-blind admissions policy, ensuring that \nno student admitted to Brown will be turned away for financial reasons.\n  Brown established a truly student-driven curriculum--the Brown \nCurriculum--in 1970 to allow students to personalize their course of \nstudy. In an effort to continue its edge in innovation, Brown launched \nits Plan for Academic Enrichment in 2002 to help transform the fields \nof research, education, and public leadership. Fiscal year 2013 saw the \nUniversity conduct more than $170 million in sponsored research, \nhelping the Rhode Island economy and making new discoveries that can \nimprove lives.\n  The commitment of Brown's alumni to public service is also \nparticularly noteworthy and admirable. According to a 2013 article by \nWashington Monthly, Brown ranks fifth among national universities and \nfirst in the Ivy League for the number of alumni working in public \nservice. Some of the Brown alumni currently playing important roles in \nthe public sphere include Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, U.S. \nSecretary of Labor Thomas Perez, and World Bank President Dr. Jim Yong \nKim. Through this commitment to service, members of the Brown community \ncontinue to find ways to improve the quality of life for people across \nRhode Island, the Nation, and the world.\n  I am proud of the talented men and women who have contributed to the \nsuccess of Brown University over these past 250 years. I congratulate \nChristina Paxson, Brown's 19th president, the students, the Brown \nCorporation, and the entire Brown community on this significant \nmilestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/27/senate-section/article/S1231-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JEFF TEAGUE\n\n Mr. PRYOR.

A bill to provide for the repeal of certain provisions of \nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that have the effect of \nrationing health care; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss \nObamaCare provisions that should be keeping my colleagues and all \nAmericans up at night. Obviously, my views are very different from my \ncolleagues who have just propounded their views on the same subject.\n  Unfortunately, since the implementation of ObamaCare began, the \nstories and reports have only confirmed the many warnings that I and \nmany of my colleagues made during the debate. Most of the stories \nKansans tell me now involve many hundreds of dollars in increases in \nmonthly premiums or people simply losing their coverage. These are real \nstories from real Kansans, and they are not lies.\n  Compounding the problem, this administration has made it a routine \npractice to do what we call a regulations dump on Friday. This is a \ndeliberate posting of sometimes thousands of pages of regulations \nduring the time when the American public and the press is least likely \nto be paying attention.\n  Most recent reports from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices--what we call CMS--are that millions of small businesses will \nface increased premium rates under ObamaCare. The President promised to \nmake it easier for small businesses to offer coverage and, lo and \nbehold, it may even become impossible for them to do so.\n  Then there are the cuts our seniors are about to face to their \nMedicare plans. We can't forget that the President pilfered--that is a \ngood word, pilfered--$1 trillion from Medicare to pay for ObamaCare. \nThese cuts have been delayed, but the most recent regulation on Part D \nand Medicare Advantage will be extremely detrimental to seniors' access \nto the availability of Medicare plans. And because of this, for once--\nfor once--I wish to speak about a subject where we get ahead of the \ncurve, get in front of the next disaster, and repeal specific \nprovisions of this law that I think will be most harmful to patients.\n  I have talked before about how this law comes between patients and \ndoctors, but I think we need to bring more attention to the specter of \nwhat I call rationing--yes, rationing. In the absence of complete \nrepeal, I urge my colleagues that these provisions must be repealed.\n  During the health care reform debate, and many times since then, I \nhave spoken at length about rationing. Specifically, I want people to \nknow about what I refer to as the four rations that are included in \nObamaCare. Yes, this is a very real threat. And, yes, they will ration \ncare.\n  Let me start with something called the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services Innovation Center. That is a pretty big, fancy \ngovernment name. The Center has an enormous budget to match, aimed at \nfinding innovative ways to reform payment and the delivery of health \ncare. That sounds very good, but what this means is that the \n``innovation center'' can now use taxpayer dollars to invest in ways to \nreduce patient access to care.\n  Let me say that again. The government can now use taxpayer dollars to \ninvest in ways to reduce patient access to care. It gives the \ngovernment new powers to cut payments to Medicare beneficiaries with \nthe goal to reduce program expenditures. The reality is they are going \nto reduce patients' ability to access the care they want and need--all \nhidden under the cloak of innovation. And that isn't innovation at all. \nEven if they did give it a fancy title, folks, it is smoke and mirrors. \nThis outfit is already pushing out all of the regulations to implement \nObamaCare that are now hurting patients--all the regulations we hear \nabout from our health care providers.\n  Let me move to the second ration. It grants new authorities to the \nU.S. Preventive Services Task Force--that is another nice-sounding \nentity with a long title. This Preventive Services Task Force used to \nbe a body that was scientific and academic, that reviewed treatment, \ntesting, and prevention information, and made recommendations for \nprimary doctors. Nothing is wrong with that. It used to be an academic \nbody that made recommendations, not a body pushing through mandates and \nregulations. Many would argue that is still what they do today. \nHowever, the effect of their recommendations is they are significantly \nmore costly and burdensome. Because of ObamaCare, the task force can \nnow decide what should and, more importantly, should not be covered by \nhealth plans. That is not prevention, that is rationing. If the task \nforce doesn't recommend it, then it won't be covered by health plans \nand patients bear the cost of the procedure. We are seeing this already \nwith things such as prostate exams and mammograms for breast cancer \nwhich have been so helpful to so many people--saved their lives.\n  The third rationer is the Patient Centered Outcomes Research \nInstitute. Yes, that is another mouthful. This is the outfit that was \ngiven millions and millions of dollars to do comparative effectiveness \nresearch. I am not opposed to research. I don't know anyone in this \nbody who is opposed to research, especially when it is used to inform \nthe conversation between doctors\n\n[[Page S1236]]\n\nand their patients. But there is a reason this was formerly called \ncost-effective research. There is a very fine line between providing \ninformation to doctors and patients to determine the best course of \ncare and using that information to decide whether the care or treatment \nis worth paying for. I have long been concerned that instead this \nresearch will be abused to arbitrarily deny patients access to \npotentially lifesaving treatments or services. That simply should not \nhappen. The research should only be used for the doctor and the patient \nto make the best health care decision.\n  Finally, the fourth rationer--my personal nemesis--the Independent \nPayment Advisory Board--IPAD. This is a board made up of 15 unelected \nbureaucrats who will decide what gets to stay and what gets to go in \nMedicare coverage. They will decide which treatments and services will \nbe covered and which will not, with no accountability whatsoever.\n  When proposed, supporters of the health care law told me: We are too \nclose to our constituents. It is too difficult to make the hard \ndecisions.\n  Then they said: Let's have somebody else do it.\n  That was during the debate with regard to IPAD.\n  I couldn't believe it. I believe we are elected to make the hard \ndecisions and take care of the hard votes, and I believe that is the \nway Kansans want it, and I think that is the way virtually everybody in \nevery other State wants it. This board diminishes our constitutional \nresponsibility.\n  Even worse is the fine print of the Independent Payment Advisory \nBoard, or IPAD. If Kansans or any Americans determine they do not like \nthe direction the board is taking and they call my office and, down the \nroad, any other office of any other distinguished Senator to ask me to \ndo something about it--which is what you get when you go back home on \nany regulation today: what are you going to do about it?--it will take \n60 votes in the Senate to overturn their decision--60.\n  On the surface this sounds OK until you realize that the President \ndoubtless will never support Congress overturning the recommendation of \nthis board made up of his bureaucrats. So he will veto it, and \noverriding a veto, obviously, takes a two-thirds vote. That is 66 votes \nto overturn a decision by the payment board.\n  My colleagues have been changing the rules around here because they \nthink 60 votes is too high a threshold. What are the chances of \nreaching 66? But wait. There is even more. If the Secretary appoints a \nboard unable to make recommendations for cuts to Medicare--tough \ndecisions, albeit--then she gets the authority to make the decision of \nwhat to cut, one person.\n  This President has already cut $\\1/2\\ trillion from Medicare to pay \nfor ObamaCare and gave himself the ability to go after even more \nMedicare dollars and have no accountability. This, my friends, is \nfrightening; it is ridiculous; it is irresponsible; but it is not new.\n  I have been talking about the four rationers for a long time and what \nit means to patients, especially senior patients.\n  What upsets me, scares me, as I watch all the other warnings and \nbroken promises come true, is what is going to happen to Kansans and \nall the folks back home when the warnings about the four rationers come \ntrue.\n  We need to protect the all-important doctor-patient relationship, \nwhich the four rationers put at risk. That is why today I come to the \nfloor to introduce the Four Rationers Repeal Act of 2014.\n  For once, look beyond the current troubles we are experiencing. We \nhave to get ahead of the curve. This legislation repeals the \nIndependent Payment Advisory Board; it repeals the euphemistically but \nmisleadingly named Innovation Center; it repeals the changes made to \nthe Preventive Services Task Force; and it makes sure any--any--\ncomparative effectiveness research, called CER, is used by the doctor \nand patient, not coverage providers or CMS, to determine the best care \nfor patients.\n  This legislation is relatively simple. It should be supported by all \nof my colleagues to address some of the egregious changes from \nObamaCare that are about to happen just around the bend. It is time to \nget ahead of the curve this time, prevent it.\n  I really believe that in order to protect this all-important doctor-\npatient relationship, we need to repeal and, most importantly, replace \nObamaCare with the real reforms that work for Kansans and all \nAmericans.\n  However, in the meantime we can also start taking it down, piece by \npiece, which is what my Four Rationers Repeal Act does. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this proposal. For once, let's get ahead of the \ncurve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 2065. A bill to create incentives for the development of \nalternative fuel vehicles; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I join with Senator Inhofe to \nintroduce a bill to incentivize the production and use of alternative \nfuel vehicles, including natural gas vehicles, NGVs, and plug-in-\nelectric hybrids. Encouraging the production of alternative fuel \nvehicles will help to diversify our fuel mix, while reducing our \nreliance on imported oil and also reducing carbon emissions. In the \nU.S. alone, NGVs offset the use of nearly 360 million gallons of \ngasoline in 2011. We hope our bill will help increase that number.\n  The moment is right to capitalize on the abundance of domestically \nsourced natural gas. Already, American manufacturers have benefited \nfrom the availability of domestically produced natural gas, reducing \nthe cost of US-based production and contributing to the return of \nmanufacturing to the United States. If we can expand the use of natural \ngas to fuel our vehicles, then American consumers can also benefit from \nthis cleaner and cheaper domestic fuel.\n  Michigan has become a leading innovator in advanced alternative fuel \nvehicles and is revolutionizing our transportation sector. As \nautomakers in Michigan and elsewhere manufacture NGVs they face the \ndilemma often encountered when introducing an alternative fueled \nvehicle: what will come first, the NGV infrastructure or the vehicle \nitself? This is the classic chicken and egg question. Ethanol, Diesel \nand electric vehicles all faced this challenge when first introduced. \nOur bill will allow Michigan to continue to innovate and harness the \npower and benefits that domestically sourced alternative fuels have to \noffer this country.\n  The benefits of expanding the number of natural gas and alternative \nfuel vehicles on our roads are numerous. Up to 90 percent of the \nnatural gas used in the United States comes from the United States. We \nneed to tap into this domestic resource for our transportation needs \nand take an aggressive approach to reducing our dependence on foreign \noil. Consumers should also have more choice and flexibility when it \ncomes to fueling their vehicles. This bill allows for that. At the \nmoment natural gas is about half the price of gasoline. Consumers \nshould be able to benefit from these reduced prices. Furthermore, \nvehicles running on natural gas have 20-30 percent less CO2 \ntailpipe emissions than gasoline fueled vehicles. Because natural gas \nburns cleaner, it increases the life of the car. It has no lead or \nbenzene or other chemicals that break down auto parts or dilute \nlubricants.\n  These are all desirable reasons to encourage more NGV production. The \nuse of natural gas vehicles is expanding among private fleets used by \nairports and transit agencies where refueling infrastructure is \navailable. However, the chicken and egg dilemma is slowing the adoption \nof both dedicated and bi-fuel natural gas vehicles among light-duty \npassenger vehicles.\n  Our legislation would incentivize both production and consumer demand \nfor alternative fuel vehicles such as natural gas vehicles and plug-in \nelectric hybrids by expanding regulatory incentives. It would also \nprovide consumers with an added incentive to drive natural gas vehicles \nby giving them access to high occupancy vehicle, HOV, lanes. Giving \nconsumers an additional benefit such as HOV access could help increase \ndemand for these vehicles and the fueling stations that are necessary \nto support them.\n  The President outlined in his State of the Union his goal to achieve \nenergy independence through the use of alternative fuels. He \nspecifically mentioned natural gas as the bridge fuel that can\n\n[[Page S1237]]\n\ngrow our economy, create jobs for the middle class, and reduce carbon \npollution. I am pleased to introduce legislation today that takes a \nstep toward meeting that goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/27/senate-section/article/S1237-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 364--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE INTERNAL REBUILDING, \nRESETTLEMENT, AND RECONCILIATION WITHIN SRI LANKA THAT ARE NECESSARY TO \n                         ENSURE A LASTING PEACE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. \nBlunt, Mr. Manchin, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Crapo, Ms. Collins, \nand Mr. Enzi) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations :\n\n                              S. Res. 364\n\n       Whereas May 19, 2014, marks the five-year anniversary of \n     the end of the 26 year civil war between the Liberation \n     Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the Government of Sri Lanka;\n       Whereas the people of Sri Lanka suffered greatly as a \n     result of this conflict, the impact and aftermath of which \n     has been felt by all, especially by women, children, and \n     families;\n       Whereas the Government of Sri Lanka established a ``Lessons \n     Learnt and Reconciliation Commission'' (LLRC) to report \n     whether any person, group, or institution directly or \n     indirectly bears responsibility for incidents that occurred \n     between February 2002 and May 2009 and to recommend measures \n     to prevent the recurrence of such incidents in the future and \n     promote further national unity and reconciliation among all \n     communities;\n       Whereas the LLRC report was presented to the Sri Lankan \n     Parliament on December 16, 2011, and officially translated \n     into Sinhala and Tamil on August 16, 2012;\n       Whereas the LLRC report acknowledges important events and \n     grievances that have contributed to decades of political \n     violence and war in Sri Lanka and makes constructive \n     recommendations on a wide range of issues, including the need \n     to credibly investigate widespread allegations of \n     extrajudicial killings; enforced disappearances; intentional \n     targeting of civilians and noncombatants; demilitarizing the \n     north and the country as a whole; reaching a political \n     settlement with minority communities on the meaningful \n     decentralization of power; and promoting and protecting the \n     right to freedom of expression for all through the enactment \n     of a right to information law and additional rule of law \n     reforms;\n       Whereas the Government of Sri Lanka developed the National \n     Plan of Action to implement the recommendations of the LLRC \n     and has made significant progress within limited time in the \n     implementation of the National Plan of Action, notably in the \n     areas of demining, rehabilitation of ex-combatants, \n     resettlement of displaced persons, improvements of \n     infrastructure and social services in the North and East, as \n     well as investigations into complaints regarding persons who \n     have disappeared during the war;\n       Whereas there have been reports of attacks on places of \n     worship and restrictions on the media in several places in \n     Sri Lanka;\n       Whereas the Government of Sri Lanka expressed its \n     commitment to address the needs of all ethnic groups and has \n     recognized the necessity of a political settlement and \n     reconciliation for a peaceful and just society, which is a \n     long-term process that will need to be driven by the people \n     of Sri Lanka themselves;\n       Whereas the September 21, 2013, elections in Sri Lanka for \n     the Northern, Central, and North Western Provincial Councils \n     were an important step in fulfilling this commitment;\n       Whereas these elections were made possible through a \n     sustained effort by the Government of Sri Lanka to restore \n     infrastructure in the North and put in place a system for the \n     conduct of the elections;\n       Whereas the elections allowed the people of the North of \n     Sri Lanka to exercise their political rights that had been \n     withheld from them for more than 20 years by the Liberation \n     Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and resulted in a clear victory \n     for the provincial wing of the Tamil National Alliance;\n       Whereas Sri Lanka is enjoying rapid economic growth as an \n     important hub for shipping transport, technology, and tourism \n     in the South Asia region;\n       Whereas Sri Lanka is of great strategic importance to the \n     United States, due to its location, deep-water ports, and \n     proximity to the world's busiest shipping lanes, an \n     importance noticed and pursued by other significant powers;

Res. 366\n\n       Whereas multiple sclerosis (MS) can impact people of all \n     ages, races, and ethnicities;\n       Whereas MS is 2 to 3 times more common in women than in \n     men;\n       Whereas while MS is not directly inherited, studies show \n     there are genetic and, probably, environmental, ethnic, and \n     geographic factors that make certain individuals more \n     susceptible to the disease;\n       Whereas worldwide, there are approximately 2,300,000 people \n     who have been diagnosed with MS;\n       Whereas MS is typically diagnosed between the ages of 20 \n     and 50, however, it is estimated that between 8,000 and \n     10,000 children and adolescents in the United States are \n     living with MS;\n       Whereas MS is an unpredictable neurological disease that \n     interrupts the flow of information within the brain and \n     between the brain and the rest of the body;\n       Whereas symptoms of MS range from numbness and tingling in \n     the extremities to blindness and paralysis, and the progress, \n     severity, and specific symptoms of MS in any affected \n     individual cannot yet be predicted;\n       Whereas there is no single laboratory test available that \n     provides a definitive diagnosis for MS;\n       Whereas the exact cause of MS is still unknown, and there \n     is no cure;\n       Whereas the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition, a national \n     network of independent organizations dedicated to enhancing \n     quality of life for all those affected by MS, recognizes and \n     supports Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week during March of \n     every year;\n       Whereas the mission of the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition is \n     to enhance cooperation among organizations to provide greater \n     benefits to individuals and families affected by MS;\n       Whereas the goals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week are \n     to invite people to join the movement to end MS, encourage \n     people to demonstrate their commitment to moving toward a \n     world free from MS, and acknowledge those who have dedicated \n     their time and talent to advancing MS research and programs; \n     and\n       Whereas this year Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week is \n     being recognized during the week of March 3, 2014, through \n     March 9, 2014: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of Multiple Sclerosis \n     Awareness Week;\n       (2) supports promoting awareness of individuals who are \n     affected by multiple sclerosis;\n       (3) encourages States, localities, and the territories and \n     possessions of the United States to support the goals and \n     ideals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week by issuing \n     proclamations designating March 3, 2014, through March 9, \n     2014, as Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week;\n       (4) commends the efforts of States, localities, and the \n     territories and possessions of the United States to support \n     the goals and ideals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week;\n       (5) encourages media organizations to participate in \n     Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week by educating the public \n     about multiple sclerosis;\n       (6) recognizes and reaffirms the commitment of the United \n     States to ending multiple sclerosis by supporting multiple \n     sclerosis research and education programs;\n       (7) supports all individuals in the United States living \n     with multiple sclerosis;\n       (8) expresses gratitude to the family and friends of \n     individuals living with multiple sclerosis, who are a source \n     of love and encouragement to those individuals; and\n       (9) salutes the health care professionals and medical \n     researchers who--\n       (A) provide assistance to individuals affected by multiple \n     sclerosis; and\n       (B) continue to work towards finding new ways to stop the \n     progression of the disease, treat its symptoms, and end \n     multiple sclerosis forever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/27/senate-section/article/S1238-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 367--DESIGNATING MARCH 3, 2014, AS ``READ ACROSS \n                             AMERICA DAY''\n\n  Mr. REED (for himself and Ms. Collins) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Con. Res. 33\n\n       Whereas May 8, 2014, marks the centennial of the enactment \n     of the Smith-Lever Act (7 U.S.C. 341 et seq.), which \n     established the Cooperative Extension System, the nationwide \n     transformative education system operating through land-grant \n     colleges and universities (as defined in section 1404 of the \n     National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching \n     Policy Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 3103)) in partnership with \n     Federal, State, and local governments;\n       Whereas Senator Michael Hoke Smith of Georgia and \n     Representative Asbury Francis Lever of South Carolina \n     authored the Smith-Lever Act (7 U.S.C. 341 et seq.) to bring \n     the research-based knowledge of land-grant colleges and \n     universities to individuals where the individuals live and \n     work;\n       Whereas the first section of the Smith-Lever Act (7 U.S.C. \n     341) states that the purpose of the Act is ``to aid in \n     diffusing among the people of the United States useful and \n     practical information on subjects relating to agriculture, \n     uses of solar energy with respect to agriculture, home \n     economics, and rural energy, and to encourage the application \n     of the same'' through extension work carried out by the land-\n     grant colleges and universities;\n       Whereas cooperative extension work is a critical component \n     of the three-part mission of the land-grant colleges and \n     universities to work collaboratively with research \n     institutions, in particular the State agriculture experiment \n     stations and 106 colleges and universities, in each State of \n     the United States, the District of Columbia, and each \n     territory or possession of the United States, including--\n       (1) part B institutions (as defined in section 322 of the \n     Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1061));\n       (2) 1994 Institutions (as defined in section 532 of the \n     Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status Act of 1994 (7 U.S.C. \n     301 note;

and\n       (3) reduce the expenditures of Federal and State assistance \n     programs;\n       Whereas educational activities carried out under the Smith-\n     Lever Act (7 U.S.C. 341 et seq.) provide rapid response to \n     disasters and emergencies, such as through the Extension \n     Disaster Education Network and other similar efforts, by \n     providing real-time alerts and resources so that educators \n     can respond to urgent needs resulting from hurricanes, \n     floods, oil spills, fire, drought, pest outbreaks, and \n     infectious diseases affecting humans, livestock, and crops;\n       Whereas cooperative extension activities translate science-\n     based research for practical application through local and \n     online learning networks in which educators are uniquely \n     available to identify emerging research questions, connect \n     with land-grant college or university faculty to find \n     answers, and encourage the application of the findings of \n     that research to improve economic and social conditions;\n       Whereas cooperative extension activities engage with rural \n     and urban learners through practical, community-based, and \n     online approaches resulting in the acquisition of the \n     knowledge, skills, and motivation necessary to strengthen the \n     profitability of animal and plant production systems, protect \n     natural resources, help individuals make healthy lifestyle \n     choices, ensure a safe and abundant food supply, encourage \n     community vitality, and grow the next generation of leaders; \n     and\n       Whereas many States are celebrating the centennial of the \n     enactment of the Smith-Lever Act (7 U.S.C. 341 et seq.) with \n     resolutions and proclamations, and many land-grant colleges \n     and universities are also commemorating the enactment of that \n     historic Act: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the significance of the Smith-Lever Act (7 \n     U.S.C. 341 et seq.) to the establishment of the Cooperative \n     Extension System;\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     and celebrate the centennial with a focus on launching an \n     innovative and sustainable future for the Cooperative \n     Extension System;\n       (3) honors the university faculty and local educators who \n     dedicate careers to providing trusted educational programs to \n     help people, families, youth, businesses, and communities \n     solve problems, develop skills, and build a better future;\n       (4) thanks the volunteers who provide thousands of hours to \n     promote excellence for 4-H Clubs, the Master Gardeners \n     program, the Family and Consumer Sciences program, and other \n     programs of the Cooperative Extension System in their \n     communities;\n       (5) encourages continued collaboration and cooperation \n     among Federal, State, and local governments to ensure the \n     sustainability of the Cooperative Extension System as the \n     premiere nonformal educational network in the United States; \n     and\n       (6) celebrates millions of youth, adults, families, \n     farmers, ranchers, community leaders, and others who engage \n     in cooperative extension learning opportunities designed to \n     extend knowledge and change lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/27/senate-section/article/S1239-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1239-S1240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2780.
