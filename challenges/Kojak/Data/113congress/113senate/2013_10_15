Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the distinguished Presiding Officer is, \nlike myself, a New Englander and knows what fall is like in our part of \nthe country. Late last month, I was fortunate to enjoy the most lovely \nsettings I think can be found anywhere at any time, as Vermont's \nhillsides are painted orange, yellow, and red by peak fall colors set \nagainst powder blue skies. Vermonters love these sublime few weeks. We \nhappily welcome visitors around the United States. Actually, we welcome \nvisitors from around the world. It is interesting to walk down the \nstreets in some of our cities and hear several different languages \nbeing spoken as visitors come here. They share the experience, and they \nhike and bike and fish, and they hunt in our extensive preserved \nnatural areas.\n  But these best of times have become the worst of times, as Vermonters \nand visitors alike have found closed signs on their favorite natural \nareas due to the tea party shutdown of the Federal Government. The \nwindow is quickly closing in Vermont for the Fish and Wildlife \nbiologists and national forest rangers who have work that must be done \nbefore the first snow falls. We know how Washington can close down for \nan inch or two of snow. In Vermont, we are talking about 10, 15, or 20 \ninches of snow. These Fish and Wildlife biologists and national forest \nrangers' schedules are dictated by the changing seasons and the \nbiological clocks of nature. The House Republican leadership has been \nno more able to undo the law of the land--which is the Affordable Care \nAct--than they would be able to slow or stop Vermont's changing \nseasons.\n  Insisting on tying a repeal or a defunding of the Affordable Care Act \nto reopening the government is doing real and lasting damage to \nVermont's economy and natural resources as fall quickly becomes winter.\n  The 26,000-acre Nulhegan national wildlife refuge in Vermont's \nNortheast Kingdom is among the best upland bird hunting areas in New \nEngland. There is plenty of room for everyone, but just days after the \nopening of grouse season, the refuge has been forced to hang up a \nclosed sign and lock its gates. This has dealt a blow to the tourism \neconomy of the small towns around the refuge that depend on these \nannual visitors and hunters.\n  The Missisquoi National Wildlife Refuge on the shores of Lake \nChamplain is, without a doubt, the best and most extensive freshwater \nduck habitat in New England. Huge meadows of wild rice attract \nthousands of migrating waterfowl and legions of bird watchers\n\n[[Page S7476]]\n\nand hunters. Even with the fall migrations in full swing, the \nMissisquoi National Wildlife Refuge has hung up a closed sign and \nlocked its gates for the start of the fall hunting season.\n  Hikers looking for the best panoramic views of Vermont's fall colors \nflock to the Appalachian Trail and Vermont's Long Trail which run \ntogether up the spine of the Green Mountains, through the 400,000-acre \nGreen Mountain National Forest. Through-hikers, weekenders, and day \ntrippers spread out to enjoy hundreds of miles of trails. But only a \nskeleton crew of forest rangers and fire crew remain on the job. \nVisitors centers and restrooms are closed; even volunteer workers have \nbeen pulled from the trail and forced to stop shelter work and trash \ncollection at trailheads because of the tea party shutdown.\n  These may not seem like huge matters in the national scheme of \nthings, but in a State of 600,000 people they are major. Not only are \nthe livelihoods of Vermonters being devastated, but the things that we \ncherish the most about our State are being denied to people who want to \ncome and see them.\n  Woodstock, VT, is the quintessential New England village and host to \nthe Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park. The \ncenterpiece of the park is the oldest sustainably managed forest in the \nUnited States. It is a beautiful forest. But visitors are denied access \nto this forest in all of its fall glory. Long-planned events at the \npark have been canceled and the gates have been locked.\n  Certainly there are many more places for visitors to enjoy--this has \nbeen a wonderful picture-perfect season. I am told by my friends and \nneighbors who live near our home in Vermont that it has been absolutely \ngorgeous. As much as I love all my colleagues and enjoy being with \nthem, I would much rather be up there seeing the same view as \nVermonters are. But the closing of our Federal lands, just as hunting \nseasons begin and the hillsides shine, is depriving Americans from \nexperiencing the country's natural heritage and causing serious \neconomic damage to the small towns, and the innkeepers and guides who \ndepend upon these areas for their living. Foreign tourists, \nincreasingly important to our economy, and their tour operators, are \nconfused and disappointed by these outcomes. They say: this sort of \nthing has never happened in our country and yet you are the wealthiest \nand most powerful country on the earth; why are you doing this?\n  Other conservation work is being curtailed, as well, in ways likely \nto do lasting damage. Control of parasitic sea lamprey in Lake \nChamplain has to be accomplished each fall to protect the game fish and \nthreatened species. There is a very short window when the sea lamprey \ntreatments can be applied before these parasites migrate from the \nrivers to the lake. That window is fast closing. It is going to be \nmissed if U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologists remain on furlough. \nIf these fall treatments do not take place, thousands of young sea \nlamprey will be allowed to reach the lake, where they are immune to \ntreatment, live for years, and devastate the fishery. This will undo \nyears of work, and taxpayer dollars invested in this program will be \nwasted by a small group of radical obstructionists who jump in front of \nthe cameras and say things that make no sense at all.\n  In Vermont and across the country, there is a lot of work that needs \nto take place on Federal lands before winter snows sweep in. \nSnowmobiling is very popular among my constituents. It is a mainstay of \nour winter economy. But fall is the time the trails are graded and \nbridges repaired. Our most important trail networks are on Federal \nlands, and important maintenance is being delayed--deferred in some \ncases--due to the tea party shutdown. If trails are not opened before \nthe snow flies, the devastating impact on tourism and local communities \nis going to last all winter long and impact people who want to go to \nwork every day, who are hard-working, honest, good people who can't \nunderstand what is happening here in Washington.\n  Fall in Vermont is the most glorious season. It is my favorite one. \nWe welcome visitors. We get outdoors more ourselves, and are busy \npreparing for the long winter to come. Our hard-working Federal \npartners are proud of the work they do on these Federal lands, and they \nknow this manufactured tea party crisis is causing real and lasting \ndamage to our natural resources and the Vermont economy.\n  National parks and refuges in Vermont are not the only places closed \nfor business. According to the Coalition of National Park Service \nRetirees, every day the Federal Government is shuttered costs the \nNational Park Service nearly $\\1/2\\ million in lost fee collections \nnationwide. And the impacts are even greater for the surrounding \ncommunities that are losing $76 million per day in visitor spending. \nWhile some in the tea party actually have the arrogance to go on \ntelevision and argue that shutting down the Federal Government is \nsaving us money, the truth is just the opposite. It is costing every \none of us taxpayers money, and it is costing everybody in the private \nsector huge amounts of money. And now, as we reach day 15 of the tea \nparty shutdown, the National Park Service has been denied over $6 \nmillion in lost revenues, and local communities--not government \nworkers, but local communities--honest, hard-working men and women have \nlost over $1 billion. This is why several States have chosen to foot \nthe bill to reopen a handful of national parks to stop further losses \nto local economies. The cost of shutting down the government, paying \nthe lost revenue--that is what is keeping us in the red.\n\n  So I say to the small group of obstructionists, stop wasting time. \nPut our government back to work. Show the rest of the world that we \nreally are the great country we know we are. I want to get back to work \nfor Vermonters; we owe it to our constituents to resolve this now and \nstart making real decisions about our future.\n  Speaker Boehner should call up the Senate continuing resolution for a \nvote. It would receive bipartisan support, and we could put an end to \nthis pointless tea party shutdown. We would reopen our Federal lands. \nWe would be supporting our local economy.\n  There is more I can say, Mr. President, and I will, but I applaud \nMajority Leader Reid for working with the Republican leader, Senator \nMcConnell. I applaud them for being what grownups should be, trying to \nbring us back and trying to bring our government back, showing what a \ngreat country we are so we do not have countries such as China saying: \nOh, we should not rely on American currency. They are not reliable \npeople.\n  We are getting this all over the world--Americans are not reliable. \nWhat damage these tea party obstructionists are doing to our great \ncountry. We ask our military to serve around the world and protect us--\nand maybe they will get paid, but a lot of the support for them, the VA \nand whatnot, is being closed down. It is shameful. The same people who \nshut down the government are saying it is terrible that the government \nis shut down. I think the American people can see through this.\n  I don't care what party you belong to or who you are, with the \nexemption of a small group, people know this country has to be open so \nit can work--can work for all of us--and can project an image of \nstrength and stability throughout the world, can do the things that \nmade us great in the past and that will keep making us great in the \nfuture, not this shabby exercise.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for 2 weeks the government has been shut \ndown. It is hard to imagine. It seems a lot longer if you have been \nsitting here in the midst of this maelstrom--2 weeks since the junior \nSenator from Texas took the floor and for 21 hours held the floor, \ngiving a speech calling for the end of ObamaCare as we know it.\n  In that period of time we have learned a lot about ourselves. We \nlearned a lot about this country. I think about the 800,000 Federal \nemployees furloughed, many of whom struggle to get by and now have no \npaycheck coming in. It is a hardship that is totally unnecessary, a \nhardship that was\n\n[[Page S7477]]\n\nimposed on them because there was a strategy, a political strategy, \npolitical gamesmanship that said: We can sacrifice the well-being of \nthose Federal employees and their families to make our political point.\n  It turns out they went further. They went further in suggesting they \nwere going to cut off the benefits these government agencies offered. \nAt this point in time, we have come to learn what that means. People \nwho were turned away from the National Institutes of Health, children--\nsome 30 children with cancer were turned away because that agency is \nclosed. Families who were notified they had lost a loved one in battle \nwere denied the basic benefits we provide to all families facing that \nterrible grief. There was a lack of food safety inspections when \nsalmonella outbreaks were being reported around the country. The list \ngoes on and on.\n  John F. Kennedy wrote a book called ``Profiles in Courage'' that \ntalked about those in public service who showed extraordinary courage. \nI suggest it takes no courage whatsoever to hurt 800,000 innocent \nFederal employees. It takes no courage whatsoever to deny the basic \nbenefits of government to thousands, maybe even millions, of American \npeople. I think it is political cowardice.\n  Sadly, it has gone on for 2 straight weeks. The House did some \ncurious thing there, where they voted to say: But we will pay these \nemployees.\n  A friend of mine back in Edwardsville, IL, sent me an e-mail.\n\n       Let me get this straight. They closed down the Government, \n     they turned the employees away, they said they don't have to \n     come to work but they promised they were going to pay them? \n     What is going on in Washington? What are you people thinking?\n\n  I couldn't defend it. I wouldn't even try. It is evidence of the kind \nof abandonment of reason which has become the hallmark of some Members \nof Congress.\n  What do the American people think? They are not happy with any of us, \nlet's get it straight, but when it comes to the responsibility for this \nmadness, they have said it is on the other side of the aisle. It is \ntheir idea--not just the tea party but many who were complicit in this \nstrategy.\n  As if this were not enough, now in just 2 days, for the first time in \nthe history of the United States of America, we face a default on our \ndebt.\n  You might say: So what. Who cares. What difference would it make.\n  Listen to what Christine Lagarde, chief of the International Monetary \nFund, said:\n\n       The failure to raise the debt ceiling would cause not only \n     serious damage to the U.S. economy but also to the global \n     economy as a result of spillover effects. . . .\n\n  In response to a question about debt prioritization proposals, she \nsaid:\n\n       When you are the largest economy in the world, when you are \n     the safe haven in all circumstances, as has been the case, \n     you can't go into that creative accounting business.\n\n  Christine Lagarde, chief of the International Monetary Fund.\n  It is an interesting thing in politics: you can always find somebody \nwho is going to agree with almost any point of view. Tea party \nRepublicans have rounded up some flat Earth economists who say default \non the debt is really not a big deal. In fact, I have heard some of my \ncolleagues on the floor argue that we just have to pick and choose who \nis going to get paid, that everything will work out and you really will \nnot even notice.\n\n  It reminds me of the time--Mr. President, you were in the House when \nI was--when there was the Gingrich shutdown, Rush Limbaugh and others \nannounced they would shut down the government and no one would notice. \nYou don't really need a government. They noticed in a hurry. In less \nthan 2 weeks they opened the government.\n  This, sadly, is much more grievous and will have terrible \nconsequences for innocent people. If we default on our debt in 2 days, \nfor first time in history we will destroy a global confidence in the \nU.S. dollar that we built up since World War II, since 1945. Right now \nthe U.S. dollar is the most respected and strongest economy in the \nworld, period, bar none. Countries far and wide that want to invest in \nthe safest possible investment invest in U.S. Treasurys because they \ntrust our government and its word that it will pay its debts. Those who \nare toying with this possibility of default are putting that at risk.\n  It is not just a matter of the views of the world. It is bad enough \nthat we are being lectured to by Vladimir Putin about responsible \ngovernance--Vladimir Putin lectures to us about being a responsible \ngovernment. That is bad. What is even worse is the impact on ordinary \npeople and their lives. We know what happened when we went through the \nlast recession. People who had carefully saved for their futures saw \nthe bottom fall out of their savings accounts and their retirement \naccounts. We run that very same risk if we default on this debt again. \nWe run that very same risk. And many hard-working families, people who \nhave scrimped and saved for college education for their kids, for their \nown retirement, for their next home, will find that they are devastated \nby this default on our national debt. That is the most reckless and \nirresponsible single act we could undertake.\n  They asked a Member of the House, a Republican Member of the House, \nif yours was the deciding vote on extending the debt ceiling--if it was \nup to you, one person, to decide to extend the debt ceiling, would you \nvote for it? He said: Not unless there were some strings attached. You \nthink to yourself: Still bargaining, right up to the edge of the cliff. \nSadly, if we go over, the pain will be felt as much by that Congressman \nas it will by working families in Massachusetts and Illinois. That is \nwhat this is all about.\n  Paul Schott Stevens is president and CEO of the Investment Company \nInstitute. At a banking committee hearing on October 10, he said:\n\n       I also will avoid parsing the differences among ``technical \n     default, ``selective default,'' and ``actual default,'' or \n     whether missing a Social Security payment is equivalent to \n     missing an interest payment or failing to redeem a maturing \n     Treasury bill. All such discussion misses the point. The \n     United States, like any other major debtor, must maintain the \n     confidence of its creditors--or risk the consequences. . . .\n       Once Treasury has exercised the option to delay payments, \n     investors will learn a lesson that cannot and will not be \n     unlearned--even after all missed or delayed payments have \n     been made good. That lesson is simple: Treasury securities \n     are no longer as good as cash--they carry a future risk of \n     further missed payments.\n\n  That future risk is a political creation. It is a bargaining tool by \nthe Republicans, and it goes too far.\n  At a banking committee hearing, Gary Thomas, president of the \nNational Association of Realtors, said:\n\n       [A]n increase in U.S. Treasury rates would result in higher \n     mortgage rates. In the event of a default, U.S. Treasury \n     prices would fall and yields, which move inversely to prices, \n     would rise. . . . Historically, an increase in mortgage rates \n     of 1 percentage point reduces home sales by roughly 350,000 \n     to 450,000 units . . . [and] roughly 700,000 to 900,000 fewer \n     jobs would be created. . . .\n\n  This is a job-killing strategy. Default on our national debt is a \njob-killing strategy.\n  Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr., president of the Securities Industry and \nFinancial Markets Association, said:\n\n       It is important to note that Treasury securities are a key \n     factor in the daily financing of market operations, with the \n     U.S. Treasury repo market totaling between $1.2 and $1.9 \n     trillion daily. Undermining that market could have a \n     deleterious effect on every major market participant.\n\n  If that were not bad enough, I have received some e-mails from some \nfriends. The one that sticks in my mind is from a friend who does not \nlive in my State. He is a man I have come to know. I am not going to \nuse his name on the floor--I didn't ask his permission to--but I can \ncertainly tell his story.\n  He sent his son off to war in Iraq. He and his wife took care of his \nson's wife and little baby while his son went off to fight in a war. \nSadly, his son was the victim of an IED. As a result of that terrible \nincident, his son is quadriplegic and cannot speak.\n  People had given up on the son in his midtwenties; they recommended \nputting him in a nursing home. And his father said: I just won't let it \nhappen. His father took him to a hospital in Chicago, a renowned \nhospital, the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. His son made \ndramatic progress. Eventually, he was able to return home with some \nlimited function but was able to enjoy the things in life that make a \ndifference to him. He loves to go hunting. His father picked up a \nmechanism whereby his son could actually go out,\n\n[[Page S7478]]\n\nsit in a blind, and fire at those ducks and feel as if he was back \nwhere he was before he went to war.\n  I cannot tell you the love that the mother and father have given to \ntheir son, daughter-in-law, and now their two children. They basically \ngave up their life and their business and, with the help of a lot of \ngood people in the community, built a special home for their son so \nthat he could get around in his motorized wheelchair. I have been down \nthere. The outpouring of generosity and charity in North Carolina for \nthis family is just amazing, and they continue to give their entire \nlives to their son and his wife and kids.\n\n  He wrote me an email and said:\n\n       I hope you are doing well. We see you on C-SPAN. Thank you \n     for taking a moment to read about our concern. This concern \n     is about my son. It affects him and thousands of other \n     wounded veterans. We are quite concerned about what we are \n     hearing coming out of the VA. The thought of the VA check not \n     arriving in November has all of us nervous. We are sure this \n     is a feeling in households across the country. We are praying \n     that all the parties in Washington will soon come to terms. \n     After years of war, a sagging economy, and now the shutdown, \n     nerves are stretched. I am writing to you to see if there is \n     a light at the end of this dark tunnel. My son and wife, \n     after years of working to establish a near-normal life, have \n     to start worrying about losing what they worked to return to \n     and enjoy as a near-normal life.\n\n  In writing he said:\n\n       My mood does not mean to be so down, but as a parent of a \n     family that has been through so much, the thought of this \n     threat is very heart-wrenching.\n       Thank you for listening to me.\n\n  I think of that letter, and I think of that family worried about that \nVA check.\n  I received an e-mail yesterday from a family that is worried about \nwhether they will receive their Social Security check. Why do we put \nthe American people through this? Why do we put families through this? \nThis is totally unnecessary.\n  We need to open this government. We should do it tomorrow morning, \nperiod. Just open it. We need to bring these people back to work to \nperform the services they need to perform for this great Nation, and we \nneed to make certain we don't default come Thursday. The default would \nhave a negative impact that would have far-reaching consequences beyond \nthis political battle.\n  In years to come nobody may remember the names of the people involved \nin this political fight that goes on day after day on Capitol Hill, but \nthey will remember the failure of the Congress to pay the Nation's \ndebts, to stand for the full faith and credit of the United States, and \nto maintain our reputation as a leader in the world.\n  That is what is at stake. There is no political victory worth that. I \nhope Members on both sides will come to their senses.\n  I wish to salute our leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada. I have \nbeen standing by him through this. He has been stalwart and courageous. \nI know he has been exhausted at times, but he keeps on fighting.\n  I also wish to salute Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the \nRepublican leader, who, over the last several days, has played a very \nactive and positive role in trying to resolve this issue.\n  It is time for the Senate to show leadership. It is time for the \nSenate to come together on a bipartisan basis and show the path that \ntakes us out of this political crisis.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, in the midst of the current crisis there \nhave been some who have questioned the relevance of the Federal \nGovernment to our overall economy. Some have even called the current \nshutdown just a slimdown. But in my home State of New Mexico, there is \nno question that this government shutdown has been irresponsible, it \nhas been reckless, and it has been absolutely devastating to our \neconomy.\n  New Mexico serves the Nation in many ways, through our national labs \nand our military bases, with Federal lands and monuments that host \nAmericans from every corner of the Nation. As a result, Federal dollars \nin 2010 were nearly 36 percent of our State's gross domestic product. \nThis figure includes veterans' benefits, Social Security, and student \nfinancial aid.\n  Federal dollars go toward grants to help fund State and local health \ncare, transportation, education, and housing. Many of us who have \nserved as either city councilors or mayors, legislators or Governors \nrealize the role Federal passthrough dollars play in keeping our States \nand municipalities solvent.\n  In New Mexico, Federal contracts are also critical for our small \nbusiness community. Defense purchases account for almost two-thirds of \ntotal procurement spending. We are home to nearly 27,000 Federal \nworkers--workers who want to go back to work, workers who just want to \ndo their job.\n  Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory \nemploy an additional 18,000 New Mexicans as contractors, and the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy's Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in Carlsbad employs \n1,000 more. That is out of 2 million people. So it is an understatement \nto say that shutting down the Federal Government strikes at the heart \nof my State's economy.\n  Between sequestration furloughs, the shutdown, and the current \nimpasse over averting a catastrophic default on the Nation's's debt, \nhard-working, middle-class families across New Mexico are the ones who \nare saddled with uncertainty and hardship. These manufactured crises \nhave very real consequences for these families.\n  Since the shutdown began, I have heard time and again from \nconstituents who are paying the price for this reckless debacle. They \nsay they feel like the collateral damage in the ongoing ideological \nbattles in Washington, DC. Hard-working civil servants dedicated to \ntheir jobs and their country have been sent home without pay, while \nmany others have to work through the shutdown without a paycheck.\n  Yesterday I spoke with a Rio Rancho resident named Chad Didier, a \nformer marine who is now an air traffic controller in Albuquerque. \nDuring the shutdown he has been reporting to work every day to help \nkeep our airspace safe, but he does not know when he will start getting \na paycheck again. This comes on the heels of forgoing pay earlier this \nyear due to sequestration.\n  As the father of four young children and the sole breadwinner in his \nfamily, he is worried about making rent next month and making his car \npayments on time. He is frustrated because he is doing everything he \nhas been asked of him, everything he is supposed to do to take care of \nhis family, to serve his country, but he feels his government has \nfailed him.\n  Last week, because of the shutdown, the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration ordered that Los Alamos and Sandia National Labs should \nbe ready to shut down by October 21.\n  Katy Korkos with the Los Alamos Chamber of Commerce told the Los \nAlamos Monitor that the impact of the shutdown at LANL could hit \nsubcontractors twice as hard as other entities because they will never \nbe able to recover the income they are currently losing.\n  EnergySolutions, a subcontractor that processes and ships transuranic \nwaste to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in Carlsbad, has already had \nto lay off 154 workers.\n  The general manager at a department store in Los Alamos was quoted in \nthe newspaper as saying: ``Anytime the lab sneezes, we catch cold.''\n  In southern New Mexico, Crysta Quintero told the Las Cruces Sun-News \nthat she was immediately worried for her 3-year-old son after hearing \nabout the Federal Government shutdown. That is because she relies on \nthe Federal WIC Program to supply a prescription baby formula for her \nson who has a disability. Unfortunately, Crysta is not alone. Tens of \nthousands of women and children in New Mexico who receive assistance \nfrom this program every month could be left without vital nutritional \nsupport if the shutdown continues to drag on.\n  What is also at stake is the incredible work being done at New \nMexico's colleges and universities. These first-rate research \ninstitutions rely heavily\n\n[[Page S7479]]\n\non Federal grants to fund staff, training, and projects, including \nclinical trials for cancer treatment. I am told those trials--and years \nof hard work--will have to pause or even stop if the government stays \nclosed. Scientists will see their salaries reduced, and research \nstudents who want to dedicate their lives to finding the next cure will \nhave to wait even longer just to earn their degree.\n  Because of the shutdown, important job-creating investments in small \nbusiness--the very engine of our economy--are delayed. On average, over \n$300,000 in Federal loans are approved for small businesses in New \nMexico each and every day--but not today. Because of this reckless and \nirresponsible shutdown, those small businesses are not getting the \nloans to grow their business. They are not hiring new workers.\n  New Mexico is home to many of the Nation's most treasured public \nconservation lands, including national parks such as Carlsbad Caverns, \nBLM monuments such as the newly created Rio Grande del Norte, and \nnational forests such as the Gila and Carson that are unstaffed during \nthe fall hunting seasons. More than 4,000 men and women work on these \npublic lands, and they are being forced to stay home.\n  Andrew Graves is an entomologist with the U.S. Forest Service in \nAlbuquerque. Specifically, Andrew is in a program called Forest Health \nProtection that works across agency lines providing expertise and \nassistance to Federal and tribal land managers, foresters throughout \nNew Mexico so they can deal with outbreaks of disease or insect \ninfestations. Andrew says they have already canceled or postponed \nmeetings and training because of the shutdown.\n  Each day the government remains closed, thousands of people who \nplanned to visit our national parks and our wildlife refuges will be \nturned away. That does not just hurt the government. Restaurants and \nhotels, tire shops, and grocery stores feel this pain in towns such as \nSocorro, Taos, Grants, Alamogordo, and Las Cruces.\n  Because of the shutdown, the Bureau of Land Management has stopped \nprocessing energy leases on Federal land. A lengthy delay in the \npermitting process will not only take its toll on New Mexico's oil and \ngas industry but also on the revenues generated for New Mexico's public \nschools. The 8,000 New Mexican children enrolled in Head Start are \nfeeling the impact of the shutdown on top of the cuts sequestration has \nalready imposed on that critical program.\n  The shutdown also endangers the benefits that we owe over 170,000 \nveterans in New Mexico, people who served this country with \ndistinction. The VA will run out of money to pay mandatory benefits by \nthe end of October if we do not act.\n  Americans are fed up. Other debates in recent years have been just as \nheated, just as partisan, but this crisis is far more dangerous for our \ncountry. The American people--my constituents in New Mexico--want their \nFederal Government to function again. The Federal workers in my State \nwant to go back to work. Our constituents want us to move past the \ngridlock and actually govern. They want economic security and to be \nable to take care of their families.\n  It is time to reopen the government, it is time to take the threat of \ndefault off the table, and it is time to stop playing games with the \nlivelihoods of hard-working Americans.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. We are now going into week three of a government \nshutdown, a totally unnecessary, totally avoidable, totally \nmanufactured government shutdown that is now morphing together with a \npotential failure on behalf of the U.S. Government to pay its debts, \nthe first time we have ever intentionally done that in our entire \ncountry's history.\n  This is not theoretical any longer. This is now right on top of us. \nOn Thursday of this week we will no longer have enough money to pay all \nof the bills that come in to the government. We only have about 65 \npercent of the funds necessary to pay out all of the bills that come \ndue to us, whether it is to our creditors or to the thousands of small \nbusinesses that rely on contracts with the Federal Government every \nweek to pay their bills as well.\n  I appreciate all of my colleagues coming down here and talking about \nthe real-world consequences of what this shutdown has meant and what a \nfailure to pay our debts will mean. I come down and want to share a \nhandful of stories from my State of Connecticut to tell you what is \ngoing on out there beyond the talking heads on the cable news networks. \nThey are simple stories, but they are impactful because for hundreds of \nthousands of people in my State of Connecticut, there was no margin \nwith which to operate when this shutdown hit and the consequential \neconomic impact that has come to so many families. There was not any \nmoney stuffed under their mattress they could pull out and try to pay \nthe bills they could not, now that their paycheck or their business had \nbeen lost.\n  This is a big deal to people in Connecticut, and in Hawaii, and to \nStates all across our land because there was so much economic hurt that \nhad already piled up for months and years that people had no wiggle \nroom when the tea party decided to stick a knife into the backs of \nalready hurting families.\n  That is why this makes no sense. It is not as though we had the \ncushion as an economy, it is not as though families had the ability to \ntake on a little extra hurt when the tea party decided to shut down our \ngovernment--not that it would make sense even if we were living in \nheady economic times. But today, right now, for families who are \ngetting killed by an economy that has recovered for the top 5 or 10 \npercent of America but certainly has not recovered for the bottom 80 \npercent, this is no time to be playing around with people's lives.\n  Every single year at the start of the home heating season, I go to a \nnonprofit in Waterbury, CT, which dispenses home heating assistance to \nthe thousands of families in the Greater Waterbury, CT, area who know \nthat without a little bit of help from this agency they will literally \nnot be able to heat their home, that their children will go cold that \nwinter, because even though they are making money, they cannot keep up \nwith the mounting bills.\n  Every single year, as I watch the sort of macroeconomic numbers get \nbetter for the economy, I keep on thinking that when I go to that \nagency in August or September or October, they are going to tell me: \nGuess what, Chris. Less people are coming in this year than last year \nto ask for home heating assistance.\n  We are in year five of this recession now. Every single year of those \nfive, the number has gotten bigger--every single year. Even as \nunemployment goes down, demand for home heating assistance in \nConnecticut goes up. Why? Because the top echelon of our country has \nrecovered but nobody else has. So that is why when this shutdown hit, \nit hurt so badly for someone such as Rich Martin in New London, CT. \nRich did something heroic during this recession. He started a new \nbusiness. Frankly, even more heroic, he started a bookstore and a \nrecord store in New London, CT called the Telegraph.\n  He said that business has been growing for the last 12 months. Every \nmonth he has been doing a little bit better. Then guess what. The \nshutdown. Rich wrote me and said: After growth in my business over the \nlast 12 months, people have stopped coming in these last weeks. Because \nin New London, CT, where we make submarines for the U.S. Navy, where we \nhave submariners at our base there, we have a whole lot of people who \ndepend on the Federal Government or contracts from the Federal \nGovernment to be able to pay their employees. Nobody is coming into the \nTelegraph any more. His business is getting hurt. A business, a small \nbusinessman who did something great, is now wondering whether he can \nmake it through the next couple of days and weeks.\n  Here is how the trickledown of this happens: Kathi Sanborn in \nHartford is\n\n[[Page S7480]]\n\npaying the bills right now by babysitting. She is babysitting for a \ncouple. But the husband is a defense contractor. Guess what. He has \nbeen furloughed, so he cannot pay her to babysit. Frankly, he is home \nanyway, so he can look after the kids. So she does not have her \nbabysitting gig any longer. He is out of work and she is out of work. \nGuess what. That is not where it ends. Because now that Kathi does not \nhave her babysitting job, she is going to stop buying what she used to \nbuy. She is going to have her groceries. She is not going to go to the \nstore down the street for a purchase for herself. It just keeps on \ngoing.\n  Don Spaeth in Putnam, small business owner, runs a little restaurant \nthere. Small town, Putnam. He says his business has dried up the last \ncouple of weeks. People are not coming in.\n  Rich from Fairfield has a severely autistic son. He is an adult, so \nhe was on Social Security disability. But he had his disability \nbenefits cut off because they wanted to review his eligibility. Well, \nguess what. The reviewer has been furloughed for 2 weeks. So his son, \nwho was hoping to be able to have his benefits turned back on, or at \nleast have resolution so the family would know what to do, now cannot \nget a resolution to his disability claim. His son cannot pay the bills \nto the provider who gives him housing. He is potentially going to be \nout on the streets because he does not have a reviewer in the Social \nSecurity office. That hurts economically, but that hurts \npsychologically as well.\n  Interfaith Volunteer Caregivers in New Haven gets Federal money to do \nsomething really simple: Provide frail seniors with rides to their \ndoctors' appointments. They lost their Federal funding for 2 weeks, so \nthey cannot give rides any longer. So seniors are sitting home not able \nto get to their doctors' appointments. Think about that. You have an \n85-year-old widow who has to worry every day if she is going to get \nsick because she lost her ride to the doctor's office.\n  Then let me read you this quote from Michael in Hartford. I do not \neven have to embellish it:\n\n       I am an attorney and work for the IRS.\n       I have 3 children, a 16 year old girl and 8 year old twins. \n     My wife is pregnant with my fourth child. My 16 year old is \n     taking driver's education and wants her license. I cannot now \n     pay for the insurance necessary for her. She also wanted to \n     take a PSAT prep course, another $1,200 that I don't have. \n     She needs to start visiting college campuses. More money that \n     I don't have. One of my twins, Sofia, had some learning \n     disabilities and had private tutors and other professionals \n     to assist her in staying on grade level in reading and math. \n     I will soon run out of savings to pay for Sofia's support \n     system because November 1st means that there is a mortgage \n     payment, car payment, car insurance payments and the other \n     dozen or so monthly bills that keep our household up and \n     running. I do hope that the shutdown ends soon so that I can \n     get back to work.\n\n  These stories can be repeated, frankly, hundreds of thousands of \ntimes over all across this country. While to some people they may sound \nlike small stories--a babysitter losing a job, the inability to get \nyour disabled daughter a little bit of help for a couple months--they \nadd up to $1.6 billion in economic activity coming out of our country \nevery single week.\n  They add up to unemployment claims jumping to their highest level \nlast week in 6 months. They add up to consumer confidence being the \nlowest in this country since the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008.\n  This doesn't happen in a vacuum. It is not as if we can tread water \nor move backwards economically while the rest of the world waits for us \nto resume our mantle of economic leadership.\n  China says they are looking to take their $1.3 trillion in U.S. \nTreasurys and find someplace else for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I ask unanimous consent for 5 more minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Last month Japan announced its machinery sales were the \nbest since 2008. The rest of the world is moving on.\n  If we are doing this much damage to the economy, why are we here? We \nare here mainly because tea party Republicans in the House see this \nmisery as a bargaining chip. They couldn't get their way any other way. \nThey couldn't win the legislative argument on the health care bill, a \nbill that passed the House and the Senate and was signed by the \nPresident. They couldn't win the judicial argument. It came before the \nSupreme Court, and the Supreme Court upheld the health care law. It \ncouldn't win the electoral argument.\n  The health care bill was on the ballot in 2012. The President who ran \non it and signed it was reelected by a wide margin. Every single \nSenator in this Chamber who supported it was returned to their seat.\n  Tea party Republicans have lost the argument on health care in all \nthree of the traditional forums by which one would get their way in the \nlegislative process--the legislative forum, judicial forum, and the \nelectoral forum.\n  Just as a criminal fleeing the scene of a crime, they have been \nconfronted with a last desperate option, which is to grab hold of the \neconomy, put a gun to its head, and hope then that Democrats and \nPresident Obama will relent simply because of our compassion for people \nlike Rich in New London, Kathi in New Hartford, Don in Putnam, the \nseniors who rely on Interfaith Caregivers in New Haven, and the young \nIRS attorney with a disabled daughter. They hope it will be our passion \nfor those people which will cause us to do something other than what \nthe people sent us to do and repeal, delay, or displace the health care \nlaw.\n  The good news is cooler heads are prevailing, that people do see--in \nthis Chamber at least--the need to let go of the hostage. Two weeks \ninto the shutdown, the cumulative economic effects on the economy are \nreal. Those stories I told from Connecticut can now be multiplied \nthousands of times, tens of thousands of times.\n  The House looks as if they are going to try to pass another partisan \npolitical bill loaded with add-ons as conditions to restart the \ngovernment and pay our bills. The Senate is working on a different \nsolution, a solution that could bring together Republicans and \nDemocrats to at least temporarily end this crisis. On behalf of my \nconstituents in Connecticut, we certainly hope that is the result.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I am very pleased to follow my colleague from \nConnecticut in recounting to this body some of the voices we have been \nhearing from across our State, some of the individuals whose stories \nmake very compelling evidence for the need of this body to heed the \nbipartisan spirit--indeed, nonpartisan spirit that so animates and \nmoves this country--to demand that we get the job done yesterday. I \nused exactly that expression to tell this body how important action is \nto move forward.\n  I am on the floor today with thanks to our majority leader Senator \nReid, who has come to the floor and has so ably and courageously led \nus, not only on the Democratic side but also on the minority side as \nwell. I hope we will demonstrate in this body the profile in courage \nthe country expects and needs from us at this time.\n  I yield to the majority leader at this time if he has a message to \nbring to us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate my friend's always courteous attitude. I \nappreciate it very much.\n  The House Republican leadership plan that is now out--and people may \nlook at it--is a plan to advance an extreme piece of legislation and is \nnothing more than a blatant attack on bipartisanship.\n  The past several days we have been engaged in productive bipartisan \nnegotiations in the Senate. Everyone knows this. We have been working \nacross party lines and making steady progress to achieve an agreement \nthat reopens the government, protects the full faith and credit of our \ncountry, and opens talks to put this country on a firm fiscal footing. \nEveryone needs to know that the measure under discussion in the House \nis no part of what we have negotiated in the Senate.\n  The debt is here. The deadline is looming. Rating agencies are \ntalking about downgrading us as early as tonight, again.\n  I know I speak for many of us. We have been working in good faith \nwhen I say that we felt blindsided by news from the House, but this \nisn't the first\n\n[[Page S7481]]\n\ntime. Extremist Republicans in the House of Representatives are \nattempting to torpedo the Senate's bipartisan progress with a bill that \ncan't pass the Senate--can't pass the Senate and won't pass the Senate.\n  The House measure would take away the President's fundamental \nauthority that has been in existence for as long as political science \ncan remember. It has been in place for decade after decade after decade \nto prevent a catastrophic default on the Nation's bills. Out of spite, \ntea party Republicans are trying to take authority away from President \nObama. They would never, ever consider doing this if it were President \nRomney, President Bush, President Bush, or President Reagan. Never.\n  As they have said--and they have cheered on the other side--the \ngovernment is closed. We don't mind defaulting on the debt. It is good \nfor the country. That is what they have said.\n  Their legislation would also make unacceptable major changes to \nObamaCare. The House legislation doesn't even include a process for \nbipartisan negotiation on a sensible long-term budget. They throw out \nthese numbers, think magic is going to happen, and somehow when January \n15 arrives, everything will be hunky-dory. There are still processes we \nhave to follow. They set no pattern, no schedule, no routine to do \nthat.\n  For weeks Republicans have claimed they want to negotiate, but their \nlegislation completely ignores the need to work together, craft a \nbudget, and put our country on a fiscally sustainable path.\n  For years they have complained about why don't we have regular order \nhere. They complained about lack of a budget. Now they don't even want \nus to negotiate a budget. It is hard to comprehend this logic, but the \ntea-party-driven part of the Republican Party doesn't follow logic. Why \nwould they want to close the government for 15 days, have us default on \nour debt?\n  Introduction of this measure by House Republican leadership is \nunproductive and a waste of time. Let us be clear: The House \nlegislation will not pass the Senate.\n  This is what the White House said only a few minutes ago:\n\n       The President has said repeatedly that members of Congress \n     don't get to demand ransom for fulfilling their basic \n     responsibilities to pass a budget and pay the nation's bills. \n     Unfortunately, the latest proposal from House Republicans \n     does just that in a partisan attempt to appease a small group \n     of Tea Party Republicans who forced the government shutdown \n     in the first place.\n\n  I am very disappointed with John Boehner, who once again would try to \npreserve his role at the expense of the country.\n  I have worked hard to rise above bipartisanship and find common \nground in the Senate. We have done that together for the good of the \nNation. This is much bigger than the presiding Senator, who is from the \nState of Hawaii, or the assistant leader, who is at my side. This is \nmuch bigger than that. It is much bigger than me, it is much bigger \nthan the two Senators on the floor who are from Connecticut. We have \nSenator Murray, who is chairman of the Budget Committee. It is bigger \nthan her. It is bigger than the senior Senator from New York, Senator \nSchumer, who is on the floor.\n  We have to start working together as a country. This is what we have \nbeen trying to do. This is so disappointing. On the eve of financial \ndestruction for this great country, this is what it is--to appease a \nsmall group of people over there. I am so disappointed.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the majority leader, through the Chair, one of the \nkey elements in this new proposal from Speaker Boehner is to diminish \nthis President's authority to deal with a default on our national debt. \nThis authority, so-called extraordinary measures or emergency measures, \ngives to Presidents, going back to President Kennedy, the wherewithal \nthrough the Treasury Department to try to avoid an economic disaster \nwhich could impact families, businesses, jobs, and the reputation of \nthe United States in the world.\n  I ask of the majority leader, through the Chair, now that we have \nseen the Republican Party bring us so close to the precipice on a \ndefault, it is unimaginable to me that any President, including \nPresident Obama, would surrender this authority to keep America safe in \nlight of this type of threat. Is this one of the key elements in terms \nof the problems associated with the Boehner proposal?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, to my friend, the senior Senator from \nIllinois, we have seen what has gone on these last few months, through \nthis whole year, with a group of people who are giving press \nconferences, holding demonstrations. They want the government to stay \nclosed. They wanted it closed in the first place.\n  The hardship we have over this country is awful. If that is not good \nenough, they are boasting they want the country to fail its obligations \nto pay its bills.\n  These are not new programs. These are obligations we have. That is \none of the problems. The proposal they have would not allow--for \nexample, my friend is the chair of what some say is the most important \npart of the Federal Government, to protect the safety and security of \nthe United States, the subcommittee dealing with defense that was led \nmany decades by Senator Dan Inouye. The proposal they have sent gives \nthe President of the United States, the Chairman of the Chiefs of \nStaff, no flexibility whatsoever when sequestration kicks in on the \n15th.\n  We are not asking to change those numbers. We agreed to those \nnumbers. We voted to approve those numbers, but they won't even allow \nflexibility to allow the Department of Defense to shift that money \naround. I do not know how the defense of this country can go forward if \nthey don't have flexibility with losing $22 billion beginning January \n15. They don't even give authority for that.\n  The bill they are sending over is doomed to failure. It is doomed to \nfailure legislatively and it is so awful for our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would like to underscore for a brief \nmoment what our leader has said: Default would be devastating to this \ncountry. Closing the government is awful for our country. Yesterday we \nall saw for the first time, after the government has been closed for \ntoo many days, when we are on the eve of default, some real progress--\nLeader Reid and Leader McConnell coming together on the outlines of a \nplan which made a great deal of sense, where each side had to give but \ncould accept. And all of a sudden at the last minute, as the locomotive \nto avoid default is heading down the tracks and getting some steam, \nSpeaker Boehner throws a log on the path. This is wrong.\n  He knows his proposal--we don't even know what it is yet. They have \nto tweak it probably to try to appease the hard right. But he knows his \nproposal with the measures in it already that have leaked out would not \nbe signed by the President or pass the Senate. So instead of doing the \nright thing, looking at the Senate bipartisan proposal and moving \nforward on that, Speaker Boehner decides to light a match and throw it \non the gasoline that is already all over the place. I hope he will \ndesist.\n  We all have seen that the House can't lead in this regard. They can \npass a lot of one-House bills, but they can't get anything done. Let \nhim desist. Let him defer to the Democratic and Republican leaders here \nin this body so we can avoid default, open the government, and get back \nto America's business.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, let me add my voice to the eloquent \nand powerful remarks made by our majority leader and the Senator from \nNew York, who have rightly deemed this House proposal an obstacle--\nindeed, an obstructionist move--designed to perpetuate and not end the \nshutdown, and to block and not enable our efforts to reach a bipartisan \ncompromise which would allow America to continue paying its bills on \ntime.\n  Those two goals--ending the shutdown and enabling America to pay its \nbills on time--are the predominant objectives we must have as a \nbipartisan effort goes forward here in the Senate. This House proposal \nis doomed to failure. It would be a failure not just for\n\n[[Page S7482]]\n\nthe legislative process, not for the political actors here, but a \nfailure for America.\n  I am reminded of the remarks so well made more than 10 days ago by \nthe majority leader about one aspect of the effects of this shutdown on \nan industry very important to his State of Nevada and very important to \nthe Presiding Officer's State of Hawaii--the tourism, lodging, and \nhotel industry. That impact is devastating.\n  As their Senator, I have heard this morning from staff and employees \nof the Starwood Hotels based in Stamford, CT, who have written to \nMembers of Congress about the effects they see to their company and to \nothers like theirs in this industry--hotel and tourism--which is vital \nto the State of Connecticut. In fact, we invest constructively and \npositively in promoting our State's tourism industry.\n  I will read from a letter from Amy Kilbury, associate director of IT \nfinance at Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide:\n\n       The current impasse, now in its third week, is having a \n     negative impact both on the economy in general, and \n     specifically on the travel and tourism industry, which \n     depends on the confidence of business and individuals on the \n     future stability of the economy. The shutdown is having \n     ripple effects; as federal agencies have reduced their \n     operations so have private government contractors, and in \n     turn, this is affecting both business and leisure travel.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this letter, \nand a letter written by the American Hotel and Lodging Association.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 Starwood Hotels &\n\n\n                                      Resorts Worldwide, Inc.,\n\n                                                     Stamford, CT.\n       Dear Representative Himes, Senator Murphy, and Senator \n     Blumenthal: I am the Associate Director of IT Finance at \n     Starwood Hotels & Resorts, which has its headquarters in \n     Stamford, CT. I wish to express my concern over the impasse \n     in government funding and the impending risk that the United \n     States could default on its obligations, and to urge you to \n     work with your colleagues to forge a bipartisan compromise to \n     reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling.\n       The current impasse, now in its third week, is having a \n     negative impact both on the economy in general, and \n     specifically on the travel and tourism industry, which \n     depends on the confidence of business and individuals on the \n     future stability of the economy. The shutdown is having \n     ripple effects; as federal agencies have reduced their \n     operations so have private government contractors, and in \n     turn, this is affecting both business and leisure travel.\n       There is no question that the future health of the American \n     economy depends on policies that will restore robust economic \n     growth and job creation while gradually reducing debt, and I \n     know that you are committed to those objectives. The \n     government shutdown, however, and even the threat of default, \n     will only slow the economy down and jeopardize efforts to \n     achieve a lasting economic recovery.\n       The next few days are very important and I hope that you \n     will make a major contribution towards reaching a positive \n     compromise that will move this Nation forward. You have my \n     best wishes as you deal with the awesome challenges ahead.\n           Regards,\n                                                      Amy Kilbury,\n     Assoc.

Current fiscal uncertainty and the \n     increasing lack of consumer confidence are disrupting recent \n     economic progress and job creation, in which the lodging \n     industry has played a significant role.\n       Analysts say that for each day the federal government is \n     shut down, collective American income is reduced \n     approximately $200 million, and our nation's hotels are \n     losing more than $8 million in economic activity--putting \n     jobs at risk and causing repercussions across many other \n     related sectors. Communities near national parks are expected \n     to lose $76 million a day in visitor spending. In Yosemite \n     National Park, for example, lodges and cabins scheduled to be \n     filled to near capacity are instead giving thousands of \n     visitors 48 hours to leave. Additionally, thousands who had \n     planned to visit national parks are cancelling their trips \n     and hotel reservations. Stories continue to pour in from \n     AH members about how their businesses are being negatively \n     affected.\n       The impacts extend far beyond our national treasures. \n     Hoteliers with international travelers have experienced a \n     significant increase in cancellations because these visitors \n     are confused on whether they will be able to enter and leave \n     normally. Our members in northern states receive calls daily \n     from Canadians checking to see if the border is open.\n       Current fiscal conditions are leading to increased consumer \n     uncertainty, all to the detriment of economic growth. In \n     short, the government shutdown is increasingly impairing the \n     lodging industry's ability to hire, grow, and contribute to \n     the economy.\n       It is imperative that Congress and the President act now to \n     address the fast-approaching deadline to raise the U.S. debt \n     limit, or else risk default and further economic damage. \n     Acting to put the debt on a downward path into the future and \n     addressing our long-term fiscal challenges are imperative to \n     stronger consumer confidence, future job growth, and our \n     nation's standing throughout the world. The lodging industry \n     will continue to be a leader in U.S. economic growth if our \n     leaders can provide fiscal certainty.\n       AH and our members thank you for your efforts to address \n     these critically important issues.\n       American Hotel & Lodging Association; America's Best \n     Franchising, Inc.; Arizona Lodging & Tourism Association; \n     Asian American Hotel Owners Association (AAHOA); Association \n     of Starwood Franchisees & Owners--North America (ASFONA); \n     Best Western International; Bev Kaftan, American Payment \n     Solutions, Mesa, AZ; Brian Latture, The Hotel Group, \n     Franklin, TN; California Hotel & Lodging Association; Carlson \n     Rezidor Hotel Group; Catherine DeVane, The Hotel Group, \n     Franklin, TN; Chandler Wiens-Thayer, RHW Management, Overland \n     Park, KS; Choice Hotels International; Chuck Donnelly, The \n     Lodge at Mountaineer Square and The Grand Lodge, Gunnison \n     County, CO; Colette Wear, Country Inn & Suites By Carlson, \n     Lincoln, NE; Colorado Hotel & Lodging Association; Cortney \n     Damiano, Best Western Plus, Olive Branch, MS; Delaware Hotel \n     & Lodging Association; Douglas Dreher, The Hotel Group, \n     Edmonds, WA; Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association; \n     Georgia Hotel & Lodging Association; Hilton Worldwide; Host \n     Hotels & Resorts.\n       Hotel Association of Washington, D.C.; Hyatt Hotels and \n     Resorts; IHG Owners Association; InterContinental Hotels \n     Group; Jeff Gouge, The Arctic Club Seattle, Seattle, WA \n     98104; Jeffrey T.

These Starwood employees are writing to their \nSenators and Members of Congress because they see firsthand the effects \non their livelihood and their lives. The stories recounted earlier by \nmy colleague from Connecticut and those I recited yesterday on the \nfloor are real effects in the lives of real people, negative and \npainful--indeed, devastating effects on people who depend on the \neconomic flow of certain and stable work by the government, \ncontractors, and small and large businesses like Starwood that are \naffected.\n  There is no question the future health of the American economy \ndepends on the policies we need to adopt\n\n[[Page S7483]]\n\nand advance to sustain economic growth--indeed, to make it more robust \nto preserve job creation and, in fact, heighten and enhance it, and to \nmake sure that these employees of Starwood are well served, not \nimpeded, by the government they supported with their taxes and they \nelected with their votes. We have an obligation to them to do better \nthan we have.\n  I was deeply moved by the story recounted by Senator Durbin a short \ntime ago on the floor about a young Iraq veteran more severely wounded \nthan the ones I recounted yesterday. But he is a veteran like the \nindividuals whose stories I told yesterday. They deserve better from \nour government. Indeed, they deserve an end to the kind of \nobstructionism we saw just a short time ago on the other side of this \nCongress, in the other branch of this legislative body, from Members of \nthe House of Representatives who know the proposal they are making has \nno chance of adoption by the deadline we need to meet to make sure that \nthe greatest Nation in the history of the world avoids default and \ncontinues to pay its bills on time.\n  The CEO of the American Hotel and Lodging Association, which \nrepresents Starwood, Katherine Lugar, said: Hotels are a major economic \ndriver and job creator across the country, and the industry's ability \nto continue its growth is hamstrung by inaction from our policy \nmembers. The administration, the House of Representatives, and the \nSenate need to act swiftly in the best interests of the entire Nation \nand end this shutdown. Pay our bills on time.\n  That has been the objective of my colleagues on this side of the \naisle and on the other side, like Senator McCain who has just come to \nthe floor. That bipartisan effort has to be our objective. We need to \ndo better for the American people and meet the obligations we now have.\n  As chairman of the subcommittee which has jurisdiction over the hotel \nand lodging industry, the commerce committee, we are hearing about how \nStates such as Arizona, Hawaii, and Nevada, as well as Connecticut, are \nlosing millions of dollars every day in economic activity. In fact, the \nWeir Farm National Historic Site in Connecticut is harmed, along with \nthe Grand Canyon, and all the communities and industries associated \nwith it. These issues are real and tangible. The harm is now and \nurgent.\n  I urge my colleagues to come together and resist the pressures and \ndemonstrate the kinds of profiles of courage we have seen on both sides \nof the aisle--standing strong, speaking out, resisting partisanship--\nand coming together for the good of the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Connecticut.\n  In the last 24 hours a lot has been taking place. A tentative \nagreement has been reached between both Republican and Democratic \nleaders. The Speaker of the House has come forward with what we believe \nis a plan which would reopen the government, extend the debt limit, and \nhas several other provisions in it.\n  The reaction to that has been immediate automatic condemnation by the \nmajority leader, by the White House, and by Democrats in the House, \nabsolutely rejecting this proposal.\n  I don't understand that. I don't understand that visceral reaction in \na most negative fashion. Why don't we try something like we used to do \naround this place? Why don't we say: You have a proposal to open the \ngovernment; we have a proposal to open the government. Let's both pass; \nlet's go to conference--which we could do in 24 hours--and resolve our \ndifferences.\n  I understand what the polling data says, that 74 percent of the \nAmerican people disapprove of the Republican handling of this issue. \nAnd I agree. Some of us at the beginning said we are going on a fool's \nerrand to believe we will be able to defund ObamaCare. We got ourselves \nin a ditch, and we have to stop digging. That is well understood here \nby certainly the overwhelming majority of my Republican colleagues. But \nfor the majority leader and the Democrats in the House and the White \nHouse to say absolutely, categorically, we will not consider what the \nRepublicans in the House of Representatives are doing, in my view is \npiling on. It is piling on and it is not right.\n  I urge my Democrat colleagues: Let's sit down and work this out. We \nhave a proposal from the House. We have a proposal between the two \nleaders. Let's get this resolved. To categorically reject what the \nHouse of Representatives and the Speaker is doing--and I think he is \npretty courageous in what he is doing--in my view is not serving the \nAmerican people.\n  So let's stop this. Let's stop it, sit down, consider the Speaker's \nproposal, get our proposal done, and then get this resolved, which we \ncould do in the next 24 hours.\n  I came to the floor to express my disappointment in the categorical \nrejection of a good-faith effort by the Speaker of the House--which \ndoesn't contain all the provisions I want. I am sure the agreement made \nby both the Senate majority and Republican leaders will not be \neverything I want. Let's stop the condemnation. Let's consider the \nRepublican House proposal as a serious proposal, as a way to end this \ngridlock, and then let's sit down together and get this thing done.\n  I again urge my Democratic colleagues. We know you have the upper \nhand. Isn't it time we help find a way out of this--which is what the \nAmerican people want--rather than who won and who lost. The only people \nlosing right now are the people of this country. As I have mentioned a \ncouple times before, Al Qaeda is not in shutdown.\n  I urge my Democratic colleagues and the White House to reconsider \ntheir categorical rejection of any proposal from the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                                  Iran\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, clearly the issue we are facing with \nregard to the budget, ObamaCare, the debt ceiling is a very important \nissue. In the hours and days to come I will have a lot more to say \nabout it. I waited over the last few days, because of the urgency that \nconfronts us domestically, to reserve my comments on the issue of Iran. \nAt this point I believed I could no longer wait to speak out on it, so \nif my colleagues can indulge me for a few moments, I wish to talk about \nit because, as serious as the domestic challenge may be with regard to \nthe budget, the spending, the debt limit, ObamaCare, we have another \ncrisis brewing, one that goes to our national security interests, one \nthat quite frankly for the most part unites us across the aisle; that \nis, the issue and the threat Iran's nuclear ambitions pose to the \nworld.\n  The reason I believed I could no longer wait to address this is \nbecause I believe, as many of you do, that the world is entering a \ncrucial time in the international efforts to stop Iran's nuclear \nprogram. On September 24 of this year, I, along with a group of other \nSenators, wrote to the President and we expressed our concerns about \nreports that the administration was contemplating making a fresh, new \noffer, fresh new series of offers to Iran. In that letter, we said Iran \nmust not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon; that is, if, God \nforbid, it becomes necessary, we could support the use of military \nforce to prevent an Iranian bomb and that Iran must not be allowed to \nmaintain any indigenous enrichment capability; and that now is not the \ntime to suspend sanctions but to increase them on the Iranian regime.\n  All of us would like to wake tomorrow to the news that the Ayatollah \nhas decided to abandon his nuclear weapons ambitions, but it is \nespecially imperative on matters of national security that we not be \nguided simply by our hopes. We must be guided by reality. This is true \nin life in general, but it is especially true and important on issues \nof national security that we be guided by reality. That reality is that \nno matter how much Iran's political leaders say they do not have plans \nfor a nuclear weapon, their actions say something else. They have \ndramatically increased their ability to enrich uranium and they \ncontinue to spend millions of dollars to expand their nuclear program \nand to develop long-range missiles which threaten not just Israel and \nEurope but eventually the United States.\n\n[[Page S7484]]\n\n  The only reason you put so much money and time into developing long-\nrange missiles is to put a nuclear weapon on them. That is what they \nhave been doing. They have been developing this missile capability.\n  Recently, we heard all this new talk about there is a new President \nin Iran and he might be a reformer. We hope so. But this is also the \nsame person who in the past has bragged about how he has fooled the \nworld before and bought time for Iran's enrichment capacity to \nincrease. In the end, by the way, even if he is a reformer, he is not \nthe ultimate decisionmaker, nor is the Foreign Minister or any of these \nother civilians in their government. The ultimate decisionmaker is \nIran's so-called Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. So far no one has accused \nhim of being a reformer.\n  Iran's leaders are making noises about negotiating with the world now \nbecause over the last few years the United States and the European \nUnion have imposed very significant sanctions on Iran and these \nsanctions are starting to hurt the Iranian regime. It is hurting, \nalthough it has not stopped, their ability to export terrorism around \nthe world. It is hurting, although it has not stopped, their ability to \nbuy parts for their nuclear program and for their missile program.\n  Do you want to understand why they are doing all this now, what their \nplan is? It is not that hard to understand. What they are trying to do, \nthey are trying to get us and the world to agree to weaken the \nsanctions without them having to agree to any concessions that are \nirreversible, to any concessions that irreversibly block their ability \nto one day build that weapon. This ambition of theirs, this plan they \nhave is clear as day. They are trying to figure out if they can get \nthese sanctions suspended or lifted without giving up too much. Then at \nsome point in the future, when the world has moved on, when we are \nfocused on other things, they can then make their move to build their \nbomb.\n  By the way, this is the model North Korea employed over a decade ago. \nThey used a combination of belligerence and pretended negotiations to \nbuy the time and the space. Now they are a nuclear power and they \ncontinue to develop their rocket technology--which does not just \nthreaten South Korea and Japan but the west coast of the United States \nand potentially one day the entire country, our entire country.\n  This is why, as these talks between the so-called P5+1 group of \nnations and Iran restarted, we are at a critical juncture. We should \ntalk to Iran. We should see if they are serious. But we cannot, under \nany circumstances, put at risk the hard-earned leverage that took so \nlong to put in place and assemble.\n  First, we need to remember whom we are dealing with. We are talking \nabout a regime that has earned the distrust of the entire world through \nits secret nuclear program, a regime that admits foul play only when \nthey are caught red-handed, a regime that supports terrorism, killing \nof Americans, and has an active hand in fueling conflicts that \ndestabilize its neighbors. This is a regime that brutalizes its own \npeople and denies them their basic freedoms. This is the regime, by the \nway, that plotted to assassinate the Saudi Ambassador in this city, in \nWashington DC.\n  Given this record, the erosion of trust in Tehran is simply too \ngreat, so the United States must look long and hard at what Iranian \nactions could qualify as what the administration likes to call credible \nconfidence-building measures.\n  I say this because of whom we are dealing with. Sanctions on Iran \nshould not be lifted or suspended until they agree to completely \nabandon any capability for enrichment or reprocessing. Iran has a right \nto a peaceful civilian nuclear energy program. But they do not have the \nright to enrich or reprocess. Holding this line is especially important \nin light of Iran's repeated and blatant disregard for international \nobligations in the past and even to this day.\n  Even a limited enrichment program and possession of sensitive \nreprocessing technologies is unacceptable because of the risk that such \na program would once again be abused by Iran in the future for \nnefarious and dangerous purposes. Suspending sanctions before Iran not \njust suspends but abandons enrichment would give the Iranian regime \nexactly what they want, an eventual path to a nuclear weapon. Sanctions \nrelief at this time would allow them to make advances on their broader \nstrategic objectives in their region such as propping up the Assad \nregime in Syria, such as continuing to destabilize Iraq, such as \nsupporting terrorist groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n  We cannot allow the No. 1 exporter of terrorism in the world this \nopportunity. Until Iran agrees to abandon enrichment and reprocessing, \nnot only should we keep the current sanctions but the Congress should \nmove to implement a new round of additional sanctions without delay. I \nwould say that at some point Congress should consider making it very \nclear that if it becomes necessary, the President of the United States \nshould reserve the right to take military action to prevent Iran from \ncontinuing to advance its nuclear weapons program.\n  The United States and the international community have succeeded in \nbringing Iran to the negotiating table through firm action, not through \nhalf measures. Personally, I hope, as do all of my colleagues, that \nthere is a diplomatic solution to this problem. But Iran does not have \nforever to prove they are serious. We cannot allow them to use these \ntalks to continue to buy time and space as they have for the last \ndecade, as North Korea did before them, to buy time and space so they \ncan continue to develop their nuclear weapons capability. We cannot \nallow them to use these talks to continue to spread terror, to \nundermine their neighbors, and to threaten our country or our allies in \nIsrael and around the world.\n  We cannot fall into their trap. Yes, we should be willing to talk. \nBut talk alone should not slow down our actions. Until they act, we \nshould continue to increase pressure and speak forcefully about what \nthese people sitting across from us have done internationally and to \ntheir own people; otherwise, I truly believe at some point in the \nfuture we are going to awake to the news that Iran has tested a nuclear \nweapon and we may find ourselves stuck with the reality that they have \nthe ability to put that weapon on a missile that can reach the United \nStates. If that day should ever come, God help us all.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, you know when you are driving along and \nyour children keep asking you, are we there yet? Are we there yet? That \nis an appropriate question. I would have thought we were there--until \nnow. We heard about the agreement that was hammered out between the two \nleaders in the Senate and now all kinds of changes wanting to be made \nin the House of Representatives. The countdown clock is ticking. The \nominous sounds of default are being heard. The stock market, the New \nYork Exchange, has reacted accordingly. Up on Friday, up again a little \nbit yesterday on the hopes, but today with the new news, down--not a \nhuge amount but a significant amount.\n  It is reflective of this emotional roller coaster of what is at \nstake, which is the financial integrity of this country.\n  Enough is enough. The ridiculousness ought to stop. Let's go back and \nlook where we have been over the course of the last 2 weeks.\n  All of this started with a shutdown of the Federal Government, of \nwhich there are untold stories of hardship and deprivation that are \ngoing on. That ought to be enough to spur people to action to stop the \nshutdown. What did the shutdown start with? It started because a small \ngroup in the House, maybe folks who would affiliate with the tea party, \ndecided they want to take away the funding for the health care reform \nact, the Affordable Care Act. As a result, they forced this shutdown.\n  In the course of the last 2 weeks, about 1 week goes by and that \ncrowd sees this is not working and so they\n\n[[Page S7485]]\n\nshift then their attacks to one of overall spending. But still today, \nwith the two leaders in the Senate having basically come to an \nagreement, the House of Representatives is going back to the Affordable \nCare Act and wanting to extract additional things. And all the time the \nclock is ticking toward not only not being able to bring government \nback so it can function--stopping the shutdown--but also the potential \ndefault that is looming.\n\n  I really believe and I understand what the people in my State of \nFlorida feel. They are fed up with this. It is so ridiculous. Yet that \nis what our politics has come to. The small group in the House of \nRepresentatives better start understanding that.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HEINRICH.

I strongly \nsupport, of course, that language, and I strongly support that \ndiscussion and that effort in the House, and I really encourage all of \nour House colleagues to look hard at that and act on it.

As the Presiding Officer knows, as we went into that August \nrecess the Obama administration issued a rule--an illegal rule, in my \nopinion--without statutory authority, contrary to the ObamaCare \nstatute, that gives Members of Congress and congressional staff special \nstatus, special exemption, or special subsidy, if you will, not in the \nlaw, and one not enjoyed in that way by any other American. This ``no \nWashington exemption'' language, which I have been an advocate of with \nmany others here in the Senate and with many House colleagues, would \nend that special elite status. That is what we need to do.\n  I think we need to do it for two crucial reasons--first of all, just \non principle. I believe it should be the first rule of our democracy \nthat Washington is treated as the rest of America is treated. What is \ngood for America and what Congress and the administration--what \nWashington passes on America, it lives with itself with no special \nstatus, no special rules, no special exemption or subsidy. That should \nbe true across the board. It should certainly be true regarding \nObamaCare. That should be the first rule of American democracy.\n  Washington doesn't want that. It wants to impose these new rules on \nthe rest of America; it doesn't want to live by them itself. It is sort \nof like when a person walks into a restaurant and hears that the chef \nnever, ever eats at that restaurant, never, ever has a meal out of that \nkitchen, it makes a person wonder. The same thing is true here on a \nnumber of fronts, including ObamaCare.\n  So the first point is based on pure principle. Washington should live \nunder the same rules it imposes on America across the board, including \nunder ObamaCare. So Washington--Congress, all congressional staff, the \nPresident, the Vice President, their political appointees--should have \nto go to the same fallback option under ObamaCare that is there for all \nAmerica--the so-called exchanges--and it should do that with no special \nrules or special deal or special subsidy or special exception. It \nshould do that the same way ordinary Americans do, who in many cases--8 \nmillion-plus--are forced out of good health care coverage they have now \nthrough their employment and forced onto the ObamaCare exchanges.\n  The second reason this language is so important is a very practical \none, because the sooner we make Washington live by the same ObamaCare \nrules as the rest of America, the quicker Washington will change \nObamaCare in substantial ways, will fix it not just for Washington, as \nit did through the special illegal Obama administration rule on this \nsubject, but for America. We need to align policymakers' personal \ninterests in Washington along with the interests of the American \npeople. The way we do that is to make them live by exactly the same \nrules, make them walk the walk of those Americans who have to go to the \nObamaCare exchanges, in many cases against their will--8 million-plus--\nwho were satisfied with the health coverage they had prior to ObamaCare \nand then who realized that under this law the promise by President \nObama that ``if you like the health care coverage you have now, you can \nkeep it''--they realized the hard way that promise was a lie.\n  So there are two crucial reasons we must pass this language into law: \nfirst, the principle, and second, the practicality--first, the \nprinciple that Washington should live under the same rules the same way \nas America and, second, the practicality that we need to visit upon \nWashington all of the burdens and challenges that face America under \nObamaCare, including those 8 million-plus Americans going to the \nexchanges against their will.\n  Again, I encourage the House to include this ``no Washington \nexemption'' language in any compromise they put together with regard to \nthese fiscal issues we are dealing with now. That would be enormously \nimportant. It would show leadership. I think it will resonate with the \nAmerican people. The American people get this issue, and they resent--\nrightly so--Washington getting a special exemption or a special subsidy \nunder ObamaCare that no other American in that situation gets.\n  Again, I urge the House to act on that important language. That would \nshow leadership. That would align our personal interests with the folks \nwe represent. That would honor what should be the first principle of \nAmerican democracy: Washington lives under the same rules as the rest \nof America on ObamaCare and on everything else.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, we still remain hopeful as the hours, \nunfortunately, click down towards what could happen in this country if \nwe do not pay our debts. It has never happened in American history. I \nknow when we woke up this morning, when America woke up, they saw \nLeader Reid, the Democratic leader, the majority leader, and Leader \nMcConnell, the Republican leader from Kentucky, coming together in \ndiscussion, coming together on a plan, and they are pretty close to \nagreement.\n  We know there are still problems in the House of Representatives. I \nthink some of us in this body are fans of Abraham Lincoln, and many of \nus have studied a lot of things Lincoln said and did. Lincoln used to \ntalk about--when his staff wanted him to stay at the White House to win \nthe war and free the slaves and preserve the Union--he said: I have to \ngo out and get my public opinion bath.\n  I think some of my colleagues in the House could learn something from \ngoing out and listening to real people, not just going on talk radio, \nnot just going to their country clubs, but to listen to people talk \nabout their lives and what this government shutdown has meant.\n\n[[Page S7486]]\n\n  It has meant more than 50,000 jobs in my State--people who are \nfurloughed. Madam President, 97 percent of NASA employees in Cleveland \nand Sandusky in northern Ohio have been furloughed. We know what it has \nmeant to Battelle Memorial Institute, one of the great research \nfacilities in the country. They run the energy labs. We know what it \nhas meant to people who depend on Meals On Wheels and food stamps and \ndepend on food safety and meat inspections and all that government \ndoes.\n  We know long term what this shutdown or repeated shutdowns in the \nfuture do. That is why these negotiations are so important that \nMajority Leader Reid is insisting that every time somebody says: I am \ngoing to shut the government down, you do not repeal a law for them \nbecause then that is what becomes a matter of course.\n  If you are a research scientist and you are funded by an NIH grant at \nCase Western Reserve University in Cleveland or you are at Wright State \nUniversity and are a medical researcher or you are doing aeronautics \nresearch at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base or at NASA Glenn, if you \nsee these interruptions, if you are furloughed for 3 weeks in October \n2013 and then again some time next year, and again, you--some of the \nmost talented researchers--are going to walk away, and we are going to \nlose so much of the edge we have in this country.\n  We are still the leading economy in the world. We are the greatest \ncountry in the world because, as the Presiding Officer knows in \nWisconsin, we have built the kind of intellectual and physical \ninfrastructure the world has never seen--whether it is the University \nof Wisconsin, which is a great university, not quite as great as a \nslightly larger one in Columbus, but whether it is a great university, \nwhether it is medical research, whether it is building highways and \npublic transit and aeronautics and all that we do as a nation and we \nhave done together, we cannot lose that edge. These government \nshutdowns and threats are damaging not just to the economy today but to \nour long-term future as a nation.\n  That is why I am hopeful, as Senator McConnell and Senator Reid have \nworked together and come close to an agreement, that the House of \nRepresentatives will understand how important this is to the future of \nour Nation. All we are asking is--once we get this agreement in the \nSenate--that Speaker Boehner simply go along; otherwise, it really is a \nbetrayal of our values and our future and us as a great country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. What is the pending status of the Senate floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is on the motion to proceed to S. \n1569.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I rise to speak for approximately 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. We are 33 hours away from the possible default of the \nUnited States of America on its debt obligations. We are 33 hours away \nfrom the possibility of the United States of America becoming a \ndeadbeat nation, not paying its bills to its own people and other \ncreditors.\n  We are 33 hours away from our T-bills becoming a junk bond. It is \nunacceptable that our T-bills, our Treasury bills, should move to a \njunk-bond status. We have to get rid of that and we have to get rid of \nthe junk talk that is going on around here.\n  The Congress of the United States must have a sense of urgency and \ncome together on a program that ensures the United States of America \npays its bills and opens its government to serve its own people and to \nserve the role we play around the world.\n  I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, let us pass the \nframework that was originally suggested yesterday by the Democratic \nleader Senator Reid and by Senator McConnell, our Republican leader. \nMaybe it is not something all of us would have written, but it is \nsomething we could all do. It means the President would sign it, the \ngovernment would reopen, we could extend the debt ceiling, and we could \nbe working on both our budget and our Senate appropriations.\n  I say, as the chair of the Appropriations Committee, I am eager to go \nto work. I am eager to fashion that bipartisan compromise within the \nSenate in terms of what our spending should be, how we could make sure \nit is affordable, frugal, makes good investments in the American \nframework, makes sure we have national security physical \ninfrastructure, meets compelling human need, and conducts research and \ndevelopment.\n  We can do this. I spoke with my House counterparts. We are eager to \ngo to work, but in order to negotiate we must have this agreement.\n  I am very adamant that before we can get to appropriations and our \nbudget, we have to raise the debt ceiling. If we fail or falter to \naddress the crisis, the United States of America will irrevocably be \naffected. This is a manufactured crisis. It is a manufactured crisis \nbecause it is a self-inflicted crisis. This is not what our global \ncompetitors are doing to us. This is not what Russia is doing to us. \nThis is not what China is doing to us. This is what the House of \nRepresentatives is doing to us.\n  I thought we had an agreement arrived at by two mature leaders \nwilling to do statesmanship rather than brinkmanship. That became the \nmantra of the day, statesmanship over gamesmanship. We felt very good \nabout it last night when we went home. It was going to take give. \nCertainly, it was going to take give from we appropriators, but that is \nOK. That is the American way.\n  Now we are on the verge of being a deadbeat nation. How humiliating \nis this, that the Federal Government, already shut down for 2 weeks, \ncould be heading for default. The full faith and credit of the United \nStates has always been the international standard for investment in the \nworld and now it is a question mark.\n  There is a lot of confusion about debt ceiling and what it means. \nDebt ceiling doesn't mean permission to acquire new spending, it means \nto acquire funds to pay bills we have acquired in the past. The debt \nceiling determines how much the government can borrow to pay for the \nprograms it has already enacted. I wish to repeat it allows the United \nStates to pay the bills it has already incurred.\n  Opponents of raising the debt ceiling say that by blocking an \nincrease, it is going to save the United States money. That is simply \nnot true. We don't save money by not paying our bills. Do you know what \nhappens when someone doesn't pay their bills? They get a lousy credit \nrating. When someone gets a lousy credit rating, he or she has to pay \nmore for what they want to buy if they have a terrible credit rating. \nIt is as if we are moving into payday loans.\n  This is the United States of America. We don't just erase the debt by \nnot paying our bills. In fact, we end up owing more money, as I said, \nbecause our interest rates go up. The consequences of a default are \nsignificant and severe. For the House of Representatives to say no, to \nwant to give up and say no to what we are working on in the Senate is \nthe height of dangerous behavior.\n  The Treasury Department warns that default could create a worse \neconomic crisis than 2008 and could cause more damage that might last \nover more than a generation. A generation is 20 years. I don't want \nchildren who are now 6, 7, and 8 years old to grow up in a country that \nis viewed as an international deadbeat. I don't want to derail our \neconomic recovery. Economists predict we could lose over 600,000 jobs \nand 401(k)s would be hit hard.\n  The President would also have to decide who gets limited government \nmoney. We will operate only over existing limited government revenue. \nShould we pay our troops, continue Social Security checks? What should \nwe do?\n  This isn't only about let's squeeze government programs. This is \ngoing to put the squeeze on Medicare and Social Security. I went \nthrough this in the 1995 government shutdown. The consequences are very \nsevere to Social Security. Each month Social Security\n\n[[Page S7487]]\n\npays about $70 billion in benefits to 63 million Americans. Most \nbenefits are made to retirees and people with disabilities. October 16, \ntomorrow, we have a bill due of $13 billion. On October 23, the next \nround of Social Security checks go out, which is $13 billion. November \n1 is another $27 billion with another $4 billion in SSI benefits.\n  If we have default, we might have to delay benefits. They could be \ndelayed until there is enough revenue in the Treasury to cover the \npayments due that day. Let me paint the picture. Within the next 4 \nweeks, we have $70 billion worth of benefits due in Social Security. \nJack Lew, the Secretary of the Treasury, says that on October 17 it \nwill be $30 billion. In Social Security alone, we have a $40 billion \ndecline and a gap. The Bipartisan Policy Center estimates that not \nraising the debt ceiling could delay the November 1 payment by 2 weeks. \nWe are talking about delaying Social Security. That is an earned \nbenefit.\n  I would like to say what it also means to Medicare. On Medicare, if \nthe government fails to pay, Medicare payments would be delayed. \nMedicare pays providers and also covers the prescription drug benefit. \nLet us go to the prescription drug benefit, which means a lot to many \npeople. If someone needs prescription drugs to control blood pressure, \nto control blood sugar, to take an anticoagulant to prevent heart \nattack or stroke, he or she needs Medicare. About $5.2 billion worth of \nMedicare payments to private insurance companies for the drug coverage \nis due on November 1.\n  On November 1, the U.S. Government is supposed to pay its share to \nprivate insurance companies to cover the prescription drug benefit. If \nit doesn't do that, what is a private insurance company going to do? \nThey are supposed to help administer this Medicare Part D benefit. Will \nthe insurance companies continue to provide prescription drugs if they \ndon't get paid by us?\n  What happens to the seniors? I don't know.\n  Let us go to providers. Medicare pays doctors and hospitals that \ntreat Medicare patients. Under the law, they are supposed to be paid \nwithin 14 days. Every day, 5 million claims worth about $1 billion are \npaid to either hospitals or doctors. If we don't have money to pay that \nhospital or to repay that doctor for services rendered, will they \ncontinue to treat Medicare patients? Will hospitals continue to admit \nthem? I am sure they would do it in an emergency, but the whole idea of \nbeing able to see your doctor is to avoid an emergency. Doctors are \nalready hesitant about Medicare because of the Spartan reimbursement, \nbut now we are talking about maybe no reimbursement at all for weeks at \na time. Why? Not because of a natural disaster but because of politics, \npolitics, politics, politics.\n  The other side, particularly the other side of the dome in the House, \nmight not like ObamaCare. There are those on the other side of the \naisle who don't like ObamaCare. I think everybody likes Medicare. No \nmatter what one thinks about ObamaCare--and I do believe President \nObama does care and that is a good thing to call that health care \nprogram--but I do believe everyone likes Medicare. I know no Senator, \nno Member of the House of Representatives, who would like to end the \nMedicare Program.\n  If we default, we could be ending Medicare as we know it. We will \nshake the very confidence in the provider system. We will shake the \nvery confidence that we have in a partnership between Medicare, private \ninsurance, and the people who need health care. What is it that we are \ndoing? Again, this is a self-inflicted manufactured crisis.\n  I say to the House of Representatives, listen to the framework of the \nSenate bill. Let's not add a lot of other issues the House might like \nto bring up. Let us pass the framework that was discussed by Senators \nReid and McConnell yesterday.\n  There was a lot of give-and-take, that we would reopen government. By \nDecember 15, the Budget Committee will have met. By January 15 we would \nhave produced our spending bill for 2014, and we would lift the debt \nceiling until February 7. I think that would be a good way to go.\n  One might say shouldn't the Budget Committee meet anyway? You betcha. \nSenator Murray passed her budget bill on May 23 by almost 70 votes in \nthe Senate, but she could not go negotiate with Paul Ryan because six \nSenators on the other side of the aisle objected. Now we have to pass \nlegislation mandating following the law.\n  We are now passing a law to tell them to follow the law. I am willing \nto pass a law to tell them to follow the law, because in order for me \nas the chair of the committee, working with my vice chairman Senator \nShelby, a really rock-ribbed fiscal conservative--we have a lot of \nnegotiating back and forth, but we have an atmosphere of civility, \ncandor, and an interest in the good of the country. We can get it done. \nWe know we have to give and take. I know as a Democrat I have to, and I \nam willing to do it. I called him this morning and reaffirmed my \ncommitment to work in the spirit of compromise.\n  So let's get on with it. Thirty-three hours to go--now it is 32 hours \nand 45 minutes to go. The clock is ticking on the United States of \nAmerica and its standing in the world. I urge us to come together, that \nthe Senate be able to move the framework discussed by our leadership; \nthat the House take it up, pass it, and we get on to doing the \ngovernance we were elected to do.\n  I yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask consent to speak in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, it has now been 2 weeks since the launch \nof the insurance exchanges that were created by President Obama's \nhealth care law. After 2 weeks of delays, error messages, things the \nPresident calls glitches, the American people are united in saying that \nthis is what a train wreck looks like. A recent poll by the Associated \nPress found that only 7 percent of Americans say this rollout has gone \neither very well or extremely well. The Obama administration continues \nto say the problems were just because of too many people trying to \ncheck out the Web site the first day.\n  I bring to the floor the front page of Sunday's New York Times, \nSunday, October 13, now 13 days into the exchange, with the headline \nabove the fold, front page on Sunday: ``From the Start, Signs of \nTrouble at Health Portal. Many Deadlines Missed. Web Site Problems May \nImperil Finances of Insurance Market.'' This is a front-page story. It \ncontinues inside the paper. It says:\n\n       In March, Henry Chao, the chief digital architect for the \n     Obama administration's new online insurance marketplace, told \n     industry executives that he was deeply worried about the Web \n     site's debut. ``Let's just make sure it's not a third-world \n     experience,'' he told them.\n       Two weeks after the rollout, few would say his hopes were \n     realized.\n       For the past 12 days, a system costing more than $400 \n     million and billed as a one-stop click-and-go hub for \n     citizens seeking health insurance has thwarted the efforts of \n     millions to simply log in. The growing national outcry has \n     deeply embarrassed the White House, which has refused to say \n     how many people have enrolled through the federal exchange.\n       Even some supporters of the Affordable Care Act worry that \n     the flaws in the system, if not quickly fixed, could threaten \n     the fiscal health of the insurance initiative, which depends \n     on throngs of customers to spread the risk and keep prices \n     low.\n       ``These are not glitches,'' said an insurance executive who \n     has participated in many conference calls on the federal \n     exchange. Like many people interviewed for this article, the \n     executive spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying he did \n     not wish to alienate the federal officials with whom he \n     works. ``The extent of the problems is pretty enormous. At \n     the end of our calls, people say, `It's awful, just awful.' \n     ''\n\n  At the time, the President of the United States--he and I talked \nabout this directly face to face on Friday at the White House. He said \nwe just have a problem with the cash register. I would say this is a \nWeb site with major flaws. It goes way beyond the cash register.\n  One online database programmer told CBS News:\n\n       It wasn't designed well, it wasn't implemented well, and it \n     looks like nobody tested it.\n\n\n[[Page S7488]]\n\n\n  That is from a computer expert who says he supports the law but the \nWeb site needs a complete overhaul.\n\n       I would be ashamed and embarrassed if my organization \n     delivered something like that.\n\n  Remember, they spent $400 million of hard-earned taxpayer dollars. \nThis guy says he would be ashamed and embarrassed to deliver something \nas bad as the Obama health care exchange.\n  I think the Obama administration should be embarrassed about the \nwhole law. The law wasn't designed well, hasn't been implemented well, \nand it looks as if nobody tested it. The problems we have seen are not \njust first-day glitches. The problems have continued. People still \ncannot sign up easily. It is still not as easy to use as Amazon. \nRemember the President of the United States promised it would be as \neasy to use as amazon.com. Why are there problems 2 weeks later?\n  The CEO of Aetna Insurance said yesterday--this is 2 weeks into it. \nHe said:\n\n       There's so much wrong, you just don't know what's broken \n     until you get a lot more of it fixed.\n\n  We still have no idea how many people have been able to enroll \nsuccessfully. What is the Obama administration continuing to hide?\n  Wolf Blitzer came out last week on CNN and said:\n\n       If they weren't fully ready, they should accept the advice \n     the Republicans are giving them, delay it for a year, get it \n     ready, and make sure it works.\n\n  Even Jon Stewart was asking why the Obama administration gave a 1-\nyear delay to big businesses but not to the American people. Mr. \nPresident, if you are the Obama White House, when you have lost Jon \nStewart, you know things are not going well.\n  The problems do not end with the media or professional comedians. A \nDemocratic Member of the House who actually voted for the health care \nlaw called the launch of the exchanges ``excruciatingly frustrating.'' \nRobert Gibbs, President Obama's former Press Secretary, said yesterday:\n\n       I hope they fire some people who were in charge of making \n     sure that this thing was supposed to work.\n\n  The biggest cheerleaders for the President's health care law are now \nturning against it, the American people do not like it, and people are \nnot buying the administration's excuses for why it has failed. This is, \nof course, bad for the President, but the American people have even \nbigger problems, and that is what we should be really focused on.\n  The White House is worried about how this looks from a PR standpoint. \nWe should also be talking about the real harm this health care law is \ndoing to hard-working Americans and their families and their jobs and \ntheir paychecks. Many of them are going to lose their doctors--doctors \nwho are not included in the insurance plans sold in the exchanges. Many \nare already seeing that their premiums are going up because of all the \nWashington mandates.\n  Remember the President and his promises in passing this health care \nlaw? That is not what the people are seeing today. One mother told a TV \nstation in Allentown, PA, that when she went to sign up on the Web \nsite, she was told her premium would be almost $950 for her family. \nThat is $765 more than she pays now. She told the station, ``It would \ntake food out of our mouths to be able to afford this coverage.'' This \nis what the President of the United States and Democrats in this body \nhave foisted on the American people.\n  People are finding that not just the premiums are going up, but many \nof their other health care costs are also higher.\n  The Chicago Tribune had this headline on Sunday:\n\n       Obamacare deductibles may cause sticker shock. Insurance \n     companies are requiring higher out-of-pocket expenses to pay \n     for complying with new rules.\n\n  Expenses to pay for complying with rules--not expenses to give you \nhealth care, not expenses to keep you healthy, not expenses to prevent \ninjury or illness, but expenses to pay for complying with the rules. \nThat is the Chicago Tribune, the President's hometown newspaper.\n  As if all that weren't bad enough, the administration is still \ninsisting it is going to fine people who don't have insurance, even \nthough people can't sign up on the ObamaCare Web site successfully. The \nadministration was saying that this is a long process and people have \nuntil the end of March of next year to enroll in the exchanges, but \neven that changed last week. Now it turns out people will actually have \nto sign up 6 weeks earlier than that--by Valentine's Day--or pay the \ntax penalty. What we are looking at is a tax penalty at 1 percent of \nincome or $95, whichever is greater that first year. That could be a \nsizable amount of money for some families who thought they were going \nto get affordable insurance under the President's health care law \nbecause that's what the President promised them. He stood in Congress \nand told the American people that. He stood in front of groups all \naround the country, and the American people feel misled and deceived. \nAll of this frustration, expense, stress, and pain was all avoidable.\n  Democrats in Congress and President Obama need to swallow their \npride. They need to admit that the problems with the health care law \nare not limited to a bad Web site. The problems with the health care \nlaw run much deeper, and they are only going to get much worse. We must \ndo something to stop this terrible law from doing more damage to \npeople's jobs, their care, and our country.\n  The President will be held to the promises he made as recently as \n2\\1/2\\ weeks ago: If people like their doctors, they can keep their \ndoctor, the cost will be less than a cell phone bill, and that it will \nbe easier to use than amazon.com.\n  This health care law has failed miserably. We needed health care \nreform so people could get the care they need from a doctor they choose \nat lower costs. They have not gotten it. It is time to repeal and \nreplace this terrible health care law.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask that the senior Senator from South \nCarolina, the senior Senator from Georgia, if he comes to the floor, as \nwell, and I be permitted to enter into a colloquy for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Terrorist Prisoners\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nsomething that is fundamental to all of us, and that is the safety and \nsecurity of our country.\n  On October 5, our special forces did an excellent job in conjunction \nwith our intelligence community, and I commend the administration for \nordering the raid that captured a key Al Qaeda terrorist whose name is \nAbu Anas al-Libi. When they captured him, they put him on a ship.\n  About a week ago, my colleague from South Carolina and my colleague \nfrom Georgia, who is the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, \nstood up and we said: After successfully capturing one of the most \nimportant Al Qaeda members--which is a result of the great work done by \nour special forces and our intelligence agents--why are we putting him \non a ship for purposes of interrogation instead of bringing him to \nGuantanamo Bay detention facility, which is a top-rated detention \nfacility? At Guantanamo Bay we could do a lengthy interrogation of this \nperson who has been associated with Osama bin Laden and the current \nhead of Al Qaeda, Anwar al-Awlaki.\n  He is also charged with participating and being involved in the 1998 \nKenya and Tanzania bombings at the embassies that killed 224 people, \nincluding 12 Americans. He has been described as a potential treasure \ntrove of information about the activities of Al Qaeda and their plans. \nThe information we have, which has been released publicly, is that he \nis someone Anwar al-Awlaki may have sent to Libya to try to make sure \nthat they could have the Al Qaeda network in Libya.\n  Let's not forget what happened on September 11, a year ago, in Libya \nwhere our ambassador and three brave Americans were murdered. Does Mr. \nal-Libi know anything about that?\n  We will never fully know what Mr. al-Libi knows because after a week \non the ship where our intelligence officials were given an opportunity \nto speak to him, he was transferred to a Federal district court, and \ntoday in Federal district court he pled not guilty to the 1998 bombings \nat the embassy. He was given a lawyer. We know\n\n[[Page S7489]]\n\nthat when these terrorists are given a lawyer, it gives them an \nopportunity to say: I will not talk to anyone anymore because I have a \nlawyer. They are told they have the right to remain silent.\n  It is irresponsible for our Nation to capture a top Al Qaeda \nterrorist and tell them a week later: Here is your lawyer and your \nright to remain silent because the most important piece we have to \nprotect our country is information to prevent future attacks and \ninformation that our intelligence officials can use about the Al Qaeda \nnetwork to protect Americans and our allies. That information was given \nup because this administration is so worried and concerned about \npolitical points and closing Guantanamo Bay that they would rather \ntransfer someone who is a key Al Qaeda operative to the Federal \ndistrict court in New York and give him a lawyer a week later, instead \nof a lengthy interrogation designed to find out everything he knows.\n  It took years to get the information that led to the bin Laden raid \nthat captured and killed Osama bin Laden. Yet we only had a week of \ninterrogation with a key Al Qaeda operative because they are so worried \nabout adding more people to those who are present at Guantanamo Bay \nthat they would rather put that political goal above gathering \ninformation to make sure America is protected. It is wrong, and we will \nnever know what information we lost that could have protected Americans \nby only allowing this interrogation to go a week in military custody \ninstead of a lengthy interrogation in a top-rated detention facility.\n  One of the reasons that the administration has given is that he had \nmedical issues. If he did have medical issues, guess what. Guantanamo \nBay actually has top-rated medical facilities. Had we captured him and \nbrought him right there--in fact, these are the same types of medical \nservices that our own men and women in uniform are able to receive. He \ncould have been treated there, and we also could have kept him there \nand made sure that we prioritized getting information about Al Qaeda \nfrom him to prevent future attacks against America and to stop the \nterrorists with this information. The more information we have, the \nbetter we can protect our country.\n  Since I have been a member of the Armed Services Committee, I have \nbeen repeatedly asking the administration: What is your detention and \ninterrogation policy? What if you capture the head of Al Qaeda \ntomorrow? And you know what I get from the top military leaders? I have \ngotten answers such as this: I would need lawyerly help on that one. We \nare still working on our detention and interrogation policy.\n  While they have had years to work on this, we are left where we are: \nA top Al Qaeda terrorist who was captured in Libya and after only a \nweek of interrogation was given a lawyer so they can accomplish their \npolitical goals instead of prioritizing and gathering information from \nsomeone who has known and been involved with Osama bin Laden and knows \nthe current head of Al Qaeda, and finding out what that individual \nknows so we can keep America safe.\n  I hope that the administration will stop doing this. We can't put \npolitics above intelligence gathering to protect our country.\n  I ask the Senator from South Carolina, through the Chair, if he still \nbelieves we are still at war with Al Qaeda? Also, how important is it \nthat we gather information from terrorists who are captured, and that \nthose interrogations be done on a lengthy basis instead of a short \nperiod such as a week?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from New \nHampshire who has been one of the strongest voices since the day she \ngot here in the Senate to talk about the difference between fighting a \nwar and fighting a crime. The Senator has been the attorney general of \nNew Hampshire, and I have been a military lawyer for over 30 years. The \nlegal systems to fight a war are different than the legal systems to \nsolve a domestic crime.\n  Here is the problem: Do I believe Al Qaeda is at war with the United \nStates and our values and our friends? Would they kill us all if they \ncould? Yes.\n  Why did 3,000 Americans die on 9/11/2001? They couldn't kill 3 \nmillion of us. If they could, they would have. If you believe that, \nthen the goal of our generation is to marginalize this movement, and \nwhen we capture one of them, we need to find out what they are up to.\n  Dying for their cause is not a deterrent. It is like first prize. So \nwhen you tell somebody who has joined Al Qaeda that you may die in the \ncourse of this attack, they say good. The goal is to prevent them from \nhitting us, and the best way to do that is through intelligence \ngathering.\n  When you capture someone who is determined by our military and \nintelligence community to be a member of Al Qaeda, then under the law \nof war--the authorization to use military force passed by Congress over \na decade ago--you can hold that person under the law of war to gather \nintelligence.\n  Why is that the case? War is about winning the war. Enemy prisoners \nare valuable captured alive because they can provide information about \nwhat the enemy is up to.\n  When you charge someone with a crime, you cannot spend a long time \nwith them without their lawyer trying figure out if they committed the \ncrime because of the right against self-incrimination in our criminal \njustice system. The military legal system, and the law of war, is \ncompletely different when it comes to asking questions of an enemy \nprisoner about future military activity or what they know about past \noperations.\n  The most dangerous thing we could do as a nation is to treat a \ncaptured Al Qaeda terrorist as a common criminal, read them their \nMiranda rights, and put them in civilian court before we have a chance \nto gather intelligence. That is exactly what the Obama administration \ndid here. To their credit, they captured al-Libi. Here is what breaks \nmy heart the most: The special forces units that go into Libya, \nSomalia, and Pakistan risk their lives to capture these people alive, \nif possible, so we can gather intelligence.\n  It really does bother me that after completing this operation, which \nwas very successful, we only had control of this enemy prisoner for \nabout 10 or 11 days. I will never be convinced that in that short \nperiod of time we were able to gather the intelligence he possessed. He \nhas been associated with Al Qaeda at the highest level for 20 years. He \nwas a treasure trove of information.\n  This was a political decision by the Obama administration, not a \nlegal decision based on the law of war. This is not what our military \nadvises or our intelligence community advises. This is what the \nPresident chose to do because he does not want to use Guantanamo Bay.\n  Why was he placed on a ship? Because there is no prison available in \nthe United States, other than a naval vessel, to hold someone as an \nenemy combatant under the law of war. Why? Because the President \nrefuses to use Guantanamo Bay.\n  If we can close Guantanamo Bay and create a new prison to allow \npeople to be held as enemy combatants, sign me up. But the idea of not \nhaving a jail available to the United States on land at a time of great \nstress, and during a very pivotal moment in the war on terror, is an \nill-conceived and dangerous policy.\n  I applaud the Senator from New Hampshire for bringing up this issue.\n  Here is what we need to understand as Members of Congress: This \npolicy cannot be sustained. When we capture high-value targets, such as \na 20-year veteran of Al Qaeda, we are crazy as a nation not to use the \nlaw of war to gather intelligence.\n  I am not for torturing anyone. I have been a military lawyer for 31 \nyears. I believe in the Geneva Conventions. I believe my country is \nspecial. I believe in the international regimes about how we \ninterrogate prisoners we hold. I know what Al Qaeda does to their \nprisoners. I do not want to be like them. I want to be the United \nStates. But the United States has a right, under the law of war, to \ngather intelligence.\n  The last thing a member of Al Qaeda should hear when they are \ncaptured is: You have a right to remain silent. Here is your lawyer. I \ndon't want them to remain silent. I want them, over time, to provide us \nwith whatever intelligence is available.\n\n  Why was he moved off the ship? Apparently, he had a medical condition \nthat could not be treated on the naval\n\n[[Page S7490]]\n\nvessel. I believe in providing quality health care to prisoners of war \nsimply because I want that standard to be available to our soldiers in \nfuture wars. The standard we set today will follow us into the next war \nand, unfortunately, there will be. But having to take him off the ship \nbecause he was sick is no excuse to stop his interrogation to gather \nintelligence. Putting him on the ship because we don't want to use \nGuantanamo Bay is an ill-conceived and ill-designed strategy that, if \nit is not changed or replaced, is going to come back to haunt this \ncountry.\n  This man possesses an enormous amount of intelligence potential. He \nis now in Federal court. He will be given a lawyer. Once he is charged \nwith a crime, he should be given a lawyer. But before that, we have the \nright under the law of war to hold him to gather intelligence--treat \nhim humanely but question him about what he knows about Al Qaeda, \nbecause they are still out there, lurking.\n  I will end with this. I wish to work with the Senator from New \nHampshire and anybody on the other side who would like to try to find a \ndetention and interrogation policy that is more rationally based. \nGuantanamo Bay, in its early years, did hurt the image of this country. \nSome of our interrogation techniques right after 9/11 hurt us as a \nnation.\n  Guantanamo Bay has been reformed. It is Geneva Convention compliant. \nThe Detainee Treatment Act that I helped author with Senator Levin and \nSenator McCain is the gold standard of how we treat people under the \nlaw of war. I am proud of the system we have created over the last \nseveral years in a bipartisan manner, and I urge this administration to \ncreate a vehicle to interrogate under the law of war people such as al-\nLibi so we can be prepared for the next attack. The policy they have in \nplace today is going to deny this country the ability to gather \nvaluable intelligence.\n  When it comes to defeating Al Qaeda, the more we know about how they \nbehave and what they are up to the safer we will be, because they will \nnot be deterred by the threat of death. We cannot deter them; we have \nto stop them. We have to hit them before they hit us, and the best way \nto do that is to gather intelligence when we find someone such as al-\nLibi.\n  I am very disappointed that we have blown it when it comes to \nintelligence gathering with this high-value target. I am very sad to \nreport to the military members and their families that the bravery they \nhave demonstrated and shown just a few weeks ago has been undermined, \nin my view, by an irrational political decision that denies our country \nthe ability to learn from a high-value target they risked their life to \ncapture.\n  I don't know how to fix this in the current political environment, \nbut I know as a military lawyer it needs to be fixed, and I know we are \nnot elevating our country by diminishing our ability to use legal \nsystems that have been around for hundreds of years at a time when we \nneed them the most. So I look forward to working with the Senator from \nNew Hampshire who has become one of the leading voices when it comes to \ndetention and interrogation under the law of war.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Let me make a correction for the Record. I used the name al-Maliki. \nIt is Ayman al-Zawahiri who is the current head of Al Qaeda, and that \nis whose name I meant to say.\n  The point is this: If we capture al-Zawahiri tomorrow, are we going \nto put him on the ship, and is he only going to be on the ship for a \nweek when we gather information from him to ask him what future attacks \nhe is planning against America and our allies? Does that make any \nsense? And then we are going to give him a lawyer and tell him he has \nthe right to remain silent? No. What makes the most sense is that we \nhave a detention and interrogation policy so that with people such as \nal-Libi, we take as much time as we need to make sure we find out \neverything they know about Al Qaeda to protect America, and if we \ncapture Zawahiri tomorrow, we make sure we protect America by finding \nout everything he knows. That is what we are worried about and that is \nwhat we need to do for our country.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We are throwing around names. I think Zawahiri is the \nperson who took bin Laden's place. If we captured him tomorrow, that \nwould be the ultimate treasure trove.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Right.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Can the Senator from New Hampshire tell us a little bit \nabout this individual called al-Libi? Why do we believe he would be \nsuch a treasure trove? What is his background? How long has he been \ninvolved in Al Qaeda? And what have we missed here? What opportunities \nhave we lost by only holding him as an enemy combatant for less than 2 \nweeks?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. al-Libi is someone who is alleged to have been \ninvolved in Al Qaeda for decades. He is someone who as early as the \n1990s was working with Osama bin Laden. He is alleged to have been \ninvolved with--and that is what he is charged with in Federal court, as \nI mentioned--the 1998 bombings of the Kenya and Tanzania Embassies that \nkilled 224 people, including 12 Americans.\n  He reportedly played a critical role as the intermediary between al-\nZawahiri, whom we just discussed, who took over for Osama bin Laden as \nthe head of Al Qaeda in an effort to establish an Al Qaeda-affiliated \noperation network in Libya where our Ambassador, of course, was \nmurdered, along with three brave Americans, last September 11. He has \nbeen reported to be an Al Qaeda computer intelligence and operations \nsecurity expert, and he is alleged to have been involved in Al Qaeda \nstrategic planning.\n  This is one of the most important captures we have had in years of Al \nQaeda.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, if the Senator from New Hampshire will \nyield for one more inquiry. He was captured in Tripoli, Libya; is that \nright?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We believe he was in Libya before the attack on our \nconsulate in Benghazi, right?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Right.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We also know him to be one of the higher level Al Qaeda \noperatives roaming the planet. He was involved in bombing our Embassies \nin 1998 in Kenya and Tanzania; is that correct?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. That is right.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. What are the odds that he was in Tripoli before the \nBenghazi attack, had a record of bombing embassies in the 1990s, and \nhad nothing to do with the consulate attack in Benghazi? The Senator \nfrom New Hampshire is a prosecutor. What does my colleague think the \nodds are of this guy not having any knowledge or involvement in killing \nour Ambassador in Benghazi and being involved in the attack on our \nconsulate that was organized by Al Qaeda affiliates? And what have we \nlearned, if anything, about his potential involvement in Benghazi? How \ncan we learn everything this man has done in 11 or 12 days before we \ngive him a lawyer? I would argue we can't.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you. I would argue we can't possibly understand all \nhe knows about Benghazi in the last 20 years of terrorism by holding \nhim on a ship for less than 2 weeks. He should be held at Gitmo as long \nas it takes to find out what he knows and then he should be tried. Does \nthe Senator from New Hampshire agree with that?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I agree. We need to protect our country. That means a lot \nlonger than a week interrogation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I might for a moment, we have had dozens \nand dozens of terrorists who have been arrested. We had the so-called \nUnderwear Bomber, a member of Osama bin Laden's family, and many \nothers. They were all given their Miranda warning and they wouldn't \nshut up. They kept talking day after day after day. It has been my \nexperience that if they are going to talk, they are going to talk, \nwhether they are given a Miranda warning or not. Wouldn't it be nice if \nwe demonstrated to the rest of the world that we are not afraid of \nthese\n\n[[Page S7491]]\n\npeople, and that we have the best system of justice in the world and we \nare going to use it? We have only had three or four convictions by \nmilitary commissions in terrorism cases; we have had several hundred \nconvictions in our Federal courts.\n  It is not responsible for Senators to talk about: Oh, my gosh, if we \njust sent them to Guantanamo. Guantanamo by itself is damaging to the \nUnited States and harms the image of the United States.\n  The fact of the matter is that the people we have arrested and who \nwent through our court system will usually talk ad nauseam, whether \nthey have been given the Miranda warning or not. So let's be realistic. \nIt might be a nice talking point to scare people, but the people who \nare actually involved in prosecutions know it works.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, yesterday we heard very optimistic \nnews about steering away from the brink of American default before it \nbecame too late. Majority leader Harry Reid came to the floor and gave \nvery optimistic reports. Minority leader Mitch McConnell came to the \nfloor and gave very optimistic reports. They hinted very strongly that \na deal was close, and time was scheduled with the caucuses, presumably \nto make a presentation of the deal. And then what?\n  We have had some very interesting speeches and colloquies from our \nRepublican colleagues on the floor. I found the debate as to whether \nour defense and law enforcement experts had kept an Al Qaeda captive in \nthe right location to be interesting. I found the earlier discussion \nabout the insurance exchange Web sites to be a very interesting \ndiscussion. I found the discussion earlier this morning about Iran to \nbe a very interesting discussion. What is even more interesting is what \nthey are not talking about. What they are not talking about is that \ntoday the Republican leader pulled out of those very productive \nnegotiations and very optimistic negotiations--pulled out of those \nnegotiations that promised an end to this crisis. I find that \nabsolutely stunning. I am amazed, while we are in a situation where we \nare that close to resolving this crisis and avoiding the catastrophes \nthat have been predicted, that one side would simply walk away. I don't \nblame the minority leader. The information I have is that he was asked \nto do so, that the message came from the other side, from the Speaker; \nthat Speaker Boehner torpedoed the productive bipartisan Senate \nnegotiations that were at the brink of resolving this crisis.\n  Instead of the bipartisan successful process, Speaker Boehner has \nwanted to interrupt and bring in the same partisan House process that \nhas been a disaster for us over and over--100-percent partisan, 100-\npercent politics.\n  We have sent bills over to the House. Those bills have never been \nbrought up for a vote. They have been monkeyed with before they have \nbrought them up, but House Members have never had the chance to vote on \na Senate-approved measure, which would have ended this. That is the \nSpeaker's choice. It is the so-called Hastert rule, which means that \nunless a strong majority of the Republicans are for something, he won't \ngive Democrats a chance to even vote, let alone to be a part of the \nnegotiations.\n  Here in the Senate we have bipartisan negotiations, with the leaders \nfrom both sides still with optimism and hope. On the other side, we \nhave a leadership that won't talk to the Democrats, has purely made \npartisan decisions about whether something should come to the floor, \nand has not yet brought a Senate bill to the floor for a clean vote. It \nis a nightmare over there. And the strategy has not worked, in case \nthey did not get the memo.\n\n  Holding the economy hostage was a terrible choice for the Speaker. \nCausing the shutdown was a terrible choice. Holding the credit of the \nU.S. Government hostage has been a terrible choice. To use words that \nwere used on the floor this morning by one of our Republican friends, \nit was a ``fool's errand''--it was a ``fool's errand''--that put the \nparty ``in a ditch.''\n  Well, unfortunately, because he is the Speaker, it is not just the \nRepublican Party that is in the ditch. The whole country is in the \nditch as this default looms. Some of them are trying to get out of the \ndifficulty they find themselves in by pretending that the default is \nnot real. We have default deniers now side by side, I guess, with the \nclimate deniers and the other deniers. They deny that October 17 is the \nreal date when anything might go wrong. They deny that anything bad \nwill actually really happen if the U.S. Government defaults. They \ndeny--if we just pay the Treasury bills and leave other things unpaid--\nanything really bad will happen.\n  Treasury bills get sold in an auction, in a market. If you are going \nto that auction to buy Treasury bills and you see a government that is \nnot paying Social Security recipients on time, that has massive \nliquidity and cashflow problems as a result of the debt limit failure, \nwe may say: Yes, we will pay you first, but are you really going to pay \nthe same rate for that security of that country while that country is \nfacing all of these other problems? It is a preposterous notion. It is \nthe type of notion that you can only believe when you absolutely need \nto believe it for your ideological purposes. Reality simply does not \nsupport a notion like that. If you are living in a cocoon world of \nextremist ideology, you can come up with thoughts like that. And if you \nare only talking to other people who think the same way, you can kind \nof agree that thought makes sense. But there is a little problem. \nReality wins. Reality always wins.\n  They are playing with dynamite over there, and they are pretending \nthat it is not even dangerous. It would be one thing if we understood \nthat they respected how very dangerous the stunts are that they are \npulling in the House Republican leadership. It is even more dangerous \nwhen they do not appear to know the danger they are causing for our \neconomy.\n  I hope we will get back to work here in the Senate right away with a \nbipartisan solution to this rather than allowing the House and the \nSpeaker to wreck the opportunity we had as late as yesterday in order \nto play dangerous partisan games. We do not have the time for that, and \nit is the wrong thing. It is the wrong thing in a very immediate way in \nterms of the damage it will do to our economy, to the world economy, to \npeople across this country whose interest rates are pegged to Treasury \nbills, to anybody who depends on an economy where people have \nconfidence that the United States is a solid investment and have \nconfidence that our economy is going to grow. The default puts all that \nat risk. It creates real economic hazards for our country. But the \nmethod of getting us here has additional hazards, and I would like to \nclose by talking about them.\n  From the very founding of this Republic, we have prided ourselves on \nour distinct American system of government. We have fought for it. We \nhave protected it. It has seen us through world wars, civil wars, great \ndepressions, great recessions, all types of calamity. What it \nfundamentally is--the phrase we use probably as much as any other about \nour country is that it is a government of laws. It risks being turned \ninto--by a very small faction in one party in one House in one branch \nof government--a government not of laws but of threats, a government \nwhere the person who can make the scariest threat wins.\n  It does not matter that what they are objecting to was passed in the \nregular order, passed by both Houses of Congress, signed into law by \nthe President, approved by the Supreme Court. It does not matter that \nit was the center of the last Presidential election and that their \npoint of view lost convincingly. What matters to them is if they can \nmake dangerous enough threats, they may be able to try to get their way \nanyway--anyway. That is not the way a government of laws behaves. That \nis the way a government of threats behaves.\n  If we go down the road of a government of threats, we will be taking \na very big step away from our American heritage, away from the \nprocedures of our American Constitution, and away from the values that \nhave seen us through hundreds of years of growth and pride. It is a \ndangerous point, and the fact that they are willing to do that, the \nfact that they are willing to not only wreck the economy but to wreck \nthe status of this country as one that is run by a government of laws\n\n[[Page S7492]]\n\nand turn it instead into a government of threats, shows how shallowly \nthey wear their patriotism on their sleeves. It is bunkum patriotism to \nput the real values of this country into the hopper and turn us into a \ngovernment of threats instead of a government of laws.\n  A great judge, a Supreme Court Justice, once said: Procedure is the \nbone structure of a democratic society. Breaking those bones to make \nyour point is no way to enhance our democratic society.\n  So I hope the majority leader and the minority leader will resume \ntheir negotiations right away. I hope, frankly, they have begun already \nand I just do not know about it yet. But we have to get going. And if \nthe minority leader is unwilling to tell Speaker Boehner: No. Knock it \noff. You have done enough damage already. We are going to solve this in \nthe Senate, and we are going to sit down and have a bipartisan \ncompromise--if he is unwilling to say that, then we need to come back \nto the floor and we need to bring up the bill the Republicans \nfilibustered on Saturday that would have gotten us out of this pickle. \nTime is short. We have to get moving. If our colleagues on the other \nside then want to filibuster--to filibuster--the solution to this debt \nlimit crisis, they will have shown their hand in a very dangerous way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, a couple of hours ago I was on the Senate \nfloor urging and encouraging the House to act on a compromise proposal \nto deal with the current fiscal issues before us that included the ``no \nWashington exemption'' from the ObamaCare language.\n  As I said, I think that is very important for two reasons; one, the \nprinciple. I think the first rule of American democracy should be that \nWashington lives by the same rules as it imposes on America under \nObamaCare, under everything; secondly, a very practical consideration. \nI think the quicker we do that, the quicker we start getting things \nright. The quicker we start understanding in a gut, personal way the \nreal challenges and burdens of ObamaCare, the quicker we start changing \nthat.\n  I return just a couple of hours later to congratulate the House \nbecause they are apparently moving in exactly that direction. All \nindications are that they will be going to the Rules Committee very \nsoon with a package that features--that has as its centerpiece that \n``no Washington exemption'' from ObamaCare language.\n  Again, I think it is important for all the reasons I said. I also \nwant to point out that assuming the House passes that--I think they are \ngoing to tonight--that ``no Washington exemption'' language will be the \nonly thing--the only substantial thing in that proposal that has not \nbeen essentially agreed to by Senate Democrats. Everything else is \ndetail, a date here, minor provisions. The only major difference \nbetween what the House is hopefully passing tonight and what has been \nagreed to in discussions by Senate Democrats is that ``no Washington \nexemption'' language.\n  So the question will be is this perceived crisis, is this standoff \ngoing to continue over that, over Members protecting their wallets, \ntheir special elite status, demanding that they are treated differently \nthan other Americans under ObamaCare? Is it going to continue and not \nbe resolved over that?\n  I think that is what it will all be about, again assuming, as I hope \nit does, the House passes this proposal tonight. Again, the ObamaCare \nlanguage, the statute itself does not allow for this special exemption \nor special subsidy. That is nowhere in the statue. Because of that, it \nwas sort of an example of what Nancy Pelosi said about the ObamaCare \nstatute in general: We have to pass it to figure out what is in it. It \npassed with language in it that said clearly, Members of Congress and \ntheir staff would have to go to the ObamaCare exchanges for their \nhealth care--no provisions for any special subsidy.\n  Then, after it passed, many folks on Capitol Hill read it to figure \nout what was in it. When they got to that section, they said: Oh, you \nknow what. We cannot live under this. We cannot stand for this.\n  So then a fierce lobbying campaign started to get the administration \nto fix ObamaCare--but not to fix it for America, to fix it for \nCongress. That resulted in a special Obama administration rule that was \nconveniently issued right as Congress was leaving Washington for the \nAugust recess, right as Congress was fleeing the scene of the crime.\n  That rule did two things, neither of which is in the statute. That is \nwhy it is a completely illegal rule, contrary to the statute, in my \nopinion. First of all, the rule said: When the statute says that \nMembers of Congress and their staff have to go to the exchanges for \ntheir health care, we do not know who official staff are. We cannot \nfigure that out, the administrative agency said. So we are going to \nleave that up to each individual Member of Congress.\n  That is absurd. The language is clear. All official staff are \ncovered. The administration should have demanded in the rule that all \nofficial staff are covered and not leave it up to individual Members. \nBut under this cozy relationship, an individual Member can exempt any \nstaffer he or she likes. In fact, in theory, that Member can exempt all \nof his staff and say: It is up to me. They are not official staff for \npurposes of this provision of ObamaCare. That is absurd on its face.\n  Then the second thing this special rule only did for Congress is say: \nFor those who go to the exchanges, including Members, they get to take \na huge taxpayer-funded subsidy with them, a subsidy available to no \nother American at that income level--no other American. That is not in \nthe ObamaCare statute. That is made up out of thin air in terms of this \nrule.\n  So we need to correct that situation. We need to make sure Washington \nis treated like America; first, because it is the right thing to do. It \nshould be the first guiding principle of American democracy; second, \nfor the practical reasons I stated. The quicker we do that on ObamaCare \nand across the board, the quicker Washington, the Congress, the \nPresident, will start getting important matters, including the impact \nof ObamaCare, right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. VITTER. I will in a second. Again, I congratulate the House for \ndoing exactly that, for doing exactly that. Again, I would point out, \nassuming the House does that and passes that tonight, the only \nsignificant difference between their package and what Senate Democrats \nhave agreed to in discussions will be this ``no Washington exemption'' \nlanguage from ObamaCare.\n  There will be other very minor differences: a date here, language \nregarding how income verification is handled, very minor compared to \nthis central issue. So that is what it is coming down to. That will be \nwhat Senate action on that House proposal is about.\n  I will be happy to yield to my distinguished colleague from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, through the Chair, since the Senator from \nLouisiana has raised on the floor many times the issue of the health \ninsurance of Members of Congress, I would volunteer that I am under the \nFederal Employees Health Benefit Program, some 8 million Federal \nemployees, including Members of Congress and their staff, are currently \nunder the same health insurance program across the Nation.\n  I have the same health insurance policy as the park ranger at the \nLincoln home in Springfield, IL. I would ask the Senator from \nLouisiana: What is your health insurance policy?\n  Mr. VITTER. I am under exactly the same program. What I am suggesting \nis merely that we follow the law. The distinguished Senator and many of \nhis Democratic colleagues constantly make the point that ObamaCare is \nthe law of the land. He is right. I want to change that, largely; the \nSenator does not. It is the law of the land as we speak. That law of \nthe land is crystal clear. It has a specific provision about this. It \nsays every Member of Congress, all of their official staff can no \nlonger stay in that plan and have to go to the ObamaCare exchanges, the \nso-called\n\n[[Page S7493]]\n\nfallback provision for the American people.\n  I think there was a reason for that. I think there was thinking \nbehind that. It is simple; that we should live under that same scenario \nthat millions of Americans have to live under, 8 million-plus, who do \nnot want to have to go to the exchanges, who like the insurance plan \nthey have now, who heard the President say: If you like the plan you \nhave now, you can keep it. They found out after the fact that was not \ntrue for them.\n  There are 8 million-plus who are being forced off coverage they like \nto go to the ObamaCare exchanges. They do not get any subsidy. They do \nnot get this special treatment. I am suggesting we should not as well.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. VITTER. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I hope the Senator will concede that Members of Congress \nand their staff are going into the insurance exchanges because of an \nexpress provision requiring that to happen in the law, offered by \nRepublican Senators Coburn and Grassley.\n  Secondly, what we are dealing with is a strange situation. ObamaCare \ndoes not force anybody into the insurance exchanges. It is available \nfor those who have no health insurance or those who are on individual \nhealth insurance plans and want to buy something different.\n  Mr. VITTER. If I can respond and reclaim my time, I do not think that \nis true at all. I think ObamaCare absolutely forces millions of other \nAmericans into the exchanges. It is not the same mechanism that it is \nfor Members of Congress. It is not an express provision. But it is \nforcing 8 million-plus Americans into the exchanges against their will \nnonetheless because there are many Americans who want to keep the \ncoverage they have. They heard over and over from President Obama: If \nyou like the coverage you have, you can keep it. Then they found out \nthat for them that was a lie. They did like the coverage they had. They \nare losing it against their will. I do not think that is by accident. I \nthink that is by design because the ObamaCare statute creates clear \nincentives for many employers to get out of the health insurance \nprovision business and to just let their workers go to the exchanges.\n  So I completely disagree with the statement from the Senator from \nIllinois that no other American was forced onto the exchanges. Millions \nof other Americans were forced onto the exchanges, in a different way, \nbut absolutely millions of Americans were forced onto the exchanges \nagainst their will.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. VITTER. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Since the Senator is under the Federal Employees Health \nBenefit Program, his monthly premiums for his health insurance and my \nhealth insurance receive an employer contribution. That is how most \nAmericans who work get their health insurance. The employer \ncontribution the Senator receives and I receive is about 72 percent of \nthe premium.\n  The Senator from Louisiana has characterized an employer contribution \nas a government subsidy. I would like to ask the Senator from \nLouisiana, is he prepared to disclose the government subsidy, as he \ncalls it, that he has personally received for his health insurance as a \nMember of the Senate?\n  Mr. VITTER. Absolutely. Reclaiming my time and reclaiming the floor, \nthat is absolutely public information. That is true. What I am merely \nsuggesting is that ObamaCare mandates the change. That is the law of \nthe land, as the Senator and his Democratic colleagues make the point \nmany times, and we should live by the law of the land.\n  As the distinguished Senator from Illinois absolutely knows, there is \nno provision in the ObamaCare statute for that subsidy to transfer to \nthe exchanges for Members or congressional staff, no provision \nwhatsoever. In fact, having that happen is inconsistent with the law \nbecause the requirements of exchange policies are different than the \nrequirements for FEHBP policies, so it is completely inconsistent with \nthe law for that subsidy to follow Members of Congress to the \nexchanges. It is nowhere mentioned in the statute. It was made up out \nof thin air under this illegal Obama administration rule with no \nsufficient statutory basis in the law.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. VITTER. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator is stating that no one under an insurance \nexchange, no one, can receive an employer contribution for their health \ninsurance, he is wrong, flat wrong.\n  Mr. VITTER. Reclaiming my time and reclaiming the floor, I did not \nstate that and I will not state that.\n  What I did say is there is no subsidy available to Members of \nCongress and congressional staff under the ObamaCare statute. There is \nno provision in the statute for that old FEHBP subsidy to magically \nredo itself as an exchange subsidy. There is absolutely no provision of \nthat whatsoever.\n  Folks, these 8 million Americans who are forced out of the plans they \nlike, they are not getting a subsidy. They are going to the individual \nexchange, and they are getting no comparable subsidy. If they have low \nenough income they get a subsidy for being at a certain income level.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Louisiana has \nexpired.\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you. I urge again that the Senate stand tall and \nstand with the American people, not stand for Washington elites.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am pleased to have this exchange with my colleague \nbecause he comes to the floor repeatedly and says things which aren't \naltogether accurate. This is why I wanted to speak to him today. He \nyielded for a question and I thank him. I am sorry he has left because \nI would like to further engage in dialog. There is a reason he left. \nThere are questions he can't answer. If he tries to answer them, his \nwhole case explodes in front of him.\n  We created these insurance exchanges for 40 or 50 million Americans \nwho have no health insurance or have rotten insurance. They were paying \na fortune for bad health insurance policies.\n  When the Senator says 8 million people were forced into these \nexchanges, this is what the Senator was saying--8 million people had \nhealth insurance policies that were so bad that those policies, \nfrankly, had to be rewritten.\n  This is what we said and is the law under ObamaCare. Offer health \ninsurance to my family or the family of the Senator from Connecticut. \nThey cannot discriminate against a person applying for health insurance \nbecause of preexisting conditions of anybody in your family. Does \nanybody in your family have preexisting conditions? We all do.\n  We decided that was fundamentally unfair. If one has a child with \nasthma, wife with diabetes, mental illness in your family, for \ngoodness' sake, people shouldn't be discriminated against. That is one \nof the provisions of ObamaCare which many on the other side of the \naisle want to repeal.\n  Secondly, we said there can be no lifetime limits on your health \ninsurance policy. What does that mean? In the old days people would buy \na policy that said they would give up to $100,000 and then the \npolicyholder is on his own--$100,000. That ought to be great until one \nends up in the doctor's office the next day or someone in your family \nhas a serious cancer diagnosis. With surgery, chemo, and radiation \ngoing on for a long period of time, it can be way over $100,000. It can \nhappen.\n  I had a routine surgery 3 years ago, and it turned out well. It cost \nover $100,000. If I had one of those limited policies, I would have had \nto start paying out of my pocket. We eliminated that and said there \ncan't be a cap on insurance policies. They want to repeal that. They \nwant caps on insurance policies.\n  It turns out that 60 percent of insurance policies in America did not \ncover maternity benefits. How about that? Do we love families and love \nchildren? How about making sure health insurance covers them? That is \nin ObamaCare and they want to repeal it.\n  The list goes on. This is a point I wish to get to. Members of \nCongress are now going to be covered by the same insurance policies \noffered by ObamaCare and our staff will too. That is acceptable to me. \nI have taken a look at what is available. It is as good\n\n[[Page S7494]]\n\nas anything Members of Congress receive today. I am not worried about \nthe quality of coverage for myself or my wife. It will be fine. I can \nlive with that.\n  Currently, the Senator from Louisiana and every other Senator, when \nit comes to health insurance, has the same health insurance as Federal \nemployees, 8 million Federal employees and their families. It is the \nsame basic coverage. I think it is pretty darn good. I have said that \non the floor. People have corrected me, saying: Senator, you may have a \npolicy worth $15,000 a year. There are people with policies worth \n$40,000 a year.\n  I will leave it at this. I think I have good coverage for myself and \nmy wife. I can match that coverage in terms of the quality of coverage \non the insurance exchanges without fear of interruption in service and \nprotection for my wife and me, and I feel good about that.\n  This is what the Senator from Louisiana is upset about. When I go on \nthe insurance exchange, which is required by law--not voluntary, \nrequired by law--the Senator doesn't want the employer to make any \ncontributions for myself or my family and says our staff should be \nunder the same restriction. People who get their health insurance \nthrough their employer across America, virtually all of them have \nemployer contributions. This is common. There is nothing sinister or \nsneaky about it.\n  The Senator calls it a government subsidy, the employer contribution. \nAll I ask is this: I will go on the government health insurance \nexchange and happily do so. Treat me the same way when it comes to \nemployer contribution for my health insurance and my staff health \ninsurance as every other Federal employee. It is that simple. The \nSenator says: No, that is special treatment for Members of Congress. \nThe Senator from Louisiana is just plain wrong, stands on the floor, \nand talks about special privileges for Members of Congress.\n  I will tell what you I am prepared to do. I am prepared to put a \nspecific provision in the law which says no Member of Congress or \nMember of any congressional staff shall receive any special privileges \nor additional rights not available to every other person under the SHOP \nor insurance exchange program.\n  How is that? I could live with that because, as the Senator almost \nacknowledged, currently employer contributions can be made for those \nwho run the insurance exchanges. It is there. We are not getting \nanything too unusual. It is already there. This argument about some \nspecial treatment for Members of Congress--no way. I will state what \nbothers me the most about this is it doesn't take an act of political \ncourage to take money away from somebody else, in this case away from \nour staff people.\n  I started out here as an intern a long time ago when I was in \ncollege. I worked around the Hill all of my life. There are some \nextraordinary people here. People go to work every day to make me look \ndarn good, to answer the phone, try to satisfy the needs of the people \nof Illinois, and to deal with some pretty serious cases that involve \nlife and death sometimes or Federal benefits. They work long hours and \ndo great work. Because of their great work they cover me in glory with \nregularity. I can't thank them enough.\n  What a thanks this is to say to them: We are going to eliminate your \nemployer's contribution for your health insurance. You are on your own. \nThat is what the Senator from Louisiana wants to do. If the Senator \nthinks an employer's contribution for health insurance is something \nthat is sinister and shouldn't be allowed for Members of Congress and \ntheir staff, hang on tight because we have 150 million people in \nAmerica who have health insurance through their work with an employer \ncontribution.\n  Is that the Senator's next target? Is the Senator going after them? \nThen there will be a fight because people can't afford health insurance \nwithout employers helping to pay. We put it in the Tax Code, we have to \nprotect it in the Tax Code. We have to beat the Vitter amendment.\n  Think about this for a minute. We started this debate 2 weeks ago. A \nSenator from Texas took the floor for 21 hours, stayed up all night. \nHis goal: Let's defund ObamaCare.\n  What happened? The Senator's side ended up shutting down the \ngovernment and is putting us within 36 hours of defaulting on our \nnational debt for the first time in history over the issue of defunding \nObamaCare. Haven't heard about that recently. They stopped talking \nabout it because something has happened. Over 12 million people are now \ngoing on the Internet trying to find whether they are eligible for a \nhealth insurance policy. The popularity of ObamaCare has gone up as \nRepublicans have criticized it because there are a great many people \nwho don't have health insurance or they have health insurance they \ncan't afford.\n  I am not going to make excuses for the problems with the computers \nand the Internet as the program kicks off. It better improve and it \nwill. It shows us what happens when we are overwhelmed with people who \nwant health insurance. The system broke down. We have to get better.\n  During this period of time when the other side was railing against \nObamaCare, the numbers for approval of ObamaCare were going up across \nAmerica. It didn't work. They gave up on defunding ObamaCare. I haven't \nheard that phrase in a long time, 2 weeks ago from the Senator from \nTexas but not since. They have now decided that instead of defunding \nObamaCare, they are going to follow the Senator from Louisiana--who \nwants to take health insurance away or make it prohibitively expensive \nfor Members of Congress and their staff. That is it. That is what this \nhas been all about?\n  We have shut down the government, and we have run the risk of \ndefaulting on our debts for the first time in history over whether our \nemployees, the people on our staff, are going to get a Federal \nGovernment contribution for paying health insurance? It is pathetic we \nhave reached that point.\n  I believe health insurance is a right. It isn't a privilege. I \nbelieve employer-sponsored health insurance is a good thing that we \nought to protect. I believe Members of Congress ought to play by the \nsame rules as everybody else in the insurance exchanges and our staffs \nshould as well.\n  If he accepts those as premises, the Senator's amendment goes away, \ndisappears. But if the Senator is out to get the employer contribution \non health insurance, maybe that is the goal, have at it. I think the \nSenator is going to find it is a very lonely battle. Most Americans, \nDemocrats and Republicans, value health insurance. They need to have it \nin their lives to give them peace of mind and give them the best care.\n  This war on health insurance for individuals, the uninsured, even \nMembers of Congress and their employees, is mindless. It is mindless \nand petty.\n  We have to do better. We need to expand the reach of health insurance \nacross America. We will. This effort to defund ObamaCare and now the \nVitter amendment, we must defeat both of those efforts.\n  Once this program is in place and Americans have this protection, we \nare never going to take it away. Once people have that peace of mind \nwith affordable health insurance, then 6 out of 10 people who go on the \nhealth insurance exchanges will pay less than $100 a month for health \ninsurance. It is less than a cable bill.\n  Finally, they will get health insurance. That is what it is all \nabout. Once it happens, once it moves forward, it will become one of \nthe basic concepts in America that we count on to protect ourselves and \nour families.\n  We have to defeat the Vitter amendment. It is pathetic that we have \nreached this point with the shutdown of the government and the idea of \ndefaulting on the debt, that it has come to this amendment. It is very \nsad.\n  It doesn't speak well for those on the other side who started off \nwith this lofty goal to defund ObamaCare. Yet in the end all they want \nto do is to raise the cost of health insurance for the people who are \nworking night and day for them in their offices across America.\n  I hope the people in this country understand what this debate has \nfinally descended into and will join us in defeating this Vitter \namendment.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7495]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask consent to talk for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, we are now in the third week of \ngovernment shutdown. We are facing an imminent debt limit crisis. It \nseems that it has become a pattern around here that we live from crisis \nto crisis. I hope we do something about that. We obviously have to deal \nwith the immediate issues in front of us in the next day or so, \nhopefully no more than that. There have been a lot of discussions that \nhave occurred over the course of the weekend and the last few days to \ntry to bring to a conclusion at least this chapter of this particular \ncrisis we are dealing with.\n  I am encouraged when I hear our colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nare meeting and having discussions. We have had a number of those that \nhave gone on, I think so far without result. There have been meetings \nthat have occurred between our two leaders. Also I have been working \nvery hard to try to get a result, something they could take back to \ntheir respective caucuses and present, that could ultimately be voted \non.\n  There are also discussions going on in the other body, in the House \nof Representatives, and have been for some time, trying to find a \npathway forward that could get the necessary votes to pass in the House \nof Representatives and then ultimately here in the Senate. I heard some \nof my colleagues in the Democratic leadership on the floor this morning \ndenouncing some of those efforts in the House of Representatives, which \ncame as a surprise to many of us because I do not think it should be \nany shock to anyone that the House of Representatives, created in \narticle I of the Constitution, might decide to perform some things that \nare consistent with its constitutional role.\n  They have been working on legislation. We had the leader get up this \nmorning and make some comments on the floor with respect to what was \nhappening in the House of Representatives. He described it as a \npartisan attempt to appease a small group of tea party Republicans. He \ndescribed it as an extreme piece of legislation, most of the elements \nof which, by the way, have been part of the bipartisan agreement here \nin the Senate. He said it was a blatant attack on bipartisanship.\n  He went on to say he felt blindsided by the news from the House and \nthat extremist Republicans in the House of Representatives were trying \nto torpedo the Senate's bipartisan progress with a bill that cannot \npass the Senate. He went on to lament the fact he was disappointed in \nthe Speaker of the House.\n  Again it was a big surprise to many of us. I don't think we should \nfeel blindsided when the House of Representatives tries to find the \nnecessary votes to move legislation that is so important to this \ncountry. In fact, it would appear at least that perhaps Democrats here \nin the Senate and the White House--which, by the way, came out and said \nit was going to veto the proposal from the House of Representatives, of \ncourse before it had ever seen it. There had never been anything in \nprint with respect to that. So the Senate Democrats hadn't seen it, the \nWhite House hadn't seen it, but the President came out and said he was \ngoing to veto it and the Senate leader said he was blindsided on this, \nit was extreme, it was an attempt to torpedo bipartisan discussions.\n  It would appear at least that some of the Democrats around here are a \nlot more concerned about the political consequences and having the \nopportunity to dance on the political graves of Republicans than in \nactually solving a problem that is important to the future of this \ncountry and the American people.\n  I think it is unfortunate that is where we are. I hope in the course \nof the next few hours--that is about all we have left--we will come to \nsome agreement. Whether that originates in the House of Representatives \nor originates here in the Senate, one way or the other both are going \nto have to vote on it. Both are going to have to find the necessary \nvotes to pass something that will avoid the disaster that is facing us \nif we do not take steps to do that. I guess I am one of many who, when \nI heard those comments this morning, was more than a little bit \nsurprised to think that we here in the Senate would be shocked and \nsurprised and disappointed and blindsided that the House of \nRepresentatives would decide to do some work and try to solve this \nproblem as well. Ultimately we have to have the House and the Senate \nagree and concur.\n  I am glad to see the House of Representatives is proceeding in a way \nthat will solve this problem. I hope we will continue in the Senate to \ntry to find a solution in the next few hours, something we can actually \npass through both Houses of Congress and put on the President's desk \nand something he might be able to sign into law.\n  But when you talk about the various elements of those proposals, most \nof those things that were denounced and rejected here this morning by \nthe Democratic leaders when they came to the floor were the very things \nthat a bipartisan group here in the Senate had been working on for \nseveral days.\n  I hope when we get through this immediate crisis and hopefully create \nthe process by which we might address the real problems the country \nfaces--because this living from crisis to crisis is not a way to govern \nthe country. It is not a way to provide certainty to our economy. It is \ncertainly not a way to get the economy growing and expanding.\n  Many of us on this side of the aisle think we ought to have a \ndiscussion, when we are raising the debt limit, about how we are going \nto fix the debt, what are we going to do to reduce the debt, what are \nwe going to do to ensure that we don't continue to pile trillions of \ndollars of debt on the future generations of this country. We do not \nseem to get serious about that. I hope we will. I hope when we get past \nthe immediate crisis we will take a look at the long term and say what \ncan we do to put this country on a more sustainable fiscal path?\n  I think we all know what that entails. It means we have to get \nspending here in Washington, DC, under control, particularly in the \nareas of some of the mandatory spending parts of the budget. If you \nlook at what the Congressional Budget Office says, over the next 10 \nyears, discretionary spending--which is that small part of the budget \nthat is impacted by the sequester--is going to grow roughly 17 percent. \nDuring the same period mandatory spending is going to grow \napproximately 79 percent or $1.6 trillion over the course of the next \ndecade. So spending on mandatory programs continues to grow. This CBO \nreport underscores that reforming entitlements is absolutely necessary \nif we are going to get spending under control.\n  We know what the issues are. It is not like it is a big secret. The \nCongressional Budget Office gives us insight on regular basis. We have \nhad lots of commissions that have studied these issues, they presented \ntheir findings, they put forward recommendations about how to address \nthese long-term crises the country faces, and yet there seems to be the \nlack, if you will, of political will to try to actually solve the \nproblem.\n  My own view is that if we can get through this immediate crisis, over \nthe course of the next couple of months, which is basically what we \nhave to work with, we can actually sit down--hopefully with the \nPresident engaged in this process--and negotiate in a way that will \nallow us to put in place solutions that actually do put us on a more \nsustainable fiscal trajectory for this country's future.\n  Over the course of the last 4\\1/2\\ years we have seen the publicly \nheld debt of this country double. It took 230-some years of American \nhistory and 43 Presidents to get to the first $6.3 trillion in debt, \nand that has literally doubled in the last 4\\1/2\\ years under this \nadministration.\n  We have a huge debt problem. We added $1 trillion a year for the \nfirst 4 years. This year everybody is patting each other on the back \nand saying: Gee, the deficit is down to $650 or $700 billion, as if \nthat is some sort of major accomplishment. That is literally the fifth \nlargest deficit in history behind the first 4 years of this \nadministration, which were the four largest deficits in American \nhistory.\n\n[[Page S7496]]\n\n  We have an out-of-control debt. We have an out-of-control deficit \nthat is growing as a percentage of our economy and getting to the point \nwhere it is literally going to drown our economy if we don't do \nsomething about it.\n  Controlling the spending part of the equation is essential. The other \npart that is essential is getting the economy growing and expanding. \nWhen the economy is growing and expanding, it means that people are \nworking, people are investing, people are making money, people are \npaying taxes, government revenues go up, and that makes a lot of these \nproblems look much smaller by comparison too.\n  We can't have an economy growing at 1 to 2 percent and an \nunemployment rate that is chronically at about 7\\1/2\\ percent. When we \nfactor in the people who have quit looking for work or are working part \ntime who would rather be working full time, that unemployment rate gets \nup into the double digits.\n  We have chronically high unemployment, massive amounts of debt, and a \nsluggish economy. Those are all things on which we should be focused. \nIn order to get the economy growing and expanding again, we have to \ncreate the economic conditions for small businesses to invest, hire \nmore people, put their capital to work, and try to get that economic \ngrowth rate back up to where it would allow us to deal not only with \nour deficits but also to do something that would really improve the \nquality of life and the standard of living for people in this country. \nA growth rate in the 3- to 4-percent range is significantly different--\ndramatically different than a growth rate in the 1- to 2-percent range, \nand that means a big difference in the take-home pay of middle-class \nAmericans.\n  If we want to see middle-class Americans do better in this economy, \nwe have to get the economy growing again, and that means reforming our \nTax Code, broadening the tax base, and lowering those marginal income \ntax rates. We have the highest business tax in the world. It makes us \nnoncompetitive in the global environment. We lose jobs every single day \nto other countries around the world. We need to do things that would \nlessen the cost of doing business in this country. We need to make it \nless expensive and less difficult to create jobs, not more expensive \nand more difficult.\n  One of the concerns many of us have with respect to ObamaCare is that \nit is making it more expensive and difficult to create jobs. It has \nhigher taxes. There are higher insurance premiums. Obviously, that \ntranslates into fewer jobs.\n  Getting the cost of regulation to a more reasonable level, keeping \nthe tax rates at a more reasonable level, and doing what is necessary \nto unleash this economy is the way we will improve the fiscal picture \nin this country, coupled with good fiscal discipline and constraints on \nFederal spending, and that means we have to tackle the mandatory part \nof the budget. That part was not affected--or at least not affected \nvery much--by the sequester.\n  Those are the ingredients, components, and elements, if you will, \nthat will lead us to a situation where we are not having a crisis every \nfew months where we are worrying about a debt limit increase or how we \nare going to fund the government. We ought to get to a place where we \nare in a more systematic way doing what we should be doing in the first \nplace. We should be passing appropriations bills. We didn't pass a \nsingle appropriations bill this year, which is why we are here at the \neleventh hour trying to come up with a continuing resolution to fund \nthe government.\n  Those are the things we need to do if we are going to get this fiscal \nsituation improved for our country and get the economy up and growing \nagain and creating jobs and doing what is necessary to improve the \nlives of the American people. That is what I think the public wants to \nsee.\n  Actually, if we look at public opinion polls--and there has been a \nlot of discussion about that lately--by a 2-to-1 margin, people in this \ncountry believe that if you are going to raise the debt limit, you \nought to do something about the debt. I saw a survey just last week by \nCBS News that said 55 percent of the people in this country believe \nthat when you are going to raise the debt limit, you ought to do \nsomething to reduce spending. I think that only 23 percent of the \npeople surveyed said they supported a clean debt limit increase.\n  The American people get it. The people in my State of South Dakota \nunderstand that you can't spend money you don't have. You have to live \nwithin your means, and we have to, as a Federal Government, do the same \nfamilies across this country have to do on a regular basis. They get \nthis. They understand what this is about.\n  I hope that in the next few weeks and months we will be able--with \nthe involvement and engagement of the President of the United States--\nto sit down and negotiate the resolutions, if you will, and proposals \nand solutions to this debt crisis and get this country on a more \nsustainable fiscal path and at a place where the economy is growing at \na faster rate and creating the types of good-paying jobs that will help \nmiddle-class Americans in this economy prosper.\n  If we look at what happened to take-home pay or household income over \nthe past several years, it has gone down, not up. We have seen the \naverage household income go down by $3,700 since the President took \noffice. It is time we changed that and got the American people back to \nwork, incomes coming up, and jobs that will keep the young people in \nthis country not only employed but looking with confidence and optimism \ntoward their future, which is something we don't see today. Let's deal \nwith the immediate crisis, but let's work together on that.\n  Instead of coming over here and denouncing what is happening in the \nHouse of Representatives or using extreme language to characterize what \nis happening in the House of Representatives, understand we have to \nfunction together. We are the Congress of the United States, and in \norder for anything to get done here, we have to move legislation \nthrough both the House and Senate. It seems to me, at least, that there \nought to be a recognition of that in the Senate. As I listened this \nmorning to the comments of some of our leaders on the other side when \nthey came down here and denounced what was happening in the House of \nRepresentatives, it struck me that that is not a productive or \nconstructive way to get where we need to go in the next few hours. I \nhope we can do that, and I looking forward to the kind of bipartisan \ncooperation that will solve this problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to use as much \ntime as I might consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, the Senator from South Dakota has \npointed out how concerned he is about jobs and economic growth. He is \nconcerned about our not doing enough appropriations bills. He is \nconcerned that we have not resolved our differences in the conference.\n  I want him to know, since he asked for bipartisanship, that as a \nDemocrat, I am concerned about pay and jobs and economic growth. I am \nconcerned that we have not had any appropriations bills. I am concerned \nthat we have not gone to the budget. But I need to speak the truth, and \nthe truth is in the record.\n  Why don't we have appropriations bills? Because the Republicans \nfilibustered our very first bill, and when we tried to get it done, \nthey would not give us the votes, so it was taken off the floor. \nSenator Murray and Senator Collins--our moderate Republican colleague--\nwere very upset about that. The Republicans filibustered the very first \nappropriations bill we tried to get through, and it was clear they were \ngoing to continue to filibuster each one. So to come down here and \nlament the fact that we didn't take up appropriations bills flies in \nthe face of recent history.\n  My friend laments the fact that we have not had a chance to discuss \nwhat he now sees as a target for cuts in Medicare and Social Security. \nHe calls them entitlement programs. That is their new thing now. They \nwant to cut those programs. Well, you know what. We have said open the \ngovernment, let's pay our bills, and we will negotiate, listen, and \ntalk.\n  Our friends on the Republican side stopped us from going to a budget \nconference 21 times, and now they have\n\n[[Page S7497]]\n\nshut down the government. All you have to do is understand why. They \nwere very clear. They don't like the Affordable Care Act.\n  I have come to the floor, as I have before during this government \nshutdown that is in its 15th day, to raise the alarm about the harmful, \nterrible, hurtful impacts on America and its people as a result of 15 \ndays of not having access to their government. Who are they punishing? \nThe people of this Nation. This is their government. Open the door and \nlet them in. Let them talk to us. Let them tell us about the \nlegislation they want us to proceed to. Let them not suffer, as they \nare in my State and in many States because the government is shut down. \nIn a moment, I will talk about some of the ways my people are hurting.\n  They shut down the government because they didn't like the Affordable \nCare Act. I am so happy to say that Covered California-dot-com--\ncoveredCA.com, which is our Web site--has had more than 1.5 million \nunique visits to the site. The call volume to the service center is \n104,000-plus. The average call wait time is now 1 minute 55 seconds. \nThe average call-handling time from the time you get on until the time \nyou get off and get your questions answered is less than 15 minutes. \nOur cumulative applications are approaching 100,000. Tens of thousands \nhave already completed the signups. This is why they shut down the \ngovernment. They don't want that to move forward.\n  I will tell some stories about health care reform in my State.\n  Rakesh Rikhi of San Jose is now paying $950 a month to insure \nhimself, his wife, and his two children with Kaiser Permanente. \nAccording to the NBC station in the Bay area, Rakesh was stunned to \nlearn that through Covered California he can get a similar Kaiser plan \nfor his family for $400 less a month. So when my friend stands here and \nsays premiums are going up, ask Rakesh. He is getting a plan for his \nfamily for $400 less a month. He quickly did the math, and when he hung \nup the phone and signed up, he found out he is saving $5,000 a year.\n  Why do the Republicans want to shut down the government and stop \nsomebody like that from getting a plan? I think they have to look into \ntheir hearts.\n  Rakesh owns an auto repair shop. He has four employees. He is hoping \nthat with the savings he will be able to offer his workers medical \ninsurance. He cannot wait to sign up and complete the application. He \nlooks forward to feeling relief from the financial pain of skyrocketing \ninsurance costs.\n  Then there is Laura Hunt of Modesto. She lost her husband's employer-\nbased coverage when he was killed in a car crash in 2006. She is \nsuffering from income loss and the painful loss of a spouse. She \ncontacted Covered California and found out she could have an Anthem \nBlue Cross policy for a net cost of $23 a month. Why do my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle want to stop Laura Hunt of Modesto, who \nlost her husband's employer-based coverage when he was killed in a car \ncrash, stop her from getting affordable health care?\n\n  Kevin Burke, an assembly worker, told the Fresno Bee he had been out \nof work for 2 years and now he qualifies for Medicaid and he is going \nto be OK, and he is not going to wait until he is rushed to an \nemergency room. Why do my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwant to stop Kevin Burke of Fresno from getting affordable health \ninsurance? They need to look into their hearts.\n  Then there is Rufina Arango, a diabetic. At Vista Family Health \nCenter she filled out an application for coverage through a significant \nexpansion of Medi-Cal. Rufina and her family lost their health \ninsurance several years ago when her husband was laid off after working \nfor 22 years. She said:\n\n       It's so great. It's going to help so many of us. If not for \n     ObamaCare, many of us would not qualify for health insurance.\n\n  I could go on and on with these stories. I don't have the time to do \nit. But I am going to keep on adding these stories to the Congressional \nRecord so some day, when people look back at this moment in history, \nthey will realize that when we stood for the people and their right to \nhave affordable health care, that we did it for a very good reason. \nSome day in the future people will say: You mean there was a time when \nwe had 40 million people without insurance? Are you kidding? But that \nis the moment we are in now. We are either going to stand sentry, as my \nfriend Barbara Mikulski always says, for a law that is going to help \npeople, or just walk away. No law is perfect. Of course there are \nglitches and issues. We are very happy to talk about making it better--\nvery happy. The President is as well. He said as much.\n  I want everyone to read an opinion piece that ran in the Washington \nPost recently, a couple of days ago, by one of my constituents. Her \nname is Janine. Janine Urbaniak Reid is a writer, and so she has a \nbeautiful way of expressing herself. She talks about her loving son, \nMason, who has brain cancer and who has had to undergo multiple \nsurgeries. Listen to this:\n\n       He would have hit his lifetime limit on the policy and the \n     family would have been driven into--\n\n  her words--\n\n     the financial abyss if it wasn't for the Affordable Care Act.\n\n  She writes that the family:\n\n       Thanks God and whoever else would listen for our good \n     fortune to have coverage.\n\n  She ends her piece with this line:\n\n       If I could get those who are trying to repeal this law on a \n     conference call, I would explain this to them. I would tell \n     them that while they were busy trying to derail the \n     Affordable Care Act over the past 2 years, Mason has again \n     learned to walk, talk, eat, and shoot a 3-point basket.\n\n  Why would anyone want to hurt that family and reverse our law, the \nAffordable Care Act, which is everybody's law, that says no more \nlifetime limits and no more annual limits. We have to ask the \nRepublicans why they want to do it. They come to the floor and they \nsay: Health care costs are rising; these things are happening; the sky \nis falling. But then we look at the facts, and the facts are that tens \nof thousands of people are signing up. Young people are now able to \nstay on their parents' policies until they are 26. There is no more \npreexisting condition bar. If a person has a preexisting condition, \nthey can still get insurance. There are so many good things. Women are \nno longer discriminated against. We used to pay twice as much as men. \nBeing a woman was considered a preexisting condition. Can my colleagues \nimagine. Really? Because, yes, we can have babies and, yes, we had \ncertain needs. Well, that is over now. We have equal rights in this \nAffordable Care Act.\n  So the reason for the shutting down of the government was to stop the \nAffordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act is now signing up tens of \nthousands of people. It is saving a lot of our families. If the \nRepublicans want to make improvements in it, that is fine. We are ready \nto do it. We will sit down with anyone and make this law better--\nabsolutely. But don't stop a law that passed almost 4 years ago and \nthat was upheld by the Supreme Court; and, may I say, there was a big \nelection about it.\n  Remember what Mitt Romney said:\n\n       The first thing I will do when I am your President is to \n     repeal ObamaCare. That is my promise.\n\n  And, boy, I believed him. It was a big issue. People decided that \nwasn't a good enough reason, and they reelected our President not in a \nsmall way but in a big way.\n  So since there is no more reason to shut down the government because \nthe Affordable Care Act can't be stopped--it is funded by a separate \nstream of funding, not appropriations--we begged the Republicans: Don't \nshut the government down over this. It is starting. It is happening. We \nare not going to repeal a law that took--I would say decades--to pass.\n  So they didn't listen. Now they have stopped talking about the \nAffordable Care Act, pretty much. Now they have a whole different \nreason for shutting down the government and bringing us to the brink of \ndefault, and that reason is deficits--deficits.\n  I want to speak a little bit about default because we are hours away \nfrom a default--the first time in this Nation's great history. If we \ndon't take action, we will be unable to pay the bills that have been \nincurred in the past.\n  It is important to note that we have gone through so many crises in \nour Nation--tough, tough, tough ones, including civil strife, world \nwars, the Great Depression. We always followed the Constitution that \nsays, ``The validity\n\n[[Page S7498]]\n\nof the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, shall not \nbe questioned.'' This is in the Constitution. Yet from the people who \nsay they are constitutionalists, they seem not to read that part, and \nthey are flirting, for the first time, with allowing us to get to the \npoint where we can't pay all of our bills. That is a default.\n  Some of our colleagues come to the floor, and they say that it is not \na default if we pay interest on the bonds. I am an old economics major, \nbut I don't pretend to know everything about economics. But I can tell \nmy colleagues this: The definition of a default in Black's Law \nDictionary is ``the failure to make a payment when due.'' It doesn't \nsay the failure to make an interest payment when due. It says, the \nfailure to make a payment. That means to our contractors. That means to \nour workers. That means to our Social Security recipients. That means \nto our Medicare recipients.\n  I have never seen such creative license taken when it comes to the \ndefault. A party that says it is fiscally conservative and then says it \nis not a default when we don't pay our bills as long as we pay China \nthe interest we owe them? They have to be kidding. Take that to a town \nhall meeting, I say to my friend who represents so many wonderful \nseniors in the great State of Florida, Senator Nelson, who is on the \nfloor. So we have never gotten to this point.\n  Mr. NELSON. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. NELSON. If the Senator will yield on that point.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. I can yield for as much time as my colleague wants.\n  Mr. NELSON. Since the Senator so eloquently posed this question, \nsince this Senator has the privilege of being the chairman of the \nSpecial Committee on Aging, and since the Senator from California has \njust pointed out that seniors are at risk, I wish to remind the Senate \nthat on October 23, there is a bill due to be paid of $12 billion to \nSocial Security recipients--October 23. Shortly thereafter, on November \n1, there is another bill due: $67 billion for Social Security \nrecipients, for Medicare recipients, and for SSI, which is Social \nSecurity for low-income seniors. In addition to the default the Senator \nfrom California has spoken about--defaulting on interest payments on \nU.S. Treasury bills--we are talking about default to real people with \nreal needs. This is just a drop in the bucket of the total amount that \nis coming due.\n  I thank the Senator for letting me share that information in this \ndiscussion.\n  I might say that the Presiding Officer, the junior Senator from \nMassachusetts--or now the senior Senator from Massachusetts--is one of \nthe most active and prominent members of the Special Committee on \nAging, and our committee has pointed out statistics such as these over \nand over.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wish to thank my friend, and I hope we can continue to \nhave these conversations. I thank the Presiding Officer for recognizing \nmy friend so he could make his point.\n  We are, as leader Pelosi said, playing with fire. We are playing with \nlives.\n  One of our colleagues, Senator Casey from Pennsylvania, read the most \namazing letter he got from a constituent and he said:\n\n       She is so worried about her parents. They are in their 80s, \n     and the fear--just the thought--of maybe not getting a check \n     on time, that is making her parents physically ill.\n\n  Why are we doing this? There is no reason to do this. This is a self-\ninflicted wound. The government shutdown is self-inflicted. Playing \nwith the full faith and credit of the United States of America is a \nself-inflicted wound.\n  Here is the thing: We know one of the heroes of the Republican Party \nand a hero to many Democrats is Ronald Reagan. Let's see what he said. \nI have it here. When it comes to the debt:\n\n       The full consequences of a default, or even the serious \n     prospect of a default, are impossible to predict and awesome \n     to contemplate. Denigration of the full faith and credit of \n     the United States would have substantial effects on the \n     domestic financial markets and on the value of the dollar in \n     exchange markets. The Nation can ill afford to allow such a \n     result.\n\n  That is Ronald Reagan. I was here during most of his presidency. I \nwas over in the House. I think my friend from Florida was as well. Lord \nknows, we didn't agree with Ronald Reagan on everything. We agreed with \nhim on some things, not all things, and we may have cast a vote or two \nto say that we object. But no one ever brought down the full faith and \ncredit of the United States. He got 18 increases in the debt ceiling \nduring his presidency--18 over 8 years.\n  So there are two paths we can take. One path is a road that is a \nlittle bit bumpy and curvy and dusty, but at the end of the day it gets \nus where we want to go: Into a budget conference with our bills paid \nand our government open to the people. That is the bipartisan road. It \nis not easy.\n  I am so proud of Senators Reid and McConnell for working on a plan \nthat is something we can accept. No one on either side is thrilled \nabout it, but we can accept it. It gets us out of this mess. That is \nthe road we should take, the bipartisan road that gets us into the \nconference, that opens the doors of government, and pays our bills.\n  The other road is the road the House Republicans are taking. That \nroad is straight over the cliff. That is the partisan road, and we will \ndive down. We are not going to get there that way. We are going to \nbring a world of hurt on the people.\n  What did the people do to deserve this? They did not vote the way my \nRepublican friends in the House wanted them to. Sorry, that is what \nelections are about. I have been disappointed in election outcomes, \nbelieve me, more times than I care to admit. That is what elections are \nabout.\n  Well, once you get here, you have to work across party lines, and \neven though that road is bumpy and dusty and twisty and windy, and all \nthe rest of it, that is the road that gets us where we have to go. That \nis the road Leaders Reid and McConnell had us on until a few hours ago \nwhen all of a sudden that road kind of shut down and the other road--\nthat partisan road--opened right up. I do not know why they are taking \nus down that road leading us off a cliff, with all the pain and \nsuffering and job loss and economic chaos that awaits if we go down \nthat road. But I honestly think we can get back on that bipartisan \npath. I do not know exactly how it will come about. How a bill becomes \nlaw is sometimes very complicated, but if the House sends us something, \nbut we can work to make it bipartisan, we will be over this. We will be \nover this. We cannot have a strictly partisan political bill.\n  I want to share with the Presiding Officer and with my colleagues the \nfact that Fitch, a credit rating service, has put our creditworthiness \n``under review for a downgrade,'' according to the Associated Press. It \nmeans that America's AAA rating is in doubt. Let me say that again. \nFitch, a credit rating service, put our creditworthiness ``under review \nfor a downgrade,'' reports the Associated Press, putting America's AAA \nrating in doubt.\n  Mr. NELSON. Just this afternoon.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Just this afternoon, after the bipartisan plan was \nstalled here in the Senate and the House went forward with their \npartisan plan.\n  What Fitch did is a warning sign. It is a warning sign for businesses \nin terms of their borrowing costs to expand. It is a warning sign to \nthe job market if there is a lack of expansion by the business \ncommunity. It is a warning sign that students could be paying higher \ninterest rates to go to college. It is a warning sign for homeowners \nwho could be paying higher rates for their mortgages.\n  What is going on? We are just getting out of the worst recession \nsince the Great Depression. The Presiding Officer is in the Senate \nbecause she fought so hard to get this economy on track, and people in \nher State said: That is what we need, and she came here. And now this \nself-inflicted wound just as we are coming out of it, just as we are \nstarting to see progress? Why are we doing this?\n  I want to talk a little bit about the bill the House is probably \ngoing to be voting on soon because it deals with a couple of things \nthat are very problematic. I have already said it is a partisan bill. \nSpeaker Boehner did not have a conversation with Leader Pelosi. He just \nwrote the bill with Republicans only, as opposed to Harry Reid, who \nwrote our compromise with the Republicans, taking us down that \nbipartisan road.\n\n[[Page S7499]]\n\n  My understanding is the House bill does something that is \ninexplicable to me and many others, both Republicans and Democrats. \nListen to this. It says that no President--starting now with this \nPresident, and into the future--no President can take steps to avoid \ndefault. I do not get it. We all know a default is chaos. Everyone \nagrees it is terrible, it is bad. Republican and Democratic \nadministrations for decades have taken measures when there is a little \nstall here or there and they need a few days to move around a bill or \ntwo.\n  I cannot believe it--from a party that said: In case we default, we \nshould prioritize who we pay--they will not allow future \nadministrations to avoid a default and add a couple of days until we \nface that.\n  Listen to what Tony Fratto said. He worked in the Bush administration \nas Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs for Treasury. He said the \nfollowing:\n\n       Restricting Treasury's use of extraordinary measures is \n     like restricting the fire department's use of hoses.\n\n  So imagine if you said to a fire department: You can use every tool \nat your disposal, but you can't use a water hose to put out a fire. \nThey are saying to the Treasury Department: You have to default even if \nthere is an easy way to avoid it for a few days.\n  What are they thinking? Do they want this administration and others \nto have an easier path to default? I thought we would all agree we \ncertainly do not ever want to default but certainly give the ability of \nan administration--Democratic or Republican--to avert a default, if \nthey can. Their language makes no sense.\n  Then their other rider they have on there--it is my understanding; I \ncould be wrong, but this is what I get from reading what their \nlegislation, I think, is going to be--the other one involves treating \ncongressional employees differently than any other employee in the \ncountry who works for a large employer by taking away the employer \ncontribution that these workers have had for more than 50 years.\n  I do not get it. Why do Republicans want to punish the people who \nwork so hard for them and work so hard for our country? What are they \nthinking? Why do they want to treat people differently than all other \nworkers who work for large employers?\n  Honest to God, I do not get it. I do not get it. If they do not like \nthe people who work for them, then get somebody else. But do not punish \nyour staff, who work day and night. And I want to say, my staff and the \nPresiding Officer's who are working are working without a paycheck. \nWell, this is a lovely thing to say to these workers, some of whom earn \nvery little: You are going to be the only people in the country now who \ncannot get an employer contribution. I do not get it. I really do not.\n  So here we are: a government shutdown because the Republicans will \nnot accept the fact that a law passed 4 years ago that they do not \nlike, that the Supreme Court upheld--and they did not like that--there \nwas an election over it--and they did not like that--so they stamped \ntheir feet and said: We are shutting down the government.\n  And is there ever pain. I have communities in Los Angeles, one \nparticular one where kids are getting nosebleeds. They are sick. They \nlive near an industrial site, and the Environmental Protection Agency \nwas about to find out what the problem was when they shut down. And \nthose kids do not have an answer.\n  I had a plane crash at a small airport in Santa Monica that killed \nfour people. We do not know why it happened, but there is no \ninvestigation. It had to stop midstream.\n  I do not have any inspectors on the ground inspecting clean air, \nclean water, safe drinking water. There are 505 superfund sites where \ncleanup has been suspended. I know the Presiding Officer has some in \nher State. These sites are toxic brews. They have arsenic. They have \nbenzene. They have chlorine. They have everything in them that is bad \nfor people to breathe. It is bad if it gets in the drinking water. No \ninspectors on the ground and no cleanup at 505 superfund sites.\n  Remember Fukushima? I think everyone knows what Fukushima is. Well, \nnow 92 percent of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff have been \nfurloughed. They have one mission, and I am quoting from their mission: \n``to ensure the safe use of radioactive materials.''\n  The Army Corps manages 12 million acres of public lands. They host \n370 million visitors annually. This is just the time of year when \npeople still--just before we get to winter--can go out there and enjoy \nthe recreation. No. They are closed.\n  And just think about the mom-and-pop shops that exist around our \nparks, our Army Corps land, our wildlife refuges. Madam President, 561 \nrefuges--they are all closed because of the shutdown. Hunting season is \nin full swing.\n  I already talked about the fact that the National Transportation \nSafety Board furloughed 380 of its 400 employees, and they have \nsuspended all their pending investigations. I talked about that.\n  There is another crash they were investigating in San Francisco, the \nAsiana Airlines Flight 214. I will tell you, when you stop an \ninvestigation like that, it is hard to get right back to it. The \nproblem is, it takes you longer to find the cause of the crash. A lot \nof times these crashes have clues in them that there may be a part in a \ncertain type of plane that is defective, there may be a problem on the \nrunway--something wrong.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Commission--another watchdog. In San \nDiego last week, a 2-year-old child, Annette Estrada, was killed. She \nwas crushed by a falling TV. So they cannot investigate this incident, \nand maybe some other kids are going to suffer that. It might have been \na very defective design.\n  What does the House do? They are governing by press release: Well, we \nwill open this little sliver of an agency and that one. That is not how \nyou run the greatest Nation on Earth.\n  Open the government. You said you shut it down because of ObamaCare. \nObamaCare is going forward. You want to fix some parts of it. We are \nready to talk. There are no winners in this shutdown. It is devastating \nfor our workers. Do you know there are more contract employees than \nthere are Federal employees? There are. Even if you take away the \nmilitary Federal contract employees--and we hope they are getting paid; \nwe are not positive that all are, but let's say they are--there are \nmore than 2 million contract employees who do not know when the next \npaycheck is coming.\n  We sent a bill over to Speaker Boehner in the House. Open the \ngovernment. Just open it. Then we will negotiate all the issues you \nwant to talk about. He would not even allow a vote on that.\n  We are in a bad place. I have to say, I have lived long enough to \nknow that life does deal us some terrible blows. We know that, each of \nus. We have each had our tragedies, our challenges, whether they are \nhealth challenges or financial challenges or all kinds of challenges. \nWe have enough of those without a self-inflicted wound--two: a \ngovernment shutdown over here, and a pending default over here, totally \nunnecessary. It could end in 5 minutes, but still the angst continues, \nstill the anxiety continues, still the uncertainty continues.\n  I will close with a hopeful note. I laid out the two paths we have: \nthe partisan path to a cliff or the windy, difficult bipartisan path, \nwhich the Senate was on until we were pulled off it. I hope and pray \nthat we will get back on that bipartisan path, that we will reopen this \ngovernment, that we will pay our bills, and this great Nation--this \ngreat Nation--can get back to doing what we do best: making sure this \nAmerican dream is there for everybody, making sure we care about our \npeople, making sure they have access to their government, and getting \nus out of this morass we are in for no good reason.\n  We can do it. The path is there. Let's hope we take that path.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S7500]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/15/senate-section/article/S7500-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Mr. President, it is my pleasure to celebrate the career \nof a very dedicated Utah public servant. Palmer DePaulis has served the \npeople of Utah for over 30 years, most recently as the executive \ndirector of Utah Department of Human Services.\n  As executive director, Mr. DePaulis has made great strides in \ncreating safe and permanent homes for vulnerable children and at-risk \nfamilies. He has instituted a ``System of Care'' approach for children \nand families that creates a partnership between children, their \nfamilies, and caregivers that focuses on an individualized, culturally \nresponsive plan to address a variety of mental health challenges so \nthat children can be kept in the least restrictive, most integrated, \nand safe setting possible.\n  Current law directs the majority of Federal dollars to the least \ndesirable outcomes for vulnerable families, namely, removing a child \nfrom the home and placing them in foster care.\n  During the last session of Congress, the Congress passed and the \nPresident signed legislation I drafted that permits some States to \napply for and receive waivers for certain rules relative to foster \ncare.\n  In drafting this legislation, I worked closely with Mr. DePaulis and \nhis team to craft policies that would give Utah and other States the \nflexibility to innovate and try different approaches to improving child \nwelfare systems.\n  I am pleased that Utah was one of the first States to successfully \napply for and be granted a child welfare waiver. Utah's plan is a \nstrategic and forward thinking approach that strives to gain a better \nunderstanding of the needs and strengths of children and families that \nhave experienced child abuse, neglect, and dependency. It acknowledges, \nas a guiding principle, that, whenever possible, children should remain \nsafely at home. Utah's wavier proposal adopts a holistic framework to \nprovide supportive family services that prevents neglect and abuse and \nbolsters a family's ability to keep a child safe within the home and \npreserve intact families when a family's problems can be addressed \nsafely and effectively.\n  I am confident that the Utah's waiver, instigated by Mr. DePaulis and \nhis team, will result in improved outcomes for children and families.\n  In addition to his work in the area of child welfare, Mr. DePaulis \nalso oversaw services that have benefited thousands of Utahans. These \ninclude, but are not limited to: meals to homebound seniors, treatment \nfor mental health and substance abuse, and services that help \nindividuals with disabilities lead independent and productive lives.\n  Prior to joining Utah Department of Human Services, Mr. DePaulis \nserved as mayor of Salt Lake City. During his tenure as mayor, Mr. \nDePaulis made the humane treatment of the homeless one of his signature \nissues. He helped open family and men's homeless shelters and worked \nwith community partners to highlight the need for a continuum of \nservices to ensure shelter residents had access to medical, \ntransportation, substance abuse, and mental health services.\n  Throughout his long and distinguished career, Mr. DePaulis has worked \nto improve the lives of our most vulnerable and forgotten citizens. \nUtahans and the Nation owe him our gratitude and appreciation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/15/senate-section/article/S7500-3", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              REMEMBERING ADMIRAL TAZEWELL T. SHEPARD, JR.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I was honored to be at the funeral \nservices at Arlington for ADM Tazewell T. Shepard, Jr., an American \npatriot, a native of Mobile, AL, a man widely recognized for his \ncharacter and integrity as well as for courage, intelligence, and \nprofessionalism.\n  Admiral Shepard was born in Mobile, AL, attended Murphy High School, \none of Alabama's great high schools, and joined the Navy when World War \nII began. He married the daughter of Senator John Sparkman and they \nwere partners for 71 years. He received the Navy Cross, the Navy's \nhighest award for heroism during the Battle of Guadalcanal acting with \ncoolness and courage to direct action and to care for casualties.\n  He was a naval aide to President John F. Kennedy and advised the \nPresident during the Bay of Pigs crisis in 1961. He published a book \nJohn F. Kennedy: Man of the Sea, in 1965.\n  His quiet and firm character was the quality that stands out in this \nlife well lived. Former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor spoke at the \nservice and recalled those times of friendship--tennis, bridge, and \ndancing--enjoyed by their families. His son, Tazewell Shepard Ill, \nspoke also and provided insights that revealed the strong values and \npositive qualities of his father. The service, honored by the presence \nof a naval detachment, closed with the naval hymn.\n  Admiral Shepard through the quality of his life set an example of \nfaith, family and patriotism. We extend our sympathy to his fine family \nand even in this time of loss celebrate his wonderful and productive \nlife.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/15/senate-section/article/S7500-4", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:58 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill and joint resolution, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 3190.
