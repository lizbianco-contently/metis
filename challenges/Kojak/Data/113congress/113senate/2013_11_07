Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 236.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the bill (H.R. 3204) to amend the \n     Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to human \n     drug compounding and drug supply chain security, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for giving \nme an opportunity to speak first this morning due to a commitment I \nhave away from the Capitol.\n\n\n                        tribute to billy graham\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to start out this morning by \nsaying a few words about a man who has earned the respect and \nadmiration of countless Americans for his energy, courage, and \nfaithfulness to a calling that he first received about 75 years ago on \na late-night walk around the Temple Terrace Golf Course in Tampa. The \nson of a North Carolina dairy farmer, Billy Graham turns 95 today. And \nI just want to join all the others across the country and around world \nin thanking this good and humble servant for his decades of ministry \nand tireless preaching of the Gospel that he loves.\n  In a career that spans generations, Billy Graham has walked the halls \nof power and counseled presidents and kings. But he has never forgotten \nhis mission in life. And while he may not be able to preach at the \ngiant rallies that made him a household name, he is still finding new \nways to share his faith with a world in need of healing, hope, and \npurpose. Tonight, at the age of 95, Billy Graham will preach what's \nbeen called his final message to America.\n  Growing up, Billy Graham wanted to be a baseball player. Thankfully, \nGod had different plans. And ever since that night in Tampa, he's put \nhis extraordinary natural talents and generosity of spirit at the \nservice of others.\n  Billy Graham's first crusade took place in the Civic Auditorium in \nGrand Rapids, MI, in September 1947. In the decades to come, more than \n400 crusades would follow in more than 185 countries and territories on \nsix continents. At one memorable crusade in South Korea, more than one \nmillion people showed up to hear the powerful preaching and the hopeful \nmessage of the Reverend Billy Graham.\n  Billy Graham may be the only preacher with a star on the Hollywood \nWalk of Fame. But he never let that celebrity get to his head. I am \nsure he would say that his beloved Ruth helped keep him focused. And it \nis a credit to both of them that all five of the Graham children are \ncarrying on the family legacy today.\n  As Billy Graham has receded from public life in recent years, we have \nmissed the steady, reassuring presence that he lent to moments such as \nthe Oklahoma City bombing and 9/11. But we have been consoled to know \nthat he is still there on his mountain retreat in Montreat, NC. Billy \nGraham once said that ``God has given us two hands, one to receive with \nand the other to give with.'' So today, I join countless others in \nsending our own message of thanks to a man who has been called \n``America's pastor,'' and to say how grateful\n\n[[Page S7892]]\n\nwe are for the life and witness of the Reverend Billy Graham.\n\n\n                               OBAMACARE\n\n  Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, yesterday Secretary \nSebelius came back to Capitol Hill to testify about ObamaCare. We did \nnot learn much from her testimony, but some of the Q-and-A was actually \npretty revealing. She admitted that the number of folks who have \nenrolled in ObamaCare is ``very low.''\n  When pressed on the administration's promise that ObamaCare would \ndrive down premiums, here is what she said about premium rates on the \nindividual market: ``I didn't say they are going down.''\n  When asked if convicted felons could become ObamaCare navigators and \nacquire Americans' sensitive information, here is what she said: ``It's \npossible.''\n  These revelations are really concerning. Americans were counting on \nthe President's claim that their families' premiums would go down, not \nup, under a new health regime. Americans who have lost their insurance \nand find themselves forced into the exchanges--the last thing they need \nis to worry about some felon stealing their identity.\n  To many Americans the administration still seems more interested in \ndeflecting blame than taking responsibility for the real harm this law \nis causing. Yesterday's hearing did little to dispel that notion.\n  By now we have heard our friends on the left blame just about \neveryone and everything for the disaster they forced on our country--\neveryone and everything, of course, except themselves. They have tried \nto blame the same contractors they hired. They blame the Republicans. \nThey blame the tea party. I am sure they have even tried to pin this on \nGeorge W. Bush. Of course, the administration has repeatedly tried to \nblame insurance companies for lost plans too. But here is what the \nWashington Post Fact Checker had to say about that:\n\n       The administration's effort to pin the blame on insurance \n     companies is a classic case of misdirection.\n\n  That is the Washington Post--``a classic case of misdirection.'' They \ngot three Pinocchios for that whopper.\n  Unfortunately, that does not seem to have deterred our friends on the \nother side from indulging in the blame game. Within just the past week \nwe have seen the White House lash out at the words of a cancer survivor \nand try to point a finger of blame at Texans. A few days ago--get this \none--one of the President's political allies attacked the very kind of \nfolks who are now losing their health coverage under ObamaCare. ``Free \nriders,'' he called them. ``Free riders.'' You know the folks he is \ntalking about. These are not folks who have done anything wrong. They \nare not free loaders or free riders or anything else; they are our \nneighbors, our constituents, and they are not looking for handouts from \nthe government. In fact, these are folks who went out and spent their \nown hard-earned money--not taxpayer money--to purchase the kind of \nhealth protection that best suits their families. For this, the \nPresident's allies attacked them? Many just want the government to \nleave them alone. Many just want to be able to keep the plans they like \ninstead of only the plans the President likes. They want to keep the \nplans they like, not the ones the President in effect picks for them.\n  Here is what a small business owner in North Carolina said after his \npremiums shot up 400 percent: ``I just wish I could have my insurance \nback.'' That is what he said. ``I just wish I could have my insurance \nback.''\n  I just read this morning about a constituent who lost his insurance \nand is finding that policies on the exchange will be more than double \nhis premium and increase his annual deductible. That is partly because \nas a 31-year-old single male he will now be required to buy a policy \nwith features he doesn't need, such as pediatric dental care and \nmaternity care. ``It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me,'' he \nsaid.\n  Another constituent from Caldwell County had this to say after \nlearning of changes to her plan: ``My husband and I work hard, pay a \nlot in taxes and ask for little from our government. Is it asking too \nmuch for the government to stay out of my health insurance?''\n  No, it is not asking too much. It is simply taking the President at \nhis word for the promise he made over and over, the promise that so \nmany Democrats here in Washington made to their constituents but that \nwe now know is simply not true.\n  I understand the White House is in a tight spot. They did a poor job \npreparing the country for this law, they wasted time making promises \nthat simply could not pan out, and they chose to ignore the warnings \nfrom my party and experts across the country that these kinds of things \nwould, indeed, happen. This is the result, and people are getting hurt. \nPremiums are rising, taxes are going up for millions in the middle \nclass, folks are losing access to hospitals and doctors they like.\n  At this point, more Americans have lost health coverage than have \ngained it. As I mentioned yesterday, more than 50 times as many \nKentuckians have lost private health coverage as have signed up for \nprivate plans on the State exchange. That is 280,000 folks we are \ntalking about in my State, 280,000 Kentuckians who have lost their \ninsurance. In Louisiana we are talking about 80,000 folks; in Kentucky, \n280,000; up in Minnesota, 140,000 people; and close to half a million \npeople in Georgia have lost their insurance.\n  It is way past time for our Democratic friends to end the blame game. \nInstead, they need to start acknowledging the consequences of their law \nand actually do something about the mess they created. If they are \nready to do so, Republicans are willing to help. Let's work together to \nundo the harm of ObamaCare and start over with real, bipartisan, cost-\nsaving reforms, reforms that will actually allow Americans to keep the \nhealth plans they like. That is the kind of reform Americans really \nwant. If Democrats are ready to work with us, we can give them just \nthat.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Majority leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following my remarks the Senate will resume \nconsideration of S. 815, which is the Employment Non-Discrimination \nAct. At 11:45 there will be two rollcall votes, first on the Toomey \namendment and then a cloture vote on the bill. If cloture is invoked, \nthere will be a third rollcall vote on passage of the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Billy Graham\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy to join with my friend in happy \nbirthday wishes for Billy Graham. I have not had the good fortune to \nmeet this man, but I have read his book. I read a biography of him. He \nis such a personality I thought that was something I should do, and I \ndid.\n  I remember a lot of things about the book. The one thing I do \nremember is this: He is so scrupulous in making sure there is never any \nquestion about his integrity, his moral integrity. We have had a lot of \nproblems with people preaching who do not turn out to be so good. But \nBilly Graham, among other things, would never meet a female in his \noffice without the door being wide open so people could see everything \nthat was going on in that room. That is just an indication of the kind \nof person he is.\n  I join with my friend in congratulating Billy Graham in his 95th \nyear.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  The remarks of my friend, the Republican leader, kind of remind me of \na joke that is not very funny, but it is a joke and I think it makes \nthe point. Prison setting--these people run out of material for jokes. \nThey are there together all the time and hear the same joke day after \nday. So they decided what they would do is they would list the best \njokes from 1 to 50, and rather than tell the joke over and over, they \nwould just yell a number and people would laugh.\n  That is what we have here. Why don't our Republican colleagues just \nnumber from 1 through 50 their criticisms of ObamaCare, and rather than \ncoming and giving these speeches, I think we would be much better off \nif they would just give us a number and we would all--because we have \nheard these speeches so many times--immediately laugh because basically \nthey are jokes too.\n  It is too bad that the Republican leader and many of his Republican \ncolleagues want to keep fighting an old\n\n[[Page S7893]]\n\nfight. Four years ago we passed the health care reform bill. The \nPresident signed it, the Supreme Court upheld it, and it is the law of \nthe land. Of course, we want to make it better, and certainly with what \nhas happened with the rollout of the Web site, we need to do that. But \nI wish our Republican colleagues would stop trying to scare people out \nof participating in this program. If they would stop fighting last \nyear's fights and move on and try to do the business of the American \npeople, we would all be better off.\n  We can look back at the big changes we have made in legislation and \nwe have made some big changes over the years in this body and some of \nthose matters dealt with health care.\n  I was not here when Medicare passed, but I remember how important it \nwas, because at the time it passed, I was the chairman of the board of \ntrustees--an elected official in Nevada--with the biggest hospital \ndistrict in Nevada. They had lots of beds and lots of patients. So I \nremember the impact of Medicare. We also know Medicare did not become \npopular overnight. There were a lot of criticisms about it.\n  Although not nearly as big as ObamaCare or Medicare, I was here when \nwe passed--under the leadership of President Bush No. 2--the Medicare \ndrug benefit bill. A number of us didn't like that. We thought it \ndidn't go far enough and that it should have been done differently, but \nit passed in this body and became the law of the land. It was difficult \nto get that up and running, but we did not come to the floor and say: \nGet rid of this bill. We believed, as imperfect as it was, it was the \nbeginning of building support and doing something about health care in \nAmerica.\n  I wish my Republican colleagues would do something constructive \nregarding health care. We have not heard one positive remark about what \nthey would do to change what we have already done. I think we would all \nbe better off if that were, in fact, the case. This legislation is \nworking, and it will work even better when we get the issues regarding \nthe Web site worked out.\n  There are people in Nevada, there are people in New Jersey, there are \npeople in Indiana, and there are people all over America today who are \nbenefiting as a result of what happened 4 years ago in the Senate and \nthe House of Representatives when the President signed the bill.\n  I am sure the Presiding Officer, and other people who are listening \nto this speech, can identify with someone who has or had a preexisting \ndisability. Under the old law, if you were a woman, it was a \npreexisting disability. You could be charged differently because you \nwere a woman. A child born with diabetes, an adult with diabetes, \nsomeone who had been in an automobile accident, someone who was--my \nfriend Tony Coelho, who was one of the leaders when I served in the \nHouse with him, was an epileptic. He had a preexisting disability, and \nthat is an understatement.\n  We could go on and on. If you are under age 18, it doesn't matter if \nyou have a preexisting disability. At the first of the year, you can be \nan adult and have a preexisting disability and you can get insurance. \nIn many States we extended the preexisting disability exemption to \nadults. It is already in effect in a number of States because under the \nlaw the States had the authority to do that, and the Federal Government \nwill help them.\n  The Bush drug benefit was flawed. What did we do with it? We didn't \ntry get rid of it, we improved it. The so-called doughnut hole is being \nfilled and millions of senior citizens, and Americans over the last 4 \nyears, have received millions and millions of dollars in benefits \nbecause our drugs are cheaper.\n  I have talked on this floor before, and I will say it again--in my \nhometown of Searchlight, NV, there was a young man who was in college \nand on his parents' insurance. In Nevada you could stay on your \nparents' insurance until you were 23 years old. Within a matter of \nweeks of turning 23, he started getting very sick. He had testicular \ncancer. His parents had no money. One of my friends who is a \nneurologist did the surgery for free, but he had two other surgeries \nthat were not free.\n  His parents had no money; one was a retired operating engineer and \none worked part-time in a post office there in Searchlight. They \nstruggled, and their son Jeff has been taken care of. Many people don't \nhave the benefit of his parents who sacrificed a great deal for their \nboy. That is no longer a problem. Children can stay on their parents' \ninsurance for 3 more years, and that would have allowed Jeff, and other \nmen and women just like him, to get out of school.\n  ObamaCare is a wonderful piece of legislation for America. Let's make \nit better. Stop carping about this. Get over it. It is the law. It is \nthe legacy of Barack Obama and always will be. Let's make it better and \nstop the mischievous, unfortunate speeches out here every day about how \nbad it is. Talk about the good things in this bill and help us work to \nmake it better.\n\n\n                   Employment Non-discrimination Act\n\n  This afternoon the Senate will vote to advance the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act. It is legislation that will protect all Americans \nfrom workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender \nidentity. The vote on cloture on the bill will take place before lunch \nand vote on final passage will take place before the caucus adjourns. \nWe will start voting at 1:45 this afternoon.\n  I do hope and expect a bipartisan vote, a good one, to extend \nsafeguards against workplace harassment and discrimination to every \nAmerican. The time has come for Congress to pass a Federal law that \nensures all citizens, regardless of where they live, can go to work \nunafraid of being who they are.\n  More than 80 percent of the American people think that is already the \nlaw. It is not already the law, but that is what they think, so let's \njust do what the American people think already exists.\n  I appreciate Chairman Harkin. He is a devoted person for people who \nneed help. If you ever wondered how C-SPAN has closed captioning, it is \nbecause Tom Harkin led the fight here for many years in the Senate to \nprovide closed captioning. He has a brother who is hearing impaired, \nand because of that, he was focused on providing closed captioning. We \nhave all kinds of good things for the disabled thanks to Tom Harkin. \nThe disabilities act, which is so important for our country, is now the \nlaw. So I appreciate Chairman Harkin's work on this legislation. It is \na shame for Iowa and the country that he has decided not to run for \nreelection. What a good man.\n  Jeff Merkley, from Oregon, also worked on this legislation. He has \ndevoted huge amounts of time to this legislation, and I admire and \nrespect him so very much. I respect and appreciate the leadership of \nthese two fine Senators.\n  I hope Speaker Boehner will reconsider his decision not to bring this \nup for a vote in the House of Representatives. This legislation would \npass by a nice margin in the House if the Speaker would allow a vote on \nit.\n  I can't understand what is going on in the House of Representatives. \nLegislation the American people want is held up over there. The farm \nbill would save this country $23 billion, and they will not bring it \nup. The American people want this. There are reforms in the legislation \nthat Senator Stabenow and others have worked so hard to put in place \nfor decades. They are in this bill. The House is holding this up.\n  Immigration reform. America wants immigration reform. They are going \nto get it, but it is just too bad that it is being fought every step of \nthe way by my friend, the Speaker. Comprehensive immigration reform is \nsomething that is needed in this body; it is needed in the House. We \nhave already passed it. It should be the law of the land. They seem to \nbe so focused on debt reduction. Well, immigration reform saves $1 \ntrillion of debt.\n  Marketplace fairness would allow little strip mall operators and \nsmall businesses to have the same benefits others have. It is unfair \nthat brick-and-mortar businesses that pay rent cannot be competitive \nwith the businesses on the Internet that pay no sales tax. The House is \nholding that up, and now they are holding this up. That is just another \npiece of legislation that people around America support and the House \nis holding up. I hope the Speaker will reconsider his position.\n\n\n                      DC Circuit Court of Appeals\n\n  I will also file cloture today on the nomination of a highly \nqualified jurist to serve on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. The DC \nCircuit is often called\n\n[[Page S7894]]\n\nthe second highest court in the land. No one has debated that in any \nother way. It is so important. It is no wonder why. Here is what former \nDC Circuit Chief Judge Patricia Wald said of the court's caseload: \n``The DC Circuit hears the most complex, time-consuming, labyrinthine \ndisputes over regulations with the greatest impact on ordinary \nAmericans' lives.''\n  It is unfortunate that Republicans are filibustering another talented \nand dedicated public servant nominated to service on this crucial \ncourt.\n  Georgetown law professor Nina Pillard is the next victim of what the \nRepublicans are doing. She graduated magna cum laude from Yale and \nattended Harvard Law School. For 5 years she litigated individual and \nclass action racial discrimination cases as an attorney for the NAACP \nLegal Defense Fund.\n  She served as Deputy Assistant Attorney General and Assistant \nSolicitor General. Support for her confirmation is bipartisan. Two top \nJustice Department officials from the Bush era, Assistant Attorney \nGeneral Viet Dinh and former FBI Director William Sessions, have \nsupported her nomination.\n  Professor Pillard is also faculty codirector of the Supreme Court \nInstitute at Georgetown, which helps attorneys to argue cases before \nthe High Court. She brings a wealth of knowledge to the job. She has \nargued nine cases before the Supreme Court and has written briefs for \nanother 25. Her arguments helped open the Virginia Military Institute \nto women in 1997 and beat back a constitutional challenge of the Family \nand Medical Leave Act.\n  She is qualified and dedicated. It is truly a shame that Republicans \nwould filibuster this nomination for unrelated political reasons. The \nDC Circuit is currently operating with only 8 of its 11 seats. While \nSenate Republicans are blocking President Obama's nominees to this \nvital court, they were happy to confirm judges to the DC Circuit when \nPresident Reagan and both President Bushes were in office.\n  Republicans have already blocked two exceedingly qualified nominees \nto the DC Circuit, Caitlin Halligan and Patricia Millett. I hope my \nRepublican colleagues will not block another qualified nominee when we \nvote on cloture on this matter next week. This nominee deserves a fair \nconfirmation process and a simple up-or-down vote.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  Mr. REID.

This issue is an important component in the \ndebate on the legislation that we are currently considering, but it's \nalso an issue that defines, I believe, who we are as a Nation as well \nas the rights granted to us in the Constitution.\n  To paraphrase what Thomas Jefferson said in 1807, for Americans, he \nsaid, `Among the most inestimable of our blessings' is the blessing `of \nliberty to worship our Creator in the way we think most agreeable to \nHis will; a liberty deemed in other countries incompatible with good \ngovernment and yet proved by our experience to be its best support.'\n  From Jefferson's time to today, freedom of religion has been a core \nAmerican principle, a principle our founding fathers put their lives on \nthe line for and a principle that generations of Americans in uniform \nhave defended so that we can all enjoy this cherished freedom. \nUnfortunately, this principle of religious freedom is under attack \nacross our country today. Though in many cases these attacks may be \nsubtle, make no mistake, we are seeing the free exercise of religion \nand freedom of speech constrained and restricted.\n  We have seen it in the administration's rule regarding church-\naffiliated groups to facilitate insurance coverage that includes \ncontraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs despite their deeply held \nreligious beliefs.\n  I think about my alma mater, Wheaton College in Illinois, which is a \nschool from which Billy Graham graduated years ago.\n  I appreciate the Senate's Majority Leader and Minority Leader's \nreference to his life as he celebrates his 95th birthday. Billy Graham \nhad an important impact on my life and millions of people--not just \nAmericans, but people around the world. I appreciate the recognition \nthat has been given here by our leaders.\n  I also think about Indiana-based University of Notre Dame. Despite \nconscious objections and the clearly outlined standards of these \ncolleges and universities--the College's Community Covenant at Wheaton \nand the values of the University of Notre Dame--they have been told by \nthe government that they are not considered religious institutions and \nmust comply with the Health and Human Services Mandate.\n  Let me describe a little bit the thread of faith that runs through \nevery aspect of a school like Wheaton College and the values of faith \nexpressed frequently in a number of ways by the University of Notre \nDame. If you tune into the Notre Dame football programs on Saturday \nafternoons, as I do every week, or intend to do, you will see an ad by \nFather Jenkins, President of Notre Dame, that talks about the component \nand element of faith that is essential to the beliefs of what the \nUniversity of Notre Dame is trying to address through its education \nprocess.\n  Whether it is professors or students, administrators or \ngroundskeepers or others that thread of faith and values runs through \nthe university and throughout my alma mater as well. There's such a \nthing as, it's been described by former president of Wheaton College, \nas umbrella universities--those [universities] that have a faith \ncomponent perhaps in a theological school or a religious program. The \nthought is well, certainly, they can exercise their constitutional \nrights guaranteed by the First Amendment. But what about the doorkeeper \nor receptionist at the administration building or the coaches of the \nteams or the professors? Sure the professor of theology and the \nprofessor of religion, but what about the professor of science, \nprofessor of economics, or the professor of business, how does that \napply? Or what about the groundskeepers or those who serve the meals in \nthe cafeterias to the students? Well, there are those types of \ninstitutions, and there is an argument that it is not systemic, it is \nnot the thread that runs through every aspect of the program. And this \napplies to homeless shelters and faith-based institutions across \nAmerica. Some are secular related. Some are a mix of secular-religious. \nAnd some are systemically faith-based where a thread of faith runs \nthrough every aspect of their program or the institution.\n  So what we're talking about here is a situation where institutions of \neducation, like Wheaton College and the University of Notre Dame, or \nfaith-based institutions reaching out through homeless shelters, food \nkitchens, any number of programs provided by faith-based institutions \nor individuals engaged in this that believe that the thread of faith is \nimportant to their success and that's why they're there.\n  These faith-based institutions have been told by the government that \nthey're not considered religious institutions and must comply with the\n\n[[Page S7895]]\n\nHealth and Human Services Mandate. Last year administration officials \nsaid they worked out a compromise on this rule, but the fact is the \nmandate still exists. These institutions should not have to facilitate \ninsurance coverage for products that are counter to their moral \nbeliefs. In my opinion, to require faith-based institutions to betray \nthe fundamental tenets of their beliefs and accept this violation of \ntheir First Amendment rights guaranteed by the Constitution is simply \nwrong.\n  I think about the health care professionals who have been required to \nparticipate--required by the government--to participate in medical \nprocedures that violate their rights of conscience and their deeply \nheld religious beliefs about the meaning of life and when life begins.\n  I think about the recent efforts in many States to force churches and \nreligious professionals into performing rituals or ceremonies that run \ncounter to their faith.\n  So what is at stake here is of extreme significance. Established in \nour nation's founding days and sustained for over 200 years, this \nprinciple is at the very core of our system of government, as Jefferson \nwas trying to say.\n  We can't pick and choose when to adhere to the Constitution and when \nto cast it aside for cheap political prerogatives. We must consistently \nstand for these timeless constitutional granted privileges and rights.\n  The legislation before us raises very serious concerns regarding \nreligious freedom. The so-called protections from religious liberty in \nthis bill are vaguely defined and do not extend to all organizations \nthat wish to adhere to their moral or religious beliefs in their hiring \npractices.\n\n  For example, the religious beliefs of faith-based childcare providers \nand small business owners would be disregarded under this legislation. \nFaith-based daycare providers could be forced to hire individuals with \nviews contrary to the faith and incorporated values of these daycare \nproviders. Do we really want to support policies that discriminate \nagainst an employer's religious beliefs and require employers to hire \nindividuals who contradict their very most deeply held religious \nbeliefs?\n  This bill also would allow employers to be held liable to workplace \nenvironment complaints opening the door to the silencing of employees \nwho express their deeply held beliefs. This possibility runs counter to \neverything America stands for in the realm of free speech.\n  Now I know there have been some efforts, including amendments offered \nby my colleagues, Senator Toomey from Pennsylvania and Senator Portman \nfrom Ohio, to clarify the existing religious protections in this bill. \nSome Members believe that these amendments go too far. I frankly \nbelieve they don't go far enough. However, they are at least a first \nstep, and I will support these two measures not to make a bad bill \nbetter, but to highlight the importance of the freedom of religion \nprinciple involved in this legislation.\n  Let me quote from Jay Sekulow, Chief Counsel for the American Center \nfor Law and Justice. He wrote this:\n\n       A steadfast commitment to one's religious scruples was once \n     lauded as a virtue, but in the current public discourse, \n     religious objectors are often chastised as seeking special \n     treatment that would impose their values on others. The \n     apparent unpopularity of the expression of religious values \n     through actions or words brings to mind Justice Oliver \n     Wendell Holmes' observation that: ``We should be eternally \n     vigilant against attempts to check the expression of opinions \n     that we loathe and believe to be fraught with death and the \n     Supreme Court's more recent reminder that the First Amendment \n     protects expression, be it of the popular variety or not.'''\n\n  The Supreme Court's recent reminder and I quote again, ``the First \nAmendment protects expression, be it of the popular variety or not.'' \nIt is an important thing for us to remember from a very respected \nSupreme Court judge.\n  I oppose discrimination of any kind, and that includes discrimination \nagainst individuals or institutions for their faith and values, which \noften gets lost and has been lost in this discussion. So there's two \ntypes of discrimination here we're dealing with and one of those goes \nto the very fundamental right granted to every American through our \nConstitution, a cherished value of the freedom of expression and \nreligion. And I believe this bill diminishes that freedom.\n  So I feel it's vital for this body to stand up for our country's \nlong-standing right to the freedom of religion and speech. For these \nreasons, I am not able to support this current legislation, and I hope \nmy colleagues would stand with me in protecting our religious freedom \nand oppose this legislation.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his suggestion for \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. COATS. I will, and I apologize for not recognizing my colleague, \nwho is standing in the back row. My eyesight is not as good as it used \nto be.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I can see my colleague from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nEmployment Non-Discrimination Act.\n  In many towns, cities, and States across our country, it is still \nperfectly legal to fire someone simply because they are gay. One can be \na hard worker who shows up on time and gets exemplary performance \nreviews, but if a person's boss discovers that he or she is gay or \ntransgender or suspects it, he can fire a person for being who they are \nor for whom they love, and there is nothing the person can do about it.\n  That is a terrible injustice for Americans who happen to be LGBT. It \nviolates the principle that we are all equal under the law. We all \ndeserve the chance to work hard and to prove ourselves, regardless of \nour race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, age, \nsexual orientation, or gender identity.\n  Many Americans do not realize it remains legal to discriminate \nagainst LGBT Americans in the workplace. In one recent poll, eight in \nten Americans believe it is already illegal under Federal law to fire \nor refuse to hire someone because of their sexual orientation or gender \nidentity. Doesn't that tell us something about how obviously right ENDA \nis?\n  The debate we are having in the Senate today is about whether we \nshould ensure LGBT Americans don't suffer discrimination in the \nworkplace. I have long been a supporter of ENDA, and enacting it into \nlaw is something we should have done a long time ago. In fact, 17 years \nago, it came within one vote of passing in the Senate.\n  Making ENDA law will be the next significant step in the fight for \nequality for LGBT Americans. After decades of struggle, we have \nachieved a number of huge victories in rapid succession: ending don't \nask, don't tell; overturning the Federal ban on same-sex marriage \nrecognition; the achievement of marriage equality in more and more of \nour States, including my home State of Minnesota.\n  While we are debating ENDA in the Senate today, equality in the \nworkplace is, in fact, something we achieved in Minnesota over two \ndecades ago. In 1993, the Minnesota State legislature amended our \nState's human rights act to protect Minnesota's workers from \ndiscrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. At \nthe time only a few States prohibited discrimination based on sexual \norientation, and Minnesota was the first State to include protections \nfor transgender workers.\n  We have had this law in effect now for over 20 years in Minnesota, \nand what has been the result? Well, for LGBT Minnesotans it has meant \nthey do not have to live in fear of being fired or discriminated \nagainst in hiring just because of who they are or because of whom they \nlove. That is a big deal.\n  But if you are not an LGBT Minnesotan, very little has changed. Some \npeople, including House Speaker Boehner, are opposing ENDA because they \nclaim it will cause frivolous lawsuits and be bad for business. The \nMinnesota experience shows these fears are unfounded. There has not \nbeen a flood of lawsuits because the rights of LGBT Minnesotans are \nwisely respected. And with 19 Fortune 500 companies, Minnesota has \nbecome an ever better place to work and do business. Minnesota is \nbasically the same as it was before this law was passed, except that it \nis better because LGBT Minnesotans are free from discrimination at \nwork.\n  Let me give you one example. Last year, a vice president from General \nMills--the Minnesota-based company\n\n[[Page S7896]]\n\nthat is one of the world's largest food companies and which currently \nemploys 35,000 people and makes Cheerios--spoke at a Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing about General Mills' \nsupport for making sure that the same legal protections people have in \nMinnesota are extended to workers all across the United States.\n  The General Mills vice president spoke about how the company's policy \nof inclusion has contributed to its innovation and growth. He said:\n\n       Employees who are members of the GLBT community are \n     incredible contributors to our enterprise. Absent their \n     unique perspectives, talents, and gifts, we would be less \n     competitive and successful. Simply said, talent matters. Now \n     more than ever, American business needs to leverage the \n     ingenuity of all sectors for our nation. Discriminatory \n     barriers to top talent just don't make business sense.\n\n  And there are many other large employers headquartered in Minnesota--\nTarget, Supervalu, U.S. Bancorp, Xcel Energy, Medtronic, 3M, Cargill, \nBest Buy, and many others--who have put in place companywide policies \nagainst discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual \norientation wherever their other factories or businesses or stores may \nbe.\n  Minnesota's small businesses have also reported on the positive \neffects of Minnesota's human rights law. For instance, Nancy Lyons is \nthe owner of a small 70-person Minneapolis business that develops \nsoftware. Nancy says the protections and peace of mind her employees \nget from not living in fear positively impact every aspect of their \nlives, from their productivity at work to their family lives.\n  It is long past time that LGBT employees around the country be \nguaranteed the same rights they have had in Minnesota for 20 years. In \nMinnesota, our law has given LGBT Minnesotans peace of mind and freedom \nfrom discrimination at work and improved the overall climate in our \nState for those individuals, for families, and for businesses. I look \nforward to the Senate passing this bill, and I hope the House will take \nit up and pass it as well.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to urge \nmy colleagues again to focus on an important issue in the overall \nObamaCare debate; and that is how Washington fares under ObamaCare, and \ndoes Washington live by the same rules, the same laws it passes on the \nrest of America?\n  All across the country, as we see daily in news reports, Americans \nare struggling with real issues and real challenges created by \nObamaCare. We need to fix those issues and those challenges. We need to \nget it right. But at the same time as that is going on in the real \nworld, Washington--leaders here--basically get an exemption, a \ncarveout, special treatment, a subsidy. That is particularly egregious \nand particularly unfair when ordinary Americans suffer under these very \nreal challenges.\n  That is why I have introduced my No Washington Exemption from \nObamaCare bill, and that is why I continue to work hard with many other \nMembers--we have significant coauthors here and in the House--to get \nthat passed.\n  With regard to Congress, the ObamaCare statute actually got it right. \nAnd with regard to Congress, all we are asking for is that we live by \nthe statute, live by the law. That statutory language says clearly that \nevery Member of Congress and all of our congressional official staff go \nto the exchanges for our health care and be treated just like other \nAmericans going to the exchanges--many of them being forced off plans, \nemployer plans they like, and having to go to the exchanges--no special \ntreatment, no special exemption or carveout or subsidy.\n  The problem is that after the law passed--I guess it was a classic \ncase of what Nancy Pelosi said: We need to pass the law in order to \nfigure out what is in it--because after ObamaCare passed with that \nspecific statutory language, a lot of folks on Capitol Hill read it, \nfigured out what was in it, and said: Oh, you know what. We can't have \nthis. We can't live with this. And then they furiously started lobbying \nfor a way out, for an end-run around: And sure enough, they got it. The \nObama administration issued a special rule for Congress to take all of \nthat financial sting out of the provision.\n  The rule basically said two things, both of which I think are \noutrageous and contrary to the statute itself. First of all, it said: I \nknow the law says all official staff go to the exchanges. But we don't \nknow who that is. We don't know who official staff are. So we are going \nto leave it up to each individual Member of Congress to designate who \nis official staff who must go to the exchanges for their health care.\n  Well, I think that is flat-out ridiculous. The law, the statute, \nclearly says all official congressional staff. To create this \nopportunity for exemption, where each individual Member designates \nstaff as official or not, is silly. That designation, by the way, \nhappened last week, and some Members have actually said: None of my \nstaff is official. I have no official staff for purposes of this \nsection, so none of my staff go to the exchanges. That is outrageous. \nOther Members said: Well, my personal office staff is official but \ncommittee staff, no; leadership staff, no. That is outrageous too.\n  The second thing this illegal rule did to get around the impact of \nthis provision of ObamaCare is to say: Well, for Members and staff who \ndo go to the exchanges, they get to take with them a huge taxpayer-\nfunded subsidy--a big subsidy no other American at that income level \ngets. That is not in the ObamaCare statute either, and that is contrary \nto the ObamaCare statute. In fact, that specific language was \nconsidered for inclusion and was not put in--proof that was not the \nintent of that section of ObamaCare.\n  I believe that is outrageous as well and defeats the whole purpose of \nthe section, which is to make sure Members of Congress and our staff \nwalk in the same shoes as other Americans, 8 million-plus of whom are \nbeing forced off coverage they like and being forced on to that \nObamaCare exchange.\n  That is why I have joined with others to push this No Washington \nExemption from ObamaCare language.\n  As I mentioned, one key element is this election that this illegal \nrule creates, where every individual Member of Congress determines who \non their staff goes to the exchange or does not. As I said, in some \ncases, Members say: I have no official staff. Nobody has to live by the \nlaw, nobody has to live by this mandate, which is particularly \noutrageous.\n  To add insult to injury, these individual decisions by every Member \nof Congress are not public. This is all secretive. This is hidden from \nthe public. Some Members have said what they are doing through the \npress, but the full information, each individual Member's election in \nthis regard is not public.\n  So as soon as that loophole was created, I filed another bill, \nanother piece of legislation, that simply says we are going to make all \nof these decisions public. Everybody has a right to know how each \nMember of the Senate, how each Member of the House is handling the \nsituation. That is my Show Your Exemptions bill, which I filed about 10 \ndays ago.\n  I think it should be a no-brainer. I think it should be beyond \ndebate. Whatever you think about the underlying issue, whatever you \nthink about ObamaCare, shouldn't this decision of each individual \nMember be made public? Shouldn't the public have a right to know? That \nis why I filed this bill, and that is why I am pushing for a vote on \nthis bill.\n  Getting a vote on that proposal will be a key priority of mine, \nparticularly when we consider the drug compounding bill in the near \nfuture and when we consider the Department of Defense authorization \nbill. It is going to be my key priority: to get a simple vote on that \nsimple proposal. Again, I believe that should be a no-brainer, that \nthis information--which does involve how taxpayer dollars are being \ntreated, which does involve how congressional offices are handling the \nsituation--that information one way or the other be made public. You do \nnot need to editorialize about it. Everybody can make up their own mind \nabout what they think about the underlying issue, about what they think \nabout ObamaCare, but shouldn't that information be made public?\n  We need to vote on that proposal, and I urge us to move and agree \nquickly to\n\n[[Page S7897]]\n\nhave a vote, either in the context of the drug compounding bill or the \nDefense authorization bill over the next few weeks. Those are probably \ngoing to be the only opportunities for a vote this calendar year. I \nthink it is certainly fair and reasonable to get that vote, have the \nAmerican people be able to see that information, and that is the only \nopportunity I am likely to have in the Senate this calendar year.\n  Again, whatever my colleagues think about the underlying issue, \ncertainly whatever we all think about ObamaCare, I would hope we can \nall agree--that election, that information, how each individual Member \nof the Senate, each individual Member of the House, handles the \nsituation should be made public. It certainly involves public policy \nand taxpayer dollars and how we run Congress. It should be made public.\n  I urge my colleagues--Republicans and Democrats--to unite around that \nreasonable, commonsense proposal and get that information out to the \npublic, as it should.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Excuse me. I withhold my suggestion of the absence of a quorum, but I \ndo yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                            Budgetary Waste\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, after weeks of budgetary wrangling and a \ngovernment shutdown that had the country on edge, last week marked the \nbeginning of the bicameral budget conference. I commend my colleagues \nwho are meeting on the issue and are trying to reconcile the goals of \nwildly different budget outlines. That is no easy task. I think we all \nknow that. However, we all know that shoveling more IOUs into our $17 \ntrillion debt is simply unsustainable.\n  No matter on which side of the aisle we sit, I hope we can all agree \nthat America's present fiscal trajectory is untenable and that our \nNation's future depends on turning these economic issues around. There \nis no secret formula. At a minimum, Congress should abide by the budget \ncontrol framework which has produced some of the most meaningful \ndiscretionary spending reductions in decades. Beyond that, we have to \nslow the rising costs of entitlement programs in order to achieve \nsignificant long-term deficit reduction.\n  Sadly, some seem fixated on spending beyond the BCA's cap for next \nyear. Some of our colleagues have suggested that the spending \ndiscipline we achieved with the sequester should be replaced with \nrevenue increases. Now, we all know that sequestration is a blunt \ninstrument for reducing spending, but this desire to replace it by \ndriving up taxes is based on an incorrect assessment. Washington has a \nspending problem, not a revenue problem. In 2013 the government spent \nsome $3.5 trillion. We are on track to spend another $3.7 trillion in \n2014. Before anyone starts to look at tax hikes, we should realize that \nwe are nowhere near cutting our budget to the bone. In fact, there is a \nlot of fat left in a lot of agencies. These budgets deserve to get the \nknife. But do not just take my word for it. The administration, our \ncolleagues in the Congressional Budget Office, the Government \nAccountability Office, and numerous concerned-taxpayer organizations \nhave also posed examples of wasteful spending that should be \neliminated.\n  If the sequester's bluntness has taught us anything, it is that \nCongress ought to jump at the chance to make smart, surgical spending \ncuts. To that end, I intend to take 5 minutes each week for the coming \nweeks to highlight some of the wasteful spending programs that still, \neven in times of economic belt-tightening, lurk in our Federal budget.\n  Today I would like to highlight some of the programs in the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture. With a budget request of $146 billion in \n2014, the USDA rounds out the top five most expensive Federal agencies. \nMany programs within the USDA provide valuable services, including meat \ninspection, crop data collection, and managing the agricultural safety \nnet. But the USDA also has its own agency-level homeland security \ndepartment, pays for Sunkist to advertise overseas, and underwrites an \nastonishing number of zero-down-payment suburban home mortgages. That \nis the USDA.\n  The most obvious place to realize significant savings in the USDA is \nwith the Federal Crop Insurance Program. Here is a program in which the \ntaxpayers cover the majority of the risk. It pays private insurance \nagents commissions to sell and administer individual policies. It funds \nthe oversight of the program and, on top of all of that, subsidizes \npolicyholders' premiums. That is a pretty good deal if you can get it.\n  In 2012 taxpayers spent more than $7 billion to subsidize this \nprogram. In 2010--one of the better recent crop years--when the USDA \ntook in a record $2.5 billion more than it paid in claims, the Federal \nCrop Insurance Program still cost taxpayers $3.7 billion. That is \nbecause taxpayers foot the bill for roughly two-thirds of each premium, \nleaving the policyholder only to cover the remaining third.\n  Congress could reap significant savings just by reducing the \npercentage the taxpayers have to spend to subsidize these premiums. In \nfact, according to CBO, simply rolling back the percentage of taxpayer \nsubsidy in the program to pre-2000 levels would shave more than $40 \nbillion in spending from the pre-2013 farm bill baseline. To that end, \nI have introduced the Crop Insurance Subsidy Reduction Act, which would \ndo just that.\n  There are a number of other places at USDA where Congress can find \nsavings. Surely one of those is USDA's own Office of Homeland Security, \ncreated in the post-9/11 security glut. This department is supposedly \nresponsible for providing oversight and coordination for USDA's \npreparation and response to matters of homeland security importance. A \n$1 million program such as this may be easily lost in the President's \n$4 trillion budget, but there is an entire agency in the Federal \nGovernment tasked with the same objective and funded with the tens of \nbillions of taxpayer dollars.\n  Another place to find savings at USDA is in the Market Access \nProgram, which has spent $1.4 billion since 2006 and looks to collect \nanother $200 million in taxpayer funds in 2014. This program has spent \nbillions of tax dollars on overseas advertising campaigns that benefit \nsome of the most deep-pocketed corporations around, including \nMcDonalds, Nabisco, Welch's Foods, and Sunkist.\n  When it comes to questionable budgetary items at USDA, the single-\nfamily housing direct and guaranteed loan program takes the cake. This \nobscure but growing home loan program writes and guarantees mortgages \nfor low- and moderate-income families in rural and suburban areas. \nThese loans are 100 percent financed and require no down payment. While \nhome buyers in big cities are not eligible for these loans, residents \nof many fast-growing towns and suburbs--some within 30 miles of this \nvery building--are receiving those kinds of subsidies. Do not be fooled \ninto thinking these loans are for rustic farmhouses either. They are \nspecifically designed to finance your standard home, and, inexplicably, \nthe USDA discourages buyers from using them to purchase farms or \nranches. This is the USDA discouraging us from using these subsidies to \npurchase farms and ranches but, rather, regular homes.\n  Since 2006 the USDA--remember, that is the Department of \nAgriculture--has spent nearly $10 billion on single-family housing \ndirect loans. While it did not show up in the budget, home loan \nguarantees by the USDA have also put taxpayers on the hook for another \n$118 billion. The agency has requested another $320 million to fund \nsingle-family housing direct loans in 2014 and plans to issue another \n$24 billion in guarantees. To put the figures in perspective, the \nentire Department of Housing and Urban Development submitted a budget \nrequest of $47 billion.\n  When we have such egregious examples of waste, why should we demand \nmore of the taxpayers' money?\n  In the coming weeks I hope my colleagues on the budget conference \ncommittee, along with the President and Members of Congress and various \nfiscal organizations, will consider some of the proposals I am offering \nto eliminate this wasteful spending. A good start would be sowing the \nseeds of fiscal restraint at the Department of Agriculture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n[[Page S7898]]\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a short \ncolloquy with the distinguished Senator from Arizona and the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I appreciate so much the comments of my \ncolleague from Arizona on the challenges inherent in getting our budget \nunder control. I particularly appreciated over the last few days the \nconversation we have had about the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.\n  I would like to say that the Senator from Arizona has brought \nparticular value in expressing concerns about how we make sure \nbusinesses have the guidance they will need to implement this act \neffectively, particularly as this act embraces an area--that is, \ntransgender discrimination--that was not part of the act considered in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I appreciate the work the Senator from \nOregon did with my office this week to try to arrive at language we \ncould put into an amendment. We were not able to get that amendment.\n  When I voted for ENDA in the House in 2007, as the Senator mentioned, \nit did not contain the provisions with regard to gender identity. Those \nadded provisions have concerned me in terms of potential costs of \nlitigation or compliance. I still have those concerns. I hope that as \nwe work through the process, as this bill moves on to the House, we can \nfind ways to make sure employers can implement these provisions in a \nway that is reasonable and proper.\n  I also thank the Senator from Wisconsin for working with my office on \nthese issues as well. I have a better appreciation for what needs to be \ndone and what we can do with this legislation as it moves through the \nprocess.\n  I yield to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I would like to express my appreciation \nand gratitude to the Senator from Arizona for his very thoughtful and \ncareful approach to considering this legislation. I enjoyed working \nwith the Senator during our days in the House of Representatives and \nremember well the vote the Senator cast back in 2007 after great study \nand reflection.\n  I think we find ourselves in the position we are in right now, with \nan expanded bill that has protections for both sexual orientation and \ngender identity, because of the leadership of the Senator from Oregon.\n  To the point of the concerns that have been raised in this colloquy, \nthere has been a really exhaustive amount of research done on those \nStates that have passed similar pieces of legislation at the State \nlevel and how they chose to move forward on employment protections on \nthe basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. I have discussed \nwith the Senator from Oregon on numerous occasions the approach most \nStates have taken and the success these bills have had in helping to \nkeep all of our employment decisions based on work ethic, character, \nand loyalty, and the subjects on which they should be focused.\n  I look forward to working on this measure in the future, and I thank \nboth the Senators from Arizona and the Senator from Oregon for their \nfocus on ENDA.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I look forward to that conversation as \nwell. The State of Wisconsin was one of the first or maybe the first in \nthe Nation to bring an end to workplace discrimination. Oregon has a \nfully inclusive bill that has worked very well. We have worked out a \ngreat partnership with the businesses of Oregon in making sure there is \nsatisfactory guidance for them. I look forward to bringing that \nexperience into this conversation about the concerns of the Senator \nfrom Arizona. I echo the appreciation for the thoughtful dialog we have \nhad over the past few days and look forward to future dialog as we \ncontinue to try to make this bill ending discrimination in the \nworkplace work well for businesses across the Nation and certainly for \nthe millions of LGBT Americans who will have the opportunity to break \nthese chains of discrimination and more fully participate in our \nnational economic life.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I thank both the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from \nWisconsin for working with me and look forward, as this process goes \non, to making sure the provisions in the legislation work for employers \nas well as for employees. I appreciate the work and the assistance the \nSenator has given our office. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Women's Rights\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Blumenthal and Senator \nBoxer, who will be joining me in this conversation in a few minutes.\n  I think that now more than ever, after we have emerged from this very \ndamaging and completely unnecessary government shutdown, the American \npeople want us to focus on jobs and the economy. That is what every \npoll says, that is what all of our constituents say, and that is \nabsolutely what is needed at a time when families continue to struggle \nto make ends meet.\n  Instead of working with us across the aisle on jobs and economic \ngrowth, it seems as if some Republicans are now focused on something \nelse entirely--politics. In fact, in a short while, the senior Senator \nfrom South Carolina is going to be introducing a bill that is blatantly \npolitical, a bill that not only undermines a woman's access to her \ndoctor but also restricts an array of reproductive health services.\n  Today we wish to make it abundantly clear; that is, that this \nextreme, unconstitutional abortion ban is an absolute nonstarter. It is \ngoing nowhere in the Senate and those Republicans know it.\n  I want to think that over the last 40 years, since the historic \ndecision of Roe v. Wade, we have moved on from debating this issue. I \nwish to think that after four decades many of those who want to make \nwomen's health care decisions for them have come to grips with the fact \nthat Roe v. Wade is settled law. After all, the many signs of progress \nare all around us.\n  This year a record 20 women are serving in this body. One year ago \nyesterday women's power and voice at the ballot box was heard loudly \nand clearly. In fact, last year when Republican candidates running for \noffice thought that rape was a political talking point, that idea and \ntheir candidacies were swiftly rejected, thanks in large part to the \nvoices of women. Only this week we saw women in Virginia resoundingly \nreject the Republican candidate for Governor and his misguided and \noutdated agenda for women's health.\n  Sometimes it is tempting to think that times have indeed changed, \nthat maybe politicians have realized that getting between a woman and \nher doctor is not their job, that it is possible that rightwing \nlegislators have a new-found respect for women's health care.\n  The truth is that the drumbeat of politically driven extremist and \nunconstitutional laws continues to get louder. Apparently some of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle want to make some noise about \nthis so that their adoring audience of rightwing radio hosts, \ncolumnists, and activists is satisfied.\n  In fact, here is an example of how blatantly political this \nrestrictive ban is. One of the actual participants in the press \nconference to introduce their bill today had this to say to Politico \nabout the strategy behind doing this. She said: ``It's a much better \nthing to be campaigning on rape and incest these days.''\n  That is an insult to women everywhere, and it is most certainly not \nwhat the Senator from South Carolina has called ``a debate worthy of a \ngreat democracy.''\n  This is a debate we have had. A woman's access to her own doctor is \nsettled law. We are not going to let attacks on Roe v. Wade such as \nthis one change that.\n  I wish to remind all of those who are even considering supporting \nthis bill that real women's lives and the most difficult health care \ndecisions they could ever possibly make are at stake.\n  I wish for us to consider the story that Judy Nicastro from my home \nState shared so bravely with the New York Times last summer. In an op-\ned she wrote only days after the House passed a bill that was virtually \nidentical to the one that is being introduced today, Judy talked about \nbeing\n\n[[Page S7899]]\n\nfaced with every pregnant woman's worst nightmare. In describing the \nnews that one of the twins she was carrying was facing a condition \nwhere only one lung chamber had formed and that it was only 20 percent \ncomplete, Judy captured the anguish that countless women in similar \npositions have faced. She wrote:\n\n       My world stopped. I loved being pregnant with twins and \n     trying to figure out which one was where in my uterus. \n     Sometimes it felt like a party in there with eight limbs \n     moving. The thought of losing one child was unbearable.\n\n  She went on to say:\n\n       The M.R.I., at Seattle Children's Hospital, confirmed our \n     fears: the organs were pushed up into our boy's chest and not \n     developing properly. We were in the 22nd week.\n\n  Under the bill that is being introduced, the decision Judy ultimately \nmade through painful conversations with her family and consultation \nwith her doctors would be illegal.\n  The decision to make sure, as she put it, ``our son was not born only \nto suffer'' would be taken from her and given to politicians.\n  I am here to provide a simple reality check. We are not going back. \nWe are not going back on settled law. We are not going to take away a \nwoman's ability to make her own decisions about her own health care and \nher own body. Women are not going back to a time when laws forced them \ninto back alleys and made them subject to primitive and unsanitary \ncare. Senators such as me, Senator Boxer, Senator Blumenthal, and \nothers who join me in opposing this effort are not going to go \nanywhere.\n  Advocates and doctors who treat women every day and know that their \nhealth care must be protected are not going to go anywhere. Women who \ncontinue to believe that their health care decisions are theirs alone \nare not going anywhere.\n  By the way, the Constitution is not going anywhere. Therefore, this \nbill is not going anywhere. This bill, as attacks on Roe v. Wade before \nit, will eventually be lost to history. But millions of American women \nwill not forget. I welcome our colleagues on the floor to this debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I thank my colleague from the State of Washington for \nher eloquence and leadership on this issue, as I do my colleague from \nCalifornia. She has been steadfast and strong in support of a woman's \nright to make choices about reproductive rights. She is absolutely \nright; we are not going away.\n  This bill that will be introduced later today from our colleague from \nSouth Carolina--as much as we respect him--is a nonstarter because it \nis nonsensical and unconstitutional. This bill was passed by the House \nof Representatives earlier this year. We could not have been clearer \nthen, and we should be very clear now, that it is inappropriate, \nunwise, and unfair. It remains so today and will be so for as long as \nwe are here.\n  This bill essentially leaves any woman who needs an abortion for \nhealth reasons--and I stress, for health reasons--after 20 weeks of a \npregnancy with no options--none. It punishes doctors with up to 5 years \nin prison for providing a service that the doctor believes, in his or \nher professional judgment, in his or her medical opinion, is best for \nher and her family. Those decisions are what the Constitution protects, \nwhat Roe v. Wade guarantees, what the right of privacy preserves in the \nright to be left alone.\n  Quite simply, this bill is bad for women, and it criminalizes medical \nprofessionals who would try to do what is right. I have a long history \nin law enforcement, and this sort of ban, which would leave women in \ncompletely desperate circumstances with no options is shortsighted, \nmisguided, and illegal. We should not be here talking about proposals \nthat would degrade and disgrace the Constitution, but about job \nmeasures, economic growth bills, and measures to solve the immense \nchallenges that confront us in dealing with budget issues. I thank the \nSenator from Washington State for the great work that she is doing on \nthose issues.\n  We should be debating the issues that concern and confront the \nAmerican people at this historic challenging time--not a measure that \nwill be struck down by the courts because it is so plainly \nunconstitutional and so clearly bad policy--not only for women but for \nmen, families, and for all of us.\n  We have seen bill after bill in recent times stalled by disagreements \nover health care. We have seen the Federal Government shut down over \nhealth care. Now we see another legislative attempt to win, \nessentially, political points at the expense of risking the health and \nwelfare of women and children in this country. The attack on women's \nhealth care must stop.\n  We are here in the midst of a busy legislative session to restate the \nfact that this bill is going nowhere. My colleagues and I will not \nallow this bill to put women's lives at risk, and to put their health \ncare in jeopardy with politically motivated attempts at destroying \nconstitutionally protected rights. That is why we are elected to this \nbody, to take a stand and speak out, to protect the people who are most \nvulnerable, and to make sure that women who are at risk can be allowed \nto make personal private decisions about their health and their bodies \nwithout obtrusive interference from the government.\n  These decisions should be made by women, their families, the medical \nprofession, and whomever else they wish to consult, not by politicians.\n  I yield the floor for my colleague from California\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is very good to see the Presiding Officer in the \nchair.\n  Since the Senator has arrived, we have cast some landmark votes for \nlaws that are so critical and for candidates who are so critical. We \nare about to have a moment in history where we are going to expand \nopportunities for the LGBT community, expand protection for them so no \nlonger will they face fear in the workplace.\n  If we have an overwhelming vote--which I hope we will have--it will \nsend a message to Speaker Boehner that he should join with us. After \nall, what is the purpose that we should serve here? It is really making \nlife better for people. It certainly is protecting our people.\n  This leads me to the reason I am here at the request of Senator \nMurray. It is because we need to speak out against the bill that will \nshortly be introduced. It is ironic, because as we are about to end \ndiscrimination on a whole group of worthy people, this bill attacks \nanother group of people, the majority of this country, women.\n  We are here to say that the extreme and dangerous 20-week abortion \nban is not going anywhere in the Senate--not on our watch. Anyone who \nknows this knows we mean what we say and say what we mean.\n  The American people continue in election after election to reject the \nwar on women. They did it in race after race in the 2012 cycle, and \nthey did it in these local and State-wide races only a couple of days \nago.\n  The American people, regardless of party, want us to focus on issues \nthat make a difference in their lives, such as creating jobs, reforming \nour immigration system, keeping college affordable for students, and \nrebuilding an infrastructure that is failing us. They don't want to \ntake us back to the last century and open up battles that have long ago \nbeen fought in 1973.\n  I see my friend from Iowa, a real champion of Roe v. Wade, a decision \nthat was made by the Court that was a very tough decision. They really \ndid take a moderate view of balancing all of the interests.\n  We have a bill being introduced today that has been shopped around by \nthe most extreme elements in our country that would essentially say Roe \nv. Wade doesn't make any difference, and it opens up a direct assault \non women's health, a direct assault on Roe v. Wade, a direct assault on \ndoctors.\n  It is a radical bill. It is an abortion ban. It offers no health \nexception, no help for women facing cancer, facing kidney failure, \nfacing blood clots or other tragic complications during a pregnancy, no \nexception for rape or incest when folks are too scared to report that \nthey were raped or they were a victim of incest. It throws trusted \ndoctors into jail for 5 years simply for providing needed health care \nto their patients.\n  I wish to tell you who opposes this: the American Congress of \nObstetricians\n\n[[Page S7900]]\n\nand Gynecologists. They said that these restrictions are ``dangerous to \npatients' safety and health.''\n  I want to speak about Judy Shackelford. Four months into her \npregnancy, she developed a pregnancy-induced blood clot in her arm. The \nonly guarantee that she wouldn't die and leave behind her 5-year-old \nson was for Judy to end that pregnancy. She and her husband made that \nvery difficult decision.\n  No Senators were in the room when she made that decision with her \nhusband. No Governor was in the room. No President was in the room. \nThis was a personal decision she made with her husband, her god, and \nher doctor. That is how it ought to be. If a family decides they are \ngoing to save the life of their mom, that should be respected.\n  Christie Brooks of Virginia, when pregnant with her second child, \nafter her 20-week ultrasound found out that her daughter would be born \nwith a severe structural birth defect and the baby would suffocate at \nbirth. She made the incredibly difficult decision to end that \npregnancy. She wouldn't be allowed to do that under this radical ban.\n  We need to decide who we stand up and fight for. Is it some \nideological rightwing agenda or is it for the people, the families, the \nloving families that we represent?\n  What is best for them? That is it.\n  So we are going to stop this dangerous bill. We are going to stop \nthis dangerous attack on women in its tracks. We are sending a clear \nmessage--and I thank Senator Murray for organizing us today--that we \nwill protect women and their families across America.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise today to address an amendment I \nhave pending on the ENDA bill which we will vote on soon. This is an \namendment I have offered on my own behalf and that of Senators Flake \nand McCain, who have joined me in this effort, and I thank them for \nthat.\n  It occurs to me that sometimes in our work a tension can arise \nbetween important competing American values, and two vitally important \nAmerican values are, I believe, somewhat in tension in some aspects of \nthis bill. First, one great enduring and important value for all \nAmericans is equality. This bill today clearly makes a strong stand for \ngreater equality.\n  I believe, and I think most Americans share the view, that every \nindividual is entitled to dignity and respect and fairness, and that \nindividuals ought to be judged based on their merits, on their \ncharacter, and on their abilities. A person's sexual orientation is \nirrelevant to their ability to be a good doctor or engineer or athlete \nor a Federal judge. That is why I have supported acknowledging that \nreality.\n  I supported 17 years ago, in the writing of the charter of the city \ngovernment of Allentown, a provision that would ban discrimination on \nthe basis of sexual orientation in the hiring for that city. I \nsupported an end to don't ask, don't tell, because I thought it was an \ninappropriate infringement on the freedom of gay and lesbian persons \nserving in the military. I believe there are more legal protections \nthat are appropriate to prevent employment discrimination based on \nsexual orientation. So these are an important set of values.\n  Another obvious and vitally important American value is freedom, and \nparticularly religious freedom. The First Amendment guarantee of the \nfree exercise of religion means that religious groups, even in the \ncourse of secular services, can, for instance, choose to hire employees \nwho agree with their religion, employees who will promote that \nreligion. And of course, the First Amendment applies even when we don't \nnecessarily agree with the views of that religion or that faith.\n  What we have tried to do in this legislation and in other context is \nto strike an appropriate balance between the tension that arises \nbetween these sometimes competing values. The sponsors of this bill \nhave made a very thoughtful, credible effort to strike that balance. In \nfact, the sponsor of this bill and I agree on what at least an \nimportant aspect of that important balance ought to look like, and \nspecifically I believe the agreement is that religious institutions, \nincluding those engaging in some secular activities, should be exempt \nfrom the requirements of this bill if it violates the tenets of their \nfaith.\n  The goal of my amendment is to simply make sure the bill actually \nachieves what the drafters intended. The Senator from Oregon, who is \nthe chief sponsor of the bill, has stated correctly, in terms of its \nintent, that the bill ``broadly exempts from its scope houses of \nworship as well as religiously affiliated organizations.'' This \nexemption, which covers the same religious organizations already \nexempted from the religious discrimination provisions of title VII of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 should ensure that religious freedom \nconcerns do not hinder the passage of this critical legislation.\n  Other groups that are advocates for this legislation have similarly \nobserved that the provisions of title VII would ensure the exemption of \nfaith-based institutions. There are examples where circuit courts have \nruled, in interpreting title VII of the Civil Rights Act, that \naffiliated organizations would in fact get this exemption. Examples \ninclude a gymnasium run by the Mormon Church, Christian elementary \nschools and universities, a Presbyterian-operated retirement home, a \nSeventh Day Adventist hospital, a Jewish community center, and there \nare others.\n  So I acknowledge it is absolutely true it is the case there are \nFederal courts that have respected the religious freedom of these \ninstitutions to be exempted from the religious hiring mandates of the \nCivil Rights Act and, presumably, that would apply in the case of ENDA \nbecause of the way the legislation is crafted.\n  The problem that concerns me is that there are other cases where \nother courts have come to a different conclusion, and they have not \nrecognized religious institutions the same way. There is a lack of \nuniformity across our country, across the different districts that \nultimately interpret the application of title VII of the Civil Rights \nAct.\n  In fact, over the years, different courts have interpreted the \nlanguage quite differently, and so we have these two problems, in my \nview, if we leave the underlying legislation as it is. One is that \nAmericans will live under not two but multiple different standards. The \n12 circuits that apply the title VII exemptions have already adopted \nfour different tests for determining whether an institution qualifies \nfor the religious exemption.\n  The second problem is that employers and workers don't necessarily \nhave predictability even within a circuit that has its own test, which \ndiffers from another circuit. And the reason is the tests themselves \nare somewhat subjective and somewhat unpredictable. They have multiple \nfactors. For example, the Third Circuit, which includes my State of \nPennsylvania, has nine factors; and as the court explained, not all \nfactors will be relevant in all cases, and the weight given each factor \nmay vary from case to case. The result is that in a single case \ndecisionmakers looking at the same set of facts can reach very \ndifferent conclusions.\n  In the absence of my amendment, my concern is there will be no \nuniform, predictable national standard for determining when a religious \nentity, a religious organization, is exempt from the bill. There are a \ncouple of examples that illustrate my point.\n  In a case called the EEOC v. Kamehameha Schools--that is a Hawaiian \nword. My pronunciation may not be correct. This is a 1993 decision--\nthere were two schools created by a charitable trust to help orphans \nand poor children. The trust instructed ``the teachers . . . shall \nforever be persons of the Protestant religion.'' The schools shall \nprovide a good education ``and also instruction in morals.''\n  The schools hired only Protestant teachers. They held themselves out \nas Protestant schools. They required all the students to take religious \nclasses. They offered Bible studies and worship services, and they had \na cooperative relationship with one specific Protestant church.\n\n[[Page S7901]]\n\n  The district court found the schools were religious and, therefore, \nthey were covered and they qualified for the exemption. But the Ninth \nCircuit Court, considering the exact same set of facts, found the \nopposite and decided the schools were secular. The Ninth Circuit \nacknowledged the schools' original principle was providing religious \ninstruction, but they essentially ruled that since some students were \nnot Protestant and since the schools offered courses that were not \nreligious in nature--the schools taught math and they taught social \nstudies--for those reasons they would not qualify for the exemption and \nthe schools were required to hire non-Protestant teachers.\n\n  Another example--and I only have two--is a Methodist orphanage \nfounded by the Methodist Church. The board of trustees were Methodist \nand they had close ties to the Methodist Church. The district court \neventually held that many of the orphanage's day-to-day activities of \ncaring for children were simply not necessarily religious, and so the \nhome was not exempt. But initially, the district court had actually \nfound for the Methodist orphanage. It was the Fourth Circuit that \nreversed it, sent the case back with instructions they reconsider this.\n  The district court had an interesting comment in this. It stated its \nopinion by declaring that it remains somewhat confused as to the proper \ninterpretation, but it would do its best. So if a Federal judge can't \ntell what the test is, how could workers? How could an employer? How \ncould an institution based on faith?\n  My amendment really is a modest attempt to ensure the bill actually \nachieves what I believe its authors and sponsors and supporters intend. \nIt would continue to guarantee equality to workers, but it would \nprotect religious groups' rights to the free exercise of their \nreligion. And it would ensure all Americans would live under the same \nrule, the same formulation, with predictability and certainty. It would \nclarify that ENDA's religious exemption applies to religious hospitals, \nschools, charities, and other organizations that are owned by, \ncontrolled by, or officially affiliated with a church or religious \ngroup covered by ENDA's current exemption.\n  What this does is simply ensures we get close to striking a good, \nsensible balance between the equality in the workforce that is the \nprinciple motivation for this bill and the religious freedom I feel \nvery strongly about and I think many of my colleagues do as well.\n  I want to commend everybody who has put in a lot of hard work on a \ncareful and thoughtful effort here, and I hope my fellow Senators will \njoin me in supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for up to 5 minutes in opposition to the Toomey \namendment and that the Senator from Wisconsin also have 2 minutes to \nspeak in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, over the course of this debate, we have \ndocumented the tremendous business community support for this bill, \nincluding over 100 major companies. A key reason for that support is \nthat ENDA is closely modeled on title VII of the civil rights law. \nEmployers are familiar with the law, they understand how to comply with \nthe law, and it provides certainty.\n  The many Fortune 500 companies that have employment nondiscrimination \npolicies in place have modeled their policies on the nondiscrimination \nrequirements of title VII. Unfortunately, by proposing an entirely new \ndefinition of businesses that would qualify for an exemption from the \nEmployment Non-Discrimination Act, this amendment calls into question \nthat very certainty. ENDA already exempts the same religious \norganizations that qualify for an exemption under title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act.\n  Under current law, the exemption includes not only houses of \nworship--churches, synagogues, and mosques--but also religious schools \nand religiously affiliated hospitals. The exemption in this bill passed \nthe House of Representatives on a broad bipartisan basis, 402 to 25, in \n2007.\n  In determining what organizations should qualify for religious \nexemption, most courts have also said that where the primary activity \nof the organization is commerce or profit, despite strongly held \nreligious beliefs by the owners, the organization may not discriminate \nin hiring. That is what this amendment, I believe, seeks to change. \nThis amendment would allow entities that are ``officially affiliated'' \nwith a religious society to discriminate on the basis of sexual \norientation and gender identity. This is a new term that is undefined \nin the text of the amendment and could lead to thousands of for-profit \nbusinesses being allowed to discriminate.\n  Some examples that have been suggested could qualify for the \nexemption could be a private employer whose only ``affiliation'' with a \nreligious society is receiving a regular newsletter from that society \nor a private employer who sponsors a fundraiser for a religiously \naffiliated nonprofit or a private employer who provides goods and \nservices to a religious organization. Again, this amendment would open \nthe floodgates for all kinds of lawsuits. Courts would be inundated \ntrying to figure out what does ``officially affiliated'' mean because \nthere is no definition to that. The definitions we had before provide \nthat kind of certainty to our business owners.\n  Our Nation's civil rights laws require those who participate in \ncommercial activity must adhere to the broad principles of fairness and \nequal treatment. In potentially allowing secular commercial businesses \nto discriminate in hiring and other employment practices on the basis \nof sexual orientation or gender identity, this amendment threatens to \ngut the fundamental premise of ENDA that all workers should be treated \nequally and fairly.\n  So while I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, I wish to \nnote that the sponsor of the amendment supported beginning debate of \nthe bill. His amendment is one that goes directly to the substance of \nthe bill that we are debating and not an unrelated issue. So I wish to \ncompliment the author, Senator Toomey. This is the way we should \noperate in the Senate.\n  As many know, I have been advocating for rules changes since 1995. \nOne thing I have always adhered to is that it is the right of the \nminority to be able to offer relevant germane amendments to a bill. The \nauthor of this amendment has adhered to that. This is certainly \nrelevant. This is certainly germane. That is why I compliment him for \nproviding us with a way the Senate should work. But the amendment, I \nbelieve, is ill-defined. It would open the floodgates for all kinds of \nnew cases. It would disrupt businesses all over America. So for that \nreason I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment by the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, the bill before us today, the Employment \nNon-Discrimination Act, contains a very carefully negotiated bipartisan \nreligious exemption provision. The amendment before us right now \nsignificantly expands that provision, and I rise to share why I believe \nit would be unwise to do so and urge my colleagues to oppose the \namendment.\n  Religious organizations are not touched by this legislation. They can \nuse an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity in their \nemployment decisions if they choose to. ENDA does apply, however, to \nbusinesses and entities that are not primarily religious in purpose and \ncharacter.\n  Just as with other civil rights legislation and in laws protecting \nindividuals from discrimination on the bases of race, sex, national \norigin, religion, age, and disability, a capable employee in a \nnonreligious business should not be fired--or not hired--because of his \nor her boss's religious beliefs.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Toomey would broaden this exemption \nto allow an employer to be exempt from ENDA if it is affiliated with a \nparticular religious organization, even if it engages primarily in \nsecular activities. Allowing this type of exemption could be \ninterpreted so broadly that it could negate the bill and its important \nprotections for American workers.\n\n[[Page S7902]]\n\n  The provision of this bill that this amendment seeks to modify is the \nproduct of a long and significant bipartisan negotiation and \ncompromise.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. I am a former Member of the House of Representatives, \nand I worked very closely with faith groups and civil rights advocates \nover the months leading up to consideration of ENDA in 2007 to arrive \nat the religious exemption compromise in the bill we are considering \ntoday. In fact, this current language in the bill before us passed the \nHouse of Representatives on a broad bipartisan basis of 402 to 25 as a \nfloor amendment during our consideration of ENDA in 2007. It is a \nbipartisan compromise supported by many religious organizations, \nincluding the Presbyterian Church, the United Methodist Church, and the \nUnited Synagogue for Conservative Judaism.\n  Over 40 religious organizations wrote to endorse this bill with a \nletter that reads:\n\n       Any claims that ENDA harms religious liberty are misplaced. \n     ENDA broadly exempts from its scope houses of worship as well \n     as religiously affiliated organizations. This exemption--\n     which covers the same religious organizations already \n     exempted from religious discrimination provisions of title \n     VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964--should ensure that \n     religious freedom concerns don't hinder the passage of this \n     critical legislation.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment and then join together \non a historic day to vote in support of the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to discuss the need to \nprotect all Americans from workplace discrimination. The vote that the \nPresiding Officer from North Dakota just announced was a tremendous \nvictory for civil rights in our country; it was a tremendous victory \nfor all people, gay and straight. It will mean a more productive \nworkplace. It will mean better work conditions. It will mean an \nexpansion of human rights. And what is not to celebrate about that?\n  I worked on this bill as a cosponsor starting almost 15 years ago--\nmore than 15 years ago--in the House of Representatives, and I am \nthrilled to have been able to vote for it today, as I know 60-plus of \nmy colleagues were, and I am hopeful the House of Representatives \ndecides to do the same.\n  Earlier this year people of different genders, ethnicities, and ages \ngathered outside of the Supreme Court wanting to be there when civil \nrights history\n\n[[Page S7903]]\n\nwas made when the Defense of Marriage Act was declared \nunconstitutional. Clergy, people in collars, parents with children, \nstudents, seniors--everyone in between--were there too. The steps of \nthe Supreme Court that morning were filled with people who represented \nevery walk of life in our great country; so, too, must our laws.\n  Today and every day far too many Americans still go to work fearing \nthey can be fired for who they are and whom they love. This needs to \nstop now. That is why the Senate needs to pass--later today, I hope--\nthe Employment Non-Discrimination Act and the House needs to bring up \nENDA for a vote. ENDA would protect LGBT Americans from workplace \ndiscrimination. It is currently legal--this is what I think the public \ndoes not always hear and what I think Speaker Boehner needs to hear--it \nis currently legal in 29 States to discriminate based on sexual \norientation. Think about that. Twenty-nine States--in this great \ncountry, with this Constitution, with this Bill of Rights--29 States \nallow gay Americans to be fired solely on the basis of their sexual \norientation. In 2013 you can still be fired for whom you love in 29 \nStates. It is legal to do that.\n  We have laws protecting Americans from workplace discrimination based \non the color of their skin, as we should; based on their religion, as \nwe should; based on whether they are a man or a woman, as we should; or \nwhether they have a disability, as we should have those laws in place.\n  We should offer these same protections to LGBT Americans. We \ncurrently do not protect or workers, though, from being fired for whom \nthey love. It is morally wrong. We are not living up to the basic moral \nstandards. We teach our children the Golden Rule: that we are to treat \nothers as we would want to be treated. This country was not built on \nthe ideal that only some people deserve equality and justice. We know \nthat no one should be discriminated against simply because of who they \nare.\n  Many Fortune 500 companies and small businesses have already taken \nsteps to protect their employees because they know it is right. In a \nmeeting a few months ago, I listened to a Cincinnati-based engineer \nfrom Procter & Gamble discuss the importance of ENDA. She said, simply: \nPeople should be able to bring all of themselves to work, not needing \nto hide herself or her family in the workplace. She gets it. \nUnsurprisingly, so does her employer, Procter & Gamble, an American \nicon.\n  Passing ENDA makes good economic sense. In a competitive global \neconomy, it is essential that businesses attract talented, hard-working \nemployees. That is difficult to do when discrimination is allowed. If \nwe want to create jobs and compete on a global level, then we need all \nworkers from all walks of life to be contributing to the economy. \nPurposefully leaving out a portion of our workforce only puts us behind \nin that global competition.\n  We have already made progress in the fight for equality, but we need \nto continue to move forward. We repealed don't ask, don't tell. This \nJune the Supreme Court held the Defense of Marriage Act--which five of \nmy Senate colleagues voted against in 1996, a few of us in the House \nvoted against--as unconstitutional. As a result, couples are able to \nlegally marry in many States across the country, the newest of which is \nIllinois. We must continue this progress to create a most just, \ninclusive Nation. Dr. King once said, ``Injustice anywhere is a threat \nto justice everywhere.'' Workers fought for the right to organize, \nwoman for the right to vote, African Americans fought for equal \njustice, and now LGBT Americans of all backgrounds are fighting for \nequality. They are entitled to the support of their government, of all \nof us, in that fight.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time, \nincluding the time during quorum calls, be equally divided between both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. During the first few years after it became the law, the \nAffordable Care Act was known to most Americans as mainly a set of \npromises. Americans were repeatedly told that ObamaCare, once it began \nto take full effect--that coverage would expand, premiums would go \ndown, and everyone who liked their existing health care coverage could \nkeep it.\n  When the President and my friends across the aisle described it this \nway, ObamaCare sounded too good to be true. Unfortunately, the promises \nreally have turned out to be too good to be true. After spending years \nlistening to hollow assurances about what ObamaCare would or would not \ndo, the past 5 years have taught us a lot, maybe only the tip of the \niceberg, about the realities of what ObamaCare actually looks like.\n  We have learned that no fewer than 3.5 million Americans have already \nreceived cancellation notices from their insurance coverage because of \nthe new law. We have learned that millions more will receive those same \ntypes of notices in the foreseeable future.\n  We have learned that the administration and, in fact, the Senate, \nknew that was going to happen in 2010 because we had a vote on the \nCongressional Review Act of the regulation which would have expanded \nthe grandfather clause, and it was defeated in a party-line vote with \nall Republicans voting to expand the grandfathering provision and all \nour Democratic colleagues voting against.\n  What we learned, when they launched the ObamaCare Web site--which has \nbeen perhaps the most visible image of ObamaCare--was they did it \nbefore they could guarantee the information people would put in it \nwould be secure. That includes both your tax information, your Social \nSecurity, and your mental health and physical health conditions. We \nlearned yesterday from Secretary Sebelius that the navigators, who are \nthe people who have been hired to help people navigate the Affordable \nCare Act and get signed up, were hired without performing any kind of \nbackground check. To the surprise of a lot of people, Secretary \nSebelius answered a very direct question about that. I asked her in the \nFinance Committee: Is it possible a person could be a navigator and be \na convicted felon? She said it is ``possible.'' Because there is no \ncriminal background check.\n\n  In other words, America's top health care officials believe it is \npossible that convicted felons could be collecting some of our most \nsensitive personal information--our Social Security numbers, tax \ninformation, and sensitive medical data. Yet this administration \ncontinues to insist upon refusing a proper vetting system. It is bad \nenough the Web site is entirely dysfunctional--that will get fixed \nsooner or later--but the fact is this same Web site could, in the \ninterim, become a magnet for fraud and identity theft.\n  Many of us who were skeptics about the President's extravagant \npromises of ObamaCare once implemented have been expressing our \nconcerns for years. But as skeptical as I was about ObamaCare when it \npassed the Senate on Christmas Eve in 2009, it is even worse than many \nof us predicted--certainly worse than we imagined.\n  With millions of Americans getting cancellation notices from their \ninsurance companies, we are finding out their premiums are about to go \nup and not down. It is important to remember exactly why this is \nhappening. Thanks to the regulations our friends across the aisle \ncontinue to support, ObamaCare has allowed Washington bureaucrats to \ndefine what constitutes an acceptable health insurance policy in the \nindividual and small group market. In other words, it has allowed \nWashington bureaucrats to force hardworking American families to pay \nfor health care coverage they do not want and they do not need.\n  I have heard from my constituents in Texas who are absolutely furious \nand, in some cases, absolutely desperate\n\n[[Page S7904]]\n\nabout losing their coverage or being forced to pay higher premiums they \nsimply can't afford in order to buy coverage they do not need.\n  The underlying conceit of ObamaCare is that individuals and their \nfamilies can't be trusted to choose the right health insurance coverage \nfor themselves so they must turn those decisions over to the \nbureaucracy in Washington to do it for them.\n  Some have heard us talk about a government takeover of the health \ncare system. This is what a government takeover of a health care system \nlooks like--when you lose the choices that should be available to you \nas an American citizen--to decide what kind of policy you need at a \nprice you can afford--because of this monstrosity of a law. That is a \ngovernment takeover.\n  The main objective of ObamaCare, we were told, was to provide \ncoverage for all Americans. Yet the Congressional Budget Office has \nmade it clear ObamaCare fails even in that objective. They estimate \nabout 30 million people will still remain uncovered by the year 2023 \nwhen ObamaCare has been fully implemented. Thirty million people. OK, \nexplain to me again, what was the purpose of this exercise? We were \ngoing to bring costs down and cover people without insurance, and \neveryone would be able to keep the insurance they had if they liked it. \nYet none of that ends up being true. All of that ends up being false.\n  As I said yesterday, the cost of ObamaCare far outweighs the \nbenefits. It would have been a lot smarter for us to figure out how to \ndeal with the people who are uninsured and get them insured without \nraising costs or prejudicing the rights of people who had policies they \nalready liked.\n  If Congress were to choose at some point to actually dismantle \nObamaCare in its entirety, which I think we ought to do, we ought to \nstart over and enact an alternative health care reform bill aimed at \nsolving the problem not creating new ones. These reforms could include \nrevising the Tax Code so that individuals could buy their own health \ninsurance on the same tax terms as if it were employer provided.\n  We would allow people to actually buy in the health care market \nnationally and form pools to share risks. That would help bring down \nthe costs. It would increase competition.\n  We also ought to expand the use of tax-free health savings accounts \nfor people who decide they want to buy a high-deductible catastrophic \nhealth insurance policy because it is pretty cheap, and in the meantime \nthey want to set money aside each month in a health savings account. \nMaybe they will need it for health care and maybe they won't, but they \nget to do that tax free. And if they don't use it, they can use that as \npart of their retirement. We ought to expand that.\n  We ought to make health care price and quality information a lot more \ntransparent. One of the most successful health care programs I have \nseen pass the Congress--though we made some mistakes with it and we \nshould have offset the cost--is the prescription drug plan, Medicare \nPart D. It has actually worked better than any of us thought it would \nbecause it is not a government takeover. It created competition between \ncompeting prescription drug companies that had to compete based on \nquality and price. The result has been the price has gone down roughly \n30 percent under the projected costs when it was passed.\n  That is the kind of transparency and choice that is produced from \nquality information and that leaves the choices to people individually \nand not to the government.\n  And yes, we ought to crack down on frivolous medical malpractice \nlawsuits. We have seen in Texas that reducing the costs of frivolous \nmedical malpractice lawsuits in turn helps to protect against defensive \nmedicine, where doctors make clinical decisions based not on their best \nmedical judgment but based on their aversion to litigation risk.\n  We ought to use high-risk pools to ensure people with preexisting \nconditions can get covered. This is one of the biggest \nmisrepresentations I have heard about ObamaCare. Some of our colleagues \nhave said: Well, the only way you can get preexisting conditions \ncovered is to take ObamaCare hook, line, and sinker. That is clearly \nnot true. Virtually all of our States have high-risk programs for \npeople with preexisting conditions. They may need to be better funded--\nand we ought to look to try to shore them up--but it would be better to \nfix the problems we know exist rather than creating more problems.\n  We ought to give the States more flexibility to deal with Medicaid. \nMedicaid is designed as a safety net program for people who can't \nafford to buy their own health insurance. I see the Senator from Maine \non the floor, and she was very intimately involved in this when she was \nthe insurance commissioner for her State. Medicaid, unfortunately, pays \ndoctors about half of what private health insurance does to reimburse \nthem for their costs, so many doctors have to restrict their practice \nand their ability to see new Medicaid patients.\n  In Texas, only about one-third of the doctors will see a new Medicaid \npatient because they simply can't afford to do so. So we need to have \nadditional freedom to improve Medicaid and to shore it up while \nproviding competition and consumer choice to bring down costs in \nMedicare.\n  Mr. President, such reforms would give us a health care system with \nmuch lower costs, much better coverage, and much greater access to \nquality care. Those are the sorts of reforms we should have embraced in \n2009 and 2010 but did not. We missed our chance back then, but there is \nno good reason we have to accept ObamaCare or nothing. As a matter of \nfact, we should take this opportunity, as we see the promises of \nObamaCare being broken and not living up to the expectations of its \nstrongest proponents, to turn to these other sensible ways to lower \ncosts, increase coverage, and improve access.\n  As the law's deficiencies become more and more evident, I hope my \nfriends across the aisle will join with us, Republicans and Democrats \nalike, to replace ObamaCare with something better.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I will cast my vote in support of S. \n815, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. This vote is consistent \nwith my firm belief that workplace discrimination--whether based on \nreligion, gender, race, national origin, or sexual orientation--should \nnot be tolerated in America.\n  As my colleagues know, this legislation expands Federal employment \ndiscrimination protections, provided under the Civil Rights Act, to \ninclude sexual orientation. Under this bill, employers with more than \n15 employees would be subject to new Federal regulations for hiring, \nfiring, or promoting an individual on the basis of sexual orientation.\n  Many of my colleagues raised concerns about how the bill's language \nfailed to provide adequate protections for religious businesses, \nschools, charities, and other institutions. In order to address these \nconcerns, I worked with Senator Portman of Ohio and Senator Ayotte of \nNew Hampshire to offer an amendment to further protect the \nconstitutional rights and religious freedoms of religious \norganizations. Our amendment prevents retaliation on religious \nemployers by Federal, State, and local governments based on the fact \nthat these employers are exempt from the non-discrimination \nrequirements of ENDA. I am pleased that this amendment was agreed to \nwithout opposition.\n  I have always believed that workplace discrimination--whether based \non religion, gender, race, national origin, or sexual orientation--is \ninconsistent with the basic values that America holds dear. With the \naddition of the amendment I cosponsored with Senators Portman and \nAyotte strengthening protections for religious institutions, I am \npleased to support this legislation.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today the Senate is voting on the \nEmployment Non-Discrimination Act--a bill that I am proud to cosponsor. \nAmericans believe that hard-working people should be rewarded for their \nefforts and commended for their skills. Yet all throughout our Nation \nindividuals are being held back at work or even fired--not because they \nare incompetent but because of their sexual orientation or gender \nidentity.\n  I firmly believe people should be judged based on their individual \nskills, competence, and unique talents and nothing else. Sexual \norientation does\n\n[[Page S7905]]\n\nnot affect job performance, so it should not be a consideration, and \nthe vast majority of Americans agree. In fact, an overwhelming 73 \npercent of Marylanders support the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.\n  The Employment Non-Discrimination Act would close a significant gap \nin our civil rights laws. It would ensure that people are judged on the \nquality of their work, not on sexual orientation or gender identity. \nJob discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, or religion \nhas long been prohibited; however, it is still legal to hire and fire a \nperson based on their sexual orientation. This is an outrageous \npractice for a country that prides itself on equal rights for all.\n  Today, when I look back at the civil rights movement of the 1960s, I \nam shocked by how modest the demands of the African American community \nactually were. If we can pass this piece of legislation, in the future \nwe will look back and think what a modest, obvious step it was and \nwonder why it took so long. This bill does not bestow special rights; \nit simply offers gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender Americans the \nsame protection against unfair discrimination in the workplace as other \ngroups--no more, no less.\n  Currently, 21 States and the District of Columbia have passed laws \nthat prohibit job discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. In \naddition, hundreds of companies have implemented nondiscrimination \npolicies that include sexual orientation.\n  Gay Americans are part of the American mosaic and are entitled to the \nsame rights and freedoms as every other American citizen. Change in \ncivil rights comes slowly, but we are long overdue in making sure they \nhave protection against unfair discrimination in the workplace. My hope \nis that someday we will look back on this and wonder what took us so \nlong. We all deserve to live in an environment where people are treated \nfairly and with the dignity they deserve, and today I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for this important bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this Nation began not as merely a plot of \nland, or as a group of people united by language or ethnicity. It began \nwith an idea: ``That all men are created equal.'' Our story since \nThomas Jefferson wrote those words has been a story of progress toward \nhonoring what has been called ``the immortal phrase.''\n  Today, this Senate can move our Nation one important step forward in \nhonoring the truth of those words by finally passing the Employment \nNon-Discrimination Act, or ENDA. We can help ensure that no American is \ndeprived of the opportunity to work--the opportunity to succeed--as all \nof us want to succeed merely because of sexual orientation or gender \nidentity, just as we have acted to protect that opportunity against \ndiscrimination based on age, race, color, religion, national origin or \ndisability.\n  This legislation is carefully crafted to protect the sincere \nreligious beliefs many Americans hold. It embodies a simple but \npowerful American ideal: On the job, what matters is your work, not \nyour gender or skin color or faith or your sexual orientation any other \nextraneous matter.\n  There may have been times in the past when the Congress pushed \nAmericans into new and perhaps uncomfortable territory in the march \ntoward equality. But today, the law lags public opinion in this area. \nPublic opinion polls show that roughly 7 in 10 Americans believe \nworkplace discrimination against gays, lesbians and transgendered \nindividuals should be against the law. In fact, they think it already \nis--according to one poll, 80 percent of Americans believe such \ndiscrimination is already a violation of Federal law. Support for ENDA \nis not confined to one region of the country--polls show that \nmajorities in every State in the union support it. So, passage of ENDA \nis not some bold social experiment or engineering process. It is what \nthe American people want and are ready for.\n  That is as true today as it was in 1996, the last time the Senate \nheld a vote on this measure. Even then, a majority of Americans \nsupported it, and just as it is today, it enjoyed the support of a \ndiverse group of religious and business organizations. Then, as today, \nAmerican businesses recognized that discrimination on the basis of \nsexual orientation or gender identity is just bad business.\n  This is also not a partisan issue. This legislation is on the brink \nof passage here because members of both parties have shown principled \nleadership and dedication.\n  But the ultimate reason I have supported this legislation for decades \nnow is not related to public opinion polls or endorsement letters from \nchurches and corporations, though those are heartening and welcome. \nSimply, it is wrong to deny employment to anyone who can do the job, \njust because of their sexual orientation. ``All men are created equal'' \nmeans giving every American the opportunity to earn what their talents \nand dedication allow, to provide for themselves and their families. \nDenying anyone that right is at odds with the ideals on which this \ncountry was founded and on which it depends to this day.\n  I strongly support this legislation. I urge my Senate colleagues to \nsupport it, and upon Senate passage, I urge the leaders of the House of \nRepresentatives to recognize just how far behind the American people \nthey have fallen on this issue, and bring the Employee Non-\nDiscrimination Act to the House floor for a vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate has a historic opportunity today \nto take discrimination out of the workplace by casting a vote for the \nEmployment Non-Discrimination Act. Today's vote has been 20 years in \nthe making, and it is long overdue for Congress to extend these \nprotections to all American workers. Years from now we will look back \non this remedy as another substantial milestone on our Nation's \neverlasting quest to achieve a more perfect union--a quest to realize \nmore completely the motto engraved in Vermont marble above the Supreme \nCourt building that declares: ``Equal Justice Under Law.''\n  We now have protections for workers from discrimination on the basis \nof race, sex, religion, national origin and disability, as we should. \nYet there are no Federal protections from discrimination on the basis \nof sexual orientation or gender identity. In 29 States, it is still \nlegal for an employer to fire employees based on their sexual \norientation, and in 33 States employees can be fired based on their \ngender identity. Maintaining the status quo would keep in place a \nsystem that supports a second class of workers in a majority of States. \nThis runs counter to our founding values. It is time to remedy that.\n  As the son of Vermont printers, I learned at an early age the primary \nimportance of the First Amendment. The First Amendment in our Bill of \nRights is the foundation of our democracy and our way of life. It is \none of the most defining principles of our national character. It helps \npreserve all of our other rights. By guaranteeing a free press and the \nfree exercise of religion, it ensures an informed electorate and the \nfreedom to worship God and to practice our religion as we choose--or to \npractice no religion at all.\n  Religious freedom does not end with the vital protections afforded by \nthe First Amendment. The bill before us contains important protections \nfor religious organizations by ensuring that they can continue to make \nsignificant faith-based employment decisions. The carefully crafted \nreligious exemption in this legislation is consistent with the freedoms \nguaranteed by the Constitution.\n  All Americans deserve civil rights protections under our \nConstitution, which, in addition to the First Amendment, also ensures \ndue process and equal protection. In previous legislative debates like \nthe one before us today, Congress has protected and bolstered these \nrights by passing legislation to fill gaps in our Federal laws. This \nincludes passing legislation to protect the practice of religion \nwithout discrimination, to prevent pay discrimination based on sex, and \nto serve openly in the military. By passing the remedy before us today, \nwe will take another significant step forward in taking discrimination \nout of our laws and ensuring the equal treatment of lesbian, gay, \nbisexual, and transgender Americans.\n  I thank Chairman Harkin and Senators Merkley and Collins for their \nleadership on this significant, overdue, and bipartisan \nantidiscrimination remedy. I also am mindful and appreciative of the \nleading role that Senator Jim\n\n[[Page S7906]]\n\nJeffords of my State of Vermont took in advancing this remedy during \nhis time in this body. And I thank Majority Leader Reid for making this \na priority for the Senate. I know that my late friend Senator Kennedy \nis smiling down on this chamber today as we advance his efforts to end \nemployment discrimination. Today we can honor his legacy with this \nhistoric vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, we are about to make history in this \nChamber by passing the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, more commonly \nknown as ENDA. We will establish the principle that the right to work \nfree from discrimination is a fundamental right of each and every \nAmerican regardless of age, race, gender, religion, disability, \nnational origin, and now, finally, sexual orientation.\n  It has taken a long time to get to this day. More than 10 years ago I \nwas proud to join a life-long champion of civil rights, the late \nSenator Ted Kennedy, as a cosponsor of ENDA. That was back in 2002. \nOver the years our country has rightly taken a stand against workplace \ndiscrimination in a wide variety of forms. It is past time we close \nthis gap for our LGBT employees. The time to pass this bill has come.\n  I thank Senators Merkley and Kirk for taking up the cause and for \nmoving this bill forward. Senator Kirk, along with Senators Hatch and \nMurkowski, led Republican support for this bill during its \nconsideration by the HELP Committee.\n  I also acknowledge the work of the chairman of the committee Tom \nHarkin in bringing this bill to the floor.\n  Other Senators who helped to improve this bill include Senators \nPortman, Ayotte, Heller, Hatch, and McCain, in their effort to draft \nstrong antiretaliation language. Their amendment, which was adopted \nunanimously, improves this bill by strengthening the protections for \nreligious institutions that are legitimately exempted under ENDA.\n  I thank each of those Senators and others, such as Senator Flake, for \ntheir willingness to work with the sponsors and cosponsors of this \nlegislation. Senator Toomey also has worked hard.\n  Mr. President, all Americans deserve a fair opportunity to pursue the \nAmerican Dream. ENDA is simply about the fundamental right to work and \nto be judged according to one's abilities, qualifications, and job \nperformance. Much of corporate America has already voluntarily embraced \nLGBT protections because they know that doing so helps them attract and \nretain the best and the brightest employees.\n  Nearly two dozen States have versions of ENDA. In fact, in my home \nState of Maine, it has been the law for nearly a decade. Simply put, \nENDA is about fairness and workplace equality. Today, I am confident \nthe Senate will affirm that principle and will say to everyone in this \ncountry the workplace is simply no place for discrimination.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today the Senate is sending a clear \nmessage that all Americans are entitled to earn a living free from \ndiscrimination and to be judged in the workplace based on \nqualifications, ability, and integrity.\n  The Employment Non-Discrimination Act is simple and clear. It states \nthat private businesses, public employers, and labor unions cannot make \nemployment decisions--hiring, firing, promotion, or compensation--\nbecause of a person's actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender \nidentity. The bill is modeled on title VII of the Civil Rights Act, a \nlaw that has been in place for almost 50 years. It is a law that is \nwell understood by employers and is strongly supported by employers.\n  More than 50 years ago, with the Civil Rights Act, we took the first \nsteps to eliminate discrimination at work. Since that time we have \nensured that the employers may not discriminate on the basis of race, \nsex, national origin, religion, or age. In 1990 with passage of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act we ensured that Americans were not \ndiscriminated against on the basis of a disability. Today, for the \nfirst time, the Senate goes on record prohibiting discrimination at \nwork on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n  Yesterday I entered into a colloquy with Senator Leahy, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee with regard to Senate \namendment No. 2012. I would like to further clarify my response to \nSenator Leahy. As Senator Leahy clearly set forth in his question to \nme, this amendment simply says that you cannot retaliate against an \norganization solely because it qualifies for the exemption under \nsection 6(a) of ENDA. The amendment is not intended to undermine in any \nway current or future Federal, State, or local civil rights \nprotections--States and localities can still enforce their own \nnondiscrimination laws for violations within their jurisdiction, \nregardless of whether an entity is exempt under the national ENDA \nlegislation.\n  We have had a very collaborative process on this bill, and I would \nlike to take this opportunity to thank all of those who have made that \npossible first, to the sponsors of the bill, Senator Merkley, Senator \nKirk, Senator Baldwin, and Senator Collins, all of whom have put in \nmany hours behind the scenes working to build support for this bill and \nmake passage today a reality. Thank-yous also go to their staff: \nJeremiah Bauman, Cade Clurman, Amber Shipley, John Kane, Katie Brown, \nand Betsy McDonnell.\n  On my HELP Committee staff I would like to thank Beth Stein, Lauren \nMcFerran, Chris Williamson, and Pam Smith. I would also like to thank \nthe HELP Committee minority staff who also worked to get this bill \nthrough a very collaborative process: Kyle Fortson, Kai Hirabayashi, \nand David Cleary. A special thank-you goes to Dan Goldberg, who \nrecently left my HELP Committee staff but did a tremendous job on this \nbill up through the committee markup. I commend all of the staff for \nhelping to make final passage of this bill a reality.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes to \nspeak to this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague who preceded me who \nhas summarized the bipartisan collaboration to bring this bill to this \npoint that we will be voting on in just a few minutes. No one has done \nmore than she to advance this conversation over many years. I thank the \nSenator from Maine for those incredible efforts on behalf of ending \ndiscrimination and advancing liberty and opportunity.\n  Today the Senate will vote to break the chains of discrimination that \nhold back millions of LGBT Americans from the full promise of liberty--\nliberty, that freedom to participate fully in our society, in the \npublic square to the voting booth, to the school, to the workplace; \nliberty, that quality deeply rooted in our national journey and \nembedded in our Declaration of Independence `` . . . that all men are \ncreated equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain \nunalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit \nof Happiness;'' liberty, the declared mission of our Nation in the \npreamble to the Constitution: We, the people, in order to form a more \nperfect union and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our \nposterity, do ordain and establish a Constitution of the United States \nof America.\n  But the march to liberty has been long, with numerous battles along \nthe way: the fight to end slavery that President Lincoln figured so \nprominently in, the fight to end racial discrimination, the fight to \nend gender discrimination, the fight to end discrimination against our \nseniors, and the fight that continues today with this bill to end \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n  Discrimination diminishes the potential of the individual and it \ndiminishes the potential of our Nation. Senator Ted Kennedy said this \nsuccinctly when he helped introduce in 2009 a predecessor of the bill \nwe will be voting on today. Senator Ted Kennedy said: ``The promise of \nAmerica will never be fulfilled as long as justice is denied to even \none among us.'' He spoke these words just 20 days before he passed \naway. It is appropriate to quote Ted Kennedy because he led the fight \nfor this bill since its first introduction in 1994. I think he would be \ntremendously pleased with the bipartisan vote of affirmation against \ndiscrimination which we will soon be taking.\n\n[[Page S7907]]\n\n  Along the course of the two decades many have helped on this bill, \nwhose footsteps no longer echo in these Halls, and to all of those \nchampions of liberty who have participated in this process I say thank \nyou.\n  There are many champions of liberty still in this body who have been \nfighting toward this moment, and I wish to make sure I acknowledge \nthem: Senator Harkin, who championed many elements, including ending \ndiscrimination against those with disabilities and who steered this \nbill through his committee; Senator Harry Reid and the leadership team \nwho worked together to enable this moment in the calendar to have this \ndebate and to advocate this bill; Senator Tammy Baldwin, who brought in \nenergy from the House and the powerful voice of her personal experience \nto bear on this debate; Senator Collins, who just spoke, who has done \nso much for so long to make this happen, and in the first 2 years of \n2009 and 2010 was the lead cosponsor. She passed the baton to Senator \nKirk, who has carried that baton forward in the most admirable way. \nSenators Murkowski and Hatch joined to help this bill come out of \ncommittee and helped create the momentum; Senators Portman, Ayotte, \nHeller, Toomey, and Hatch engaged to help make sure the religious \nexemption which we developed with the right hand is not taken away with \nthe left hand, to reinforce the integrity of the title VII religious \nexemption; Senator Flake, who brought forward ideas on how to make sure \nthe guidance would be there to help businesses understand how to \nimplement this act.\n  There are a lot of coalition groups that have done a tremendous \namount of work. Well done. Every conversation such as this takes \nadvocates inside the Chamber and advocates outside the Chamber but a \nparticular acknowledgement of the Human Rights Campaign.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. There are two staff members on my team who have labored \non this whom I wish to personally acknowledge: Scott Rosenthal, who \ncarried this organizational responsibility for a number of years, and \nmy legislative director Jeremiah Bowman, who provided over these last \nfew months this critical organizing stage.\n  I look forward to this vote for liberty, this vote for freedom, this \nvote for opportunity, and this vote for a fairer and just America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all postcloture time \nis yielded back.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is, \nShall the bill (S. 815), as amended, pass?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Casey) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Wyoming (Mr. Barrasso), the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. \nCoburn), and the Senator from Alabama (Mr. Sessions).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy).

Mr. President, I was with my wife today, who was \nrecovering from surgery, but had I been present I would have proudly \ncast my vote in favor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA). \nAs a cosponsor of ENDA, I am grateful for today's bipartisan Senate \nvote, and I was pleased to vote for cloture earlier this week.\n  Despite the progress our Nation has made in ensuring equality for \nall, more than one in five lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender \nemployees have experienced workplace discrimination. That is completely \nunacceptable and Congress is long overdue in extending workplace \nprotections to the LGBT community. Workers should be judged on the \nquality of the job they do, not who they are. I applaud today's vote \nand hope that the House of Representatives will quickly follow the \nSenate and work in a bipartisan way to send this legislation to the \nPresident for signing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/07/senate-section/article/S7909-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7909-S7920]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      DRUG QUALITY AND SECURITY ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on Veterans Day we come together to \nhonor the brave men and women who have given so much to defend our \ncountry and protect our freedoms. I think of so many veterans, \nincluding my dad, who served in the U.S. Navy. I want to take this \nopportunity to say thank you to our country's veterans, and the nearly \n500,000 veterans in the State of Indiana, for your service to the \nNation.\n  Veterans Day is also a chance to reaffirm our country's commitment to \ncaring for veterans and their families. While it is important to say \nthank you to veterans, it is even more important to express our \ngratitude through action for all generations of veterans.\n  There are several ongoing efforts in my office that I would like to \nshare with everyone. I have been a proud supporter of the Veterans \nHistory Project through the Library of Congress, and it has done an \noutstanding job in leading this effort. We have so much to learn from \nour veterans, and it is vital that we record their stories and \nexperiences for future generations. I urge veterans of any conflict to \ncontact our office if you would like to share your story. We stand \nready to give Hoosiers information on this important project, and \nplease contact us at any time if you would like to participate.\n  Additionally, there are Hoosier veterans of Vietnam and other wars \nwho still have not received, or have lost over the years, their honors \nor their medals that they earned for heroism. Now is the time to \nresolve these cases.\n  I am so deeply honored this Veterans Day to be handing to four \nHoosier veterans--Mr. Michael Hodgson, Mr. Canard Terhune, Mr. Jim \nHorn, and Mr. Julian Quarnstrom--the many medals and ribbons they were \nawarded for their service and bravery but still have not received.\n  I also believe it is important to honor veterans from all conflicts, \nwhich is why earlier this year I introduced a bill that would authorize \nthe construction of a National Desert Storm and Desert Shield Memorial \nat no cost to the government. The men and women who fought in the first \ngulf war, especially those who gave the ultimate sacrifice, deserve to \nhave their service memorialized.\n  Now we have a new generation of veterans. They have returned home \nfrom Iraq and Afghanistan, and many of them are still coping with \nreadjusting to civilian life. They have experienced health challenges, \nincluding traumatic brain injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder. \nThese incredible challenges have resulted from their service and their \ndedication to our country. Our veterans have earned the best care we \ncan provide, and this includes access to timely and quality medical \ncare. It is both our challenge and our priority to ensure a smooth \ntransition and to effectively treat any health conditions linked to \ntheir service efforts.\n  In particular, I am dedicated to addressing the problem of military \nand veteran suicide. If you are in need of or know of a servicemember \nor veteran who has challenges and who is in need, please know that \nseeking help is a sign of strength, not a sign of weakness, and from \nthat strength there is always help that is available.\n  I am also committed to addressing the backlog in benefits claims, one \nof the significant challenges facing the Veterans' Administration. Wait \ntimes for benefits claims are at an unacceptably high level.\n  In the VA regional office in Indianapolis, Hoosiers play a critical \nrole in processing claims to eliminate the backlog. I thank them for \ntheir public service, their hard work, and urge them to continue to do \nwhatever they can to reduce that wait time so benefits may be received \nmore promptly.\n  While I know the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, General Shinseki, is \nfully committed to solving this problem, more must be done. I stand \nready to work together with my colleagues to provide the VA the tools \nit needs to accomplish this goal, reduce the wait times, and take even \nbetter care of our veterans.\n  In addition to ensuring care and benefits for our veterans, I believe \neconomic opportunity is equally important. When I ask servicemembers \nwhat we can do for them, they always have the same answer: We just want \nto make sure there is a good job to come home to and a good job that \ncan help take care of our families when we do.\n  A quality education and gainful employment give our veterans the \nchance to fulfill the American dream, and it helps fulfill our \nresponsibility in supporting our veterans. That is where all of us come \nin. As one of Indiana's U.S. Senators, I am always looking for ways to \nimprove the transition from military to civilian life. Let's make sure \nour trade schools and universities welcome our veterans with open arms.\n  To our business owners, thank you for all of the veterans you have \nhired, and I urge you to hire even more. Veterans have many skills that \ncan translate to a variety of positions, they have a strong commitment \nto quality and service, and you can always rely on our veterans.\n  Hoosiers in every community, please welcome back our brave men and \nwomen--whether it is in your neighborhood, whether it is at the local \nrestaurant, whether it is at your child's school, or whether it is at \nchurch on Sunday.\n  On Veterans Day, and every day, let us honor America's veterans by \ncherishing the freedoms they have defended. Our country is grateful for \nall you have done for all of us. You have given us our safety, our \nfreedom, and our liberty. Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Manufacturing Jobs\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an important \ninitiative that is not only important to my State of Arkansas but \nimportant to our entire Nation, and that is manufacturing. This country \nis an economic powerhouse, and we are certainly a manufacturing \npowerhouse. There is an important initiative that is being put together \nhere in the Senate called the Manufacturing Jobs for America \ncampaign. I think so far we have maybe 21 colleagues, maybe 22, or \nmaybe even more who are in support of this effort. I encourage others \nto look at it.\n\n  We see a lot of manufactured crises here in Washington. It may be the \nfarm bill or the government shutdown or the near debt default. Those \nare all just kind of manufactured by the Congress. But I am glad to see \nwe have 21 or 22 or 23 colleagues here who are ready to turn off the \n``my way or the highway'' politics and turn down the rhetoric and \nreally focus on what our No. 1 priority should be, which is jobs and \nthe economy, because if we didn't learn anything else from the shutdown \nand some of those high-wire act politics of the last few weeks, \nhopefully we learned that if we want to get anything done in \nWashington, we need to work together. That is the bottom line. That is \nwhat this package of bills and this initiative are intending to do. If \nwe really want to create jobs and if we really want to make a \ndifference for the U.S. economy, we have to reach across the aisle.\n  There are many bright spots in the Congress. Listen, we know we have \nbeen through the ringer. We know how difficult this recession was. It \nwas the hardest economic downturn in my lifetime and most of our \nlifetimes, the hardest economic downturn we have ever seen since we \nhave been alive, but we are coming out of it.\n  There are many bright spots in the economy. Yes, we get good economic \nnews pretty much every day, and we also get some mixed economic news \npretty much every day. So it is not happening as fast as we would like \nit to, and it is not happening in every sector of the economy and in \nevery section of the country as we would like it to, but it is \nhappening.\n  One of those bright spots is manufacturing. Last year manufacturing \ncontributed $1.87 trillion to our economy--$1.87 trillion in \nmanufacturing. That is how much of a difference it made in our economy. \nThere are 17.2 million U.S. jobs; that is, jobs in this country, and 1 \nin 6 private sector jobs is tied to manufacturing. It also provides a \nvery strong return on the investment we make. So if we invest $1 in \nmanufacturing, it adds $1.48 back into the economy.\n  America is a powerhouse when it comes to manufacturing, and we need \nto keep it that way. Everybody knows--look at all the studies--the \nUnited States is the world's largest manufacturing economy. In fact, if \nwe just took manufacturing and put everything else on the side, the \nUnited States would still be the 10th largest economy in the world just \nbased on our\n\n[[Page S7911]]\n\nmanufacturing. We are a powerhouse, but we can do more, we can do much \nmore, and we should.\n  We need to fight hard to make sure that ``Made in America'' remains \nthe gold standard. We want it to be the thing everybody wants to see in \nevery market. ``Made in America'' means something. It also means \nsomething here because the investment is here, the workers are here, \nand the productivity is here. It is good for GDP, et cetera. We want to \nmake sure manufacturing remains what it has always been. That is why \ntoday I offer my public support for this Manufacturing Jobs for America \ncampaign, and it is why I have supported a lot of provisions in the \npast. Most of them have been bipartisan efforts where we have reached \nacross the aisle to try to work with my Republican colleagues on all \nkinds of issues, including the America COMPETES Act and the America \nCOMPETES reauthorization efforts. I am totally for them. I think they \nare good initiatives.\n  One of them we have talked about is the national strategic plan for \nadvanced manufacturing. Advanced manufacturing is a little different \nfrom traditional manufacturing. We need to make sure that we are \nstrategic and focused and that we know what we are talking about, as \nwith angel investors. A lot of times people think investment just \nhappens. A lot of times it does, but sometimes, if we can give that \nlittle nudge to angel investors, they can invest and make a huge \ndifference in those companies and they can touch millions of people's \nlives. We have seen that in our State of Arkansas, and that resulted in \nsome real success stories.\n  Then, if we can bring it back down to a really small scale, one of \nthe initiatives I have supported over the years is the small business \nstartup savings account. People can take a certain amount of money from \na paycheck, put it in a savings account tax-free--kind of like an IRA \nor a fund like that--put it in that savings account and use it to start \na business or somehow grow the business. They never get taxed on it. \nThey can cash it in at some point and use it to start a business. That \nis good for savings, it is good for the economy, and it is good to get \nthese small businesses started. Everybody knows as well as I do that \nwhen someone walks into a lender, a bank, and they have, say, $10,000, \n$20,000, or $30,000 saved, that gives them a big advantage when they \nneed a loan for the rest of the money. So that is a win-win across the \nboard.\n  Again, I support working on this commonsense package of bills that \nreally accomplishes four goals: First, strengthening our manufacturing \nsector; second, leveling the playing field for American companies; \nthird, helping startups get access to capital; and fourth, enhancing \ninnovation, competitiveness, and trade opportunities for businesses \nhere at home. Various Senators in the Chamber have different ideas on \nhow we accomplish them, but I think we can all agree on those goals. If \nwe work together, we really can make a great difference for our Nation.\n  One of the reasons why coming out of this sluggish economy has been a \nlittle more slow than we would have liked is because we don't have as \nmany manufacturing jobs as we used to. Although the number is on the \nrebound and it is growing, we all know we have lost a lot of \nmanufacturing jobs in the last couple of decades. But we are back. It \nis because of energy. It is because of the trained workforce. It is \nbecause of our efficiencies, et cetera. We are back. We need to push \nthis advantage and keep it growing. Our country has the workforce, we \nhave the infrastructure, and we have the manufacturing base and the \nwork ethic here; we just need to give our businesses that little extra \nboost to manufacture jobs for America.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Sportsmen's Act\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of protecting our \nNation's outdoor traditions, including opening access to our public \nlands, preserving some of the greatest places to hunt and fish and \nrecreate, and encouraging economic development and job creation in our \ngreat outdoors.\n  Last fall I called upon Congress to pass my bipartisan Sportsmen's \nAct. As the chairman of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, I made it \nmy goal to do something significant, something historic for this \ncountry's hunters and anglers. We came very close to passing my bill \ntwice, but politics got in the way both times. A commonsense and widely \nsupported measure failed to get across the finish line because some \nfolks around here put self-interests before the interests of their \nconstituents. I am optimistic that this time will be different and that \nwe can work together to get this bill across the finish line.\n  Senator Hagan is leading the charge on behalf of our sports men and \nwomen, and I know she is ready to work with all of our colleagues to \nfind a path forward. My friend from North Carolina is the new chairman \nof the sportsmen's caucus. Hailing from a State with a rich hunting \ntradition, she knows the importance of protecting America's outdoor \nheritage. Representing a State that stretches from the Atlantic Ocean \nto the Appalachian Mountains, she knows it is critical to preserve our \nwide range of treasured lands.\n  Senator Hagan's legislation combines more than 15 bills that will \nincrease access for recreational hunting and fishing, that support land \nand species conservation, and that protect our hunting and fishing \nrights. Most importantly, they take ideas from both sides of the \npolitical aisle, ideas with support from all corners of the \nconservation and outdoors community.\n  When I was the chairman of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, \nsports men and women would constantly tell me about the importance of \naccess to our public lands. Right now there are 34 million acres of \npublic land that sports men and women cannot access. That is why this \nbill requires that 1.5 percent of the annual funding from the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund be set aside to increase public land access, \nensuring sports men and women access to some of the best places to hunt \nand fish in the country.\n  Senator Hagan's bill will reauthorize the North American Wetlands \nConservation Act. This voluntary initiative provides matching grants to \nlandowners who set aside critical habitat for migratory birds, such as \nducks. Over the past 20 years volunteers across America have completed \nmore than 2,000 conservation projects and protected more than 26 \nmillion acres of habitat under this successful initiative. The North \nAmerican Wetlands Conservation Act is a smart investment in both our \nlands and our wildlife, and it needs to be reauthorized.\n  Senator Hagan's bill and mine are not identical, but most of the \nprovisions are the same, and the bill is a product of the same spirit \nof cooperation that drove my bill.\n  Now, just as happened last year, some folks around Washington will \nask why this legislation is important. After all, we need to be working \ntogether to create jobs and put this country on solid financial \nfooting. But outdoor recreation is a job creator and an economic driver \nthroughout this country, and Montana is no exception. In my State, one \nin three Montanans hunts big game and more than 50 percent fish. \nNationwide, outdoor recreation contributed nearly $650 billion in \ndirect spending to the economy in 2012. Hunting and fishing is not just \nrecreation; it is a critical part of our economy. In Montana, hunting \nand fishing brings in more than $1 billion a year to our economy--\nnearly as much as our State's cattle industry.\n  Strengthening our economy, creating jobs, preserving our outdoor \ntraditions and our treasured places--these all sound like no-doubt-\nabout-it ideas, but last year the Sportsman's Act ran into trouble \nright here in this Senate. Opposition to my bill didn't come from \nconcerns about measures in the bill itself; instead, it was blocked by \nMembers of Congress taking out frustrations with how other votes went \nthat day. My bill was simply caught in the crossfire. Sports men and \nwomen across the country who have been waiting for a bill such as this \nfor a generation\n\n[[Page S7912]]\n\nwatched in disbelief as my bill fell victim to politics. They won't \nstand for it again.\n  This is a bill with widespread support that preserves our outdoor \neconomy and secures our outdoor heritage for our kids and our \ngrandkids. There is nothing controversial about it.\n  Thanks to the leadership of Senator Hagan, my colleagues have another \nchance to get it right. When Senator Hagan's sportsmen's bill comes to \nthe floor, whether here or in committee, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it. Approve it as a vote for bipartisanship. Approve it as a \nvote for common sense over political victory. Approve it as a vote for \nAmerica's 90 million sports men and women. Approve it as a vote to \ncreate jobs.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                POST Act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, yesterday Senator Harkin of Iowa, the \nChairman of the Senate HELP Committee, joined me in reintroducing a \nbill called Protecting Our Students and Taxpayers or the POST Act. I am \npleased that supporting our efforts are the Education Trust, U.S. PIRG, \nthe National Association of College Admissions Counseling, the Military \nOfficers Association of America, and the Young Invincibles.\n  Since 1992, Congress has required for-profit schools to derive a \nportion of their revenue from non-Federal sources. Most people would be \nsurprised to learn how these for-profit schools are really totally \nupside down. Many depend almost exclusively on Federal money. They are \nprivate schools, very profitable, and yet often most of their money \ncomes from the Federal Government.\n  If you took this segment of our economy, for-profit schools, and made \nit a Federal agency, it would be the ninth largest Federal agency. That \nis how much money we put into for-profit schools. Who are these \nschools? Well, young people, particularly high school age or college \nage, they know them by name. They are the ones that come bombarding you \non the Internet with solicitations to please come join our for-profit \nschool. You cannot get on a CTA bus in Chicago, or on the subway in New \nYork without being inundated with all of these schools trying to sign \nup young people.\n  There are three numbers which everyone should understand when they \ntake a look at the for-profit school industry. These three numbers tell \nyou what you need to know: 12 percent of high school graduates go to \nfor-profit colleges--12.\n  For-profit colleges and universities receive 25 percent of all the \nFederal aid to higher education, 12 percent of the students--25 percent \nof the Federal aid to higher education: student loans, Pell Grants.\n  The third number is the most important. Forty-seven. So 47 percent of \nthe student loan defaults in America are students from for-profit \nschools. They are a small segment of the population, 12 percent; 25 \npercent of the Federal aid to higher education and 47 percent of the \ndefaults. They have cooked quite a deal with Congress and with our \nFederal Government.\n  Since 1992 we have said to these schools--the law has said: You have \nto derive a portion of your revenues not from the Federal Government. \nIt is not a portion from the Federal Government, but a portion not from \nthe Federal Government. This was meant to keep for-profit schools in a \nsituation where they would not rely completely on Federal dollars to \nsurvive.\n  Originally, these schools had to come up with--listen to this--15 \npercent of their revenue from non-Federal sources--15 percent. In 1998, \nit was reduced to 10 percent. What it means is when the school signs up \na student, they only have to come up with 10 percent of the actual \ncost, in most circumstances, from sources outside of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  These schools are channeling Federal dollars by the millions through \nthese students into their own coffers. Nine out of every $10 that these \nschools take in can come from the U.S. Treasury and taxpayers. Much of \nthe for-profit college industry takes in most of its money directly \nfrom the Federal Government.\n  In fiscal year 2012, we sent $32 billion to for-profit schools. We \nspent more on for-profit schools then we did on the National Institutes \nof Health, NASA, the Coast Guard, Customs and Border Patrol, the EPA, \nor the FBI. We spend more on for-profits than we do keeping planes in \nthe sky, protecting our borders, tracking down criminals, responding to \ndisasters, researching cures for cancer, protecting the Nation's food \nsupply, making sure our air and water are safe, or exploring the outer \nreaches of the universe.\n  In 2009 and 2010, for-profits took in 25 percent of the Department of \nEducation Title IV funds, enrolling only 12 percent of the students. \nThey have quite an arrangement going on here. The largest is University \nof Phoenix, the Apollo Group. You have heard about the University of \nPhoenix; you cannot escape them. They advertise all the time.\n  In 2011, the Apollo Group, which owns the University of Phoenix, \ncounted 86 percent of its revenue from Federal sources, Title IV funds, \nmore than $5 billion to this one for-profit school. As long as they are \neducating students, why should we be concerned?\n  The Apollo Group's profit last year was more than $400 million. In an \nera of spending cuts and austerity, what are Federal taxpayers doing \nsending so much money to a private sector company that is so \nprofitable, particularly in a sector of the education economy that \naccounts for 47 percent of student loan defaults?\n  Last year a young woman who received a BA in Fine Arts from the \nInternational Academy of Design and Technology in Chicago contacted our \noffice. She finished the undergraduate program, and she found that no \ngraduate programs outside of that school would even consider her \ntranscript. They did not recognize a degree from the so-called \nInternational Academy of Design and Technology, a for-profit school.\n  So 4 years later, with a worthless diploma, she was $58,000 in debt \nand had no real future in her chosen field. Federal taxpayers gave the \nInternational Academy of Design and Technology, 89 percent of its \nrevenue.\n  It is a flowthrough. The students apply. They then apply for Pell \ngrants if their income is low enough, student loans. The money flows \nthrough the student into the for-profit school. The student ends up \nwith the debt and the for-profit school ends up with the money. In this \ncase, the student ends up with a worthless diploma and $58,000 in debt \nwhen it is all over.\n  Ashford University--I could go on for a while about Ashford in Iowa--\nis currently being investigated by the California attorney general for \nits recruitment practices. It receives 87 percent of its revenue from \nthe Federal Government.\n  For such dependence on Federal taxpayers for their operation, one \nwould think these schools must be generating a great return on \ninvestment. We have a deficit. Why should we be sending so much money \nto these for-profit schools? Some of these schools are good, make no \nmistake, but many are not, and the taxpayers pay either way. For-profit \ncolleges spend less on student instruction than traditional schools, \n$3,500, roughly, for students at the for-profit schools, over $7,000 at \npublic institutions, and $15,000 per student at private not-for-profit \nschools. The students leave school with more debt if they go to for-\nprofit schools. They average at least $6,000 more debt than the typical \nstudent.\n  For-profit students, as I said, are more likely to default. Almost \nhalf of the student loan defaults come from students from these \nschools.\n  How are the CEOs at the top for-profit schools doing? They made an \naverage in 2009, the last reported date, of $7.3 million a year. Think \nabout that, 80 or 90 percent of the money is coming from the Federal \ntaxpayers, encumbering the students with debt, and CEOs of the company \nare walking away with an average of over $7 million a year in income.\n  The bill I have introduced with Senator Harkin would change this. I \nwant\n\n[[Page S7913]]\n\nto do more, but the first step is returning to the 85-15 ratio, saying \nthat for-profit schools cannot take more than 85 percent of their \nrevenues from the Federal Government and taxpayers. It would also hold \nthese schools accountable for breaking the threshold after 1 year of \nnoncompliance, rather than the lenient 3 consecutive years, which is \ncurrently the law.\n  That is only part of the story. The Federal subsidy of these schools, \nthese money-making machines, goes even farther. The dirty little secret \nof the current Federal 90/10 rule is that it doesn't count GI bill \nbenefits or the Department of Defense Voluntary Education Program. \nHundreds of millions of dollars per year would flow to these schools \nfrom these programs and they are exempt from the 90 percent-10 percent \nrequirement.\n  Does anybody dispute the Department of Defense is part of the Federal \nGovernment--of course it is. Whether it be planes, bombs, or \nservicemembers' education it's paid for by U.S. taxpayers. Nobody \nquestions that. When we limit how much of these schools' revenues can \ncome from the Federal Government, why should we ignore the money coming \nthrough the Department of Defense? It is Federal money, Federal \ntaxpayer money.\n  According to the 2009 HELP Committee report on for-profit schools, if \nall forms of Federal funds were counted, the top 15 publicly traded \nfor-profit companies received, on average, 86 percent of all their \nrevenue from Federal sources. The loophole makes servicemembers and \nveterans prime targets of for-profit schools. They are all over these \nservicemembers and veterans to sign them up because they bring in more \nfederal dollars. It has led to well-documented horror stories about \naggressive predatory recruiting practices.\n  I have been on this floor telling these stories many times. I do \nthink they bear repeating. I have told the story of two former military \nrecruiters at a for-profit college in Illinois. They contacted my \noffice to tell me what happened. They were told their job was above all \nto put ``butts in classes''--that they should dig deep into the \npersonal lives of their recruits to find their ``pain point.''\n  If a prospective student was out of work, recruiters were encouraged \nto say things such as: ``How do you think your wife is about being \nmarried to somebody unemployed?''\n  Entrance requirements at these schools are very low, maybe \nnonexistent. It didn't matter how long a student stayed as long as he \ncame in, signed up, got the Federal loan that went to the school, and \nthen he was stuck with the debt. There is no telling how many \nservicemembers have been lured by these practices and then ripped off.\n  One of these schools has the name the American Military University. A \nnephew of mine is serving in the U.S. Army. I sent him an email, and I \nsaid take a close look at this school. It is not part of the military. \nThey sound like it, but they aren't. It is a for-profit school, and \nvery profitable. There is no telling how many servicemembers have been \nlured into these schools.\n  There is James Long, who suffered a brain injury when an artillery \nshell hit his humvee in Iraq. He used military benefits to enroll in \nAshford University, one of the more notorious, after he had been \nheavily recruited by that school. He told Bloomberg News he knows he is \nenrolled in Ashford, but he can't remember the courses. Remember, he \nsuffered a head injury in Iraq.\n  Christopher Ford told the LA Times he used his GI bill benefits at a \nfor-profit school to take an online engineering course, only to find \nout no company would accept his training and he had used his benefits \nin pursuing this degree. Of his for-profit education, he said:\n\n       It was heavily marketed, so I took it. It sounded pretty \n     good, but it turned out to be pretty predatory.\n\n  Our bill, Senator Harkin's bill and my own, would protect \nservicemembers and their families from being preyed on by ending this \nloophole and counting these military and veterans' benefits in the new \n85-percent limit. This commonsense bill is a modest step forward trying \nto reclaim some dignity when it comes to Federal aid in education.\n  We have opened up this amazing loophole, and 25 percent of all the \nFederal money for higher education is going into these schools, many of \nwhich are just plain worthless. If the students were just wasting time, \nthat would be bad enough, but they are wasting opportunities for \neducation and they are digging debt holes they can never get out of.\n  I received an email this week from a family in Illinois, a mom. She \nwas so proud that her son had graduated from school. It was not a for-\nprofit school, but he graduated, and she was pretty proud of him. She \ntold me he had a problem. He had incurred $130,000 in student loan \ndebt. She found out that he had signed up for a lot of debt that \ncouldn't be consolidated, couldn't be refinanced, and she was begging \nme to do something to help her. There was one line in that email I will \nnever forget. She said: Senator, we just can't afford to pay more than \n$1,000 a month for his student loans.\n  She is speaking of $1,000 a month on a student loan. That is not \nunusual.\n  Too many of these young people and their families get sucked into \nthese student loans, many of these worthless for-profit schools. We \nhave cases that have been reported of grandmothers who have had their \nSocial Security checks garnished because they signed on to guarantee \ntheir granddaughter's student loans. God bless grandma for wanting to \nhelp her granddaughter, but then her granddaughter can't get a job, \ncan't make a loan payment, and they go after the grandmother's Social \nSecurity check. That is outrageous. Surely this Congress can come to a \nbipartisan agreement on how to cure this.\n  I wish to thank Senator Harkin for his partnership on this bill. \nThere is more to come. This student loan crisis is a growing one, and \nit affects some of the hardest working families in America. They were \nsure they were doing the right things for their kids. Now they find \nthemselves hopelessly in debt, many times with worthless for-profit \nschool diplomas.\n  We can do better and we should do better to give these young people \nand their families a chance.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Veterans Day\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. I rise today on behalf of all Nebraskans to say thank \nyou to our Nation's veterans. Our Nation has long been blessed with men \nand women with integrity who step forward and answer the call to serve. \nThroughout times of war and times of peace, our country has maintained \na military that has been the envy of the world. Each year Veterans Day \nis a time to thank and to honor the generations of patriots who have \nrisked life and limb to protect our Nation and defend the cause of \nfreedom. These heroes leave their homes--their comfortable lives with \nloved ones--for months and years at a time to fight wars in foreign \nlands. From the windy beaches of Normandy, to the snowy mountains of \nKorea, and the blistering deserts in the Middle East, our veterans have \nserved fearlessly around the globe. Meanwhile, others, including \nmembers of the National Guard, have been stationed throughout the \nUnited States serving dutifully to protect the homeland.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I have the unique \nprivilege of interacting directly with our servicemembers. I have had \nthe opportunity to meet soldiers, including many Nebraskans, working to \nprotect the hard-fought gains in Afghanistan, and I have visited with \ntroops stationed in Germany, Italy, and other allied nations. This past \nJuly I had the opportunity of a lifetime, celebrating Independence Day \nwith our troops in Afghanistan. I expressed my gratitude for their \nwork, and I assured them of my support in the Senate for that work.\n  While I am committed to ensuring our Active-Duty servicemembers have \nthe training and the tools they need to fulfill their missions, I am \nequally committed to keeping the faith with our Nation's veterans. Each \ntime I speak with one of Nebraska's many\n\n[[Page S7914]]\n\nwonderful veterans, I am reminded of the honor and the valor that \ndecorates all of our men and women who have served. Each one has a \nunique and a very memorable story to tell.\n  Recently, I was humbled to take part in the inspiring journey of more \nthan 130 Nebraska Korean war veterans to Washington, DC, through the \nHonor Flight Program. It was a privilege to help welcome them at the \nKorean War Memorial on the National Mall. All of our veterans deserve \nour appreciation, but it was especially important for me to acknowledge \nthe heroic efforts of those men and women who fought in what is \nreferred to as America's forgotten war. We are forever grateful to each \nand every American who has served, and we salute those who have paid \nthe highest price.\n  Another way to honor our fallen and missing servicemembers is by \nshowing our gratitude to those who are still with us today. As \nPresident Lincoln stated, it is our great charge ``to care for him who \nshall have borne the battle and for his widow, and his orphan.''\n  As a Senator, I am dedicated to promoting policies that assist \nAmerica's veterans when they return home and to help ease the \ntransition back into a normal life. Many need care for their physical \ninjuries as well as their emotional scars.\n  Despite possessing valuable skills, veterans also have difficulty \nfinding employment after their return. We need to encourage businesses \nand organizations to utilize the talents of our Nation's veterans and \nto help them find employment in our local communities. It is not only \nthe values but also the training and the discipline of our military \npersonnel that make America's fighting force second to none.\n  I am pleased to report to Nebraskans that this year's National \nDefense Authorization Act, the NDAA, furthers the goal of helping \nservicemembers better translate the skills they gain in the military to \na civilian job. Specifically, it helps ensure that servicemembers \nunderstand how their military skills effectively transfer to meet \nlicense or certification requirements for civilian careers.\n  It also requires the DOD to make available as much information as \npossible on the content of military training to the civilian \ncredentialing agencies. Employers need to appreciate the vast array of \nskills and knowledge our veterans acquire during their Active-Duty \nservice. My staff and I also stand ready to assist these men and women \nin navigating Federal agencies to get the assistance they may need.\n  Many of our States' veterans have contacted my office with a range of \nimportant needs that are not being met, promises that have yet to be \nkept. These requests range from acquiring important service treatment \nrecords, to securing benefits for veterans' spouses, and navigating the \nbureaucratic maze that plagues the Department of Veterans Affairs. We \nhave a great track record in securing the needed assistance.\n  This year's NDAA also urges the Secretary of Defense to expedite \nefforts to integrate electronic health records between DOD and the VA.\n  When it is fully implemented, this should greatly shorten the time it \ntakes for these servicemembers to have their information transferred to \nthe VA and start receiving the benefits they are due.\n  We can never fully repay our men and women in uniform for the \ncontributions they have made to our country, for their noble acts of \nservice, but we can continue to do our best to honor their legacy. The \npeace we enjoy was hard earned. We owe our way of life to their service \nand their sacrifice. We will never forget and we are forever grateful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                         DC Circuit Nominations\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I come to the floor because there are \nthree extremely talented, well-qualified women nominees who are ready \nto get to work on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. It is \ntime they are confirmed.\n  I will be joined this afternoon by several of our colleagues: \nSenators Hirono, Cantwell, Kaine, and Blumenthal, because we all know \nit is time for the Senate to stop the needless blocking of these women. \nEnough is enough.\n  I thank Chairman Leahy for his persistence and the fact that we are \nnot giving up on these three qualified women for the bench.\n  Our courts need judges in order for the third branch of our \ngovernment to function. The Senate should not be shutting down another \nbranch of government. Some of my colleagues in the Senate will not even \nallow an up-or-down vote on these nominees. I don't know if they have \neven met these nominees, but if they had met them, I don't know how \nthey could come to this floor and not allow an up-or-down vote.\n  President George W. Bush's candidates to the DC Circuit were \nconfirmed so the DC Circuit could keep running, and our current \nPresident's nominees should be considered in the same manner. You can't \nhave justice with an empty courtroom. It is time to stop making \nexcuses. It is time to put judges in their courtrooms, and it is time \nto get these women on the bench.\n  One of the very well-qualified nominees is Nina Pillard. Nina Pillard \nis a talented lawyer and professor. She is the kind of sensible, well-\nrespected person whom we need to fill one of those empty seats in that \ncourtroom. Actually, it is Professor Pillard because she has been a law \nprofessor at the Georgetown University Law Center for the last 15 \nyears. She graduated magna cum laude from Yale College in 1983 and \nearned her J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1987, again graduating with \nhonors.\n  In addition to her academic career, Ms. Pillard served in government. \nFrom 1998 to 2000, she was the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for \nthe Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. Prior to that she \nserved as an assistant to the Solicitor General, a position held by \nsome of our country's most talented lawyers.\n  It should be no surprise Ms. Pillard is one of the most accomplished \nSupreme Court advocates in the Nation. She has argued nine cases before \nour Nation's highest Court and has briefed 25 cases.\n  Outside the courtroom, she has spent her time teaching and mentoring \nyoung lawyers, serving as the faculty director for Georgetown Law \nSchool's Supreme Court Institute.\n  When the current Supreme Court Justice Alito was nominated by \nPresident Bush to fill an open seat on the Supreme Court, Ms. Pillard \nalso donated her time to the committee to help review his writings and \nmake a recommendation on his qualifications. Why? She was the chair of \nthe American Bar Association's Reading Committee at Georgetown Law \nCenter, which found Justice Alito ``well qualified'' to sit on the \nSupreme Court.\n  People across the aisle think Ms. Pillard is well qualified too. The \nhead of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Policy under President \nBush said that Ms. Pillard is ``a patient and unbiased listener . . . a \nlawyer of great judgment and unquestioned integrity.''\n  The deans of 25 law schools, including the University of New \nHampshire, the University of Arizona, and the University of Maine, \nwrote that Ms. Pillard ``has shown an appreciation of nuance and \nrespect for opposing viewpoints, grounded in a profound commitment to \nfair process and fidelity to the law.''\n  Twenty-five more former Federal prosecutors and law enforcement \nofficials said Ms. Pillard ``is unquestionably eminently qualified, and \nis a sensible and fair-minded lawyer.'' The nonpartisan American Bar \nAssociation's--this is no surprise--committee that reviews every \nFederal judicial nominee unanimously gave Ms. Pillard its highest \npossible rating.\n  Fairminded, unquestionably qualified, unquestioned integrity--these \nare the qualities the Senate should be looking for in a person we \nentrust to decide cases in our Federal courts. Next week the Senate \nshould give Ms. Pillard an up-or-down vote.\n  My hope for progress next week is in contrast to the reality we saw \njust 1 week ago when the Senate voted to block another eminently \nqualified woman to an up-or-down vote. As I stated last week on the \nfloor, Patty Millett would also be an excellent person to fill one of \nthe vacancies on the DC court.\n  My colleagues have discussed the qualifications of Ms. Millett at \nlength. She is a talented lawyer with extensive appellate experience--\n32 cases in front\n\n[[Page S7915]]\n\nof the Supreme Court. I do not understand how anyone in good faith \ncould vote to block an up-or-down vote of someone who has argued 32 \ncases in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, who has served as an \nAssistant Solicitor General, and who spent 15 years as an attorney on \nthe appellate staff of the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Division \nunder both Democratic and Republican administrations.\n  With all this experience, Ms. Millett is also one of the most \nexperienced Supreme Court advocates in the Nation. Just as Ms. Pillard \ndid, Ms. Millett also received the highest possible rating from the \nnonpartisan American Bar Association committee that reviews every \nFederal judicial nominee. She has done all of this, as we have all \nlearned, while raising a family, with a spouse serving in the military \noverseas. She has been raising two children while her husband was \nserving our country overseas and while donating her time to help kids \nlearn how to read and volunteering for the homeless.\n  How can anyone not allow a vote on this nominee? This is another \nwoman of unquestioned ability. Instead of confirming Ms. Millett last \nweek, sadly, she was filibustered--another woman filibustered, stopped \nin her tracks.\n  I see some of my colleagues have gotten to the floor, and so before I \ntalk about Caitlin Halligan I will give them an opportunity to speak. \nBut Caitlin Halligan is yet another woman stopped in her tracks. This \nhas to end. We have been making so much progress for women in the \njudicial system and for women in the Senate. We are now 20 of 100 \nSenators. No one filibustered us. We got an up-or-down vote when we \ncame before the American people, win or lose. That is how it should \nwork for judges. They should get an up-or-down vote--and that is what \nthese women deserve.\n  With that, I will yield the floor for Senator Hirono from the State \nof Hawaii, who is also a member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Minnesota. I \nrise to speak in support of the nomination of Cornelia ``Nina'' Pillard \nto be a circuit judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia Circuit.\n  Less than 2 weeks ago, my colleagues on the other side of the table \nblocked another nominee to the DC Circuit--Patty Millett. Earlier this \nyear, they also blocked Caitlin Halligan--yet another woman who had \nbeen nominated to the DC Circuit. Unfortunately, Ms. Halligan withdrew \nher nomination after 2 years of obstruction.\n  Only five women have served as judges on the DC Circuit in its entire \n120-year history. The DC Circuit is one of the most important circuits \nin our Nation, and it is shameful that female perspectives are so \nunderrepresented.\n  Now the Senate will consider the nomination of Nina Pillard, a truly \noutstanding nominee to the Federal bench. Ms. Pillard is currently a \nlaw professor at Georgetown University Law Center and is one of the \nleading appellate attorneys in this country. Professor Pillard has \nextensive litigation experience at all levels. She has argued nine \ncases before the Supreme Court and has briefed dozens more, including \nthe historic United States v. Virginia case that opened the Virginia \nMilitary Institute to women and the Nevada Department of Human \nResources v. Hibbs case that sustained the Family and Medical Leave Act \nagainst constitutional challenge and ensured a primary caregiver could \ntake leave in the case of a family illness regardless of gender and in \nthis case the family caregiver was a male.\n  Professor Pillard has also had an impressive 15-year tenure teaching \nconstitutional law at Georgetown. The fact that is my alma mater has \nnothing to do with my support of her.\n  In addition, she serves as codirector of the Georgetown Supreme Court \nInstitute, where she prepares lawyers for oral argument before the U.S. \nSupreme Court on a pro bono basis, without regard to which side of the \ncase they represent. In fact, under her leadership, the Supreme Court \nInstitute prepared lawyers on one or both sides of every case heard by \nthe Justices in the 2012 term.\n  Professor Pillard has also twice served as a top attorney at the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, and in those roles she advised and defended U.S. \nGovernment agencies and officials on criminal law enforcement and \nnational security matters--invaluable experience for a judge on the DC \nCircuit, where such issues are routinely considered.\n  I have been deeply impressed with her experience and record and have \nfound her to be exceptionally qualified for this important position in \nthe DC Circuit.\n  In addition to her extensive qualifications, Professor Pillard also \nhas demonstrated a commitment to fair and impartial process throughout \nher career. As mentioned by my colleague, for example, when Professor \nPillard chaired the ABA Reading Committee that reviewed Samuel Alito \nduring his nomination process, her assessment of his legal record led \nthe ABA to apply their highest rating of ``well-qualified.'' She \ndeserves to be held to the same rigorous, fair standard.\n  However, following Patty Millett and Caitlin Halligan, Nina Pillard \nis the third woman in a row to be nominated to the DC Circuit only to \nface obstruction from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  The DC Circuit is one of the most important courts in our Nation, \nweighing key constitutional issues and other matters of Federal law and \nregulation. Three of the eleven seats on this court stand vacant. Given \nthe complexity and far-ranging impact of the cases the court hears, it \nis critical we fill vacancies without delay.\n  Along with Patty Millett and Nina Pillard, President Obama has \nnominated Judge Robert Wilkins to fill these important vacancies. \nUnfortunately, so far, we have seen nothing but more obstruction of \nthese extremely well-qualified nominees. This is an opportunity to put \nexceptionally talented lawyers on a significant court that has \nvacancies needing to be filled.\n  I am disappointed our colleagues recently blocked a vote to confirm \nPatty Millett, not only a great lawyer but a military spouse who \nmanaged a successful career and the care of her children while her \nhusband was deployed overseas. When we talk about supporting our \ntroops, it means supporting their very well-qualified spouses, such as \nPatty Millett.\n  I was dismayed and saddened when obstruction caused Caitlin Halligan \nto give up on her nomination after 2 years.\n  It would be disgraceful to continue this obstruction of these \nqualified and impressive women. I urge Senators to reconsider and \nsupport these nominations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, we have also been joined by Senator \nKaine of Virginia, who knows a little bit about one of these nominees \nand is also a strong advocate for more women in the legal profession. \nThat is one of the cases we are making; that this is about the DC \nCircuit, this is about the repeated gridlock we are seeing in \nWashington that the people of this country have said they have had \nenough of, but it is also about the fact our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle have now blocked not one, not two but three \nincredibly qualified women.\n  So we are starting small on a Thursday afternoon--and maybe there are \nnot a lot of people in the gallery--but this is just the beginning. We \nare not going to let this go.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I thank my colleagues, the Senators from \nMinnesota and Hawaii, for joining me on the floor. This is a matter I \nfeel very strongly about, and I do wish to offer a few words to \nbasically just raise the question of whether there is a double standard \nfor appointment of women to this particular court, the DC Circuit.\n  Before I tackle that question, I will say one thing knowing that I am \nspeaking to a law professor. I am concerned more broadly about what I \nconsider sort of a pattern of nullification. If there is a law we don't \nlike and we can't get it overturned, there seems to be efforts to \ndefund it or even shut down government--or, in this case, what I would \ncall the decapitation strategy: If you don't like the National Labor \nRelations Board, just don't appoint people to run the business or the\n\n[[Page S7916]]\n\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms or, in this case, the DC \nCircuit.\n  The DC Circuit has an allotted number of judicial positions. This \nisn't something the President chooses. Congress sets it on the advice \nof the judicial conference. The judicial conference has not suggested \nthe number should be shrunk. There are 11 judges and 3 are currently \nvacant. The strategy of blocking appointments is sort of a \nnullification of law, which I think is troubling. But let me get to the \nquestion of what I consider to be a double standard that is blocking \nsome wonderful candidates from going onto this court.\n  My legal practice for 17 years was in the civil rights area. In the \ncivil rights area, there is a legal notion called the pretext. When \nsomething bad happens--you don't get an apartment, you don't get a job, \nyou don't get your bank loan or your homeowners insurance policy--and \nif a reason is asserted for that, but the reason just falls apart, it \nis completely illogical, it is not borne by the facts, that is called a \npretext. I worry in this instance there are a couple of pretexts going \non because the instances that have been cited by my colleagues--the \nfilibustering of Caitlin Halligan, the filibustering of Patty Millett, \nand now the filibustering of Nina Pillard--rely on two pretexts. Why \nare these candidates--Caitlin Halligan, who practiced before the U.S. \nSupreme Court, was the Solicitor General for the State of New York and \ndid such a good job, why block her? Why block Patty Millett, who worked \nin the Solicitor General's Office under both administrations, supported \nby Solicitor Generals of both administrations? Why block Nina Pillard? \nNina Pillard was the appellate attorney before the U.S. Supreme Court \nto argue for the need to admit women students to the Virginia Military \nInstitute in my State, which they have done and it is working very \nwell. One of Nina Pillard's supporters was the superintendent of VMI \nwho was being sued. The promise of America will never be fulfilled as \nlong as justice is denied to even one among us. Josiah Bunting has come \nforward and said Nina Pillard would be a great circuit justice.\n  So what is the reason being asserted to block these three women? The \nreason asserted is there is not enough of a workload on this court. I \nthink it is clear the asserted lack of workload is a pretext. It is \nnonexistent. It is a phantom argument which gets brought up whenever we \nwant to but then abandoned whenever we want to. My evidence for that is \npretty clear.\n  There are two circuit courts--the Eighth and the Tenth Circuit--which \nhave lower caseloads per judge than the DC Circuit, but we have been \napproving nominees for that circuit this year without raising any \nquestion about workload. So we will put folks on the Eighth and Tenth \nCircuits, even though they have a lower workload and no one complains \nand the other side doesn't raise that. I asked Members: Why are you \nraising that here when you weren't raising it on other courts, and they \nsaid it is because the DC Circuit is the second highest court in the \nland. It is a more important court. The phrase used by someone to me: \nIt has more juice. Members on the DC Circuit might be on the Supreme \nCourt. So workload isn't the issue on the other courts. It is just an \nissue of this court apparently because the court is so important.\n  Let's now drill down on what has happened just this year. The \nPresiding Officer and I are freshmen. We came in on January 3, 2013. We \ncame in with the pending nomination of Caitlin Halligan for the court--\nsupremely qualified, bipartisan support in the legal profession for \nher. She was filibustered, and one of the principle asserted reasons \nwas there is not enough workload on the court. So she couldn't even get \nan up-or-down vote.\n  Within 2 months we had another nominee--a superbly qualified nominee \nwhom I introduced before the Judiciary Committee, Sri Srinivasan, and \nwe approved him in the Senate 97 to 0. He is a male. No one raised one \nquestion or mentioned the workload on the DC Circuit Court. We had just \nturned down Caitlin Halligan--because you don't get an up-or-down vote \nbecause there is not enough workload--but within 2 months, a 97-to-0 \nvote we confirmed. I want to make clear, Judge Srinivasan is very \nqualified to be on this court. But the workload rationale just \ndisappeared.\n  But it didn't go away because as soon as Patty Millett is nominated--\nas was indicated, not only a superb appellate attorney who has argued \nmore cases before the Supreme Court than all but a handful of women in \nthe history of this country, who has argued cases before the DC \nCircuit, where we hope she will sit, and other circuits as well. As \nsoon as Patty Millet was nominated, the workload issue pops back up: \nThe court doesn't have enough workload. Now Nina Pillard is being told \nshe is going to be blocked also because the court doesn't have enough \nworkload.\n  I assert that this workload issue is a complete pretext. It is not \nraised about other courts and it is not raised about other nominees. \nEven this year it hasn't been raised. But it has been raised with \nrespect to three superbly qualified women: Caitlin Halligan, Patty \nMillett, and Nina Pillard. I have only been here 11 months. I don't \nknow all the previous history. But as I watch, women candidates are \nbeing treated differently on this court. This second highest court in \nthe land, this court which has juice from which people may go to the \nSupreme Court, the women candidates are being treated differently. They \nare being blocked by concerns about workload which are not being \napplied in an evenhanded way.\n  The last thing I will say is another bit of evidence which I think is \nfair to put on the table in this question of whether there is a double \nstandard for women. During the Presidency of President Obama, there has \nalso been the nomination of two women to be on the U.S. Supreme Court. \nThese were debates we followed. These two women--Justices Sotomayor and \nKagan, enormously qualified, with bipartisan support from bar \nassociations and others. Justice Sotomayor, when her vote was finally \nheld here, more than 75 percent of the Senators in the minority party \nvoted against her confirmation on the Supreme Court. Elena Kagan, when \nshe was up for nomination, 88 percent of the members of the minority \nparty voted against her confirmation to be on the Supreme Court.\n  We could look at courts that aren't the two highest in the land and \nsee there have been more appointments of women judges--and that is a \ngood thing and I hope there are more still. But when you get to the DC \nCircuit and the Supreme Court, it seems there is a double standard. It \nseems this phantom workload issue gets raised when it suits one side \nand then immediately dropped a couple months later, only to be raised \nagain to block women candidates. I think that is a very serious \nconcern.\n  Congress set the law that there are 11 judges on this court. The \nPresident is trying to comply with the mandate of Congress in putting \nwell-qualified women before this body. We should debate their \nqualifications. If folks have concerns about those, let's have that \ndebate. But we shouldn't block them from being considered and assert \nreasons that don't stand the light of day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Virginia \nfor his well-thought-out argument and the evidence he put out here for \nthe Presiding Officer, a former law professor who believes in evidence. \nI think it is important that we look at the facts.\n  I wish to back up some of the facts to why this workload argument \ndoesn't make sense, even when it is put out clearly for the women \nnominees and it wasn't put out recently for the male nominees. But here \nare the facts:\n  When George W. Bush was President, the Senate confirmed his nominees \nto fill four empty seats on the DC Circuit. That was not long ago. \nUnder President Obama, there have been four vacancies on the court. \nThere were four under Bush and four under Obama. The difference? All of \nPresident Bush's nominees were confirmed by the Senate.\n  It is important to note that one of President Obama's nominees--as \nwas pointed out by my colleague from Virginia--was confirmed by the \nSenate. I guess that means one guy is confirmed and then these three \nseats are still open for which women have been put forward.\n  Some people apparently think there is a problem with the numbers, but \nlet's look at the actual numbers. These\n\n[[Page S7917]]\n\nsame people have supported having more judges on another court that \nactually has fewer pending cases. The reason we use that standard--\npending cases--is those are the active cases. They are not the pro \nforma orders which are issued quickly. These are the actual cases \nbefore the court for which they have to make difficult decisions.\n  The DC Circuit has 8 active judges, 6 partially retired senior \njudges, and 1,479 pending cases. The Tenth Circuit has 10 active \njudges, 10 senior judges, and 1,341 pending active cases. So the Tenth \nCircuit--to which my colleagues have confirmed multiple nominees--has \nmore judges but fewer pending cases per judge.\n  Why does the Tenth Circuit have more judges with fewer cases per \njudge than the DC Circuit? I believe the answer is quite simple: \nEarlier this year, the Senate confirmed two judges to fill the empty \nseats on the Tenth Circuit, and the Senate should do the same with the \nDC Circuit by taking these three well-qualified nominees and confirming \nthem.\n  I see the Senator from Washington has arrived and I know she has a \nfew remarks about this as well. As I pointed out to the Presiding \nOfficer, this is just the beginning. We are going to continue to fight \nfor these three women judges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \nher leadership on the floor this afternoon. It is great to join her and \nmy other colleagues to talk about the importance of judicial nominees, \nand in particular today, because today we are talking about the \nnomination of more female representation on the courts which I think is \nincredibly important.\n  I served my first 2 years in the Senate on the Judiciary Committee, \nand I was struck to find that, I think at that time, I may have been \nthe fourth woman in the whole history of our country to be on the \nJudiciary Committee. Now I am so proud that my colleague from Minnesota \nserves on that committee and does an excellent job and that we have \nother representation as well. But the point we have to ask ourselves \nis, do we have to get women elected to the Senate to get women on the \nJudiciary Committee to get women on the courts because our colleagues \naren't going to help us do that?\n  I am rising to support moving these nominations. President Obama has \nnominated Cornelia Pillard and Patricia Millett. We want to see these \nvacancies filled. We don't want the same dysfunction which led to a \ngovernment shutdown to let us move toward the kind of the stopping of \nputting people on the court. Nominating highly qualified individuals is \nwhat the President's job is, and filling seats on the court is not \npacking the court. It is simply doing the job.\n  On October 31, 2013, many of my colleagues voted against a motion to \nend debate on Patricia Millett to be a judge on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia. She is a very highly qualified \nattorney who has argued before the Supreme Court 32 times and is \nrecognized both by Democrats and Republicans for her legal acumen. \nDespite her qualifications, her nomination was being blocked. Had she \nbeen confirmed, she would only be the sixth woman to sit on the DC \nDistrict Court of Appeals. So I am questioning the place we are now on \nthis nomination.\n  Professor Nina Pillard is another filibustered nominee who has argued \nhistoric cases before the Supreme Court, including a case to open the \nVirginia Military Institute to women for the first time in history and \na case defending the family medical leave law. American people want to \nknow why are these qualified female judges being blocked. Just 32 \npercent of the U.S. Appeals Court judges are women. In my opinion, it \nis time to move forward with more highly qualified nominees to add \ndiversity to the courts.\n  I have not heard any of my colleagues question the credentials of \nthese nominees. In fact, Ms. Millett has been called ``a brilliant \nmind, a gift for clear persuasive writing, and a genuine zeal for the \nrule of law.'' This is not a quote by a Democratic Senator or a liberal \nthink tank. That quote is from former Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr \nin a letter with six other Solicitors General, top lawyers who have \nserved in the George H. Bush and George W. Bush and Clinton \nadministrations, basically saying, ``Equally important, she is \nunfailingly fair minded.'' That is from Mr. Starr.\n  So the DC Circuit Court currently has four judges chosen by \nDemocratic Presidents and four by Republicans. There are three \nvacancies on the court. Republicans are arguing we shouldn't fill these \nvacancies, that we should just eliminate them. I think my colleague \nfrom Minnesota just spoke to this. This is a proposal that is even \nopposed by Chief Justice John Roberts, who argues that the DC Circuit \nCourt of Appeals is similar to many of the Federal courts and is \noperating in a state of crisis. He said, ``Based on our current \ncaseload methods, the D.C. Circuit Court should continue to have 11 \njudgeships.''\n  So we need a court that is fully staffed. The primary responsibility \nof this court is the handling of cases involving Federal regulations on \nenvironmental safety, health care reform, and insider trading. We \nshould trust that our judicial branch can nominate and get judges on \nthat court that basically will look at the law and not party \naffiliation and stop obstructing people whom I believe are qualified to \nbe on the court.\n  I hope we can move forward. Ms. Millett is the second female nominee \nopposed by Republicans after the nomination of Georgetown professor \nPillard was filibustered. However, she joins a long list of judicial \nnominees who happen to be female who have been opposed, not because of \ntheir qualifications but because they were nominated by this President. \nI will submit that list for the Record.\n  I hope this discussion today points out the need of more women on the \ncourts. Maybe we also need more women elected to the Senate so we can \nmake sure we get more women on the courts. But this is, today, about \nasking my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to not look past \nthis court. Do not try to diminish it by narrowing its focus. Get more \npeople who will support qualified women so we can have the diversity in \nAmerica that we need represented on our courts, even at the DC district \nappeals level.\n  I thank my colleague from Minnesota for arranging for all of us to be \nhere today to share our views.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I think there are two interesting \nfacts that Senator Cantwell brought up that I didn't know. The first \nwas the percentage of women in the Federal district courts--in the 30-\npercent range, 32-percent range. The second was Justice Roberts' belief \nthat, in fact, we should have judges to fill these seats. It is \ninteresting that Justice Roberts actually was on the DC Circuit. I \nremember looking at the numbers. When he was confirmed to serve on the \nDC Circuit, there were actually fewer pending cases per judge than \nthere are now--even if these vacancies were filled. I keep bringing \nthat up because it is the one and the only argument we keep hearing \nagainst these three women we talk about today. Caitlin Halligan was \nalready filibustered, stopped in her tracks despite trying three or \nfour times and never giving up--1 year, the next year, putting in her \nname, having to go through a nomination process. We just saw Patty \nMillett, eminently qualified, filibustered, stopped at the door. I have \nnever seen so many tweets about a judicial nominee. They are not always \nthat well known, but in her case she is a hero of military spouses \nacross the country who cannot believe my colleagues across the aisle \nare denying her that right to serve on our courts.\n  Now we have a new nominee before us, Cornelia Pillard, someone, as we \nnoted, who has been unanimously suggested for this job by the \nnonpartisan American Bar Association. She is someone eminently \nqualified, with nine Supreme Court arguments, and someone who has so \nmuch respect from those she mentors, from her colleagues both \nDemocratic and Republican.\n  I see the Senator from Connecticut is here, another member of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, an esteemed \nlawyer and prosecutor herself, for her service on the Judiciary \nCommittee and\n\n[[Page S7918]]\n\ndedication to the quality of our courts and for her bringing us \ntogether this afternoon to focus on a topic I think perhaps is not \nuppermost on the minds of most Americans, not something they worry \nabout when they are bringing their kids to school or fixing dinner at \nnight, but that shapes the quality of our society. It assures the rule \nof law, and it guarantees the courts of our country look like the \npeople of our country.\n  We are here because there are too few women as judges on our Federal \ncourts. They have been denied that opportunity, and for so long they \nwere denied the opportunity even to practice law. We are here because \nthis situation is unacceptable. The Senate cannot and should not \ncontinue to obstruct the appointment of qualified nominees--in this \ninstance women. Nina Pillard, like Patty Millett, is eminently \nqualified--indeed, distinguished, a candidate who fits the ideal \nprofile. If you were designing and writing in the abstract the resume \nof a circuit court judge for the United States of America, it would be \nNina Pillard.\n  One of the tragic results of the obstruction that we see in the \nappointment of judges nominated by the President is that the Senate is \nblocking women appointees to this court. The Senate has only confirmed \none woman to the DC Court in the last 19 years. During this same time \nperiod, five men have been confirmed to the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals. In the court's entire history, only five women have been \nconfirmed. These facts speak for themselves.\n  Thanks to the leadership of President Obama and Chairman Leahy, the \nJudiciary Committee has been approving qualified women to take the \n``men only'' sign off the door at the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. But \nthose women have been blocked by a minority of this body.\n  There ought to be common ground for Senators to have a good reason to \nblock an appointment to the judiciary made by the President of the \nUnited States, which is his constitutional responsibility just as it is \nours to advise and consent, and not simply, blindly block a woman \nappointee.\n  In 2005, the bipartisan gang of 14 came together and they agreed that \na Senator should vote against a nominee only in ``exceptional \ncircumstances, extraordinary circumstances.'' The history of that \nagreement is pretty well known here even though only a handful of \nSenators who joined in the agreement are still here. Its spirit and \nintent ought to guide us. Even if it is not binding in letter, its \nintent and purpose are as real now as they were then. It was to avoid \nthe kind of nuclear approach--it is called, I suppose, the nuclear \noption for that reason--because it would be so organically threatening \nto the civility and collegiality of this body if it is invoked. The \napproach should be, as a Republican member of that gang of 14 said, \nthat judges should be denied confirmation only in the event of ``a \ncharacter problem, an ethics problem, some allegation about the \nqualifications of a person, not an ideological bent.'' If Senators \nagree that only exceptional circumstances justify blocking a nominee, \nthen clearly the three female nominees that have been nominated by the \nPresident ought to be confirmed by the Senate. Our Country, and the \nlegal profession specifically, has an unfortunate history when it comes \nto women.\n  As I mentioned earlier, for generations women were not even allowed \nto practice law. Only recently have they been afforded the opportunity \nto serve on the Federal bench--despite their serving with extraordinary \ndistinction when they were in fact appointed. They are still woefully \nunderrepresented.\n  When women are denied an equal chance to serve on our courts, we are \nleft with judicial bodies that fail to reflect the American people, \nfail to reflect their values and backgrounds, their aspirations and \ndreams, and in fact their talent and insight. An exclusionary Federal \njudiciary makes a mockery of our Nation's claim to equal justice under \nlaw.\n  The excuse for blocking appointees is that the DC Circuit Court does \nnot need more judges. I find this claim unpersuasive, based on the \nworkload of the court. We can debate, in fact, the numbers, but \nstatistics in this instance fail to reflect the complexity and \ndifficulty of the cases that come before this court. The same Senators \nwho say the caseload fails to justify appointments now gladly voted to \napprove John Roberts to the ninth seat on the court when the court had \njust 111 pending appeals per judge. It now has 182 appeals per active \njudge.\n  The history here is that the Senate approved appointees nominated by \nGeorge Bush to fill the 9th, 10th, and 11th seats on the DC Circuit, \nthe three seats that are vacant today. But this issue should not be \nabout partisan politics. It should not be about which President made \nthe appointments. It ought to be about the principle; that is, if the \nworkload is insufficient, the number of seats on the court should be \nreduced by legislation. The Congress should not refuse to fill \nvacancies when they exist lawfully and in fact when there is strong \nevidence that the workload justifies filling those vacancies.\n  Nina Pillard is a civil rights icon. She is a public servant of \nextraordinary distinction. Ms. Pillard led the integration of women \ninto the Virginia Military Institute. Her work led the Supreme Court to \nuphold Congress' ability to pass the Family and Medical Leave Act. Her \nacademic work continues to identify common ground between liberals and \nconservatives that can allow for the protection of important rights.\n  Some have said that she is a feminist. The fact is, Professor Pillard \nbelieves that a woman's right to choose is protected by the U.S. \nConstitution. In other words, she believes in a judicial decision, \nwritten by Justice Blackmun--for whom I clerked--which has been upheld \nrepeatedly by the U.S. Supreme Court over four decades. It is embedded \nin our constitutional law, as fundamental as the right to privacy is \nfundamental to our Constitution. I think the merits more than justify \nher confirmation. There is no question that she has the talent and \ntemperament, the intellect and integrity, the experience and the \nsensitivity to serve as one of our great judges on this court of \nappeals.\n  I urge my colleagues to put aside the extraneous and irrelevant \nconsiderations that may lead them to oppose confirmation and, very \nsimply, to give their approval to a woman who will be a mentor and a \nmodel to so many other women now in law school or beginning their \ncareers or even beginning their judgeships, and who one day will aspire \nto this kind of position. They will see her example and ours in \napproving her as an inspiration to them in their careers.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Gun Violence\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, we have been trying to figure out all day \nhow to fit five numbers on this poster. I have been bringing it down \nnearly every week since the anti-gun violence bill failed here in the \nSenate due to a Republican filibuster, and this is the first week this \nposter comes down to the floor of the Senate with five digits. There \nhave been 10,287 Americans killed by guns since December 14, the day of \nthe Sandy Hook shooting.\n  What I have been endeavoring to do since the failure of that bill on \nthe floor of the Senate--despite the fact that 80 to 90 percent of \nAmericans supported the bill--is to bring to the floor the voices of \nvictims, because the statistics are numbing at this point. We have had \n10,000 people in this country die at the hands of gun violence since \nDecember 14, and that apparently has not been enough to move this \nplace, or the House of Representatives, to action.\n  My hope is that by coming down to this floor every week or so and \ntelling the real stories--the human stories--about the individuals who \nhave lost their lives and the absolutely catastrophic runoff of trauma \nthat happens to a family and a neighborhood and a community when you \nlose a loved one due to gun violence, maybe that will move this place \nto do something.\n  I want to tell three stories this afternoon because it now is kind of \nroutine--you just sort of wonder what day\n\n[[Page S7919]]\n\nof the week is it going to be when you turn on CNN or look at your \nTwitter feed and you see ``active shooting in progress,'' ``school \nlockdown,'' or ``people fleeing airport.'' It just kind of happens \nevery week now. It has become a kind of commonplace occurrence. It is \nalmost like raindrops in the background of news coverage on a daily \nbasis--this week's shooting, next week's shooting.\n  On October 21, a seventh grader named Jose Reyes, a student at Sparks \nMiddle School, opened fire with a handgun he took from his parents. He \nkilled a teacher, himself, and left two other students wounded at a \nmiddle school in Nevada.\n  The teacher he killed was named Mike Landsberry, and, boy, you don't \nget much more American than Mike Landsberry. He was an Alabama native. \nHe graduated from high school in Reno, which is right next door to \nSparks, in 1986, and then served in the Marine Corps. He joined the Air \nNational Guard after he got out of the Marine Corps. He rose to the \nrank of master sergeant and served as a cargo specialist in Kuwait and \nAfghanistan. He fought for this country. He put his life on the line to \ndefend this Nation. When he came back, as happens with thousands of \nveterans, he decided to continue his public service and became an \nincredibly popular math teacher.\n  His brother said of Mike: He is ``the kind of person that if someone \nneeded help he would be there. He loved teaching. He loved the kids. He \nloved coaching them . . . He was just a good all-around individual.''\n  Mike is no longer with us because he is now one of the over 10,000 \nAmericans who have died at the hands of a gun--this time in a school \nshooting on October 21.\n  Gerardo Hernandez, according to his wife, was always excited to go to \nwork. He was a joyful person who took pride in his duty for the \nAmerican public. Gerardo was the TSA screener at the Los Angeles \nInternational Airport who was gunned down when Paul Ciancia, a troubled \n23-year-old, walked into LAX with an assault weapon and a grievance and \ngrudge against the government. He opened fire and killed Gerardo \nHernandez, age 39. He was the youngest in a family of four boys who had \nall emigrated from El Salvador. He was 15 years old when they made the \ndecision to come to the United States to seek a better, safer, more \nstable life. And now the youngest of four boys is one of 10,287.\n  Finally, the story of Maria Flores, who, frankly, didn't make \nheadlines when she died over the summer along with her daughter \nElizabeth Gomez. They died in Las Vegas when Manuel Mata, her boyfriend \nwith a history of jealousy and domestic violence, shot and killed \nMaria. He shot and killed her teenaged daughter and wounded a 4-year-\nold before turning the gun on himself.\n  Family members said that Mata had financial troubles, drank often, \ndisplayed jealousy, and constantly accused his girlfriend of cheating. \nThey said his girlfriend Maria Flores, who died that day, threatened to \nmove out of the residence a couple of weeks earlier, but she was \nconvinced by Mata to stay.\n  The daughter who was killed was scheduled to graduate 3 days after \nthe murder took place.\n  I tell these three stories for this reason: First, in the wake of the \nTSA shooting, a lot of folks from the gun lobby made the argument that \nthe way to fix this problem was to arm TSA agents, just as people made \nthe argument that the way to guarantee another Sandy Hook tragedy from \nhappening is to arm the teachers. Some people actually had the audacity \nto argue that an even better way was to arm the students too.\n  It speaks to this sort of new philosophy that has infested this \nplace--the Senate and the House--that I kind of describe as gun control \nDarwinism, the idea that if everybody has a gun--the good guys and the \nbad guys--hopefully enough of the good guys will shoot the bad guys. \nYou just throw a whole mess load of guns out there, let them figure it \nout, and in the end we will take care of the bad guys.\n  We have some new data that tells us how backwards that philosophy is. \nCommon sense tells you that is not a good idea, but the data now tells \nyou that is not a good idea.\n  The American Journal of Public Health did the most comprehensive \nstudy ever done in this country. They looked at rates of gun ownership \nand rates of homicide by gun death. They looked at decades of data \nacross every State in the Nation, and then they had the common sense to \naccount for about every factor you could think of: gender, race, \npoverty, income, education, alcohol use, and crime rates. What they \nfound is pretty stunning and straightforward. The American Journal of \nPublic Health said that for every 1 percent increase in gun ownership \nin a particular State, locality, or geographic region, there is a \nfirearms homicide rate increase of 1 percent, a 1-to-1 ratio. If gun \nownership goes up by 1 percent, increases in gun homicide go up by 1 \npercent.\n  Police chiefs in city after city across the country will verify that. \nAs they have taken guns off the street, as they have engaged in gun \nbuyback programs, guess what. Miraculously gun deaths decrease. That is \nnot to say the only thing that matters is the number of guns on the \nstreet. Clearly, this young man who walked into Sparks Middle School \nand the 23-year-old who walked into LAX had enormous issues that were \ngoing untreated. We are fooling ourselves if any of us are trying to \nperpetuate an argument that this is just about gun ownership. This is \nalso about a very broken mental health system that we need to address. \nBut a 1-percent increase in gun ownership leads to a 1-percent increase \nin gun violence.\n\n  The reason I tell Maria's story is because this is Domestic Violence \nAwareness Month--or maybe it was October. We have either completed it \nor we are in that month. Here is a stunning fact: In States that have \ncomprehensive background checks, women are 38 percent less likely to \ndie from domestic violence crimes. Women are 38 percent less likely to \ndie from domestic violence crimes if they are lucky enough to live in a \nState that says: Before you buy a gun, you have to prove to us you are \nnot a domestic abuser.\n  Since 1998, 250,000 domestic abusers have been stopped from buying \nguns because of background check laws. That is just the domestic \nabusers who were dumb enough to show up at a gun store and try to buy a \nfirearm. That doesn't count, frankly, the millions of domestic abusers \nwho never walked into the store to buy the gun in the first place \nbecause they knew they were going to be denied. Women in the United \nStates are 11 times more likely to be murdered by a gun than women in \nany other high-income Nation. And we have a solution: background \nchecks. Women are 40 percent less likely to die from domestic violence \nif they live in a State that does background checks.\n  I bring just three stories to the floor today in my effort to bring \nvoices to the victims--the stories of Mike, a teacher in Nevada; \nGerardo, an immigrant to this country who loved doing his public \nservice as a TSA screener; and Maria Flores, one of thousands of women \nacross this country killed by their spouses or partners in part because \nof the ease of access to a gun in this country.\n  So 10,287 people--that number is tough to fit on one board. That is \njust in 11 months. Frankly, it won't be that long--just a handful of \nyears from now--before there is absolutely no way to fit this number on \nthis board unless the Senate and the House of Representatives decide \nthat 90 percent of Americans are right and we should make sure \ncriminals can't access guns. We should ban illegal gun trafficking. We \nshould expand the reach of our mental health system so we can finally \nsay that Congress--the Senate and the House--is going to do something \nto give voice to these victims.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Veterans Day\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, as we approach Veterans Day on Monday, I \nwant to rise to recognize the selfless service and sacrifice of \nAmerica's veterans. As we reflect upon the generations of men and women \nwho have answered the call to serve and defend our\n\n[[Page S7920]]\n\nfreedoms, we especially remember those who have given what President \nLincoln so eloquently called ``the last full measure of devotion.''\n  Just as we owe it to the memory of those who have given their lives \nfor freedom, we also have the solemn obligation to ensure that every \nservicemember comes home and that we care for those who still bear the \nwounds of war. Some of these wounds are physically visible, while \nothers are not so apparent.\n  We have made great strides in caring for our servicemembers, \nespecially in regard to lifesaving procedures on the battlefield and \nrehabilitative care through the Department of Veterans Affairs, but \nthere is still much we must do to combat the epidemic of mental health \nissues among veterans. Traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, and the alarmingly high rate of suicide among our \nservicemembers remain among the most pressing issues our veterans face.\n  We owe all of our veterans a tremendous debt of gratitude, and we \nmust uphold the foremost duty of providing for their care. This \nresponsibility includes aiding our veterans as they transition to \ncivilian life by finding ways to put their skilled military training to \nwork and through providing timely processing of medical claims. We must \nrise to the occasion to make sure our past mistakes are not repeated as \nour troops return from current and future conflicts.\n  In my home State of South Dakota, it is easy to see the integral role \nveterans have played in shaping who we are as South Dakotans--a legacy \nthat dates back to before the founding of the State itself. South \nDakotans have always punched above their weight when it comes to \nmilitary service in all the various conflicts in which our country has \nbeen involved over the years. The values of service and honor are woven \ninto the fabric of our communities. With each passing day these values \nare strengthened by the men and women currently serving at Ellsworth \nAir Force Base and in the South Dakota Air and Army National Guard and \nVA centers around my State. I doubt there are many South Dakotans who \ndo not have a family member or friend who has worn our Nation's \nuniform.\n  I know firsthand the sacrifice made by our Nation's veterans because \nmy own father Harold was a decorated World War II Navy pilot. Like all \nour veterans, my dad served with pride and dignity, protecting our \ndemocracy at home and abroad. One of my favorite memories since I have \nbeen in the Senate was the opportunity to accompany my father to the \nWorld War II Memorial and show him that great memorial that was erected \nin honor of his generation's veterans. I was humbled by the quiet \nreverence they had for their comrades lost in battle and reminded of \nthe ultimate sacrifice made by so many of our countrymen.\n  We should be grateful for the generations of men and women who have \ngiven of themselves on behalf of our great Nation. There can be no \nmistake that America's veterans have served bravely and honorably, \nmaking America the country it is today.\n  As we celebrate a weekend filled with fanfare and celebrations, with \npeople involved in their weekend activities, I would ask that we all \ntake a moment to remember the service of those who did not make it back \nto their families and that we rededicate ourselves to caring for those \nwho continue to bear the cost of our freedoms.\n  May God bless our veterans, and may we continue to honor those who \nhave nobly answered the call to serve. On this Veterans Day, may we all \nkeep the brave members of our military and their families in our \nthoughts and prayers as they continue to serve our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/07/senate-section/article/S7920-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7920-S7923]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              VETERANS DAY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, as Veterans Day 2013 approaches next \nMonday, I ask that in honoring the brave men and women who have served \nour Nation, we in Congress honor them in ways that are meaningful and \nhelp them return to civilian life after they have served. A mere thank-\nyou is little comfort to a veteran who cannot find meaningful \nemployment, who is striving to provide for his or her family, or who is \ndealing with post-traumatic stress.\n  President Woodrow Wilson established this holiday--originally known \nas Armistice Day--on November 11, 1919, when he proclaimed that it \nwould be used to honor the brave Americans who fought and died in World \nWar I. The holiday was officially recognized by the U.S. Congress on \nJune 4, 1946. After the end of World War II, Armistice Day was expanded \nto honor all veterans of our military services, and the holiday's name \nwas changed to Veterans Day.\n  We should honor our veterans every day, but I believe that this \nannual holiday is especially important as it allows us to reflect on \nthe true aspect of the sacrifices that our servicemembers have made. \nTheir sacrifices are often made in stressful, frustrating, and \ndangerous conditions. Yet these brave men and women do not shy from \ncommitting themselves to serving our country. It is because of those \nwho have served selflessly, with honor and dignity, that we can \ncontinue celebrating our history and our way of life.\n  While I am proud of all of our veterans, I am especially proud of the \nveterans in my State. Maryland has a long and proud military tradition. \nMaryland is known as the Old Line State. Some people think that comes \nfrom the Mason Dixon Line, but it actually dates back to 1776, less \nthan 2 months after the Declaration of Independence, when George \nWashington's army was nearing annihilation in an indefensible position \nat Brooklyn Heights. They were faced with overwhelming odds, and the \nBritish Army--the most powerful military force in the world at the \ntime--was closing in around them. But on this historic day 400 \nMarylanders who made up the Maryland Line stepped up against those \noverwhelming odds and ran into the breach in defense of our Nation. \nToday, there is a plaque over the mass graves of those citizen soldiers \nthat reads simply this: ``In honor of the Maryland 400, who on this \nbattlefield on August 27, 1776, saved the American Army.''\n  Every year I make it a priority on Veterans Day to take an \nopportunity to thank the millions of brave men and women who served our \nNation in uniform and honor them for their courage, dedication, and \nsacrifice. In my first year as a Senator of Maryland I went to Garrison \nForest Veterans Cemetery in Owings Mills for a Veterans Day observance, \nas well as attended a Veterans Day Salute and groundbreaking of a new \nfacility for Baltimore Station, which provides innovative therapeutic \nresidential treatment program supporting veterans who are transitioning \nthrough the cycle of poverty, addiction, and homelessness to self-\nsufficiency.\n  I have also spent Veterans Day at the Leonardtown Cemetery and \nCrownsville Veterans Cemetery Remembrance Ceremony, where I placed \nwreaths honoring those who have paid the ultimate price in serving our \ncountry. Two years ago, I had the privilege of joining Maryland \nVeterans Affairs Secretary Edward Chow, Jr., to observe Veterans Day at \nCheltenham Veterans Cemetery. Through our efforts, we were able to \nannounce that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has awarded the \ncemetery a grant of $1.7 million to make improvements.\n  Just last year, I had the opportunity to thank the millions of brave \nmen and women who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces and risk their \nlives for our Nation when I provided remarks at the Crownsville \nVeterans Day Ceremony. Additionally, I was invited by the Armed Forces \nFoundation to speak to students at Manor View Elementary School--\nlocated on Fort Meade--as part of their Operation Caring Classroom \nProgram. During my visit, I talked to students about Veterans Day and \nthe importance of honoring the service of men and women in the \nmilitary, as well as the sacrifices of their families. We far too often \nforget to thank the families of our veterans for all they have \nsacrificed. We want our veterans and their families to know we are \ngrateful for their service to our Nation and are here today to honor \nthem as well.\n  This year I will have a chance to say thank you to veterans across \nMaryland as I participate in the Vietnam Veterans of America, Chapter \n451 Veterans Day Celebration and Baltimore City's Veterans Day \nCelebration sponsored by\n\n[[Page S7921]]\n\nthe Baltimore City Veterans Commission. This Veterans Day, I am \nreminded that Maryland is home to over 470,000 veterans to whom we made \nsolemn promises. I am committed to making sure they receive the \nservices and benefits they earned and the support they were promised. \nThe United States is the strongest Nation in the world, and I am proud \nto honor Maryland's veterans with my gratitude and respect.\n  For more than 237 years, Marylanders in every branch of service have \nbeen at the forefront of providing distinguished service for our \nnational defense. Let me mention a few examples. Marylanders are \njustifiably proud of amazing soldiers like PFC Kevin Jaye, an Army hero \nborn and raised in Smithsburg who saw his life change when he stepped \non an improvised explosive device, IED, while serving in Afghanistan. \nKevin lost his right leg below the knee, but despite the many surgeries \nand the long recovery process, he is determined to overcome these \nchallenges. Since the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began, more than \n1,500 U.S. troops have become amputees and Kevin is one of them.\n  We are justifiably proud of naval heroes like Navy Hospital Corpsman \nMichael Couch, who received a Purple Heart earlier this year as a \nresult of the injuries he sustained while serving in Afghanistan. \nMichael was traveling in a convoy when his vehicle rolled over an IED \nwhich detonated. He was knocked unconscious, and his eardrum was \nruptured. After 3 weeks of rehabilitation he rejoined his unit. Michael \nis now stationed at the Naval Academy, where he is an optometry \ntechnician who prescreens the vision of midshipmen before they meet \nwith an optometrist.\n  We are justifiably proud of marines from Maryland like HM3 Vanzorro \nGross, Jr., who was awarded the Purple Heart in May by Naval Health \nClinic Patuxent River. Corpsman Gross received the Purple Heart for \nwounds received in action during a raid while deployed in Afghanistan \nwith the Marines. During the firefight, eight service personnel were \ninjured and two were killed. Corpsman Gross was 30 days into a 6-month \ndeployment at the time of the attack and was sent home with damage to \nthe bones in his foot. He had a 3-inch hole in his foot from the \nshrapnel damage and has undergone four orthopedic surgeries so far to \nreconstruct it. Despite these injuries, when visited in Walter Reid \nNational Military Medical Center by a commanding officer, Corpsman \nGross' first question was, ``When can I go back?''\n  We are justifiably proud of Air Force Airman Captain Barry F. \nCrawford, Jr., a member of the Maryland Air National Guard, who was \nrecently awarded the Air Force Cross--second only to the Medal of \nHonor--and Purple Heart for his extraordinary heroism in military \noperations against an armed enemy of the United States as special \ntactics officer near Lagham Province, Afghanistan. Captain Crawford is \ncredited for taking decisive action to save the lives of three wounded \nAfghan soldiers and evacuating two Afghan soldiers killed in action. \nCaptain Crawford is only the fifth recipient, since 9/11, to receive \nthe Air Force Cross.\n  We are justifiably proud of Security Forces airmen stationed at \nWarfield Air National Guard Base, who were awarded the Bronze Star \nMedal for meritorious achievement while assigned to the Air Force \nOffice of Special Investigations Tactical Security Element at Bagram \nAirfield, Afghanistan. MSG John Duly and MSG Olen D. Smith III led a \n15-man tactical security element that provided security wherever the \nOffice of Special Investigations detachment needed to go. On a routine \nmission, an Army platoon came under attack from Taliban fighters, and \nSergeants Duly and Smith moved their unit to provide support. For the \nnext 48 hours their unit provided security and overwatch, responded to \na vehicle rollover, initiated and received direct fire, coordinated \nwith helicopter and fixed wing assets, and responded to a vehicle hit \nby an IED.\n  We are justifiably proud of the A-10 pilots from the 104th Fighter \nSquadron with the Maryland Air National Guard assigned to Bagram \nAirfield, Afghanistan, who recently flew as part of a harrowing mission \nto support ambushed coalition forces fighting during dangerous weather \nconditions. A dozen pilots protected more than 90 coalition \nservicemembers during a major battle in the mountains of eastern \nAfghanistan.\n  All across the services, our military members and veterans from \nMaryland are the best in the Department of Defense. But Congress simply \nhas not done enough to provide enough support to our veterans. For \nexample, unemployment is also an issue for the veterans community. \nVeterans, particularly young veterans from our most recent conflicts, \nare having trouble getting jobs. In this September's jobs report, the \nBureau of Labor reported that while the unemployment rate for \nnonveterans was 7.2 percent and the unemployment rate for all veterans \nwas at 6.5 percent, the unemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans was at \nan astonishing 10.1 percent. I find this troubling, as the experience \nthat these veterans acquired during their recent military service \nshould make them invaluable to prospective employers. We must do better \nin providing employment opportunities for our veterans.\n  Ultimately, Veterans Day is an opportunity for all of us to thank our \nveterans for their service and to renew our commitment to serving and \nhonoring them each and every day of the year. A true marker of our \nNation's worth is our willingness to serve those who have served us. As \nwe continue to wind down our commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan after \na decade of war, we need to gear up our commitment to our veterans. Our \nveterans deserve every possible tool we can provide to help ease their \ntransition to civilian life. I am committed to making sure that our \nveterans receive the services and benefits they earned and the support \nthey were promised and deserve. The United States is the strongest \nNation in the world because of our veterans, and we owe them and their \nfamilies our gratitude and our respect.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, Veterans Day 2013 gives us an opportunity \nto set aside our day-to-day worries and celebrate the men and women who \nhave served in the United States Armed Forces. It is a national day of \nrecognition and gratitude for those who have bravely served and fought \nto defend the freedoms that make the United States a beacon of liberty \nto the world.\n  I am heartened each year by the pride that Mississippians have for \nour Armed Forces, and their appreciation for the sacrifices made by \nloved ones on behalf of our Nation. The ceremonies, parades and \nprograms taking place this year will reflect the admiration we share \nfor our veterans. It is gratifying to see the deep respect that the \npeople of my State have for those who have served, from the first \nMississippians who took up arms to defend this land to those currently \ndeployed around the world.\n  Today, the new generation of all-volunteer veterans returning from \nmore than a decade of sustained combat operations reminds us of our \nsacred obligations to all our veterans and their families. We must \ndedicate ourselves to meeting those commitments. Doing so will make us \na stronger Nation.\n  I appreciate that on Veterans Day the world will witness an American \npeople united in its appreciation of the men and women who have served \nand fought for our republic.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Fiscal Year 2014 Appropriations\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to \nassociate myself with the remarks of the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Mikulski, earlier this week. She has really been an \nextraordinary leader for many years in this Congress. She is truly an \nexpert appropriator. We could have no better person trying to bring \nthis body together--Democrats and Republicans--in my mind than Senator \nMikulski. She is trying to get our appropriations bills through the \nprocess--which is so important for the country, not just for our \nagencies and our departments, as\n\n[[Page S7922]]\n\nthe Presiding Officer knows, as a Senator from Massachusetts with \nthousands in his State and millions of private contractors and \nnonprofit organizations, not the least of which is one my favorites, \nthe Catholic Church, which delivers so many social services to the \npeople of our State and Nation.\n  It is very hard for anyone to plan anything when the Federal budget \nis in such disarray. If there is anyone that can figure this out, it is \nSenator Mikulski. So as one of her subcommittee chairs, I want to be \nhere to support her work. I am the chair of the Homeland Security \nSubcommittee, and I add my voice to how important it is for us over \nthese next few weeks to get a budget resolution done.\n  Senator Murray has passed a budget on this side. After the \nrecklessness of a government shutdown, finally everyone has come to \ntheir senses, and we are now in conference with the Budget Committee. \nWe have to get that budget number down so that once we agree on what \nthe top-line spending is, the budget for the country, we can then go \nabout building the 12 bills that actually run the Department of \nDefense, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of \nEducation, and the others.\n  The important reason for Congress to adopt a budget resolution would \nbe for us to provide some stability--not just for the next year but the \nnext 2 years, and not only for stability to our agencies but to our \nmany private sector partners, so that we can give some idea of what the \noutlook for spending and investing is going to be by the Federal \nGovernment. It is very important for our overall economic strength. We \ncannot afford another government shutdown which puts our economic \nviability at risk and denies assistance to millions of Americans.\n  In my State, I was trying to figure out a way to describe the cost of \nthe shutdown--reckless, and it should have been avoided, and it was \nnot. So I asked, what are some of the things that cost about $92 \nmillion in Louisiana? One of the things I found out is that the New \nOrleans Saints payroll is $70 million a year. That would be like \ntelling the Saints we are not paying you for one whole year. We would \nnever do that in New Orleans. But when we think about not paying the \nsalaries of the players and then the effect that would have on the \nwhole operation, the whole organization, the city itself, the games, we \ncan see the ripple effect; and that was just the impact to Louisiana. \nThe impact to the Nation was extraordinary. We have to avoid it at all \ncosts.\n  One of the missions of the Appropriations Committee is to make sure \nthe Federal Government continues to operate on behalf of the people, \nthe taxpayers we serve, and that we invest in their future, in their \nopportunities to strengthen families and grow businesses. They need a \nbudget that they can count on just like we do. When the Federal \nGovernment is not functioning under normal order and getting our \nbudgets, our appropriations bills, it really does wreak havoc in many \ncommunities throughout our country. We need to pass our 12 \nappropriations bills that set priorities and invest in our future.\n  If we are not able to get to an agreement on the budget and to set \ntop lines for all of our appropriations bills, we will basically punt \nto a continuing resolution--CR--which I think Senator Durbin said is \nlike running your business for 2014 based on your checkbook receipts \nfrom 2013. Why would any smart businessperson do that? No one would run \na family budget or business operation using last year's stubs from the \ncheckbook. We want to pay for this year coming up. We want to budget \nfor the future.\n  Anytime we can't pass an appropriations bill and we punt to a \ncontinuing resolution, it is like putting the country on autopilot set \nfor last year's weather, not what is coming ahead for next year. It \nreally is a waste of money. It wastes taxpayer money.\n  So I am hoping that cool heads can prevail and we can get a budget \nnumber. It is going to take some additional revenues put on the table, \nas well as some smart cuts and reductions, balancing between the Murray \npriorities and the Ryan priorities. Then we can be given our numbers to \nbuild the Homeland Security budget. That is what I want to talk about \nnow just briefly.\n  Everyone knows how important it is to keep the homeland security of \nthis country intact. We have done a very fine job. It has been \nexpensive. This budget has gone from zero to its current level of $42 \nbillion post-9/11, in the last 12 years, but it has been an investment \nworth making. We have a lot of threats against our country every day \nfrom border intrusions, to cyber security threats, to explosions, as \nthe Presiding Officer knows so well, with the Boston Marathon, which \nfrightened and terrorized an entire community and city. So there are \nlots of challenges. Throwing money at the problem isn't going to fix \nthem all, but not having enough money to invest will ensure \nvulnerabilities which we cannot allow.\n  When a homemade explosive device wreaked havoc at the Boston \nMarathon, we saw how critical it was that law enforcement and first \nresponders had proper training and equipment. That training and \nequipment is funded through the Homeland Security bill. We have given \nrobust grants over the years. We want to continue to be able to do \nthat. However, if we don't get to a budget, if we don't get to an \nagreement, grant funding would be reduced to the lowest level since it \nwas formed 10 years ago. I don't think we want to go back to pre-9/11 \ninvestments. This is a new world. It is a dangerous world. The threats \nare evolving, as we saw play out in Boston. We need to be ready for the \nnext attack, and we won't be if we can't get a budget agreement.\n  Our cyber networks are under constant attack. There are 6 million \nprobes on U.S. networks alone. Among the attackers we know are 140 \nforeign spy organizations. One example: The Syrian Electronic Army \ndefaced the Marine Corps Web site and hacked into numerous print media \nWeb sites. A recent Annual Report to Congress from the U.S. Secretary \nof Defense documents that China is using its network exploitation \ncapability to support intelligence collections--of course, that is \nunderstandable--but hacking into some of our manufacturing and private \nsector databases to steal U.S. trade and manufacturing secrets. We know \nthis. It has been put into the record before, but it is worth \nrepeating.\n  Also this year, in the wake of serious chemical plant incidents in \nWest Texas and Ascension Parish in Louisiana, we are reminded that \npeople live around chemical plants and industrial sites that are very \ndangerous. Lots is done to keep them safe, but if that perimeter was \never breached by people who had intentions other than to work there and \nproduce legal products, it could be a disaster. That is ongoing. It is \na big country. It is an open country. We have partnerships to build in \nthe private sector, and in large measure that is part of what our \nbudget does. Last week, a Transportation Security officer lost his \nlife, and two others were shot in the line of duty at the Los Angeles \nairport.\n\n  So these attacks are real. This budget does what it can with limited \nresources. We try to be strategic. We try to be as efficient as we can \nto make sure that we keep our hundreds of airports, land ports, and \nwater ports safe for people to move, for manufacturing and trade, and \nfor our economy to advance. It is a big job. It takes a lot of money to \ndo that, and it takes cooperation. I sure hope in the next couple of \nweeks we can find it.\n  We continue to face threats of weapons of mass destruction. Dirty \nbombs being detonated in one of our cities or ports is an ongoing \nworry. A radiological attack would incite not just harm but mass panic \nand shut down transportation systems. We just cannot afford not to have \na Department of Homeland Security budget that is looking to the future. \nAs these threats evolve, they are ever changing. People say: I just \nbought a cell phone. Do I have to buy another one? The technology is \nchanging so fast, it is hard for people to keep up. I just got a laptop \nlast year. I need to buy another one. The technology is changing. In \nthe same sense, threats are evolving. We can't budget for what happened \n2 years ago. We need to budget for the future, and if we can't get this \nbudget worked out, if we can't get our appropriations numbers, we will \neither be in a continuing resolution--which is basically funding what \nhappened in the past, which makes no sense and wastes taxpayer money--\nor we will be short-changing our constituents.\n\n[[Page S7923]]\n\n  For 4 years in a row the Department of Homeland Security has had to \ntighten its belt. Everyone has. We have been willing to do that. We \nhave operated at reduced funding. But the impact of the sequester--\nwhich is really a blunt instrument that cuts funding in a not very \nsmart way. They are automatic cuts that were never intended, that were \nnever designed to run the government. They were really designed to \nmotivate us to do a better job of getting to the budget. That seems not \nto be working. As a result, these automatic cuts that are blunt, that \nare harsh, and that really are not smart are happening to all of our \nagencies, defense and nondefense alike. It is time to get rid of that \ninefficient way of operating and go to a more strategic, forward-\nleaning planning budget process.\n  I just want to mention an agency that I am very supportive of, the \nCoast Guard, not only because we build many of the boats in Louisiana \nbut because so many of our people--and Massachusetts as well--are \nliterally saved every year by the Coast Guard. We have lots of water, \nlots of lakes, lots of important work going on with offshore oil and \ngas drilling, and we are intercepting drugs that come into the United \nStates. The Coast Guard is on the front line. They are operating their \nsurface and air assets at 25 percent below planned levels because of \nsequestration--not smart cuts. It has resulted in a 30-percent \nreduction of drug seizures--people are not happy to hear this; I am not \nhappy to say it--and an 11-percent reduction in the interdiction of \nundocumented migrants.\n  Under a yearlong CR, Customs and Border Protection would not be able \nto hire any new officers for our air, land, and sea ports of entry. \nThis is bad news for travel and trade. The Presiding Officer knows, as \npeople come into America they ask: Why do we have to wait so long in \nline? We just came here to do business. We have to get to New York, \nChicago, Boston, Louisiana, California, and to other places where \npeople come to do international business.\n  We can't shift assets from the past to the front line with a \nsequester. We can only do it with a rational budget that will help \ncities such as New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago, Dallas, New \nOrleans and Miami to grow. This is important to business. It is \nimportant to the Chamber of Commerce.\n  So I urge my colleagues, let us work very hard together in a \nbipartisan way to come to some agreement on our budget, so that we can \nhave direction as appropriators to design bills--whether it is for the \nDepartment of Education, the Department of Agriculture, the Department \nof Homeland Security, the Department of Commerce--to fashion budgets \nthat meet future needs, that are not funding tired past priorities but \nare funding investing in the real future and real-time needs, present \nand future, of our citizens and of the great country that we believe in \nand want to see get stronger.\n  Under a year-long CR, DHS would not be able to implement safeguards \nto prevent unauthorized release of classified information. \nVulnerabilities in the existing system were highlighted in the \nWikileaks releases and the more recent disclosures by Edward Snowden. \nThere was no funding in fiscal year 2013 to stop this type of activity \nso DHS's classified data will not be adequately protected without \nfiscal year 2014 funding.\n  Critical infrastructure protection efforts would be hindered. For \nexample, without the $34 million above the fiscal year 2013 sequester \nlevel, inspections of chemical plants to prevent weaponization by \nterrorists will be delayed. Funding to better coordinate Federal \nchemical programs in the wake of the West, Texas facility explosion \nwill not be provided. Increases to prevent catastrophic impacts to \ncritical infrastructure during manmade or natural disasters will be \neliminated.\n  Because of these impacts, it is critical that we conference our \nfiscal year 2014 Senate bills with our House counterparts so that we \ncan address the weaknesses that continuing to operate at sequestration \nlevels would entail. A conference would also permit a necessary delay \nto flood insurance rate increases for properties that were formerly \ngrandfathered into affordable rates since the House and Senate Homeland \nSecurity bills contain identical language on this issue. This is one \nsmall step in a larger effort I have been working on to fix flood \ninsurance so that it is affordable, accessible and self-sustainable. \nTime and time again, Senators have heard from their constituents about \nthe skyrocketing increases in flood insurance rates. Many homeowners \nthroughout the United States will see their rates rise to unaffordable \nlevels. For example, up to 2.9 million policies nationwide could see \ntheir previously grandfathered rates become absolutely unaffordable. \nOne resident in my State of Louisiana could see rates increase from \n$633 to over $20,000 per year. That makes homeownership unachievable \nfor many Americans and traps others in houses that they cannot sell.\n  We must get our work done. We need to agree on a budget for fiscal \nyear 2014. Then we need to finalize our fiscal year 2014 bills so that \nour agencies have the appropriate funding for their critical missions--\ninstead of lurching from one funding crisis to the next. This is a hard \ntask but one I believe that is achievable. This is exactly what we were \nelected to do.\n  I thank Senator Mikulski for her leadership.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner).

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a wonderful man, \nIvey Lee Armstrong, Sr., who died last month. He was just 62. He worked \nfor nearly 30 years cooking and preparing delicious food in the Senate \nCarryout. The entire Senate community will miss him dearly.\n  Many of our constituents may not appreciate that the Senate truly is \na community. Our partisan or regional differences of opinion are made \npublic on C-SPAN2, in the newspapers, and on the campaign trail. But \nhere, where we work day in and day out, we are surrounded by thousands \nof hardworking and dedicated people who mostly toil in anonymity. They \nare the fabric of the community here. They are the ones who keep the \nSenate functioning. We have our own staff, and the committees have \nstaff, and leadership has staff, and there are the floor and cloakroom \nstaffs and the Parliamentarian and Senate legislative counsel and the \nBill Clerk and the Senate reporters, and so on. But we also have \nCapitol Police, who protect all of us and the thousands of people who \nvisit the Capitol campus daily. We have plumbers and electricians and \ncarpenters and painters. We have people who man the elevators and the \nsubways and help guide the public through the buildings and up into the \nGalleries. And we have people who work in the cafeterias, including the \nSenate Carryout in the basement of this building.\n  I eat lunch at the Senate Carryout frequently because it is \nconvenient and because the food is excellent. It is really home \ncooking. And I always enjoyed catching up with ``Mr. Ivey,'' as \neveryone knew him. But it wasn't just his culinary skills that we will \nmiss. Mr. Ivey was a fine gentleman. He was unfailingly cheerful and \npolite and he made everyone feel at home.\n  Meredith Shiner and Niels Lesniewski wrote a nice article about Mr. \nIvey in Roll Call, noting that he was often the first person at work in \nthe morning and the last one to leave when the Senate Carryout finally \nclosed for the night. They also noted that he was an Army and Army \nNational Guard veteran who earned the National Defense Service Medal, a \nGood Conduct Medal, and M16 Sharpshooter awards. I am proud to say he \nwas a constituent and there will be a memorial service for him tomorrow \nat From the Heart Church of Ministries in Suitland.\n  Mr. Ivey wasn't just devoted to his country, to the Senate, and to \nhis job, he was devoted to his family and to his faith. According to \nthe Roll Call article, Mr. Ivey re-enlisted so that he could get the \nhealth care coverage needed for a sick daughter. It is a big family--8 \nsiblings, 4 children, 10 grandchildren, and 4 great-grandchildren, \namong others. I want to send my deepest condolences to his family and \nfriends and coworkers. The Senate community has lost one of its finest \nand kindest members. We will miss his cooking but, more important, we \nwill miss his good cheer, his demeanor, and his friendship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/07/senate-section/article/S7924-3", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TAIWAN'S NATIONAL DAY\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, Sergeant Lawrence A. Roukey, a native of \nMaine, was honored today for his exceptional service and sacrifice by \nthe Defense Intelligence Agency, DIA, in a ceremony at DIA \nHeadquarters. SGT Roukey was among four servicemembers honored and \ninducted into the DIA Patriots' Memorial located in the lobby at DIA \nHeadquarters on Joint Base Bolling Anacostia in Washington, DC. The DIA \nPatriots' Memorial honors DIA employees who died in service to the \nUnited States in support of DIA's mission.\n  As a recipient of the Bronze Star Medal and the Purple Heart, \nSergeant Roukey has previously been recognized for emulating the \nhighest values of selflessness, dedication, and courage. Let me \nillustrate how DIA described Sergeant Roukey's heroism and outstanding \ncontribution on behalf of our country and why the agency is honoring \nhim today. A member of the U.S. Army Reserve, Sergeant Roukey \nvolunteered to serve during Operation Iraqi Freedom as a member of the \nsecurity detail for the Iraq Survey Group mobile collection team that \nwas conducting a critical field inspection in an anticoalition forces \narea. Under dangerous conditions, Sergeant Roukey and his squad mate \nprovided protective security for personnel charged with inspecting a \nsuspected weapons of mass destruction facility in Baghdad on April 26, \n2004. Both soldiers lost their lives when a massive explosion occurred \nat the facility being inspected.\n  Prior to rejoining the military as an Army Reservist in Maine, \nSergeant Roukey served in the U.S. Army infantry in South Korea and \nEgypt. He was a respected teammate in the Reserves and at the Portland \nPost Office, where he worked as a civilian, and he enjoyed hiking and \nsharing stories about his family.\n  It is fitting for the DIA and for all of us to honor Sergeant Roukey \nso close to Veterans Day, as well as all of the men and women who have \nsacrificed so much in defense of America and American values, including \nour military intelligence professionals. Prior to today's ceremony, the \nmemorial at DIA honored 21 individuals for their ultimate sacrifice. \nNow the memorial honors 25 individuals. Today we commemorate Sergeant \nRoukey and the other servicemembers honored with him, as well as all of \nthose who have served under the flag of the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/07/senate-section/article/S7924-5", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7924-S7925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             REMEMBERING MASTER SERGEANT MICHAEL LANDSBERRY\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor one of Nevada's own \nveterans, MSgt Michael Landsberry, who died a hero's death in Sparks, \nNV, on October 21, 2013. After spotting a student with a gun at Sparks \nMiddle\n\n[[Page S7925]]\n\nSchool, Master Sergeant Landsberry moved directly into harm's way to \nprotect his students and others from danger. He was fatally shot. This \npatriot leaves behind a legacy of self-sacrifice and service to his \ncountry and community.\n  Master Sergeant Landsberry was an Alabama native, a graduate of \nMcQueen High School, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, a University of \nNevada Reno alumnus, and a decorated master sergeant Nevada Guard \nairman. In 2001, Master Sergeant Landsberry enlisted in the Nevada Air \nNational Guard and subsequently began working for the Washoe County \nSchool District. He began his teaching career at Trainer Middle School, \nwhere he spent 4 years teaching history, math, and science. In 2006, he \nstarted teaching math at Sparks Middle School. Throughout his tenure as \na teacher, Master Sergeant Landsberry served as a coach in his \ncommunity for middle school basketball, cross country, track, and \nvolleyball, as well as high school soccer. He was a passionate teacher, \ncoach, and mentor who touched the lives of his students and those in \nthe community each and every day.\n  In 2006, Master Sergeant Landsberry deployed to Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, \nwhere he performed duties as an airlift validator for the Central \nCommand Deployment and Distribution Center. He deployed again in 2011 \nto Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan, executing air transportation \nfunctions for the 455th Expeditionary Aerial Port Squadron. Throughout \nhis career, Master Sergeant Landsberry was extensively decorated, \nsignifying his strong work ethic and commitment to service.\n  Today, I also want to recognize and express my gratitude to Master \nSergeant Landsberry's family. The sacrifices of our servicemembers and \ntheir families are debts that can never fully be repaid. My thoughts \nand prayers continue to go out to his wife, Sharon, and his two \ndaughters, Alisa and Andrea. This tragedy is one that all of us \nstruggle to understand, but we will continue to remember Master \nSergeant Landsberry as a great and honorable man and father. Today, I \nask my colleagues to join me in remembering the life of a courageous \npatriot whose act of heroism cost him his life but saved many more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/07/senate-section/article/S7925-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                GREATER NEW BRITAIN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE\n\n Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \n100th anniversary of the Greater New Britain Chamber of Commerce.\n  Founded in 1913, the Greater New Britain Chamber of Commerce has been \nthe business voice of New Britain, CT, for 100 years. Throughout its \nexistence, the Chamber has tirelessly encouraged the growth and success \nof the manufacturing, medical, and, more recently, high-tech sectors of \nthe local economy. It has provided area businesses with numerous \nopportunities to market themselves, increase their customer base, \nnetwork with prospective business partners, cut costs, and share best \npractices. As New Britain's population growth soared during the first \nhalf of the 20th century, the Chamber also actively embraced diversity, \nhelping to ensure that immigrant entrepreneurs had the necessary \nsupport and resources to open countless new businesses throughout the \ncity.\n  New Britain, CT, has had a long and storied industrial history. By \n1913, New Britain manufacturers were producing more than 300 kinds of \nproducts, and the community had become known as the ``The Hardware \nCity.'' For the past 100 years, the Greater New Britain Chamber of \nCommerce has helped to build upon that proud industrial legacy. As a \nresult, in reflection of its century-long dedication to the businesses \nof New Britain and the region, I am proud to honor the 100-year \nanniversary of the Greater New Britain Chamber of Commerce, its \ncommitment to serving its member companies, and the important role it \nhas played advancing the welfare of the community at large.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/07/senate-section/article/S7925-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WORLD WAR II VETERANS VISIT\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to \nHonor Flight South Alabama, a truly great branch of a great \norganization which is dedicated to bringing our World War II veterans \nto their memorial in Washington, DC.\n  Honor Flight South Alabama has brought over 1,000 veterans and their \ncompanions to the World War II Memorial created in their honor and \nlocated in Washington, DC. The World War II Memorial honors the 16 \nmillion veterans who served in the Armed Forces of the United States, \nthe more than 400,000 who died, and all who supported the war effort \nfrom home.\n  They are truly a remarkable breed of patriots. They endured and \nsurvived the biggest war in the history of the world, and deserve such \na great memorial in their honor. This Nation owes a debt of gratitude \nfor the sacrifices of these Americans, who left their families and \nlives behind to go ``fight the good fight.''\n  The veterans I have spoken to are so positive and enjoy the visit so \nmuch. It is remarkable. To be recognized this way has meant so much to \nthem. I have taken great pleasure in having the chance to share in the \nfellowship of these veterans.\n  As in any great organization, there are many wonderful leaders who \nshould be recognized. I wish to take a moment to appreciate a few of \nthe directors of Honor Flight South Alabama.\n  Ms. Margaret Coley, the Director of Volunteer Activities and School \nSupport Systems, had the responsibility of the in-flight mail call \nprogram and Welcome Home Ticker Tape parade at Mobile Airport.\n  COL Pat Downing, the Director of Guardian Training, was charged with \nthe most responsible position on the team, that of presenting an in-\ndepth safety training program to all guardians, thereby allaying any \nfear on the part of the families in releasing their loved ones for \nflight day.\n  Ms. Ann Eubanks, the director of the Medical Support Staff for \nSpringhill Hospital, who was in charge of coordination of comprehensive \nmedical support for our WWII veterans.\n  Ms. Tina McGrath, the director of Administration, who organized and \ndocumented all of the administrative and financial information for the \nHonor Flight Program.\n  COL John New, the director of Security, who organized all of the \nsecurity arrangements between Mobile Regional and Washington Reagan \nairports and served as the liaison with the National Park Service for \nall memorials.\n  CDR Pete Riehm, the director of Operations, who designed, organized, \nand maintained order for every phase of Honor Flight South Alabama \nactivities.\n  Finally, Dr. Barry L. Booth, the director of the Veteran-Guardian \nProgram, who coordinated the assignment of all veterans and guardians \nand assisted in fund-raising activities.\n  Without these patriotic men and women stepping up to organize this \nwonderful program, many of the WWII veterans in the region would not \nhave had the opportunity to visit their capital and see the memorial \nthey so richly deserve. I am grateful to all of those who contributed \nto the Honor Flight programs throughout the country and to those \nveterans who fought to preserve the freedoms we enjoy today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/07/senate-section/article/S7925-3", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7925-S7926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOHN BENJAMIN\n\n Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, one of the great \nnatural treasures of my State, and of our Nation, is Carlsbad Caverns \nNational Park. Underneath the Guadalupe Mountains, in southeastern New \nMexico, lies one of the most spectacular caverns in the world. Will \nRogers famously called it ``the Grand Canyon with a roof on it.''\n  Since 2004, the park has been well served by Superintendent John \nBenjamin. I rise today to congratulate John on his retirement after 45 \nyears with the National Park Service.\n  John's tenure with the Park Service has been a remarkable journey, \nand he has served with distinction every step of the way. He graduated \nfrom Syracuse University with a bachelor's degree in resource \nmanagement and a master's degree in forestry. He then began his career \nat NPS in 1968 as a park naturalist at Dinosaur National Monument in \nColorado and Utah.\n  For over four decades, John has been an exemplary public servant at \nAmerica's greatest wilderness and recreation\n\n[[Page S7926]]\n\nareas, including Lake Mead, Glacier National Park, Glen Canyon, the \nEverglades National Park, and the Grand Canyon. He served as deputy \nsuperintendent at Boston National Historical Park and Boston African \nAmerican National Historic Site, and as superintendent of Lake Meredith \nNational Recreation Area, prior to his time at Carlsbad Caverns.\n  Throughout his career, John has reflected that he enjoyed every job \nhe had and particularly his role as a mentor to others who would go on \nto serve the Park Service and the American people with the same \ndedication that he has demonstrated for so many years.\n  In his book, The Quiet Crisis, my dad wrote the following:\n\n       Each generation has its own rendezvous with the land, for \n     despite our fee titles and claims of ownership, we are all \n     brief tenants on this planet. By choice, or by default, we \n     will carve out a land legacy for our heirs. We can misuse the \n     land and diminish the usefulness of resources, or we can \n     create a world in which physical affluence and affluence of \n     the spirit go hand in hand.\n\n  Public servants like John Benjamin make sure that our ``rendezvous \nwith the land'' is a noble one and that our national treasures will be \nsafeguarded for generations to come. John can look back on a career of \ngreat accomplishment and service. He exemplifies a legacy of \nprofessionalism and commitment that will continue to inspire others. I \nwish him and his wife, Deborah, much happiness in all their future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/07/senate-section/article/S7926-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/07/senate-section/article/S7926-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/07/senate-section/article/S7926-3", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n       S. 1661.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Veterans of the Armed Forces have made tremendous \n     sacrifices in the defense of freedom and liberty.\n       (2) Congress recognizes these great sacrifices and \n     reaffirms America's strong commitment to its veterans.\n       (3) As part of the on-going congressional effort to \n     recognize the sacrifices made by America's veterans, Congress \n     has dramatically increased funding for the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs for veterans health care in the years since \n     September 11, 2001.\n       (4) Part of the funding for the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs for veterans health care is allocated toward \n     community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs).\n       (5) A number of CBOCs are administered by private \n     contractors.\n       (6) CBOCs administered by private contractors operate on a \n     capitated basis.\n       (7) Some current contracts for CBOCs may create an \n     incentive for contractors to enroll as many veterans as \n     possible, without ensuring timely access to high quality \n     health care for such veterans.\n       (8) The top priorities for CBOCs should be to provide \n     quality health care and patient satisfaction for America's \n     veterans.\n       (9) The Department of Veterans Affairs currently tracks the \n     quality of patient care through its Computerized Patient \n     Record System. However, fees paid to contractors are not \n     currently adjusted automatically to reflect the quality of \n     care provided to patients.\n       (10) A pay-for-performance payment model offers a promising \n     approach to health care delivery by aligning the payment of \n     fees to contractors with the achievement of better health \n     outcomes for patients.\n       (11) The Department of Veterans Affairs should begin to \n     emphasize pay-for-performance in its contracts with CBOCs.\n\n     SEC. 3. PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE UNDER DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS \n                   AFFAIRS CONTRACTS WITH COMMUNITY-BASED \n                   OUTPATIENT HEALTH CARE CLINICS.\n\n       (a) Plan Required.--Not later than one year after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs shall submit to Congress a plan to introduce pay-for-\n     performance measures into contracts which compensate \n     contractors of the Department of Veterans Affairs for the \n     provision of health care services through community-based \n     outpatient clinics (CBOCs).\n       (b) Elements.--The plan required by subsection (a) shall \n     include the following:\n       (1) Measures to ensure that contracts of the Department for \n     the provision of health care services through CBOCs begin to \n     utilize pay-for-performance compensation mechanisms for \n     compensating contractors for the provision of such services \n     through such clinics, including mechanisms as follows:\n       (A) To provide incentives for clinics that provide high-\n     quality health care.\n       (B) To provide incentives to better assure patient \n     satisfaction.\n       (C) To impose penalties (including termination of contract) \n     for clinics that provide substandard care.\n       (2) Mechanisms to collect and evaluate data on the outcomes \n     of the services generally provided by CBOCs in order to \n     provide for an assessment of the quality of health care \n     provided by such clinics.\n       (3) Mechanisms to eliminate abuses in the provision of \n     health care services by CBOCs under contracts that continue \n     to utilize capitated-basis compensation mechanisms for \n     compensating contractors.\n       (4) Mechanisms to ensure that veterans are not denied care \n     or face undue delays in receiving care.\n       (c) Implementation.--The Secretary shall commence the \n     implementation of the plan on the date that is 60 days after \n     the date of the submittal of the plan. In implementing the \n     plan, the Secretary may initially carry out one or more pilot \n     programs to assess the feasibility and advisability of \n     mechanisms under the plan.\n       (d) Reports.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act and every 180 days thereafter, the \n     Secretary shall submit to Congress a report setting forth the \n     recommendations of the Secretary as to the feasibility and \n     advisability of utilizing pay-for-performance compensation \n     mechanisms in the provision of health care services by the \n     Department by means in addition to CBOCs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Rockefeller, and \n        Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 1672. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nempower individuals with disabilities to establish their own \nsupplemental needs trusts; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Special \nNeeds Trust Fairness Act with my friends, Senators Grassley, \nRockefeller, and Enzi. Our common-sense bill will correct a fundamental \nflaw that prevents individuals with disabilities from creating their \nown trusts. This is a basic right that should have never been \noverlooked.\n  November is Long-Term Care Awareness Month, when hopefully many \nfamilies will discuss and decide how to best plan for their retirement \nand their future health care needs. Unfortunately,\n\n[[Page S7930]]\n\ncurrent law assumes people with disabilities lack the requisite \ncapacity to create such trusts for their long-term care needs, so these \nindividuals must turn to others to create such a trust. This creates an \nunnecessary and sometimes costly burden on the individual and \nadditional caseloads in our overworked courts.\n  I also am pleased to have the support of the American Association of \nPeople with Disabilities and Easter Seals as well as the National \nAcademy of Elder Law Attorneys, the Academy of Florida Elder Law \nAttorneys, the Academy of Special Needs Planners, and the Florida Joint \nPublic Policy Task Force for the Elderly and Disabled.\n  I urge my colleagues to support me in this legislation so that we can \nfinally correct this flaw.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           American Association of\n\n\n                                     People With Disabilities,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 31, 2013.\n     Hon. Bill Nelson,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nelson and Senator Grassley: I am pleased to \n     support the Special Needs Trust Fairness Act of 2013 (H.R. \n     2123 in the House) on behalf of the American Association of \n     People with Disabilities (AAPD). I commend your bipartisan \n     effort to empower people with disabilities by introducing \n     this legislation. The Special Needs Trust Fairness Act will \n     allow people with disabilities to set up a special needs \n     trust for themselves.\n       AAPD is the nation's largest disability rights \n     organization. We promote equal opportunity, economic power, \n     independent living and political participation for people \n     with disabilities. Our members, including people with \n     disabilities and our family, friends, and supporters, \n     represent a powerful force for change.\n       A special needs trust allows assets to be held in a trust \n     and protects against the risk of complete impoverishment. As \n     you know, due to a glitch in the current law, a capable, \n     competent person with a disability is prohibited from \n     creating her or his own special needs trust. We are in the \n     position of having to ask a parent, grandparent, guardian, or \n     the court to do so for us. This legislation not only \n     eradicates this discrimination against people with \n     disabilities, but also promotes self-sufficiency and \n     independence.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this important issue. AAPD \n     looks forward to working with you on passage of the Special \n     Needs Trust Fairness Act of 2013. Please feel free to contact \n     Colin Schwartz if you have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Henry Claypool,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     Easter Seals,\n\n\n                                     Office of Public Affairs,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 31, 2013.\n     Hon. Bill Nelson,\n     Chairman, Special Committee on Aging, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Nelson:  Easter Seals is pleased to support \n     your efforts to introduce the Special Needs Trust Fairness \n     Act of 2013 in the United States Senate. This legislation \n     would empower individuals with disabilities to help plan and \n     save for their future daily living expenses by allowing them \n     to set up a special needs trust for themselves, which is \n     prevented under current law.\n       Easter Seals is a national nonprofit organization that \n     provides individualized services and supports to help people \n     with disabilities or special needs and their families reach \n     their potential. Through our network of 72 community-based \n     affiliates, including the four that serve the state of \n     Florida, Easter Seals assisted more than 1.4 million \n     individuals and their families last year through community-\n     based services, including medical rehabilitation, employment, \n     child care, adult and senior services, caregiving, and \n     camping and recreation.\n       Easter Seals understands how important access to quality \n     services and long-term supports are for individuals with \n     disabilities. One tool to help ensure individuals with \n     disabilities have access to these essential services and \n     support beyond what is available through the government is \n     through a special needs trust. Currently, a special needs \n     trust can be created for a person with a disability by family \n     members, a guardian or the court. Unfortunately, current law \n     prevents people with disabilities from creating their own \n     special needs trust for their asset, which can later be used \n     to supplement living expenses and care when government \n     benefits alone are insufficient. This legislation would \n     remove this barrier, giving individuals with disabilities \n     direct access to a current tool that can help them live \n     independently and improve their health and well-being.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this important issue. \n     Easter Seals looks forward to working with you following your \n     introduction of the Special Needs Trust Fairness Act of 2013 \n     to help ensure the legislation receives consideration and \n     approval during the 113th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Katy Beh Neas,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n     Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         National Academy of Elder\n\n\n                                          Law Attorneys, Inc.,\n\n                                     Vienna, VA, November 7, 2013.\n     Hon. Bill Nelson,\n     Senate Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nelson: We congratulate you for your \n     leadership in protecting individuals with disabilities from \n     unjust and discriminatory laws and we applaud your \n     introduction of the Special Needs Trust Fairness Act of 2013. \n     As you know, currently under the law, individuals with \n     disabilities who have the requisite mental capacity are \n     prevented from creating their own special needs trusts, which \n     Congress has already authorized. They must have a parent, \n     grandparent, guardian, or the court create their special \n     needs trust even though they have the mental capacity to do \n     it themselves.\n       As elder law attorneys, NAELA members' clients experience \n     this injustice on a regular basis. Not all individuals have a \n     parent, grandparent or guardian who can create their special \n     needs trusts for them, and many of these individuals are \n     forced to petition a court and pay additional fees to have a \n     special needs trust. The Special Needs Trust Fairness Act of \n     2013 will remove the current barriers that prevent an \n     individual with disabilities from creating his or her own \n     special needs trust.\n       NAELA is a professional association consisting of more than \n     4,300 attorneys who advocate for the rights of seniors and \n     people with disabilities. Elder law attorneys are specialized \n     and trained in a variety of areas in the law that address an \n     individual's long-term care needs.\n       NAELA has made your legislation a top priority and stands \n     ready to assist you in securing passage of the Fairness Act \n     and eliminating this unjustified discrimination in the law.\n           Sincerely,\n     Peter G. Wacht, CAE,\n       Executive Director.\n     Howard S. Krooks, CELA, CAP,\n       President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/07/senate-section/article/S7930-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7930-S7931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 289--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT AMBUSH \n MARKETING ADVERSELY AFFECTS THE UNITED STATES OLYMPIC AND PARALYMPIC \n                    TEAMS AND SHOULD BE DISCOURAGED\n\n  Mr. BEGICH (for himself and Mr. Bennet) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation:\n\n                              S.
