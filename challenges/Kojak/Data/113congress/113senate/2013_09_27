Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 12:10 p.m. will be equally divided between the proponents and \nopponents of the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, here we are Mr. President. I guess this is like the \nmovie\n\n[[Page S6972]]\n\n``High Noon.'' The two sides are walking down the street. I just hope, \nlike in the movie ``High Noon,'' the good guys win. In other words, I \nhope reason and judiciousness and a sense of responsibility to the \npeople of this country prevails, and not some knee-jerk reaction to \nwhat a few people in the House of Representatives want to do to our \ngovernment.\n  There seems to be a sense among some Members across the aisle here, \nand certainly among a block of Republicans in the House, that shutting \ndown the Federal Government is no big deal. Well, I suppose if you are \nof an anarchist mind--which I think some of them may be--then you do \nnot want government, you want to create chaos, you want to create \nconfusion.\n  Someone might ask: Why would someone want to create chaos and \nconfusion? I think if you read your history, you will find that most \nauthoritarian governments and most authoritarian movements that are \nbased upon a minority view or a minority support gain their power \nthrough confusion and chaos, by disrupting--disrupting--the public \nbody. I do not care whether it is authoritarian movements of the left \nor the right, that is what they do. They know they cannot gain power \nthrough the normal channels, especially in a democratic government, so, \ntherefore, they do everything they can to skew the way government \noperates.\n  First, you manipulate the district lines for how you elect Members of \nthe House of Representatives so that you have a lot of safe districts \nfor one party. I have to hand it to the Republicans, they were very \nkeen on this for the last 10 years or so, and they focused on redrawing \nthe district boundaries so they would have what we might call \nsinecures, a safe seat.\n  But if you look at the election results of the last election, more \nAmericans voted for Democratic Members of the House than they voted for \nRepublican Members of the House, but the Republicans are in charge of \nthe House. That is because of the way the district lines were drawn \nafter the last census was taken.\n  So that is one way you do it, you skew it that way. And then what \nhappens is you bring in a minority block of tea party-type people to \nthe House of Representatives, and they want to sow more confusion and \nmore chaos because they know that is the only way their views are ever \ngoing to prevail. They will never prevail in the open marketplace of \nideas and debate and discourse among the American people.\n  On what do I base that statement? Look at the last election. A lot of \nwhat the tea party is proposing and what they are now doing in terms of \nfocusing on shutting down the government, much of that was proposed by \ntheir candidate for President--not all of it but a lot--and I think the \nAmerican people soundly rejected that. So the tea party, being \nfrustrated because they cannot get their way electorally or in the open \nmarketplace of ideas and discourse and public debates, now sees their \nonly way to do it is to create confusion and chaos.\n  One might say if they are doing that, certainly the public will turn \nagainst them. Well, I think to a certain degree that is happening. But \nfor the vast majority of Americans out there--who go to work every day \nand work hard, who are raising their families, thinking about where the \nnext paycheck is coming from or whether they are even going to have a \njob; young people getting out of school with mountains of debt, trying \nto get a job, to start a family, perhaps--they are not focusing on the \neveryday activities of what we do around here in Washington. They read \nthe headlines and may see the news or see something on their laptops or \non their iPads or whatever, and what they see is a Congress that is \nmuddled and mixed up and cannot get anything done.\n  You read the polls, and the people blame all of us for this. I think \nthe people in the tea party have seen that, and I think they believe \nthat if they can create more confusion and chaos and disruption of \ngovernment, both sides will be blamed, and out of that they believe \nsomehow they can rise to the top of the heap and infuse the government \nwith their minority views.\n  That is what is happening. It is a small group of willful men and \nwomen, who have a certain ideology about how our country should run and \nwhat we should do, who cannot get their way in the normal, as I say, \ndiscourse and debate and votes either here in the Congress or in the \nbody politic at large. And since they cannot get their way, they are \ngoing to create this confusion and discourse and hope the public will \nbe so mixed up on who is to blame for this that they will blame both \nsides, and perhaps they feel their minority--which is so imbued with \nthis passion of theirs, this ideology, this rigidness of ideology of \ntheirs--that they are the ones who will come out en masse and vote in \nthe next election, other people will be so discouraged they will say: \nOh, a pox on both your houses, I won't vote, and, therefore, that is \nthe path they see to taking over government.\n  It is dangerous. It is very dangerous. I believe we are at one of the \nmost dangerous points in our history right now--every bit as dangerous \nas the breakup of the Union before the Civil War. We are at a point \nwhere: Will this Congress allow a small group dedicated--I give them \ncredit for working hard--but a small group of dedicated, ideologically \ndriven individuals to dictate to the Senate and the House what our \ncourse of action is going to be? We cannot give in to that.\n  So I call upon my friends in the Republican Party who are moderates--\nand there a lot of them in my own State, around the country. They are \nconservative, but they are responsible conservatives. They may look at \nDemocrats and say: You want to go too fast one way. We might want to go \na little bit slower that way or maybe we want to go in a slightly \ndifferent direction, so let's get together and work it out and see \nwhich way we go. That is being a responsible conservative or a \nresponsible liberal too, I would say. I call upon them to disabuse \nthemselves of this idea that somehow they have to march in lockstep \nwith this small band of tea party--call them what you will--rightwing \nideologs--you can use whatever adjectives you want--but they must \ndisabuse themselves of the idea that they have to somehow march in \nlockstep with them.\n  I keep reading the papers that somehow the Speaker of the House is \ntrying to find a way out of this. Well, I do not know John Boehner real \npersonally, but he was on the Education and Labor Committee all the \ntime I was on the committee here. We always went to conference. We \nworked things out in a reasonable manner.\n  There is a way forward--there is a way forward--and that is for the \nSpeaker basically to take what we do here. What we are about to pass \ntoday is a stripped-down version of a continuing resolution that will \nkeep the government running until November 15. But it knocks out all \nthat other junk the House put in about defunding ObamaCare and all this \nother stuff they put in there. It is just a straightforward: Let's keep \nthe government running until November 15.\n  The compromise we made on our part was to give up on our budget line. \nWe had a certain level that we wanted to fund the government. The \nRepublicans had a lower level. So we accepted the lower level. We \naccepted that lower level. In turn, we asked, rather than going until \nDecember 15, go to November 15 on this continuing resolution funding \nthe government.\n  So we accepted the lower level--hard for some of us to swallow. I \ndidn't believe in that lower level. I thought it should be higher so we \ncould adequately fund things such as education, health care, the \nNational Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, all of the things--transportation infrastructure. But it \nwas a compromise. We took the lower level.\n  We said: Do it until November 15 so we can bring our appropriations \nbills out on the floor, hopefully between now and then, and we can work \non an overall spending package for next year, one that is not just a \ncontinuing resolution that just keeps things going, but maybe we want \nto make some changes--and we do. I know in my committee we want to \nchange some things, hopefully make them work better. So by doing that \nby November 15, then that gives us a month from November 15 until \nChristmas to get it all worked out and hopefully have this package \npassed by Christmas. If we go to December 15, we will not have time to \ndo that. So that is what is before us today.\n\n[[Page S6973]]\n\n  Here is the Speaker's avenue to act responsibly and to let the \nAmerican people know there are responsible Republicans. All he has to \ndo is take the bill we pass here and bring it up in the House and \nencourage some of his more moderate Republicans to support it and get \nthe Democrats to support it and pass it in a bipartisan fashion. \nHowever, if the Speaker wants to just cater to this small band of \nideologs, well then he will take what we pass here, change it around, \nadd this, add that--I hear they have a laundry list--and then send it \nback to us. That is totally irresponsible.\n  There is a path forward. It is the path of responsibility, of being \nresponsible, being judicious, not giving in to a small band of ideologs \nwho want to seed confusion and discord, a small band of ideologs who \nwant to use the power of the minority to do what they can to disrupt \ngovernment in order to get their way.\n  When we were kids, there was always some kid who was playing marbles \nwith you--or whatever it was, playing games--who did not get his way. \nSo they picked up and went home, threw a temper tantrum. Well, for kids \nwho were out playing, as we did, in the fields in small communities, \ntemper tantrums were something they lived with. They did not really do \nmuch harm. But that is not true here in the Congress. We cannot afford \nthe temper tantrums of a few ideologs.\n  There is more I could say about what they want to do and how they \nwant to nullify laws by doing this. We have the Affordable Care Act \nthat we passed here. It is being implemented. There has been a lot \nwritten about the exchanges starting next week. It is the law of the \nland and has been upheld by the Supreme Court. Yet a small band, a \nsmall group, a few on this side--not everyone on the Republican side--\nand some in the House want to nullify that law not through votes, they \nwant to nullify it by shutting down the government or by not paying our \nbills when the debt ceiling comes and defaulting on our debt. \nNullification of a law through that type of action--that is sort of \nlike picking up your marbles and going home. But when you are a kid, no \none really gets hurt. But who gets hurt from this? The American people.\n  I think there are a lot of people who say that shutting down the \ngovernment is no big deal. It is a big deal. OMB recently estimated \nthat in 1996 when the government shut down, it cost in today's dollars \n$2.1 billion just because of a few days of a shutdown of government. So \nthose who say they are fiscal conservatives have to think about that, \nwhat the cost would be to the American people of shutting it down.\n  I happen to be privileged to chair the appropriations committee that \nfunds Head Start Programs, early childhood development programs, \nelementary education, Pell grants, student loans, and medical research. \nI can tell you that if the government shuts down, a lot of people are \ngoing to get hurt.\n  Twenty-two Head Start providers will be delayed. About 18,000 kids \nwill be denied Head Start Programs. The National Institutes of Health \nwill not be able to fund new biomedical research projects. Social \nSecurity offices will close. Every day in this country, 445,000 people \nwill call their Social Security office. They have a missing check. They \nhave something wrong. They need some help. With the government shut \ndown, no one will be able to call the Social Security office and get \nthat kind of help.\n  I could go on and on. This is not a game. This is not a game. \nHopefully we are not children. Hopefully we are responsible adults. I \nbelieve what we are doing today is responsible, in passing a stripped-\ndown continuing resolution to keep the government going until November \n15. I understand we will have the votes to do that. I just hope the \nHouse of Representatives will be responsible and forget about kid's \ngames like picking up your marbles and going home or throwing a temper \ntantrum or shutting down the government because you cannot get your \nway. This is a dangerous time. I just hope the Members of this body, \nthe Senate, and the House of Representatives, in which I was privileged \nto serve for 10 years, will rise to the occasion and let the American \npeople know we are going to act responsibly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes of proponent time to \nSenator Cornyn.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I understand there \nhas been time allocated to proponents and opponents, but there is no \nbreakdown for individual speakers in terms of how much time is \nallocated?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, ObamaCare is more unpopular today than \nwhen it was passed in 2010. I know the proponents of ObamaCare--my \nDemocratic friends who voted for it in a party-line vote--had hoped it \nwould meet their expectations and the promises the President and other \npeople made about how it would be implemented and what its impact would \nbe on our health care system.\n  I am amazed, though, that our colleagues say: You know, it is the law \nof the land. We cannot change it.\n  Well, that is completely contrary to our constitutional system where \nthe very legitimacy of our laws depends on the consent of the governed. \nOf course it is within the power of Congress to change the law. That is \nwhat we do when it turns out the law does not work as those who hoped \nit would or it, unfortunately, meets the expectations of those skeptics \nwho thought it would never work. So it is within our power to change \nthis law.\n  We will be voting today on a very important provision that will give \nus an opportunity to start over and to address the failures of \nObamaCare that even some of its most ardent advocates had hoped it \nwould meet. So today we will vote on a number of matters, including a \ncloture vote on the underlying bill. I will be voting yes on cloture \nbecause I do not understand how I can otherwise vote on a matter I want \nto see passed. In other words, we will vote to proceed to a bill that \ndefunds ObamaCare. I believe we should defund ObamaCare. Indeed, just \nas we did on the motion to proceed--we had 100 Senators vote for \ncloture on the motion to proceed--I do not know why we would not vote \nto proceed on the cloture vote on the underlying bill--especially those \nof us who believe we ought to go ahead and defund ObamaCare today in \nlight of experience between 2010 and 2013 which shows it has not lived \nup to expectations and promises.\n  There are some people across America who are so upset with \nObamaCare--and I understand their frustration--that they say we ought \nto shut down the Federal Government. Our colleague Senator Coburn asked \nthe Congressional Research Service to look at what would happen to \nObamaCare if the government shut down for some reason. Their conclusion \nis that ObamaCare would continue to be funded even though the \ngovernment was shut down because there are alternate sources of revenue \nthat could be used to keep it going.\n  So I say to my friends who say we ought to shut the government down \nto get rid of ObamaCare that it will not work. Even if they hoped it \nwould work, it will not work. Of course, we can imagine the disruptions \nto our seniors, military, and to our economy, which is bouncing along \nthe bottom with slow growth and high unemployment, and what that \ndisruption might mean there.\n  So I think the real vote today is going to be on the vote the \nmajority leader will offer to strip out the defunding language. I hope \nwe have five Democrats--perhaps those who hoped in 2010 that ObamaCare \nwould actually work but will, in light of subsequent experience, \nreconsider and say: Maybe we ought to start over again because \nObamaCare has not worked. Maybe it is not the best way to make health \ncare policy, to have a bill that was passed strictly on a party-line \nvote.\n  No one is invested in trying to actually make sure it will work, such \nas when Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan fixed Social Security and secured \nit for subsequent generations. Unfortunately, we have seen the \nPresident of the United States govern by waiver, exception, and \nexemption when it comes to implementing ObamaCare. We have learned that \nObamaCare is not ready for prime time even though the exchanges are \nsupposed to go into effect next Tuesday.\n  Why are the American people so upset with ObamaCare? Why are there\n\n[[Page S6974]]\n\nsome people who are so upset that they are willing to see the \ngovernment shut down in order to get rid of it and change it? Well, it \nis simple. When the President was promoting his health care overhaul in \n2009 and 2010, he repeatedly assured the American people: If you like \nwhat you have, you can keep it. If you like your doctor, you do not \nhave to worry, nothing will change.\n  He made that promise time and time again. He was always 100 percent \nunequivocal. Here is a direct quote from the President's speech in \nJanuary of 2009 before the American Medical Association. He said:\n\n       If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your \n     doctor. Period. If you like your health-care plan, you will \n     be able to keep your health-care plan. Period. No one will \n     take it away. No matter what.\n\n  That is the President of the United States. When the President made \nthose remarks 4 years ago, many Americans believed him or at least gave \nhim the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, we now know ObamaCare was \nsold to the American people under false pretenses. The Congressional \nBudget Office has projected that ObamaCare will cause millions of \nAmericans to lose their existing health care coverage.\n  Employers large and small have already announced that because of \nObamaCare they are ending their employer-provided coverage for their \nemployees and some of their retirees. In a front-page story, even the \nNew York Times admits that because of ObamaCare, ``many insurers are \nsignificantly limiting the number of doctors and hospitals available to \nconsumers.'' So if you like your doctor, if you like your hospital, you \nwill not necessarily be able to keep them. For that matter, earlier \nthis year one of my constituents sent me a letter she got from her \ninsurance company informing her that because of ObamaCare the coverage \nshe had would be terminated by the end of 2013.\n  That letter said:\n\n       Never have we experienced the uncertainty and immense \n     challenges that confront the insurance industry during this \n     time of health-care reform.\n\n  It is now painfully clear that many people who do wish to keep their \nexisting coverage and wish to keep their current doctors will not be \nable to do so if this law is implemented.\n  This is why we are seeing some leading Democrats who are saying maybe \nwe ought to reconsider in the light of experience since the time we \nvoted to pass ObamaCare in 2009 and 2010.\n  It is also clear that ObamaCare is destroying our economy. Recently, \na group of labor leaders went to the White House to ask for a special \ncarve-out because they said ObamaCare, as implemented, was killing the \n40-hour work week. These are some of the folks who were the biggest \ncheerleaders for ObamaCare at the time it passed, but they have \nrealized, based on subsequent experience, that it is turning full-time \nwork into part-time work so employers can avoid some of the penalties \nand costs.\n  We know it is having a particular impact on some specific types of \nemployment such as restaurants, retailers, hotels, the people who \ndevelop medical devices which save lives and increase lifespan, and it \nis having a negative impact on hospitals as well.\n  For example, the Franciscan Alliance health system recently announced \nthat because of ObamaCare it was eliminating about 125 jobs at two \nhospitals in President Obama's hometown of Chicago.\n  Meanwhile, in a letter to a DC city councilman, the owner of a \npopular area restaurant chain described ObamaCare as: ``the biggest \nmandated cost ever inflicted on restaurateurs . . . in the HISTORY OF \nRESTAURANTS.'' The restaurant owner added: ``We still haven't figured \nout how we are going to pay for that.''\n  Also, as I mentioned a moment ago, because of the tax on medical \ndevices to pay for medical care, medical device manufacturers are \nleaving the United States or they are not hiring new people. Some \nconstituents from Texas came in to see me and said they had an \noperation in Costa Rica. Instead of hiring more people in Texas, they \nare going to be moving that operation to Costa Rica for one reason and \none reason only; that is, to avoid the medical device tax in ObamaCare.\n  We know that because of ObamaCare's impact on the economy, many \ncollege graduates--who advocates celebrate are now able to stay on \ntheir parents' health insurance until 26--those same young men and \nwomen are unable to find jobs because of ObamaCare. We know that its \nimpact on the medical profession is having a dramatic outcome on \npeople's access to health care.\n  It is very important to make a distinction between coverage and \naccess. Just because the government provides Medicare coverage doesn't \nmean you are going to find a doctor to see you. Increasingly, in my \nState and around the country, doctors are saying: We can't afford to \nsee new Medicare and Medicaid patients because of how much the \ngovernment compensates for that service.\n  As a matter of fact in Texas, only about one out of every three \ndoctors who currently see Medicaid patients will accept a new Medicaid \npatient because of the low reimbursement rate. Medicaid is already \nfailing to meet the important needs of the most vulnerable people in \nour country. Because of ObamaCare, States are preparing for a massive \nspike in individual health care premiums and because of ObamaCare \ninsurance carriers are already limiting consumer choice.\n  As many of us warned years ago, ObamaCare affects everyone. It \naffects working families who are happy with their employer-provided \ncoverage. It affects Medicare recipients living on a fixed income. It \naffects Medicaid patients who are already having trouble finding \ndoctors and dentists who will take their insurance. It affects young \npeople who are struggling to pay off their student loan debt, and, yes, \nas I said, it affects small business owners who wish to expand their \nworkforce.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n  It affects medical device companies that produce technology that has \nhelped millions of Americans with disabilities. The false promises of \nObamaCare have been shattered by the harsh realities of ObamaCare. A \nlaw that was supposed to solve some of our biggest health care problems \nin the country has, instead, made those problems even worse.\n  Now we have a second chance. Congress has a second chance as the \nelected representatives of the American people under our constitutional \nsystem of learning from the experience we have had since 2010 when \nCongress passed ObamaCare on a party-line vote, we have a second chance \ntoday to do the right thing, a chance to stop ObamaCare in its tracks, \na chance to reverse the mistakes of 2009 and to allow Congress, \ninstead, to pass real health care reforms that will lower costs, \nimprove access, expand quality insurance coverage to more people.\n  Republicans have said we have an alternative to ObamaCare. Some of \nour colleagues who support ObamaCare said: The only way you can cover \npeople with preexisting conditions is with ObamaCare, a $2.7 trillion \nexpenditure. That is baloney. We all know many States have health risk \npools. If we provided additional funding to those State health risk \npools, people with preexisting conditions could get coverage without \nhaving to embrace the whole behemoth of ObamaCare at a much more \naffordable cost.\n  We are eager to adopt reforms such as equalizing the tax treatment of \nhealth insurance and making health care price and quality information \nmore transparent and accessible so people can actually shop based on \nquality and price--what a concept--also, by letting people buy \ninsurance coverage across State lines, allowing both individuals and \nbusinesses to form risk pools for individual markets, by curbing \nfrivolous medical malpractice lawsuits, using State-based health \ninsurance pools to cover people with preexisting conditions, and to \ngive States more flexibility to improve Medicaid and to bring more \ncompetition to Medicare.\n  Republicans have spent years advocating these policies. Now that we \nknow ObamaCare has failed in its intended purpose, it is time to look \nto these alternatives. We are prepared to defund ObamaCare and to move \nahead with real reform as I described.\n  The only question is how many Democrats are going to learn from the \nevidence since 2010. How many of them\n\n[[Page S6975]]\n\nare going to listen to their constituents and say we can do better than \nthis failed attempt from the Federal Government to take over our health \ncare system and deny people access to the doctors of their choice and \nto keep the insurance coverage they have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes of proponent time to \nSenator Sanders.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Let me begin by saying I think a debate over ObamaCare, \na debate over health care, is good for the Nation. As I think many \nAmericans understand, the United States is the only country in the \nindustrialized world that does not guarantee health care as a right to \nall of our people.\n  Today, before the initiation of ObamaCare, we have 48 million people \nwho have no health insurance. I would tell my good friend from Texas \nthat the State of Texas, I think, ranked first in the country in the \npercentage of their people under 65 who have no health insurance, one \nout of four.\n  George W. Bush was President for 8 years. Where were the ideas about \nhow we provide health care to all of our people. It is not only 48 \nmillion people today who have no health insurance; there are many more \nwho have huge deductibles which prevent them from going to the doctor. \nThey have high copayments. At the end of the day, in this dysfunctional \nhealth care system we have, we are spending almost twice as much per \ncapita on health care as do the people of any other nation, many of \nwhich have better health care outcomes than we do in terms of life \nexpectancy, infant mortality, and the treatment of a number of \ndiseases.\n  In my view, ObamaCare is a step forward, but we have to make \nsignificant improvements. That is a good discussion and debate to have.\n  One thing that is absolutely certain is you do not hold the American \npeople hostage by threatening to shut down the government or, for the \nfirst time in the history of our country, not pay our bills, bringing \nthis country and perhaps the entire world into a major financial \ncrisis. That is what you don't do.\n  ObamaCare was passed with 60 votes in the Senate, it was passed in \nthe House, and it was signed by the President. ObamaCare was challenged \nin the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled it constitutional.\n  There was an election 1 year ago on this very issue, one of the major \nissues in the campaign. The Republican candidate said: Let's defund \nObamaCare. He lost the election. Republicans lost seats in the Senate. \nThey lost seats in the House.\n  This is what democracy is all about. What democracy is not about is a \nhandful of the Members of the House of Representatives, extreme \nrightwing Republicans, saying if we do not get our way, we are prepared \nto punish tens of millions of Americans. Yes, we lost the election; \nyes, we lost seats in the House and the Senate, but we are prepared to \nbring this government down; we are prepared to cause, perhaps, a major \nglobal financial crisis unless we get our way.\n  That is not what the American system is about. That is not what \ndemocracy is about. If we want to debate about how we improve \nObamaCare, that is a good debate. Let's have it. Let's not tell men and \nwomen in the U.S. Armed Forces, who today are putting their lives on \nthe line to defend us, that they are not going to get paid. Let us not \ntell police officers here in Washington and elsewhere they may not get \npaid. Let's not tell working families who take their little kids to \nHead Start so they can then go out to work that program may be killed. \nLet's not tell senior citizens, who are on the Meals on Wheels Program \nwho can't leave their homes and depend upon a meal, let's not punish \nthem because we have a small number of extreme rightwingers who want to \nget their way at the expense of millions and millions of people.\n  Let's have a debate, continue the debate. ObamaCare will provide \nhealth insurance to 20 million more Americans, a good step forward, but \n28 million more remain uninsured.\n  Many of the trade unions are concerned about some provisions, and I \nshare those views. Let's change that, let's improve it. Let us not shut \ndown the U.S. Government and make us look like fools throughout the \nentire world because a handful of rightwing extremists are so \ndetermined to try to destroy this President.\n  Senator Cruz was on the floor the other day. I appreciate anyone--I \nwas on the floor a couple of years ago for 8\\1/2\\ hours, and he was on \nthe floor for 21 hours. That is tough. I respect anyone who can do \nthat. I disagreed with most of what he did say, but he did say one \nthing which I think was right; that is, we need a serious debate about \nfundamental issues.\n  What I believe very strongly is that this debate about ObamaCare is \nkind of small change, nickel and dime, compared to where many of our \nrightwing Republicans wish to go. It is important we have that debate \nbecause I think the American people are not understanding the role of \nmultibillionaires, such as the Koch brothers, worth some $70 billion, \npouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the tea party. This is \nwhat this debate is about; it is not about ObamaCare. I will give some \nof the issues we should be debating. Senator Cruz was right.\n  The Texas Republican Party platform calls for an immediate and \norderly transition away from Social Security; in other words, they want \nto kill Social Security. That is a good debate. Let's have it.\n  How many of the American people think we should end Social Security \nand go back to the days of the 1920s, when the elderly people were the \npoorest people in America. That is what rightwing Republicans want to \ndo. Let us have that debate.\n\n  The Republicans in Texas--again, their view represents a whole lot of \nfolks here in the Senate and in the House--want to privatize veterans' \nhealth care. I am the chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, \nand I will tell you very strongly the veterans of America want to \nimprove and expand the VA health care system, not privatize it. But let \nus have that debate.\n  Quoting from the Texas platform, the Republican Party in Texas \nbelieves--and, again, reflecting the views, I believe, of a strong \nmajority of Republicans here in Washington--``We believe the minimum \nwage should be repealed.''\n  The minimum wage today is $7.25 an hour. We have millions and \nmillions of workers who are trying to get by on $8 an hour, $9 an hour. \nI think the minimum wage should be significantly expanded--raised. Many \nRepublicans say let's abolish the minimum wage. Do you know what that \nmeans? It means in Maine, in high unemployment areas; in Detroit, in \nhigh unemployment areas; and in Vermont, in high unemployment areas, \nwhat the employer will say is: Look, there ain't no jobs around here. \nYou want to work, here is 3 bucks an hour. But we have the government \nout of your lives. There is no longer a minimum wage.\n  They consider that freedom. I consider that wage slavery. Let us have \nthe debate about whether we should abolish the minimum wage, abolish \nSocial Security.\n  The Ryan Republican budget in the House a couple of years ago wanted \nto end Medicare as we know it and create a voucher system. Here is a \ncheck, 8,000 bucks. You got cancer, good luck. Here is your $8,000 \ncheck. Go to the doctor, to the hospital, you will get good care--for \nabout 2 days--and then we don't know what happens to you.\n  We are going to end Medicare as we know it. We are going to make \ndevastating cuts in Medicaid. We are going to give tax breaks to the \nrich at a time when the rich are doing phenomenally and the middle \nclass is collapsing. Let us have that debate. That is a good debate to \nhave.\n  It is very interesting; there was a CBS/New York Times poll that came \nout the other day absolutely consistent with every other poll I have \nseen. What these polls do is they say to the American people: What do \nyou think are the most important issues facing America? What should \nCongress be focusing on? You know what. They are not talking about \nhealth care. They are not talking about ObamaCare. They are not talking \nabout taxes. What the American people are saying is: We need jobs.\n  Real unemployment today is close to 14 percent. Youth unemployment is \nhigher. We need to create millions of\n\n[[Page S6976]]\n\njobs. Where is the debate? We bring forward ideas about rebuilding our \ncrumbling infrastructure, creating jobs, moving to a more energy \nefficient society, and creating jobs. Where are their ideas on jobs? \nThey do not have any. All they can say is: Let's give more tax breaks \nto billionaires. One out of four corporations doesn't pay any taxes. \nLet's give more tax breaks to the rich and to the corporations. \nTrickle-down economics has not worked.\n  What the American people also understand is that most of the new jobs \nthat are being created are low-wage jobs. Often they are part-time \njobs--a trend, by the way, that has been going on for many, many years, \nwell before ObamaCare. Major employers didn't need to think too hard to \nfigure out if you hire people for 25 or 28 hours a week you don't have \nto provide them with benefits. Let us discuss about how we create \ndecent wages in this country.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's yielded time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SANDERS. The last point I will make.\n  Maybe the most important discussion we should have is ending and \noverturning this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision \nwhich gives the billionaires in this country the ability to control \nwhat goes on here in the Congress, forcing Members of the House and \nSenate to raise unbelievable sums of money.\n  So there is a lot to be debated. But one thing we should not be \ndebating is shutting down the United States Government in order to \nachieve a narrow political goal.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to use 15 minutes of the \nappointed time and be notified after 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  Look, what we are here today about is the Democratic majority in the \nSenate has built a fortress around ObamaCare--the Affordable Care Act. \nThey have refused steadfastly any serious reevaluation of the law. They \nhave blocked every attempt to do that. The House, Senator Cruz, \nRepublicans, and others are trying to force this Congress to confront \nthe obvious flaws in that law, and they have refused to do so.\n  That is why it has all come down to a debate at the end of the year \nover what we are going to do. Do we just give up? Do we allow the \nmajority in the Senate to not even allow votes in the weeks to come? \nThey are not. They will not do it unless they are forced to do so. They \nmade a strategic decision to reject and fight off any attempt to bring \nup a vote on the floor of the Senate.\n  People in America, I am sure, cannot believe if a Member of the \nSenate desires to try and fix and improve the Affordable Care Act that \nthey cannot go to the floor and get a vote on it. That is exactly what \nhas been happening ever since it passed. Polling data show the American \npeople want substantial changes to it. Members, even Democrats, have \nsaid they want some change. But nothing gets voted on that will \nactually make a real change in the law.\n  It is the plan of President Obama and Senator Reid to accept no \nchange. Indeed, Senator Reid has made clear his plan is to move to a \nsingle-payer system. He said openly and publicly just a few weeks ago \nhe wants a single payer system for all health care in America--the \nUnited States Government. And that can only be described as socialized \nmedicine.\n  That is what the goal is, and we have got to confront this. So I \nwanted to say that first of all. But as ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, I want to share a few thoughts about where we are \nfinancially and what is going to happen with this legislation. First \nand foremost we have to know that the Affordable Care Act is deeply \nunsound financially. The President's promise--repeatedly made--was that \nit would not add one dime to the debt. He said it would not add one \ndime to the deficit ``now or ever, period.''\n  Is that true? No, sir, it is not true. This is a hugely unsound new \nentitlement program that will endanger the financial future of America \nat a time when we need to quit digging ourselves deeper in debt and \nbegin to work ourselves out of debt.\n  The Acting President pro tempore is on the Budget Committee. We both \nknow these numbers.\n  We are dealing with Social Security, desperately trying to figure out \na way to make Social Security sound so our seniors can go to bed at \nnight and not have any worries about the future of Social Security. \nMedicare is even more stressed. Now we are adding this law--ObamaCare.\n  What does it do? The Government Accountability Office, headed by an \nindependent person, actually appointed by President Obama, has issued a \nreport stating that under the likely financial scenario over the next \n75 years--that is how they figure Social Security and Medicare's \nliabilities--this bill will add $6.2 trillion to the Federal deficit. \nSocial Security's unfunded liabilities are only $7.7. We are talking \nabout adding almost as much debt to the future of the United States and \nto our children and grandchildren as Social Security has in \nliabilities. We need to be fixing Social Security, not creating a new \nentitlement. We need to be fixing Medicare, not adding another one. We \nneed to be fixing some of our pension plans that are unsound, not \nadding more debt. We were promised it wouldn't happen.\n  We are going to have a budget point of order later, and we will hear \narguments that ObamaCare is good for the budget. But this is how a \ncountry goes broke. This is how a country goes broke. We are going to \nhave a score from the Congressional Budget Office that says over 10 \nyears this law will bring in more money than goes out.\n  In one sense that is correct. But where did they get the money? The \nmoney--$500 billion or so--is coming out of Medicare. But it is \nMedicare's money. They are cutting doctors and hospitals--providers--\n$500 billion, and they are saying, therefore, the U.S. Treasury--the \nconventions of unified budget accounting, as CBO says--will show it as \nincreased money. Therefore, it can be spent by an entirely new program. \nBut it is not money for a new program or the U.S. Treasury. It is not \nCongress' money. This is Medicare's money, and it will be loaned by the \nMedicare trustees to the U.S. Treasury so it can be spent on this \nprogram.\n  The ObamaCare money that comes out of the Medicare savings is \nborrowed money. It is not free money. It is not new money. It is \nborrowed--borrowed from the trustees of Medicare--and it is headed in a \ndownward spiral, and they will call those loans in very soon. There is \njust no money there, and that is how it all comes out.\n  The Government Accountability Office says under a realistic set of \nassumptions this law will add $6 trillion--$6.2 trillion--to this \ncountry's deficit. Mr. Holtz-Eakin said in the first 10 years there \nwill be $500 billion added to the debt of America.\n  Supporters of the new law will contend otherwise, but it is \nindisputable that this is so. We are adding to the debt and it is going \nto threaten the future of America.\n  I would also point out, as we work our way through the entire effort \nto focus on our debt and what we will do for America, we need to \nunderstand how this accounting works. The Congressional Budget Office, \non December 23, the night before the bill passed in 2009, in response \nto my request, sent a letter saying you cannot simultaneously use the \nmoney for Medicare and to fund a new program, though the conventions of \naccounting might indicate that. You cannot use it for both purposes. \nThey used the phrase it was ``double counting.''\n  That is our own Congressional Budget Office. The night before this \nbill was rammed through the Senate, they told us that. Yet we still \nhave the President--we still have Members of this body insisting this \nlaw is fully paid for and will not add to the deficit ever, period. \nNothing could be more false. Nothing could be more false.\n  I know there are good people who feel like we have to keep this \nprocess moving, we have to send something to the House, and they will \nwant to move this bill to the House. I understand that. But I just want \neverybody to know that we all need to fully understand that this health \ncare law is unsound financially. This health care law will never work.\n  Second, I am disappointed that our colleagues in the House have sent \na bill\n\n[[Page S6977]]\n\nover that spends at a rate that would add $20 billion more to our debt \nthan the Budget Control Act would allow.\n  Colleagues, we have got to be so careful about this. I know they have \nan excuse for it. I know they say that by the end of the year the \nsequester will cut those spending levels down and it will not add to \nthe debt at the end of the year. Don't worry about it, they say. But \nright now we couldn't agree, so we just spent more money on the \ndiscretionary side than we should have otherwise. We are going to spend \n$988 billion instead of $968 billion, $20 billion more at that rate.\n  But they say after 3 months or 2 months, when this CR ends, it will \nall be fixed. I am worried about that. It is going to be harder, I \nthink. I think the pressure is going to be more intense 2 months from \nnow to keep spending at that level.\n  I don't think they should have sent a bill to this floor, even though \nthey can correctly argue that if sequester laws stay in effect, it will \nbe reduced. I recognize that they can continue to argue that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  But fundamentally it is going to be harder for us to confront this \nproblem as we go forward in the future because we will have more cuts \nover 9 or 10 months than would otherwise have been the case if we don't \nmake any of them in the first 2 months in this Congress.\n  I would say to our colleagues who are thinking, ``We may need to \nwaive the budget points of order. Let's just go forward, and somehow we \nwill work all this out in the future. We are going to be watching''--I \ncan't support it. But those who feel they have to do so to keep the \nball moving when the House sends another bill back over here, it ought \nto be on the budget level, not above it. I hope they will do that. That \nwill relieve one more problem.\n  But the truly big issue is how to understand the cost of this health \ncare law. My colleagues, using a score from the Congressional Budget \nOffice, are going to contend that if you eliminate ObamaCare, it will \ncost the Treasury money. That is what they are going to tell you, and \nthat is the score CBO would issue. But the CBO Director told us it is \ndouble-counting the money. You can't score this money twice.\n  But according to the conventions of accounting and the 10-year window \nover which this occurs, by reducing the cost of Medicare, you can \ntherefore spend more money to fund a new program. You can do that, and \nit will appear not to add to the debt. But you can't count the amount \nof money coming in because it is Medicare's money. It is simply \nborrowing money from Medicare. It is going to add to the debt.\n  Our own independent Government Accountability Office has said, \naccording to the likely analysis of events over the next 75 years, as \nthey do for Social Security and Medicare, this plan is going to add \n$6.2 trillion to the Federal deficit. In other words, what they are \nsaying is that you would have to deposit $6 trillion into an account \ntoday to have enough money to honor the commitments that are being made \nwith the Affordable Care Act. So that much money, in addition to the \nother revenues and taxes that are in the legislation and the payments \nthat are made by Americans, is not going to be enough, and we need that \nmuch more money. But we are committing this benefit to American \ncitizens. It becomes an entitlement. We are committing these benefits \nto them, and we don't have the money to honor the commitment. That \ncannot continue. We cannot as a nation continue down this path.\n  Wall Street and others are telling us we have to get our house in \norder. We cannot continue to add to our debt in this fashion.\n  I understand the difficulties Members will be facing when they cast a \nvote as they come up here today. I am not going to criticize any Member \non their vote--although I am not going to vote to waive the budget. I \nthink we ought to stay within our budget, and I think we cannot get by \nwith this idea that the Affordable Care Act is going to improve the \nfinancial condition of America when it absolutely is not.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would be delighted. The Senator is such a fine leader \nof the Appropriations Committee and one of the most knowledgeable \npeople here, a person I respect greatly.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. And I feel the same way.\n  I understand the Senator from Alabama is the ranking member of the \nBudget Committee. Could the Senator tell me why six Senators have \nobjected on his side of the aisle to having the conference on the \nbudget? The Senate passed a budget bill 5 months ago, and we could have \nbeen in negotiations to resolve that. Could the Senator tell me why \nthose six Senators object? And because of that objection, we do not \nhave a budget. Senator Murray passed a budget working here in a \nmarathon. The Senator will remember that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I certainly do. And I think I may have had a little \nrole in the fact that a budget was passed since I had been complaining \nthat the Democratic majority went 4 years without passing a budget and \nseveral years without even bringing it to the floor. While the House \nwas passing a budget every year, the Senate failed and refused a \nfundamental legal requirement to even produce one.\n  But this year our new chairman, Senator Murray, did bring a budget \nforward and did move it through the body. There was a concern--I didn't \nraise it, but a number of colleagues on this side of the aisle said: We \nare glad to have the budget move forward, but we want you to commit not \nto raise the debt ceiling on a budget reconciliation because you could \nraise the debt ceiling with 51 votes instead of 60 votes.\n  I know the Senator may not like that, but that is exactly what was \nsaid. And Senator Durbin on this floor said he did not think it could \nbe done under the rules of the Senate and that we could raise the debt \nceiling on the budget. But then why wouldn't the Senator agree to that?\n  So the request from the people who objected to sending a budget \nforward to conference was based solely--and they expressed it \nrepeatedly--on the concerns that budget reconciliation would be used to \nraise the debt and therefore not be subject to a 60-vote majority.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator for his answer. I dispute the logic \nand the reasoning, but I thank the Senator, and I thank him for working \nwith Senator Murray to move the budget. I will comment on that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield the floor. If I have not used \nall my time, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I now yield 3 minutes of the proponents' \ntime to Senator Murray, the chairperson of the Budget Committee, who \nactually did pass a budget 5 months ago but has been precluded because \nof sheer, rigid, ideological posturing from being able to go to a \nconference, sit in a room with Paul Ryan, and work out what the budget \nof the United States of America should be. This is why we have gone \nfrom the greatest deliberative body to the greatest delay body.\n  So I yield 3 minutes and any other time she wishes to consume to \nSenator Murray, who has done an outstanding job, and I wish people \nwould follow her lead and let her go to the conference so we could have \na budget.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for her \ntremendous leadership. She is absolutely correct--we are here in a \nmanufactured crisis. This Senate and the House passed a budget last \nspring. For 6 months we have been trying to get those two budgets \ntogether to conference a deal to set our budget priorities for the next \nseveral years. We have been precluded from doing that by the same \nRepublicans who now want to kill a continuing resolution that will \nsimply keep our government open for a few short weeks so we can do the \nwork we should have been doing for the last 6 months.\n  The answer to this is easy. Let's pass a clean resolution, keep the \ngovernment open for a few short weeks, do the responsible thing, say to \nthe Nation and to the world that we will pay our bills and raise the \ndebt ceiling, and then do what we need to do, what every\n\n[[Page S6978]]\n\none of us knows we need to do, which is to work out the differences \nbetween the House and the Senate budgets.\n  But we are here in a manufactured crisis because the same Republicans \nwho are now leading us to a shutdown are saying they don't want us to \ntalk. I agree with the Senator from Maryland. Keep the clean \nresolution, send it to the House, keep government open, and do what we \nshould do as leaders and adults and come to a budget agreement.\n  I also wish to speak today on and urge my colleagues to support the \nmajority leader's motion that he will bring to us to waive the budget \npoint of order against the continuing resolution we will vote on in a \nfew hours.\n  My Republican colleagues who announced their intent to raise this \npoint of order are concerned that the funding levels in both the House \nand Senate continuing resolutions violate the Budget Control Act. But, \nas we all remember, sequestration was never supposed to be in there. It \nwas supposed to be so unthinkable that it would force a compromise, \nwhich is what we are going to have to do anyway. But since those \nautomatic cuts took effect, we have now heard from families and \ncommunities across the country that sequestration is costing us jobs, \nit is slowing our growth, and it is harming our national security. That \nis exactly why the Senate and House budgets both require changes to the \nBudget Control Act.\n  It is true that we took very different approaches to altering the \nautomatic cuts. The Senate budget on our side fully replaced the \nsequestration. We did it with an equal mix of spending cuts and new \nrevenues that we raised by closing loopholes skewed toward the \nwealthiest Americans and biggest corporations. The House budget on the \nother side replaced sequestration fully also, but they did it by fully \nfunding defense programs and paying for that with very deep cuts to \ninvestments in families and jobs, all the while protecting the \nwealthiest Americans from participating in this at all and helping to \npay for it.\n  We do have a lot of work to bridge that divide, but that alone shows \nhow important it is that we pass a clean, temporary continuing \nresolution to keep the government operating while we have that space to \nnegotiate a longer term budget agreement that works for our families \nand economy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed 3 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. To do that, we have to be able to finish this bill, send \nit back to the House, and get our country back on the right course \nagain.\n  So voting to sustain this point of order isn't voting against a \nfunding level or a policy vote. Voting to sustain this point of order \nis voting for a government shutdown because if this bill that is in \nfront of us today dies, it is very likely the government will not be \nopen for business on Tuesday, and then our American families will have \nto deal with the disruption and all the uncertainty that will cause.\n  There is no reason to let the gridlock and dysfunction in Washington, \nDC, cause more harm to our families and businesses. A vote for this \npoint of order is a vote to kill this bill and shut down the \ngovernment, and we do not want that to happen. So I oppose it. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in waiving the point of order when we have \nthat vote later today. Let's pass a clean continuing resolution, have \nthe House pass a clean continuing resolution, and then do the job we \nwere sent to do. Every one of us knows what needs to be done, which is \nto bridge the divide between the House and Senate budgets and get our \ncountry back on track again.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington \nState for her comments because, as usual, they were clear, cogent, and \ncompelling.\n  We need to get a job done today. Our job today--am I correct--is \npassing a continuing resolution, which means we keep the funding at \nfiscal 2013 in place until we resolve other budgetary issues with the \nHouse. Is that correct?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I would say to the chairwoman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, that is absolutely correct.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we will be voting at 12:30 on four \nquestions. Those four votes are cloture on the continuing resolution, \nwaiver of a Budget Act on the point of order, the amendment that I \noffered on the continuing resolution, and final passage. But \nessentially it is all pretty much the same thing--it is four separate \nvotes that get there.\n  Our goal today is to send to the House of Representatives a \ncontinuing resolution, stripped of ideological riders, that keeps the \ngovernment funded until November 15 while we work out other budgetary \nissues. The continuing resolution historically was always meant to be \nshort-term to get us over problems, to keep the government functioning \nwhile we solve problems we have been working on, and it has always been \nhistorically not to have ideological riders attached to them.\n  We the Democrats, hopefully with others who will join with us to find \nthe sensible center--America always governs best when it finds the \ncenter, a sensible center--we want to find that and send it to the \nHouse where, No. 1, our continuing resolution will be until November \n15. This gives us a couple of weeks to work these issues out.\n  No. 2, to take out the ideological riders. The first rider is to \ndefund President Obama's Affordable Care Act. We want to strip that out \nbecause it is now the law of the land. There is no need to keep \nfighting the same battle.\n  Next, there is an ideological rider on how we structure paying our \ndebt. That rider is a rigged game, that we pay China first before we \npay other obligations to people here, debtors in our own country. We \nwant to strip that out and then send them the continuing resolution, \nwhich is not new money. It keeps the Government operating until \nNovember 15 at fiscal 2013 levels. That is where we are. I want to \nexplain, if we do not do this we could head to a government shutdown \nthat is harmful to our country, it is harmful to our economy, and it is \nharmful to our standing in the world.\n  In plain English, after debating the continuing resolution last \nThursday, we now have these four votes. A vote to waive a point of \norder against the continuing resolution where we could end up with more \nsand in the gears. Where we are now is that the vote on the Senate \namendment to the House CR, as I said, strips out partisan ideology, \nshortens the date and moves on so the House can look at it.\n  A government shutdown is a serious matter. If we do not come together \nacross the aisle, across the dome, across town, we will be facing a \ndamaging government shutdown. Here are a few things that will happen. \nIf we cannot enact a clean continuing resolution by October 1, our \ntroops, including troops deployed overseas, will not be paid on time; \n800,000 civil servants who serve the American people will be sent home \nand told they are nonessential. Shutting down the government will have \nan immediate and harmful effect on our economy. Small Business \nAdministration approval of loans will be put on hold; important rural \ndevelopment housing and farm loan grants will be stopped.\n  Our economy is struggling to pick up steam. The uncertainty that we \nwill create in the marketplace, in our own country and in the world, \nwill put on the brakes to our economy. It is irresponsible and \nunacceptable for this to happen.\n  Every day, thousands of Federal workers keep Americans safe. We don't \nhear about them every day but they do make a difference. Every time a \ndefective product is removed from the market, every time an inspector \nrecommends a change to keep people safe in terms of approving the \nsafety of our food supply or drug supply, every time a scammer or a \nschemer is arrested for fraud, the Federal Government and the people \nwho work for them play an important role.\n  In my own State, I represent the National Institutes of Health. Last \nspring, Director Dr. Francis Collins announced we had reduced cancer \nrates in this country by 15 percent. Instead of pinning a medal on the \nmen and women who did the basic research that could then lead to the \nprivate sector inventing new pharmaceutical and biological\n\n[[Page S6979]]\n\nproducts that would put that into clinical practice--instead of that, \nthey had to announce a furlough. How would you like to be working at \nNIH right this minute and be told you are nonessential? You are working \non a cure for cancer, you are trying to find out the causes of autism, \nyou are trying to come up with a cure or at least cognitive stretchout \nfor Alzheimer's--just talking about the A words--then you are told you \nare nonessential. They did not know that. The American people do not \nbelieve it.\n  We have to avoid a government shutdown and a government showdown. \nWhat we need to be able to do today is to be sure we work on our \namendments and make sure we have cloture on the continuing resolution. \nWe have had substantial debate. It is now time to bring that together, \nwaive the Budget Act and the point of order, pass my amendment to \nchange the time to November 15, and then have final passage.\n  The time to act is now. You hear in my voice great frustration. I am \nfrustrated, not because of solutions I do not like--that is give and \ntake in a legislative process. What I am frustrated about is the \ncontinual process of delay, where we not only throw sand in the gears \nof our ability to function, we are now throwing cement into those \ngears.\n  I hope we can move. There are cool heads on both sides of the aisle. \nThere are people on both sides of the aisle who have worked together \nand can come together. Let's pass this continuing resolution, have the \nHouse act so we can avoid a shutdown so that our focus is on solving \nthe important issues facing our country. Yes, there are those who call \nfor reducing the public debt. I support that. We can do that through a \nbalanced approach: additional strategic cuts, a review of mandatory \nspending, and a look at closing tax loopholes.\n  But there are other debts we have. We have the issue of chronic \nunemployment, of growing education unattainment, where our standing in \nthe world is slipping. I worry that we will not fund the necessary \nresearch and development so, working with the private sector, we will \ncome up with those new ideas that lead to new products, that lead to \nnew jobs.\n  DARPA, a government agency, helped create the Internet. Then the \ngenius of our private sector unleashed a power that the world has never \nseen. This is what America is known for--discovery, entrepreneurship, \nmoving our own country ahead. This is what I hope we will get back to.\n  Let's get through this process. Let's get through this quagmire and \nlet's keep America being what America can be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I do have time right now that is \nscheduled. However, my friend from Alabama had one other point to make. \nI would like to yield 2 minutes of my time to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, as I explained the unfunded liabilities \nof the Affordable Care Act, I now want to make something clear. It is a \nlot more than that. It is unlike Social Security and Medicare, where \nthere is a dedicated tax that supports those programs that are on our \npayroll withholding every week, that FICA withholding, dedicated to \nSocial Security and Medicare. There is no dedicated tax support for \nObamaCare.\n  If you assume all the new taxes they raise are actually used to fund \nObamaCare, then there would be a $6.2 trillion shortfall, a liability. \nBut if you do it like it should be accounted and assume that none of \nthis money raised in taxes is actually dedicated to the Affordable Care \nAct, then it runs about $17 trillion according to estimates by my \nBudget Committee staff.\n  Congress is well-known for this. Unless your tax money is absolutely \nlegally dedicated to something, it gets spent on other things. So we \nhave no confidence we will come in with just $6.2 trillion. It is \nlikely to be far higher than that, the way we know this body operates.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I agree with my good friend from Alabama. He has done a \ngreat job on this subject.\n  I would like to say, one of the things I enjoyed about the \npresentation that was made by my good friend from Texas Senator Cruz \nwas that we were in a position that is very rare in this body, where we \ncould talk as long as we wanted to. In fact, we actually tried to talk \nlonger. We were looking for different things to fill in. We may have \nforgotten some.\n  That is not where we are today. We are confined. But I have to share \nwith my good friend in the chair that something I am going to say now \nis going to be very offensive to a lot of people, but I really don't \ncare. At my age and being here, I think I know what this country is all \nabout and I think I know that we have the obligation to express our \ntrue feelings.\n  I have written a speech and have put it off. I am not going to give \nit today. But I was rereading it this morning. I had no intention of \ncoming down and talking because I talked long enough during the course \nof the Cruz talk. But I went back and reread the speech I was going to \ngive. What it is is to answer the question one of my sons asked me, and \neveryone has been saying this over a period of time in Oklahoma. I \ndon't think Oklahoma is that different from other States. But they ask \nme over and over again, they say: What happened? Why is it that we have \nan administration--people in government, not just the Obama \nadministration but others--who are praising Islam and trashing \nChristianity, trashing the Judeo-Christian values and other things that \nare happening today?\n  We all know it is true. How do you answer that? It is a tough answer. \nSo I am preparing and later on I will give you a little warning, I am \ngoing to make a little talk.\n  There is a guy named Paul Johnson who wrote a history of the American \npeople. He talks about how we got to where we are today. This is going \nto tie into ObamaCare. He says that the Puritans were devoted and \nsingle-minded to their ambition of creating a colony that was built on \nthe foundation and teachings of Jesus Christ. The Mayflower compact is \nevidence of that. Paul Johnson, the guy who wrote the book I told you \nabout, is right to observe the document was not just a ``contract . . . \nbetween a servant and a master, or a people and a king, but between a \ngroup of like-minded individuals, with God as a witness and symbolic \nco-signatory.''\n  Why is this important? It is important because William Bradford and \nthe other Puritans understood that while forming a civil government was \nfully within their rights, there were limitations to what they could \nand could not do. Not talking about government here. Those limitations \nwere established by God and enumerated in the Bible.\n  I go on. When I make my talk on this, I quote the Apostle Paul in \nRomans, but there is not time for that. I go on to say it is within the \nfoundation of Biblical authority that the Puritans crafted the \nMayflower compact and their system of government at Plymouth Colony. \nPaul Johnson rightly observes that this line and model of thinking was \ncritical to laying the foundation for a successful United States of \nAmerica. Ultimately, it is a morality derived from God that had its \nstrongest enduring influence over the Nation, and this is what has \ncrafted our history as a strong nation.\n  I say all this as a predicate to the answer to the question people \nask me: Why is it that we are trashing our Judeo-Christian values in \nfavor of something that was not American to start with? Sadly, our \nNation does not have the same belief today that we had during that time \nin our history. We have become arrogant, inward-focused individuals. \nRather than submit to God's authority and definitions of truth, \njustice, and goodness, as we conduct our government's business, we have \nreplaced them with our own ideals defined on what feels right at the \ntime. As Americans, we now look inward to ourselves to define with \nfluidity the foundation of truth. We have allowed ourselves to become \nultimate arbiters of what is right and wrong instead of the higher \nmoral authority of God.\n  Lastly, what was going to be in this talk, this time getting back to \nthe subject at hand, today, instead of having leaders who are \nprotecting the church from government, we have leaders who\n\n[[Page S6980]]\n\nbelieve it is government's job to impose on churches what should be \nuniversally upheld as truth. Instead of leaders who are protecting an \nAmerican's freedom to practice his or her religion of their choice--\nhere I am not talking about the choice you may be thinking about--they \nmay instead be using government institutions and law to force them to \ndo or buy things that are in very violation to their religious beliefs \nand conscience. That is the issue we are talking about now.\n  Government has become so strong and influential in our lives that we \nare losing our powers, and these are our ordained powers that we know \nare a part of this country. There is not a person in here who didn't \nstudy the Pilgrims coming over on the Mayflower and having that meeting \nin the captain's chamber and making these decisions and now we are \nwhere we are today.\n  I have an example. I have a friend in Oklahoma whose name is David \nGreen. David Green started a company called Hobby Lobby. David Green \nand his wife started this company by making picture frames in their \ngarage. They were able to open their first store, which was 300 square \nfeet, with the profits they made in their little garage operation \nmaking picture frames.\n  Over the years their business has grown to 550 stores. It has an \nannual revenue of $2.5 billion, and David Green has had success despite \nrunning his business in a very countercultural way. For instance, all \nof the retail stores close at 8 p.m. each night and all day on Sunday \nso employees can spend time with their families. This is appreciated by \nthe company's 16,000 employees--remember, it all started in a garage--\nwho are paid at a minimum $12 an hour, even though they could be paying \na much lower legal rate.\n  At one point, the company was challenged by a competitor who said \nthey would bury Hobby Lobby with their money, so their firm opened \ntheir doors on Sunday, ultimately earning the company $150 million in \nrevenue each week. Eventually, David Green said he was challenged by \nGod to trust in him with his business, to go back to his policy of \nclosing on Sundays and he did and his business has prospered. It is one \nof the largest businesses in America today.\n  David's Christian faith runs deeper than his desire to have a \nprofitable, successful company. When he was faced with a decision to \nmake more money or obey God, he chose to obey God, whatever the \nconsequences.\n  Keep all of that in mind and listen to this. This is what I am \ngetting at. Recently, he was faced with a new test. It didn't come from \na competitor. It came from the U.S. Government. Part of the ObamaCare \nlaw requires employers not only to provide health care insurance to \ntheir employees but also to provide free access to the pills that \nterminate pregnancies.\n  David, as I do, and many others believe--and some don't believe that \nwe believe--that life begins at conception, and offering an option to \nend that life would be in violation, in his case, of his moral compass \nas defined by his faith in Jesus Christ.\n  As a result, he said he would rather pay the $1.3 million a day in \ndaily fines from the Obama administration than comply with the law. \nHere is a guy who feels so strongly in his beliefs--that I think are \nconsistent with the beliefs that made this country great, but that is \njust my belief--that he would pay $1.3 million a day in fines from the \nObama administration rather than comply with this law.\n  Today the Obama administration is vigorously opposing Hobby Lobby's \nlegal challenge to the mandate, claiming that this privately owned \nbusiness is waging a war on women for not agreeing to provide these \ntreatments for its employees free of charge. That is just one example \nof what is happening. By the way, I don't think my State of Oklahoma is \nthat different from most other States.\n  Last week, four universities in my great State of Oklahoma filed a \nlawsuit against the Federal Government over the ObamaCare mandate to \nprovide certain types of contraception to their employees. These are \nfour universities which are joining with this one great American named \nDavid Green. So we have the faith of an individual and what he is \nwilling to do for his faith. He is willing to stand up to this abusive \ngovernment that we have today and to this ObamaCare law and is willing \nto pay $1.3 million a day. My feelings are just as strong as his on \nthis issue, but that is a subject for another day.\n  My wife and I have 20 kids and grandkids. Back in the old days, when \nwe were having our kids, there was kind of a rule where you couldn't go \ninto the hospital, I say to my good friend who is occupying the chair. \nBack then we couldn't see this and we had to wait outside and we didn't \nhave notice of what the baby was going to be and all that.\n  But in the case of my first grandchild, my daughter called me up and \nsaid: All right, Daddy. Come on over. It is time. I went over to the \nhospital delivery room. What a great experience that was. I never \ndreamed that would ever happen. We are talking about a number of years \nago--17 years ago. So I watched this take place, and I honestly--a tear \ndid come out from my eye.\n  At that time we were talking about partial birth abortions and the \nfact that they could have taken little baby Jase and jammed scissors \ninto his skull and sucked his brains out. That could have happened, but \nit didn't happen.\n  I feel just as strongly as David Green does. I can make all the \narguments I want about this, and I made arguments on the floor during \nthe Cruz debate.\n  I remember Hillary health care, which was about 19 years ago and it \nwas the same thing. It was government taking over the health care \nsystem, and I had my friends in Parliament and Great Britain who would \ncall and say: What is wrong with you guys over there? Don't you realize \nwe are just getting away from this thing that hasn't worked? Don't kid \nyourself and think this is not a road to socialized medicine if we end \nup not doing something about ObamaCare. It is.\n  I have a great deal of respect for the leader of the Senate, Harry \nReid. Senator Reid himself said: Yes, I believe this is leading to--and \nI endorse it--the single-payer system. So we are talking about \nsocialized medicine.\n  They called and said: What is wrong with you guys? It hasn't worked \nin Great Britain, it hasn't worked in Denmark, and it hasn't worked in \nCanada. Yet you think it is somehow going to work there.\n  That is the big issue. We have an abusive government, and this is \nprobably the greatest single step we have witnessed in the last 4\\1/2\\ \nyears as to the abuse that has taken place. We need to look at the big \npicture and do something about this. They say it can't be done now. It \nis too late. They are probably right, but they said the same thing \nabout Hillary health care 19 years ago, and I will never forget it \nbecause I was on a plane going back to my State of Oklahoma and had a \nstop in Chicago.\n  I thought we finally drove the final nail in the coffin and killed \nHillary health care. Yet I picked up the Wall Street Journal, and there \nwas a full-page ad by the AMA endorsing Hillary health care. They had \ngiven up, and that was the day before they gave them that story.\n  Anyway, it is never too late. This is something that needs to be \nstopped. I have faith in the American people that somehow we are going \nto win this thing.\n  I thank the Chair. I know my time has expired.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from New \nHampshire, Mrs. Shaheen.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I am pleased to join my colleagues on the floor, the \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee and others who have been down \nto speak in support of passing this continuing resolution.\n  I am a new member of the Appropriations Committee, and I have been \nvery impressed with the work our chair, Senator Mikulski, and Ranking \nMember Shelby have done. They have crafted the appropriations bills \nthat would address the budget for the coming year. Those appropriations \nbills would replace the harmful cuts from sequestration. Those are cuts \nthat people on both sides of the aisle have said they oppose. \nUnfortunately, because of the obstructionism we have seen so clearly\n\n[[Page S6981]]\n\nthis week, those bills have not yet come to the floor and so we need a \nshort-term CR to keep the government open.\n  We all know that the continuing resolution before us is not ideal. It \nis short term and it doesn't replace sequestration. So it doesn't \neither deal with the cuts or give businesses and our economy the \ncertainty they need. But this suggestion that we should refuse to keep \nthe government open is irresponsible. There is too much at stake for \nour economy, for our small businesses, and for our families across this \ncountry. Unfortunately, what we have seen this week is that there are \nsome who are pushing this country to the brink of another manufactured \ncrisis as a tactic to prevent health care reform from going into \neffect.\n  I am not going to review what Senator McCain said so well about how \nthe democratic process works in this country and the fact that once a \nlaw goes into effect, it is important to implement it. I think \ndemocracy works, but it doesn't always work the way I want it to \neither. When a law is passed, we have a responsibility to go ahead and \nmake it work. We have a seen a small minority of this body and of the \nHouse who are willing to shut down government to defund the new health \ncare law.\n  The people I talk to in New Hampshire don't think that shutting down \ngovernment is a good approach because they understand the serious \nconsequences it would have for them, for their businesses, and for the \ncountry. It would especially hurt small businesses, which are the \nfoundation of the economy in New Hampshire and the Presiding Officer's \nhome State of Maine and Rhode Island, Senator Reed's home State. Those \nsmall businesses create two out of every three new jobs. Many of those \nsmall businesses in New Hampshire and across the country rely on \nFederal contracts as they figure out how they are going to grow and \ncreate new jobs.\n  We talked to one CEO of an innovative small company in New Hampshire \nwho told me if its contracts were shut down:\n\n       Our income would drop to essentially zero and we would burn \n     our very thin cash reserves . . . when that money is burned \n     it is not able to be replaced so our basic financial \n     viability can be irrevocably damaged even after the crisis \n     passes. There will be no way to recover those dollars.\n\n  We had a chance to hear from the former Secretary of the Treasury, \nBob Rubin, this week. He said: Unlike 1995, when there was a short-term \nconsequence to shutting down the government, if we do that this time, \nit will be felt not just for years but for decades to come.\n  A shutdown would close the Small Business Administration's lending \nprograms, and those SBA lending programs are critical to small business \nin New Hampshire and across this country. On average, SBA supports \nloans to over 1,000 small businesses per week.\n  Then there is the housing market. In New Hampshire and across this \ncountry, the housing market has been one of the slowest sectors to \nrecover, but in the last year we have begun to see some signs of \nimprovement. The Federal Housing Administration has been a big part of \nthat recovery because they have helped families afford homes and kept \nour housing economy afloat.\n  Under the shutdown, it is estimated that assistance to 34,000 \nhomeowners would be delayed. With all of the problems that have been \ncaused by the housing crisis, we should not be stalling one of the most \neffective programs we have for assisting homeowners, and that is what \nwe would do with a government shutdown.\n  Then, of course, this would be terrible timing for the tourist \nindustry in New Hampshire and across New England because fall foliage \nis one of our biggest seasons and tourists come from all over the \nworld. They spend money in our local restaurants and hotels. Many small \nbusinesses rely on this time of year to increase their revenues. But if \nthe government shuts down, we will be turning away those customers. \nApplications for visas will come to a halt. According to the \nCongressional Research Service, during the 1995-1996 shutdowns, \napproximately 20,000 to 30,000 applications by foreigners for visas to \ncome and visit in America went unprocessed. That will not just affect \nthe tourism industries in New Hampshire, it will affect airlines and \npeople across the country.\n  Then, of course, there are Federal workers. In New Hampshire there \nare 7,400 of them. It is one of the State's largest employers, the \nFederal Government, and their salaries are not just important to them \nand their families but to the grocery stores and gas stations and all \nof the other businesses they support.\n  The Presiding Officer certainly knows, as I do, about the impact on \nthe Portsmouth Naval Shipyard of a potential government shutdown.\n  These are just some of the effects on the economy. Considering the \nmany industries that would be affected, it is no surprise that \neconomists have forecast that failure to pass a continuing resolution, \nas Bob Rubin said, would do significant damage to our economy. Even a \n3- or 4-day shutdown would slow growth by 0.2 percent, according to \neconomist Mark Zandi.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. I was a Governor for three terms. The \nPresiding Officer was a Governor for two terms. We understand what it \nis like to work across the aisle. We always passed a budget because we \nhad to put in place a budget.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank the Chair.\n  There were a lot of differences on both sides of the aisle, but we \nunderstood the importance of compromising, because it would have been \nimpossible to get something through the New Hampshire legislature and \nget a budget to my desk if people hadn't been willing to compromise, if \nthey had been continuing to play the kinds of political games we are \nseeing here in Washington.\n  It is unacceptable. Congress can do better. We need to work together \nto pass this continuing resolution, and then to raise the debt ceiling \nlater this year so we avoid the negative effect to families, to \nbusinesses, and to our economy.\n  Thank you very much.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes of proponent time to \nSenator Coats, as well as, by agreement of the other side, 3 minutes of \nopponent time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, there has been a great deal of confusion \nover what has been happening in the Senate this week. I know Hoosiers \nwant a clear explanation, so I wish to take a moment to explain exactly \nwhere I stand on the issue before us.\n  Let me start by laying out a few facts. This is the reality we face. \nNo. 1: Every single Republican opposes ObamaCare and wants to see it \nrepealed and defunded. That is unassailable. We are all together on \nthat.\n  No. 2: The House has sent us a bill that would defund ObamaCare while \nkeeping the rest of the government running. I support that bill, and I \nthink all Republicans support that bill.\n  No. 3: Senate Democrats are united in their opposition to repealing \nObamaCare and, unfortunately, the fact is they control the Senate and \nthey control the White House, and we don't have the votes to prevail.\n  So the confusion sets in because, let's face it, we have a lot of \nconfusing procedures here in the U.S. Senate, but I have always been \nguided by the principle that to the extent possible, a yes should be \nyes and a no should be no.\n  We have all of these procedural motions and Members like to attach \ncaveats, such as: This is what it means if you vote to go forward or \nthis is what it means if you don't vote to go forward. It is so easy to \nrun home and say: Oh, well, that was an issue politically. That was \nprocedural, so don't pay any attention to that.\n  Sometimes we have no other option because the majority leader won't \nallow any votes on the issue itself. In this case, the majority leader \nhas allowed that vote. That is not the case here. We don't need a \nprocedural vote to determine whether one is for or against ObamaCare. \nWe will be able to have a vote if we invoke cloture and move forward \nand keep this alive to continue debate not just this week but next year \nand however long it takes to deal with this issue. We need to move \nforward or everything else comes to a standstill.\n  That is why I will be voting to move forward. I will be voting to \nkeep the\n\n[[Page S6982]]\n\nprocess alive. Otherwise, everything stops. The House of \nRepresentatives, controlled by our party, is waiting for us to send \nthis bill back. If we deny cloture, it doesn't go back to the House. \nThey don't have an opportunity to go to the next step.\n  There is bipartisan support for a bill I have introduced in the \nSenate, and Todd Young, a Congressman from southern Indiana, has not \nonly introduced but passed in the House of Representatives a measure to \ndelay this process for a year so we can continue to address and \nhopefully repeal ObamaCare. The President has delayed implementation \nfor business, and again today for small business. He can delay it for \nindividuals, and that will give us time to continue this effort.\n  Voting for cloture today so we can send something back to the House \nis not a vote for ObamaCare. It is exactly the opposite. It is a vote \nagainst ObamaCare. It keeps the process alive. Saying otherwise is \nmisleading. Also, if that were the case, then the procedural vote we \nhad on Wednesday would not have been 100 to zero. So those who try to \ndefine this as a procedural vote are essentially stopping the process \nfrom going forward and stopping the government from running. It affects \nmilitary families, it affects veterans, and it affects thousands and \nthousands of people in critical jobs. It affects people all across my \nState.\n  The problem with this approach is that it doesn't achieve the goal. \nWe all know a major portion of ObamaCare is funded through mandatory \nspending, and that is not what we are addressing here. It can only \naffect the appropriations, the discretionary funding, which is less \nthan 50 percent.\n  If it achieves the goal, then it may be worth considering. But since \nit doesn't achieve the goal, let's keep this process alive and let's \nall be on the record with a yes or a no. Let's get this bill back to \nthe House so we can continue the fight and let's be straight up on \nwhere we stand on this issue, not through a procedural vote but through \na clear yes or no. The American people deserve no less.\n  I commend the passion of my colleagues talking on the floor, trying \nto get rid of ObamaCare. We have a difference of opinion as to how \ntactically we can achieve this objective. I have come to the judgment \nand the conclusion that I think many are coming to, which is that \ninstead of just stopping everything--which means being at a total \nimpasse and shutting down the government--and even if we were \nsuccessful, it wouldn't address the full shutdown and defunding of \nObamaCare, the best course of action is to move forward. Our House \nRepublican Members are waiting for us to send them legislation so we \ncan keep this process going and come to, hopefully, a much better \nresolution than just simply using a procedural gimmick to define where \nwe stand on this issue.\n  I take a back seat to no one on where I stand on ObamaCare, and I \nwill not give up the fight until we achieve the goal of replacing the \nlaw with real health care solutions.\n  Mr. President, I yield any time I may have remaining.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes of proponent time to the \nSenator from Massachusetts, Mr. Markey.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, where is America now? We have an economy \nin recovery. The Dow was at 7,900 when George W. Bush left office. It \nis over 15,000 right now. Our deficit is heading downward. Unemployment \nis still high, but jobs are coming back. But, as we make this progress, \npeople continue to struggle, and they expect us to put together a \nbusiness plan for America, here on the Senate floor, and work with the \nPresident--work together as Democrats and Republicans--to put that plan \ntogether for every American family.\n  What is the tea party Republican response? It is to shut down the \ngovernment, to stamp out signs of our fragile economic recovery, to \nsend the signal that America can't perform the most basic job of \ngovernment--and that is to pass a budget.\n  What is driving these tea party Republicans? I know all about these \ntea party extremists. I served in the House of Representatives with \nthem. I served over there for years. They live by the Republican tea \nparty paradox: They hate the government but, paradoxically, they have \nto run for office in order to make sure the government doesn't work, \nand that is where they are today.\n  They sent us a bill from the House and they know it won't pass. This \nis a bill to nowhere, and nowhere is where the tea party Republicans \nwant the government to go.\n  The tea party Republicans want to repeal ObamaCare. I say to those \nwho want to repeal ObamaCare, to those who do not like ObamaCare, and \nto those who like ObamaCare: We have had that debate. We debated here \nin Congress. The bill passed. It was signed by the President. It was \nheld up by the Supreme Court of the United States. It is the law. It is \ntime to stop playing games and to let the law work. But that is exactly \nwhat the tea party Republicans are afraid of--that the law will \nactually work.\n  Shutting down the government for ObamaCare is like canceling the \nWorld Series because your team didn't make it. ObamaCare is the law. We \ncan't cancel the government. We can't cancel the World Series. We have \nto accept the reality that it is the law. We had an election. But what \nwe have here are the mad hatters of the Republican tea party in \nCongress who have decided that their approach to government--to the \nold, to the sick, to the needy, to every single principle of the United \nStates of America that we stand for--it is off with their heads for all \nof those people who depend upon these programs in our country. We are \nliving in an absurd ``Alice in Wonderland'' Republican tea party world \nhere.\n  This government has to work for the American people. Instead, what \nthey are about to do, over this weekend, is send another Maalox-moment-\nfor-the-marketplace signal to the credit markets of the world that the \nUnited States cannot be depended upon to operate a government, to pay \nits bills, to respond to the needs of the families within our own \ncountry, to meet its obligations not only here but around the world.\n  And those families who are dependent upon a paycheck from the Defense \nDepartment? They are wondering, along with the families who are \ndependent upon a Federal helping hand, whether or not they are going to \nget that help over the next week, over the next two weeks, over the \nnext month.\n  I will just give my colleagues one final example. The National \nInstitutes of Health budget--well, it is really the national institutes \nof hope. That is what we give to families who have somebody with \nAlzheimer's, with Parkinson's, with cancer, with heart disease--is \nbeing cut and cut and cut and cut. It is being cut at the same time \nthat last year we spent $132 billion worth of taxpayers' money on \nAlzheimer's patients in our country. We can't cut the money for the \ncure and simultaneously say we want to cut the money for taking care of \nthose who have the disease. We can't have it both ways. That is what \nthis nihilistic tea party approach is bringing to our people.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. MARKEY. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for yielding. I \nhope the tea party Republicans come to their senses.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, we are going to have the opportunity to \nvote today to reverse course. I think most people agree that ObamaCare \nis not working out as it is intended. In fact, we had a Democrat \nrecently say that when it comes to the implementation of ObamaCare, it \nis a train wreck. Whether one believes it is a train wreck, which is \nwhat I happen to believe, or whether it is a slow motion derailment, it \nis time for us to reverse course.\n  We have an opportunity to go in a different direction with the vote \nwe are going to have here in about an hour on whether or not to defund \nObamaCare. I think the overwhelming opinion across this country--an \noverwhelming number of Americans--believe that this is not working. It \nis hurting middle class families. It is costing us jobs. It is driving \nup health insurance premiums for people across this country, and we \nneed to do something to reverse course.\n  For example, when we look at how this impacts average people in my\n\n[[Page S6983]]\n\nState of South Dakota, we have young people today who, when they look \nat what they are paying in terms of health insurance premiums this year \nand what they are going to pay under the exchanges when the exchanges \nkick in, are seeing that a healthy 30-year-old woman in South Dakota is \ngoing to be faced with a 223-percent premium increase as a result of \nObamaCare. A healthy 30-year-old man living in South Dakota is facing a \n393-percent premium increase, when we compare the data being put out by \nthe Department of Health and Human Services of what people in my State \nof South Dakota are paying today for similar coverage. I am using the \nbronze plan under the exchanges as a case in point.\n  For a young person in South Dakota, we are talking about $1,500 more \na year to pay for health insurance for a young woman, and $2,000 more \nfor a young man. This money is money that could be used to pay off \nstudent loans, save for a home, maybe start a family.\n  It is not just young adults who are going to be faced with making \ntough budget decisions between having health care and paying for other \nitems. We know also that families are seeing health care premiums \nskyrocket, since the President took office, by about $3,000, or by \nabout $2,500 since ObamaCare became law. That is happening at a time \nwhen average household income is going down. If we look at the average \nhousehold income since the President took office, it is down by about \n$3,600. So families are seeing health insurance premiums go up by \n$3,000 while average household income is going down by $3,600. As we \ncan see, middle class families in this country are being squeezed from \nboth ends.\n  We have an opportunity to correct that. The vote today is a vote to \ndefund ObamaCare. I have been a big advocate for delaying, defunding, \nreplacing, repealing. When it comes to this issue, count me as one of \nthe ``all of the above''--anything we can do to get rid of this bad law \nand the harmful impacts it is having on the American people.\n\n  The vote today is going to be on defunding. I would daresay that \nevery Republican in this Chamber--all 46 Republicans--will be casting a \nvote to defund ObamaCare. There is not a single Republican in the \nChamber today or when this law was passed back in 2009 who voted for \nit. Since that time, we have had numerous votes--I think 29 or 30 \nvotes--here in the Senate on repealing all or parts of ObamaCare.\n  So everybody on our side is going to be on the record today in favor \nof defunding this bad law. All it will take is 5 Democrats--5 \nDemocrats--to get us to the 51 votes necessary to change the direction, \nchange the course, turn this train around, and head it in a different \ndirection. Republicans are going to be united on that point. There is \nsometimes a difference of opinion on tactics, about the best way to \nreach the goal, but one thing that unites all Republicans is the goal, \nand that is doing away with this bad law and its harmful impact on the \nAmerican people, on middle-class families, on jobs, and on our economy. \nThe question before the House is, Are there going to be Democrats, a \nhandful of Democrats--five is all it takes--to stand with Republicans \ntoday and help us defund this law?\n  Nearly 60 percent of Americans say they oppose ObamaCare. We can stop \nit. We can start over and do this the right way. We have talked about, \nmany times, the things we would do differently if we had the \nopportunity to write a law that actually would address the health care \nchallenges people face in this country, that would create greater \ncompetition in the marketplace by allowing people to buy insurance \nacross State lines, by allowing small businesses to join larger groups \nin pools so they get the benefit of group purchasing power, by reducing \nthe cost of defensive medicine, by ending a lot of the junk lawsuits \nthat clog the system today, by allowing people to have a refundable tax \ncredit where they can buy their own health insurance and they have more \nchoice, more competition.\n  These are all approaches we think make sense and would provide a \npositive alternative to the American people that would not cost us the \njobs, that would not be driving up health insurance premiums by 393 \npercent for a 30-year-old man in the State of South Dakota or 223 \npercent for a 30-year-old woman, and that would give American families \nan opportunity to save more for their future, to provide for their \nfamilies, and hopefully to invest in what is a better and a more \nprosperous future for their children and grandchildren.\n  That is the vote before us today. Again, I do not have to belabor the \npoint when it comes to the harmful impacts this has had if you look at \nwhat it is doing to jobs, if you look at what it is doing to employers. \nWe talk to people all the time. I doubt there is a Member here in the \nSenate who, when they go home to their State on weekends, does not have \nconversations with small businesses, with employers who are talking \nabout what this is doing to their ability to create jobs, to put people \nto work, to raise salaries, to make sure the people they employ have a \nbetter future for their families.\n  But, clearly, as long as this bad law stays in place, it is going to \nbe more expensive and more difficult for businesses in this country to \ncreate jobs; it is going to be more difficult, more expensive for \nmiddle-class families to make ends meet; it is going to create a much \nbigger, more expansive government that is going to cost the American \ntaxpayer way more than I think was originally promised; and certainly \nit is going to add significantly to the massive amount of debt we are \npassing on to future generations.\n  We have an opportunity to get a do-over today. There has been talk \nduring the implementation of this that it has glitches and bumps and \ninaccuracies and malfunctions. This is not ready for prime time. I \nthink we can all acknowledge that. At a minimum, we ought to figure out \na way to delay this and change course, change direction, and go in a \nbetter direction for America's future.\n  Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, let me start by getting something out of \nthe way: I am opposed to funding Obamacare, plain and simple, and my \nvotes this week reflect that. The allegedly Affordable Care Act is \nraising premiums, forcing millions of Americans into part-time work, \nand raising taxes on hard-working American families.\n  However, I want to bring up another problem we are facing this week, \nwhich has so far been mostly drowned out in this latest budget crisis. \nShort-term, month-to-month budgeting is no way to run a government. \nEven if we manage to avoid a government shutdown this time, we will be \ndebating this same question in just 6 weeks. We should not continue to \nplace bandaids on Washington's failure to pass a responsible, long-term \nbudget.\n  When I ran a small business, I had a plan to meet payroll and keep \nthe lights on and doors open with the revenue I brought in. Even small \nbusinesses need long range planning, fiscal discipline, and foresight. \nWhen families sit down to plan their budgets, they are forced to make \ntough choices--like how to save for college, or simply how to get food \non the dinner table that week. But the Federal Government has \nrepeatedly failed to play by these same rules, and as a result, we move \nfrom crisis to crisis with no solution on the horizon for our growing \nfiscal mess. Congress has not completed all 12 regular spending bills \non time since 1997. This year, Congress has not yet passed any of these \nbills. As a result, our debt continues to rise, our government grows \never bigger, and our economic future remains uncertain. This hurts our \neconomy and hurts our families.\n  A big part of the solution here is not rocket science: Pass a budget. \nPass all 12 appropriations bills. Show some fiscal foresight. While \nObamacare is certainly more than enough reason to oppose the current \ncontinuing resolution, I will not support this stopgap spending measure \nand further grind our budgeting process to a halt.\n Mr. President, I want to take a moment to reflect on the \ncurrent Senate debate over the funding of our government and the future \nof the so-called Affordable Care Act.\n  At the outset, I want to make one thing perfectly clear: I oppose \nObamacare and have from the beginning.\n  I was among the most outspoken critics of Obamacare when it was being \ndebated in the Senate. In fact, I was the first Member of Congress to \nsuggest that the individual mandate was unconstitutional, an argument \nthat eventually went all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\n[[Page S6984]]\n\n  Since the law's passage, I have been one of the foremost voices in \nCongress in favor of repeal.\n  I have introduced legislation to repeal some of Obamacare's most \negregious provisions, including the individual mandate, the employer \nmandate, the health insurance tax, and the medical device tax.\n  I have come to the floor countless times over the years to call for \neither a full repeal or permanent delay of the implementation of \nObamacare.\n  In short, Mr. President, no one can accuse me of acquiescing when it \ncomes to opposing Obamacare. I have and will continue to do all I can \nto protect the American people from this monstrosity of a law.\n  That said, I wish to express my admiration for my colleagues who are \ncurrently fighting to defund Obamacare as part of the continuing \nresolution to fund the government. I admire their commitment to their \nprinciples and share their desire to see Obamacare disappear once and \nfor all.\n  While I may not agree with their chosen strategy, our overall goals \nare the same.\n  It is that strategy that I want to comment on today.\n  Once again, no one is more committed to repealing Obamacare than I \nam. However, if we are going to be successful in this endeavor, we need \nto look at the bigger picture.\n  Quite simply, the strategy of forcing a government shutdown in order \nto defund Obamacare has no chance of success. And, in the long run, I \nbelieve it will do more harm than good.\n  Unlike a number of my colleagues, I was around for the government \nshutdown of 1995. And, while purists may have patted themselves on the \nback for their resolve, the shutdown did nothing to advance \nconservative principles and, in the end, harmed the Republican Party.\n  I can't help but think that the same would happen now if we end up \nshutting down the government over a fight about Obamacare.\n  In fact, given the number of setbacks he has faced recently, I have \nlittle doubt that President Obama is hoping for a government shutdown \nso that he can blame it on Republicans.\n  That is what the Wall Street Journal editorial page argued recently, \nsaying:\n\n       With his own popularity fading, Mr. Obama may want a \n     shutdown so he can change the subject to his caricature of \n     GOP zealots who want no government. He'll blame any turmoil \n     or economic fallout on House Republicans, figuring that he \n     can split the tea party from the GOP and that this is the one \n     event that could reinstall Nancy Pelosi as Speaker. Mr. Obama \n     could spend his final two years going out in a blaze of \n     liberal glory.\n\n  Does anyone seriously believe that the mainstream media would portray \na government shutdown over Obamacare in a light that was favorable to \ncongressional Republicans?\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, at the \nconclusion of my remarks, a copy of the Wall Street Journal editorial.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of \na recent op-ed piece authored by Karl Rove.\n  In that opinion piece, Mr. Rove rightly argues that:\n  ``The desire to strike at Obamacare is praiseworthy. But, any \nstrategy to repeal, delay, or replace the law must have a credible \nchance of succeeding or affecting broad public opinion positively. The \ndefunding strategy doesn't. Going down that road would strengthen the \npresident while alienating independents. It is an ill-conceived tactic, \nand Republicans should reject it.''\n  Karl Rove isn't the only conservative making these arguments.\n  Writing in the Washington Post, Charles Krauthammer said of the \nshutdown strategy: ``[T]here's no principle at stake here. This is \nabout tactics. If I thought this would work, I would support it. But I \ndon't fancy suicide.''\n  Mr. Krauthammer continued, saying: ``Nothing could better revive the \nfortunes of a failing, flailing, fading Democratic administration than \na government shutdown where the president is portrayed as standing up \nto the GOP on honoring our debts and paying our soldiers in the \nfield.''\n  Rich Lowry, editor of the National Review wrote that this strategy is \n``a grass roots-pleasing slogan in search of a path to legislative \nfruition,'' and that it ``seems tantamount to believing that if \nRepublican politicians clicked their wing tips together and wished it \nso, President Barack Obama would collapse in a heap and surrender on \nhis party's most cherished accomplishment.''\n  Mr. President, these aren't critiques aimed at the Senators pursuing \nthis strategy. Instead, these are stalwart conservative commentators \nrecognizing the reality of our situation.\n  If the strategy that some of my colleagues are apparently pursuing \nhad even a minor chance at success, I would be the first in line to \nsupport their efforts. Once again, no one wants to see Obamacare \ndefeated more than I do.\n  But, facts are facts.\n  For this strategy to be successful, it would require at least 15 \nSenate Democrats to change their minds and support defunding Obamacare. \nThat is unlikely.\n  It would also require President Obama to sign into law a resolution \ndefunding what he believes is his signature domestic achievement. That \nis even more unlikely.\n  That being the case, I cannot support this strategy. I cannot support \na filibuster of the continuing resolution now before the Senate.\n  The CR does what Republicans want it to do--it defunds Obamacare. I \nurge all my colleagues to vote for cloture on the continuing \nresolution.\n  At the same time, I oppose any effort to strip the language defunding \nObamacare from the resolution and to raise the overall spending levels \nabove those established under the Budget Control Act.\n  Indeed, if, after the Senate invokes cloture on the CR, the Majority \nLeader's amendment is agreed to, I urge my colleagues to vote no on \nfinal passage.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 16, 2013]\n\n                            The Power of 218\n\n\n If House Republicans can't hold together, they have no leverage at all\n\n       Perhaps the only war strategizing more inept than President \n     Obama's on Syria are GOP plans for the budget hostilities \n     this autumn. Republicans are fracturing over tactics, and \n     even over the nature of political reality, which may let Mr. \n     Obama outwit them like a domestic Vladimir Putin.\n       In our view the GOP would be less confused if more House \n     Members appreciated the power of 218. That's the number of \n     votes that makes a majority and it is the only true \n     ``leverage'' Republicans have while Democrats hold the Senate \n     and a Presidential veto.\n       The latest GOP internal dispute is over a continuing \n     resolution to fund the government at sequester-spending \n     levels. The current CR runs out at the end of the month, and \n     about 40 to 50 House Republicans (out of 233) want to attach \n     a rider that either delays or defunds the Affordable Care Act \n     for a year and leaves everything else running.\n       Speaker John Boehner floated a CR with an arcane procedure \n     that would force the Senate to take an up-or-down vote on the \n     anti-ObamaCare component. But pressure groups like Heritage \n     Action and the Club for Growth rebelled and the vote had to \n     be postponed, like so many other unforced retreats this \n     Congress. Here we go again.\n       These critics portrayed the Boehner plan as a sellout \n     because of a campaign that captured the imagination of some \n     conservatives this summer: Republicans must threaten to crash \n     their Zeros into the aircraft carrier of ObamaCare. Their \n     demand is that the House pair the ``must pass'' CR or the \n     debt limit with defunding the health-care bill. Kamikaze \n     missions rarely turn out well, least of all for the pilots.\n       The problem is that Mr. Obama is never, ever going to \n     unwind his signature legacy project of national health care. \n     Ideology aside, it would end his Presidency politically. And \n     if Republicans insist that any spending bill must defund \n     ObamaCare, then a showdown is inevitable that shuts down much \n     of the government. Republicans will claim that Democrats are \n     the ones shutting it down to preserve ObamaCare. Voters may \n     see it differently given the media's liberal sympathies and \n     because the repeal-or-bust crowd provoked the confrontation.\n       With his own popularity fading, Mr. Obama may want a \n     shutdown so he can change the subject to his caricature of \n     GOP zealots who want no government. He'll blame any turmoil \n     or economic fallout on House Republicans, figuring that he \n     can split the tea party from the GOP and that this is the one \n     event that could reinstall Nancy Pelosi as Speaker. Mr. Obama \n     could spend his final two years going out in a blaze of \n     liberal glory.\n       The defunders sketch out an alternative scenario in which \n     Mr. Obama is blamed, and they say we can't know unless \n     Republicans try. But even they admit privately that they \n     really won't succeed in defunding ObamaCare. The best case \n     seems to be that if\n\n[[Page S6985]]\n\n     all Republicans show resolve they'll win over the public in a \n     shutdown, and Democrats will eventually surrender, well, \n     something.\n       If this works it would be the first time. The evidence \n     going back to the Newt Gingrich Congress is that no party can \n     govern from the House, and the Republican Party can't abide \n     the outcry when flights are delayed, national parks close and \n     direct deposits for military spouses stop. Sooner or later \n     the GOP breaks.\n       This all-or-nothing posture also usually results in worse \n     policy. The most recent example was the failure of Mr. \n     Boehner's fiscal cliff ``Plan B'' in December 2012, which was \n     the best the GOP could do because Mr. Obama had the whip hand \n     of automatic tax increases. The fallback deal that was sealed \n     in the Senate raised taxes by more and is now complicating \n     the prospects for tax reform.\n       The backbenchers are heading into another box canyon now. \n     Mr. Boehner is undermined because the other side knows he \n     lacks 218 GOP votes, which empowers House and Senate \n     Democrats. They want to reverse the modest spending \n     discipline of the sequester, and if the House GOP can't hold \n     together on the CR they will succeed. The only chance of any \n     entitlement reform worth the name is if Mr. Boehner can hold \n     his majority and negotiate from strength.\n       We've often supported backbenchers who want to push GOP \n     leaders in a better policy direction, most recently on the \n     farm bill. But it's something else entirely to sabotage any \n     plan with a chance of succeeding and pretend to have \n     ``leverage'' that exists only in the world of townhall \n     applause lines and fundraising letters.\n       The best option now is for the GOP to unite behind a budget \n     strategy that can hold 218 votes, keeping the sequester \n     pressure of discretionary spending cuts on Democrats to come \n     to the table on entitlements. The sequester is a rare policy \n     victory the GOP has extracted from Mr. Obama, and it is \n     squeezing liberal constituencies that depend on federal cash.\n       The backbenchers might even look at the polls showing that \n     the public is now tilting toward Republicans on issues \n     including the economy, ensuring a strong national defense and \n     even health care. Some Republicans think they are sure to \n     hold the House in 2014 no matter what happens because of \n     gerrymandering, but even those levees won't hold if there's a \n     wave of revulsion against the GOP. Marginal seats still \n     matter for controlling Congress. The kamikazes could end up \n     ensuring the return of all-Democratic rule.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 18, 2013]\n\n          Karl Rove: GOP's Self-Defeating `Defunding' Strategy\n\n                             (By Karl Rove)\n\n       In 2010, Republicans took the House of Representatives by \n     gaining 63 seats. They also picked up six U.S. senators and \n     675 state legislators, giving them control of more \n     legislative chambers than any time since 1928. The GOP also \n     won 25 of 40 gubernatorial races in 2009 and 2010.\n       These epic gains happened primarily because independents \n     voted Republican. In 2010, 56% of independents voted for GOP \n     congressional candidates, up from 43% in 2008 and 39% in \n     2006.\n       Today, independents look more like Republicans than \n     Democrats, especially when it comes to health care. In a new \n     Crossroads GPS health-care policy survey conducted in 10 \n     states likely to have competitive Senate races and in House \n     districts that lean Republican or are swing seats, 60% of \n     independents oppose President Obama's Affordable Care Act. If \n     this holds through 2014, then Republicans should receive \n     another big boost in the midterms.\n       There is, however, one issue on which independents disagree \n     with Republicans: using the threat of a government shutdown \n     to defund ObamaCare. By 58% to 30% in the GPS poll, they \n     oppose defunding ObamaCare if that risks even a temporary \n     shutdown.\n       This may be because it is (understandably) hard to see the \n     endgame of the defund strategy. House Republicans could pass \n     a bill that funds the government while killing all ObamaCare \n     spending. But the Democratic Senate could just amend the \n     measure to restore funding and send it back to the House. \n     What then? Even the defund strategy's authors say they don't \n     want a government shutdown. But their approach means we'll \n     get one.\n       After all, avoiding a shutdown would require, first, at \n     least five Senate Democrats voting to defund ObamaCare. But \n     not a single Senate Democrat says he'll do that, and there is \n     no prospect of winning one over.\n       Second, assuming enough Senate Democrats materialize to \n     defund ObamaCare, the measure faces a presidential veto. \n     Republicans would need 54 House Democrats and 21 Senate \n     Democrats to vote to override the president's veto. No \n     sentient being believes that will happen.\n       So what would the public reaction be to a shutdown? Some \n     observers point to the 1995 shutdown, saying the GOP didn't \n     suffer much in the 1996 election. They are partially correct: \n     Republicans did pick up two Senate seats in 1996. But the GOP \n     also lost three House seats, seven of the 11 gubernatorial \n     races that year, a net of 53 state legislative seats and the \n     White House.\n       A shutdown now would have much worse fallout than the one \n     in 1995. Back then, seven of the government's 13 \n     appropriations bills had been signed into law, including the \n     two that funded the military. So most of the government was \n     untouched by the shutdown. Many of the unfunded agencies kept \n     operating at a reduced level for the shutdown's three weeks \n     by using funds from past fiscal years.\n       But this time, no appropriations bills have been signed \n     into law, so no discretionary spending is in place for any \n     part of the federal government. Washington won't be able to \n     pay military families or any other federal employee. While \n     conscientious FBI and Border Patrol agents, prison guards, \n     air-traffic controllers and other federal employees may keep \n     showing up for work, they won't get paychecks, just IOUs.\n       The only agencies allowed to operate with unsalaried \n     employees will be those that meet one or more of the \n     following legal tests: They must be responding to \n     ``imminent'' emergencies involving the safety of human life \n     or the protection of property, be funded by mandatory \n     spending (such as Social Security), have funds from prior \n     fiscal years that have already been obligated, or rely on the \n     constitutional power of the president. Figuring out which \n     agencies meet these tests will be tough, but much of the \n     federal government will lack legal authority to function.\n       But won't voters be swayed by the arguments for defunding? \n     The GPS poll tested the key arguments put forward by \n     advocates of defunding and Mr. Obama's response. Independents \n     went with Mr. Obama's counterpunch 57% to 35%. Voters in \n     Senate battleground states sided with him 59% to 33%. In \n     lean-Republican congressional districts and in swing \n     congressional districts, Mr. Obama won by 56% to 39% and 58% \n     to 33%, respectively. On the other hand, independents support \n     by 51% to 42% delaying ObamaCare's mandate that individuals \n     buy coverage or pay a fine.\n       The desire to strike at ObamaCare is praiseworthy. But any \n     strategy to repeal, delay or replace the law must have a \n     credible chance of succeeding or affecting broad public \n     opinion positively.\n       The defunding strategy doesn't. Going down that road would \n     strengthen the president while alienating independents. It is \n     an ill-conceived tactic, and Republicans should reject \n     it.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have opposed the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act since it was forced through a Democratic-controlled \nCongress without the support of a single Republican in the House or \nSenate. I have voted to dismantle, defund, delay and reverse this law \nevery chance I have been given. I will continue to take every possible \naction that might be effective in achieving its repeal.\n  As the negative impacts of this law become more apparent, people in \nmy State of Mississippi have expressed a great deal of concern about \nhow the law is affecting their families and businesses. They have \narticulated a pronounced unease about the costs of the law, and the \nextent to which the Federal Government will be involved in their \npersonal healthcare decisions. I share their concerns.\n  My constituents recognize that the law is not working as promised. \nThe administration has delayed implementation of several of the law's \nkey provisions. These special exceptions and exemptions are clear \nindications that the law is overly complex and ill-conceived.\n  As their representatives in Washington, we should respect the fact \nthat the majority of Americans do not support this law, otherwise known \nas ``Obamacare.''\n  I dislike Obamacare as much as any of my colleagues. I strongly \nsupport the provisions in this appropriations bill that would bring \nimplementation of Obamacare to a halt. However, to now vote to stop \nthat very bill in its tracks makes little sense to me.\n  Shutting down the government to show how much we dislike the law \nwould not stop Obamacare. The mandates in Obamacare do not go away if \nwe do not fund the rest of the government. Most of the funding to \nimplement Obamacare does not depend on us passing this appropriations \nbill; that funding is mandatory spending that has already been provided \nin law.\n  To stop Obamacare we have to enact a law that does just that. That \nrequires a sufficient number of votes in the House and in the Senate, \nand it requires either the President's signature or a veto-proof \nmajority in both houses. I suspect that we do not currently have the \nvotes in the Senate to pass such legislation. But more importantly, I \ndo not think voting to stall the very language that we opponents of \nObamacare wish to see enacted--and risking a government shutdown as a \nresult--will get us closer to the goal of stopping Obamacare.\n  I think a government shutdown might have the opposite effect. It will\n\n[[Page S6986]]\n\nshift public and media focus away from the costly and damaging aspects \nof the health care law just as it is being fully implemented, and it \nwill detract from the ability of the American people to clearly express \ntheir discontent about the law. It is only such expressions of \ndiscontent that will either change the minds of a sufficient number of \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle, or send new \nrepresentation to Washington to aid in the fight against Obamacare.\n  It is shortsighted for those of us who oppose the Obamacare law to \ntake actions that would not reverse the law's potentially devastating \nimpacts, and will likely damage our prospects of achieving that goal in \nthe future. The stakes are too high.\n  I will continue to fight for our shared end goal--to fully repeal the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, since 2001 I have served as chairman \non three different appropriations subcommittees.\n  I chaired subcommittees on Military Construction and Veterans \nAffairs, the Interior Department, and today the Subcommittee on Energy \nand Water Development.\n  Over the years I made a lot of tough choices on which programs to \nfund and which programs not to fund. But never have things been as bad \nas they are today. The cuts that we are making to our appropriations \nbills under sequestration are strangling programs that must be funded. \nPrograms that are vital to our economy, vital to public safety, and \nprograms that promise to deliver the next breakthroughs in energy \nresearch.\n  To compound the problem, we are now just a few days away from a \ngovernment shutdown that has the potential to devastate our economic \nrecovery and shake the confidence in our government to get anything \ndone.\n  I would like to speak today about the negative effects a shutdown and \ncontinued sequester would have on my subcommittee.\n  The agency within my subcommittee that may have the most direct \nimpact on the public is the Army Corps of Engineers.\n  The Corps safeguards our dams, our levees and our drinking water, it \nkeeps our harbors open for cargo ships, and it maintain more than 4,000 \nrecreation sites. Simply put, a government shutdown would mean the \ntermination of a wide range of vital Corps activities.\n  Work would stop on virtually all construction projects, studies and \nactivities related to flood control and navigation across the country. \nThese important projects protect tens of millions of Americans.\n  A shutdown would mean the Corps stops work on improving dam safety \nprojects including the dam at California's Isabella Lake, the dam most \nat-risk of failure in the State. Halting these projects would endanger \ncitizens and ultimately increase the cost to complete this vital work. \nWhat's more, these projects actually reduce overall costs to the \nfederal government. Damage prevented by Corps projects exceeds $25 \nbillion per year. Other Corps projects interrupted by a shutdown \ninclude strengthening levees and floodwalls to reduce the risk of loss \nof life and economic loss from flooding and coastal storms. Work would \nstop on improvements to flood protection levees along the Mississippi \nRiver, levees that experienced record flood levels in 2011. Projects in \nBoston, Kansas City, and Seattle would be suspended. Even worse, these \nconstruction delays would come at a time when severe storms are causing \ndamage with greater frequency.\n  Even dam safety projects would be affected by a shutdown. One example \nis California's Folsom Dam, where the Corps and the Bureau of \nReclamation are working to increase dam safety. A shutdown would likely \ncause the Corps and Reclamation to suspend contract activities, \ndelaying this vital project. The Folsom Dam is a major component of the \nCentral Valley Project, which provides clean water to more than 20 \nmillion Californians, and should not be put at risk by a government \nshutdown.\n  A shutdown will also have dramatic impacts on water-borne commerce. \nMore than 2.3 billion tons of cargo moves through our marine \ntransportation system. Improvements to channels, harbors and waterways \nensure that this vital traffic flows without pause.\n  Projects at Oakland Harbor in California, Savannah Harbor in Georgia, \nand Charleston Harbor in South Carolina would be impacted by a \nshutdown, meaning higher construction and transportation costs.\n  The country's vast system of inland waterways would also suffer from \na shutdown. More than 600 million tons of cargo move through our inland \nwaterways on commercial ships. A shutdown would mean this cargo would \nbe dramatically slowed, and the use of locks would likely not be \navailable at all to recreational boaters. While facilities on lakes \nthat combine flood control and hydropower would continue to operate \nbecause of safety issues, hydropower operations would likely be \ncurtailed. This means 353 hydropower units operated by the Corps--which \nprovide roughly one-quarter of the country's hydropower--would operate \nat reduced capacity. This would cut into the $1.5 billion in payments \nthe units generate each year.\n  There are also major permitting and operational impacts that would be \nimmediately noticeable. Processing of regulatory permits under the \nClean Water Act, which the Corps handles, would be immediately \nsuspended. In a typical year, the Corps processes more than 80,000 \npermit actions. This means anyone from an individual building a dock to \na community planning a major development would not be able to move \nforward because they won't be able to secure a permit. The Corps would \nalso be unable to provide enforcement actions on existing permitted \nactivities, which could harm sensitive environmental or aquatic \nresources.\n  Another visible effect would be the shuttering of recreation areas. \nThe Corps of Engineers is the largest provider of outdoor recreation \namong all Federal agencies. They maintain more than 4,200 recreation \nsites at 422 projects in 43 states, with more than 370 million visits \neach year. Those visitors spend more than $18 billion annually and \nsupport 350,000 full-time or part-time jobs. All would be suspended by \na government shutdown.\n  The Department of Energy would also face severe limitations under a \nshutdown. Research grants to national labs and universities would be \nsuspended. These grants fund important clean energy challenges related \nto biofuels, supercomputing, and materials research. The output of \nworld-class science facilities on cutting edge research and product \ndevelopment may be significantly reduced. With U.S. leadership in \nscience threatened by China, Japan and Europe, now is not the time to \nsuspend major scientific research.\n  Regarding the national security missions of the National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration, a government shutdown may delay important \nnuclear modernization activities. A government shutdown may disrupt and \ndelay efforts to replace aging components in every single nuclear \nweapon in the stockpile. For example, delays in replacing aging \ncomponents in the W76 submarine-launched warhead--which makes up more \nthan 50 percent of the Nation's nuclear deterrent--would have serious \nimpacts to the Navy's nuclear deterrence mission. Upgrades to aging \ninfrastructure related to uranium, plutonium and high explosives \ncapabilities would also be delayed. Delays of just days can add \nmillions of dollars to a project's bottom line.\n  A government shutdown may also delay the design of a new nuclear \nreactor for the Ohio-class submarine. A shutdown may also delay \nrefueling one of only three training nuclear reactors for sailors, \nwhich is critical for supplying sufficient numbers of sailors to man \nthe U.S. submarine fleet.\n  Finally, a government shutdown will delay and increase costs to clean \nup and remediate nuclear contamination at former nuclear weapons and \nnuclear energy research sites. These activities should be completed as \nquickly as possible to protect human health.\n  I have laid out only a taste of the effects of a government shutdown. \nWhat I cannot begin to convey is the harm to millions of families who \nwould be out of work or whose work would be curtailed because of \ncanceled projects across the country.\n  This is only one of 12 subcommittees. A government shutdown would be \nfolly, and we must prevent it from happening.\n\n[[Page S6987]]\n\n  Before I close, I would like to touch on another threat to the \nagencies funded through my subcommittee, and that is the dangerous and \nongoing cuts forced on us by the sequester.\n  With Congress focused on this immediate threat, we risk losing sight \nof the even more dangerous and long-term consequences of sequestration. \nOnce again, the Energy and Water Appropriations bill provides a fine \nexample of the choices--and dangers--that we face. The Senate bill \nfunds the Corps of Engineers at $5.3 billion.\n  The House bill, based on sequester levels of funding, would slash \nthat by $596 million. This would take money from vital flood control, \necosystem restoration and navigation projects. The House also would not \napprove a single new study or project, further delaying vital flood \nprotection and navigation needs. The sequester would also jeopardize \nsuch vital projects as harbor maintenance and dredging, putting a crimp \non billions of dollars in cargo that moves through our coasts. The \nHouse sequester level also slashes $136 million from the Bureau of \nReclamation's budget, 12 percent lower than the Senate level.\n  One example of what the sequester would cut: The Senate bill directs \nfunds to the WaterSmart Program and the Recycled Water Program, both of \nwhich increase the efficiency of water use in the West. With record-\nbreaking droughts, farmers are desperately in need of more water, but \nthe sequester would dry up these programs.\n  The Senate would also restore funding arbitrarily cut by the House \nfrom restoration programs such as the San Joaquin River Restoration in \nCalifornia. This joint Federal-State-local program was the result of a \nsettlement that ended 17 years of litigation. Defunding the program \ncould force the project back into the courtroom.\n  The House funding level also further weakens U.S. scientific \nleadership and efforts to improve the competitiveness of U.S. \nmanufacturers through the Department of Energy. The House would cut \nfunds for the Office of Sciences by $500 million, the cutting edge work \nof ARPA-E by $329 million, and efficiency and renewable energy programs \nby $1.4 billion.\n  While Europe and Asia invest heavily in renewable energy and basic \nresearch, the House funding under sequester would cut in half our \ninvestments in renewable energy development and by 10% investments in \nbasic research.\n  The government shutdown is a manufactured crisis and it is dangerous. \nThe continuation of the sequester--while less immediate--is arguably \neven more dangerous.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, particularly in \nthe House, will join with Democrats to keep our government operating at \nresponsible levels. We need to make those tough choices, we need to \nkeep the government open and we must repeal sequester.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, everyone knows that the vote we are about to \ntake--cloture on the House-passed continuing resolution--is essentially \na vote to allow the Democrats to gut the House bill. That is why the \nSenate majority leader, the Senator from Nevada Mr. Reid and every \nother Senate Democrat are supporting it.\n  Twenty-one House Members know this is a vote to gut the bill that \nthey passed, that they worked so hard to pass out of the House of \nRepresentatives. That is why they signed a letter yesterday asking the \nSenate Republicans to stand united and vote against cloture on this \nbill.\n  You see, what happened was the House of Representatives, acting \nboldly and nobly and in response to a growing cry from the American \npeople--a cry for help--acted to keep the government funded, to fund \ngovernment while defunding ObamaCare, protecting the American people \nfrom a law they are becoming increasingly aware of; a law that was \npassed 3\\1/2\\ years ago without Members of Congress having read it and \nall of its 2,700 pages; a law that has since led to the promulgation of \n20,000 pages of implementing regulatory text; a law that has since been \nrewritten not just once but twice by the Supreme Court of the United \nStates, which, having concluded that the law as written was \nconstitutionally deficient in two respects, became convinced that it \nwas its duty, its prerogative, and within its power to rewrite the law \nin order to shoehorn it within the provisions of the U.S. Constitution; \na law that has since then been rewritten three or four times by the \nPresident of the United States without any statutory or constitutional \nauthorization to do so--a President who has acknowledged that the \nlegislation, this law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, \nis not ready to be implemented.\n  If the President of the United States is convinced this law is not \nready to be implemented, if the President of the United States, who \npushed this law through Congress 3\\1/2\\ years ago and counts this as \nhis signature legislative accomplishment--if this same President is \nunwilling to follow the law and is convinced it is not ready to be \nimplemented, Congress should not fund it, and Congress should keep the \ngovernment funded while protecting the people from ObamaCare.\n  Millions of Americans are concerned about what this law will do for \nthem. We have seen millions of Americans worried about keeping their \njobs, noticing that jobs are becoming harder and harder to find. Many \nare losing their jobs. Others are seeing their wages cut. Others still \nare seeing their hours cut. Many, including those 20,000 Americans who \nwork for Home Depot who were informed last week--like many other \nAmericans, they will be losing their health coverage.\n  This is why the House of Representatives acted. This is why what the \nHouse of Representatives did by passing this continuing resolution is \nsuch a good thing. It keeps the government funded, and it protects the \nAmerican people from the harmful effects of ObamaCare.\n  Now we get over to the Senate. When it came to the Senate, we saw \nthat the Senate really had a couple of options--a couple of very \nlegitimate options--upon receiving this legislation from the House.\n  The Senate could take up this legislation and subject the legislation \nto an open amendment process, allowing Democrats and Republicans to \nsubmit amendments as they deemed fit, to debate those amendments, \ndiscuss their relative merits, their pros and their cons, and \nultimately vote on them, making compromises and adjustments along the \nway, in the forum that has long been honored and revered in this \ninstitution, which heralds itself as the world's greatest deliberative \nbody. Another option, of course, would be to bring it up for a vote as \nis, an up-or-down vote based on what the House passed. You can vote on \nit as it was passed by the House or you can subject it to an open \namendment process.\n  Either one of those would be fine. If that is what we were looking \nat, I would be voting yes on this cloture vote on this resolution. \nThat, however, is not the option majority leader Harry Reid selected. \nInstead, what he chose was a different procedure whereby he would \nselect a single amendment--one that guts the House-passed bill of its \nmost important provisions--without allowing anyone else the opportunity \neven to present an amendment and have that considered for a vote.\n  The American people are tired of the games that hide the true meaning \nof this kind of tactic, of this kind of vote. So it is incumbent upon \nus to try to explain them as best we can. The people who elect us do \nexpect us to do what we say we are going to do--not sometimes, not just \nwhen it is convenient. In fact, they expect us to do what we say we are \ngoing to do especially when it is inconvenient. That is really what \nthis first vote is about. Cloture on this resolution is about showing \nthe American people that we will do what we say we are going to do even \nwhen--especially when--it is inconvenient.\n  We have the ability to prevent the majority leader, Senator Harry \nReid, from unfairly gutting the House continuing resolution. If we all \nvote no, that is what we will achieve. It is what many of us have \ntold--have promised--the American people we will do.\n\n[[Page S6988]]\n\n  I, along with several of my colleagues, including Senators Ted Cruz, \nMarco Rubio, Rand Paul, and several others, have promised to do \neverything in my power to bring the message that we have received--\nreceived overwhelmingly and repeatedly--from the American people, to \nbring that message inside this Chamber, inside these halls. That is \nwhat this effort has been all about. We promised to do everything we \ncan to improve the procedure and improve the outcome for the American \npeople, taking their message to Washington, incorporating their message \ninto our legislative strategy.\n  Across this great country, Americans stayed up with us this week. \nThey stayed up with us even overnight, choosing to forgo sleep, just to \nshow they were supportive in this effort, and we greatly appreciate \nthat.\n  I want you all who have participated in this effort in one way or \nanother to reflect on how you feel at this very moment. It has been \nsaid that opportunity looks a lot like hard work, how change is hard \nwork, especially here in Washington. This is what it feels like to take \non Washington. This is what it feels like to take on the immense and \nintimidating inertia of big government. This is what it feels like to \ndo what the American people ask and expect and demand. Those of you who \nhave been involved in this effort should be proud, should feel \nenergized and motivated to take on the next big challenge. The American \npeople, of course, expect more and deserve better than what they \nfrequently get from Washington.\n  I wish I could say that the fight that has ensued over the last few \ndays was just about ObamaCare and nothing more. Sadly, ObamaCare is \njust one symptom of a much larger problem. It all stems from the \nsyndrome of self-importance that the political ruling class in \nWashington tends to feel. The bigger problem in Washington is that the \nbigger the problem the American people face, the more people in \nWashington tend to think Washington has all the answers. ObamaCare, \nlike the fiscal cliff, like our $17 trillion debt, like our almost $1 \ntrillion annual deficit, like our $2 trillion annual regulatory \ncompliance costs in this country, all are the natural, inevitable \nresults of a Federal Government that is simply too big and too \nexpensive, that delves far too deeply into the lives of the American \npeople, delves far too deeply into everything from our communications \nto our health care decisions, into everything from what kind of light \nbulbs we use, to how much water our toilets flush.\n  These are deep and personal decisions that are getting deeper and \nmore personal every single day. The American people understand that \nthey are the sovereigns in this country. They are not subjects. We the \npeople are citizens. The government works for us, even though it has \nstarted to feel as though it is the other way around.\n  All these things show what happens when the political elite, not we \nthe people, pretend to be in control. This is not about any one person \nor even any one policy or even one political party. This is about this \ntown and it is about the American people, what they deserve, what they \ndemand, what they expect, and what they have a right to, which is the \nright to live free of undue interference from their national \ngovernment.\n  This vote is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. \nThis is simply the end of the beginning. Washington may appear to have \nthe upper hand at this moment, but it is essential that we remember \nthat the American people will always have the final word.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, 3\\1/2\\ years ago, perhaps reasonable minds \ncould have differed over whether ObamaCare would work. Perhaps \nreasonable minds could have differed over whether it would cripple the \neconomy. Perhaps reasonable minds could have differed over whether it \nwould be devastating to millions of Americans. Today, that is no longer \nthe case.\n  Today, we have seen the impact of ObamaCare. We have seen what it is \ndoing. ObamaCare is a train wreck. It is a nightmare, to use the word \nused by the lead Democratic author in the Senate, and a union leader \nwho previously supported ObamaCare. ObamaCare is the single largest job \nkiller in the country. ObamaCare is forcing Americans all over our \nNation into part-time work, to working 29 hours a week or less.\n  ObamaCare is causing health insurance premiums to skyrocket all over \nthis country. ObamaCare is jeopardizing the health care for millions of \nAmericans, threatening that they will lose their health insurance \naltogether. It, quite simply, is not working.\n  Perhaps saddest of all, the Senate is not listening. The Senate \nDemocrats are not listening to the millions of Americans who are being \nhurt by ObamaCare. If you are a young person right now coming out of \nschool, and finding door after door closed to you because small \nbusinesses are not growing, because jobs are not there, because we have \nthe lower labor force participation in decades, Senate Democrats are \nnot listening to you.\n  If you are a single mom right now, perhaps waiting tables at a diner, \nand you are seeing your hours forcibly reduced to 29 hours a week--29 \nhours a week is not enough to feed your kids. But that is what \nObamaCare is doing to you. Senate Democrats are not listening to you. \nIf you are a recent immigrant trying to raise a young family, working \nhard and seeing your health insurance premiums skyrocket, and you are \nwondering how on Earth you are going to be able to pay these rising \npremiums while still meeting the needs and expense of your young \nfamily, Senate Democrats are not listening to you.\n  If you are retired, if you are a person with disabilities, getting \nnotice from your insurance carrier that the policy is going to be \ndropped because of ObamaCare or if you are concerned that you will be \ngetting notices--so many others across this country have been--Senate \nDemocrats are not listening to you.\n  If you are married and on your spouse's health insurance, and you \nhave received a notice like 15,000 employees at UPS recently received a \nnotice, telling them that their spousal coverage was being dropped, \nthat their husbands and wives were losing their health insurance \nbecause of ObamaCare, Senate Democrats are not listening to you.\n  If you are a union worker working hard to provide for your family to \nseek the American dream, and you are discovering that the health \ninsurance that you liked, that you have worked for, that you have paid \nfor, is going to be taken away from you because of ObamaCare, Senate \nDemocrats are not listening to you.\n  Perhaps some might say, how could it be that this is happening? \nSurely Senate Democrats would listen to the American people if that \nsort of suffering were happening. Well, if you do not take my word for \nit, let me urge you to take the words of James Hoffa, president of the \nTeamsters. I would like to read a portion of a letter Mr. Hoffa wrote \nrecently to Senate majority leader Harry Reid and House minority leader \nNancy Pelosi.\n\n       Dear Leader Reid and Leader Pelosi: When you and the \n     President sought our support for the Affordable Care Act, you \n     pledged that if we liked the health plans we have now, we \n     could keep them. Sadly, that promise is under threat. Right \n     now, unless you and the Obama administration enact an \n     equitable fix, ObamaCare will shatter not only our hard-\n     earned benefits but destroy the foundation of the 40-hour \n     work week that is the backbone of the American middle \n     class.\n\n  That is not me speaking, that is James Hoffa, the president of the \nTeamsters.\n\n       Like millions of other Americans, our members are front-\n     line workers in the American economy. We have been strong \n     supporters of the notion that all Americans should have \n     access to quality, affordable health care. We have also been \n     strong supporters of you.\n\n  I would note this is addressed to Senate majority leader Harry Reid \nand House minority leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\n       In campaign after campaign we have put boots on the ground, \n     gone door-to-door to get out the vote, run phone banks and \n     raised money to secure this vision.\n\n  The vision of a Democratic majority in the Senate. So how is that \nDemocratic majority in the Senate working out for union workers across \nthe country? Well, the next sentence in this letter is:\n\n       Now this vision has come back to haunt us.\n\n  I would note this is the exact same sentiment I expressed a moment \nago. Senate Democrats are not listening to you. The letter continues:\n\n\n[[Page S6989]]\n\n\n       Time is running out. Congress wrote this law; we voted for \n     you. We have a problem. You need to fix it. The unintended \n     consequences of the ACA are severe. Perverse incentives are \n     already creating nightmare scenarios:\n\n  Note that word ``nightmare'' which I started my remarks by quoting. \nThat is not my word, that is the Teamsters describing ObamaCare. \nIndeed, the letter concludes by saying:\n\n       On behalf of the millions of working men and women we \n     represent and the families they support, we can no longer \n     stand silent in the face of the elements of the Affordable \n     Care Act that will destroy the very health and wellbeing of \n     our members along with millions of other hardworking \n     Americans.\n\n  Let me note, No. 1, Mr. Hoffa says millions of working men and women. \nNot hundreds; not thousands; millions. What does Mr. Hoffa say is \nhappening to those millions of working men and women? That their health \ncare is being destroyed. Destroyed is the word he used. What answer do \nwe get today from the Democrats in the Senate? Nothing.\n  President Obama has granted exemptions from this failed law to big \nbusiness and to Members of Congress. So the friends of the \nadministration do not have to bear the burden of the law's collapse, \nbut hard-working Americans, those without lobbyists, without friends in \nthe corridors of power, are getting no exemptions from Senate \nDemocrats. That is wrong.\n  In roughly an hour, if Senators vote as they have announced publicly \nthey intend to vote, this body will vote to put back, to restore the \nfunding for ObamaCare and to gut the House continuing resolution. But \nthe good news is, the process is not over. It is going to go back to \nthe House of Representatives. I salute the House for having the courage \nto stand and fight and defund ObamaCare. I remain confident, hopeful, \nand optimistic that the House will stand their ground, will continue \nthe fight, which means this issue is coming back to the Senate.\n  That is good news. That is good news, No. 1, for Republicans. It is \nunfortunate that there has been Republican division on this issue. When \nit comes back to the Senate after the House stands their ground yet \nagain, we will have an opportunity for Republicans to come home, for \nRepublicans to stand together. I very much hope the next time this \nissue is before this body in a few days, all 46 Republicans are united \nagainst ObamaCare and standing with the American people, that we \nlistened to the American people the way Senate Democrats are not.\n  Let me tell you I hope also that it is not just 46 Republicans. Our \nfriends on the Democratic side of the aisle go home to their States, \nthey listen to their constituents. They are hearing the suffering from \nthe men and women who elected them. It is not easy to disagree with \nyour political party. But at the end of the day, what we are doing here \nis bigger than partisan politics. What we are doing here is fitting for \n300 million Americans across this great country.\n  So I hope when this issue comes back, when the House stands their \nground and sends it back to us, instead of just exercising brute \npolitical power, as this body is getting ready to do, I hope the Senate \nDemocrats begin listening, that they begin listening to young people, \nthat they begin listening to single moms, that they begin listening to \nimmigrants, that they begin listening to people who are retired, people \nwith disabilities, that they begin listening to married people, that \nthey begin listening to union workers, all of whom are suffering under \nObamaCare.\n  This is an opportunity for the Senate to return to the finest \ntraditions of this body, where we listen to and fight for the American \npeople. That has not happened in a long time. But I am very hopeful \nthat we are in the process of seeing it begin to happen now.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am not sure if you have a fax machine at home. Many \nAmericans don't anymore and neither do a lot of small businesses. It \nseems a bit odd to tell small businesses they need to fax in--fax in--\nenrollment forms for ObamaCare, but this is what the Obama \nadministration is now doing.\n  If I might paraphrase the President: The 1980s called, and they want \ntheir health policy back.\n  To be fair, snail mail is also an option and it looks as though the \nPresident's people will try to have the issue fixed soon, despite \npassing a law more than 3 years ago. Again this is the same President \nwho told us that ObamaCare is ``working the way it's supposed to,'' and \nthat those who already have health care won't see many changes under \nthis law. This is the same guy who promised us his health care ideas \nwould make American premiums lower and that they would be able to keep \nthe plans they like.\n  Forgive me for being a little bit skeptical, given how these other \nrosy scenarios have played out. I am not the only skeptic out there. \nJust ask the folks who have already been laid off or seen their hours \ncut. Ask the graduate who can't find anything but part-time work. Ask \nthe twenty-something who is going to lose her employer health plan and \npay more over in the exchanges.\n  The reality simply does not match up with the rhetoric. That includes \nthe President's remarks yesterday in Maryland. He said there is no \n``widespread evidence'' that ObamaCare is hurting jobs. That is \nactually what he said, no ``widespread evidence.''\n  We all know the President was hanging around with Bill Clinton the \nother day. What we didn't know was he was getting pointers on syntax. \nIt makes you wonder what would constitute widespread evidence of job \nloss in this President's mind. I mean, only yesterday his press \nsecretary dismissed reports of a company dropping health insurance for \n55,000 employees as only an ``anecdote.''\n  Maybe that is how things look from the south lawn. It looks a lot \ndifferent if you just lost the health care plan you liked and wanted to \nkeep. As Senator Moynihan used to tell us: Data is the plural of \nanecdote. There are just too many stories about the impact of \nObamaCare, far too many to be dismissed with the wave of a hand.\n  Ironically, the same day the President was painting more rosy \nscenarios in Maryland, the administration announced yet another delay \nin this law's implementation. That is about the time we found out about \nthe fax machines and all that follows the revelation of yet more \nexchange problems, this time with an exchange in the District of \nColumbia. You might be able to take away any one of these ObamaCare \nproblems in isolation and explain it away, say it doesn't matter and \ncall it an anecdote, but what we are getting here is a constant drip, \ndrip, paired with the effect of seeing what is happening to our jobs, \nour health care, and the economy.\n  It all adds up to just one thing: a law in trouble, a law that needs \nto be repealed. This is the goal of every Republican Member here in the \nRepublican Conference in the Senate. We are united on the need to \nrepeal ObamaCare. We want to replace it with sensible, bipartisan forms \nthat actually will work, and in a few minutes each and every one of us \nwill vote against funding ObamaCare.\n  The American people want this repealed. Republicans want it repealed. \nI wouldn't be surprised if a number of our Democratic colleagues \nsecretly want it repealed as well. The problem is we can't get this \ndone unless my friends on the other side are prepared to step up with \nus and work on the issue, because there are 54 of them and 46 of us. \nThis doesn't mean we will give up the fight if they don't. We won't. \nThere are a lot of other things we can do in the meantime.\n  For instance, we can follow the administration's lead in offering \nObamaCare a delay for the American people. After all, the \nadministration seems to think businesses deserve a break from \nObamaCare. Doesn't the middle class deserve the same treatment, the \nvery same treatment? Republicans think so. I think we might be able to \nconvince enough Democrats to join us on that to help us provide \nfairness--fairness to the middle class.\n  Yesterday, one Democratic Senator already signaled his willingness to \ndelay some of the worst aspects of the law as well. He called a delay \nfor the\n\n[[Page S6990]]\n\nAmerican people ``very reasonable and sensible.'' He posed a question: \n``Don't you think it'd be fair?''\n  The answer is: Yes, that would be fair. That is a question for my \nDemocratic colleagues to respond to. Many of them know how badly this \nlaw is hurting their constituents. Isn't that the fair thing to do? Of \ncourse it is.\n  I am calling on Democratic Senators to put the middle class ahead of \nthe President's pride, calling for them to pass a delay for everyone. \nWe have already filed legislation that would do just that. A bipartisan \nmajority of the House already supports it. Let's work together to \nactually do it. Once we get that done, let's keep working to get rid of \nthis law and replace it with real reforms, not with ideas from the \n1980s, but with commonsense, step-by-step reforms that will actually \nlower the cost for the American people and spare them from this \nterrible law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 12:30 \nis reserved for the two leaders, with the final 10 minutes reserved for \nthe majority leader.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. During my time in Washington I have had the opportunity to \nwork with many reasonable, thoughtful Republicans, including those \nserving in this body today. Those reasonable Republicans value this \ninstitution, the Senate, and they respect the government of which it is \na part.\n  Today, the Republican Party has been infected by a small but \ndestructive faction that would rather tear down the House our Founders \nbuilt than govern from it. These extremists are more interested in \nputting on a show, as one Republican colleague put it, than in \nlegislating. That is why they prevented the Senate from taking action \nto avert a government shutdown last night to put on a show today.\n  Despite pleas from the House of Representatives for a quick Senate \naction, that same vocal minority was determined to waste the dwindling \nhours before a government shutdown--1 day, basically, they wasted. \nAlthough every minute that passes puts this country 1 minute closer to \na shutdown, a shutdown that would shatter our economy, they continue to \nobstruct and to delay.\n  A bad day for government is a good day for the anarchists among us, \nthose who believe in no--I repeat, no--government. That is their \nbelief. Modern-day anarchists known as the tea party believe in no \ngovernment. They are backed by a very wealthy group of people who \nfinance this effort to destroy our government.\n  It is important to note these tea party obstructionists don't \nrepresent mainstream Republicans either in this body or mainstream \nRepublicans in our country. But unfortunately their grip on the rudder \nof the Republican Party is very firm.\n\n  For the last few years these radicals in the House and Senate have \ndriven America from crisis to crisis--we lurch from crisis to crisis--\nleaving a trail of economic destruction behind them. Now they have \ntaken the U.S. Government hostage and demanded an impossible ransom--\nthat Democrats repeal the law of this land known as ObamaCare.\n  The Affordable Care Act has been the law of the land for 4 years. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has declared it constitutional and soon it will help \n25 to 35 million people in America who are currently living without \nhealth insurance. It will allow them to get access to the lifesaving \ncare they need and deserve.\n  I don't know if people truly know what it means not to have health \ninsurance, not to have the ability to go to the doctor or hospital when \nthey are sick or hurting. Some of us do. Some of us understand how tens \nof millions of people in America can't go to the hospital when they are \nsick or when they are hurt.\n  When I was a boy--I don't know how old I was, 10 or 11 years old--I \nwas so sick. I can still remember how sick I was. I had been sick for \nquite a long time in the house we lived in. But, you see, we didn't \nhave doctors in Searchlight. There wasn't a doctor for 50 miles and we \nhad no car. I was very sick. We didn't go to doctors. But it was \nobvious I was very ill and so one of my older brothers came to visit \nand he was with a friend. That friend of my brother Don agreed to take \nme to the hospital. So I went to the hospital. I still have the scar. I \nhad a growth on my large intestine. I would have died had I not gone to \nthe hospital. So I know what it is like not to be able to go to the \nhospital or doctor when you are sick.\n  My wonderful mother took in wash. Searchlight had nothing much there, \nbut once, I remember, a TB wagon came through. That was a truck where \nthey would do x-rays of somebody's chest to find out if they had \ntuberculosis because it was still around. People in Searchlight--I \nremember Conn Hudgens and others--had tuberculosis. My dad wouldn't go, \nbut my mother went and had her chest x-rayed. The results came back on \na little card in the mail, and she had tuberculosis. She was positive \nfor tuberculosis.\n  What did we do? What did she do? Nothing. Nothing. As a boy, caring \nabout my mother, I worried so much about that. I can't imagine even to \nthis day how she must have felt. In hindsight, it looks like it was a \nfalse positive, but that didn't take away the concern I had for a long \ntime. So I can't imagine, I repeat, how my mother must have felt.\n  So I have had some view of what it is like not to be able to go to \nthe doctor or hospital when you are sick or hurt.\n  Again, I don't know how old I was, but my little brother, 22 months \nyounger than I am, was coming up on a bicycle and he slid and he was \nhurt. He was crying. I guess he was 10 years old or something like \nthat, and no one was home. So I helped him get up to the house and lie \ndown. I went and found my mother. My brother never, ever went to the \ndoctor, and he had a broken leg. He still has a bent leg to show today. \nHe laid on that bed. He couldn't touch the bed it hurt so much. He laid \nthere until he could get up and walk a week or 10 days later.\n  So these people who just nonchalantly don't focus on the fact that \nmillions of Americans have no health insurance--we can't just walk away \nfrom this. The health care law we have is important.\n  Republicans fought long and hard in opposition to ObamaCare, and they \nlost. It was a fair fight. They made their case against Obama directly \nto the American people in November last year, and they lost again. \nObama won not by a small margin. He won by 5 million votes. What was \nthe main issue in that campaign? It was health care. The American \npeople overwhelmingly reelected the President, and one reason they did \nis because of health care.\n  Yesterday, on this floor, from over there, a colleague of ours, the \nsenior Senator from Arizona, John McCain, spoke with great eloquence \nabout this law, a law he opposes. This is what he said:\n\n       The people spoke. They spoke, much to my dismay, but they \n     spoke and reelected the President of the United States. That \n     doesn't mean we give up our efforts to try to replace and \n     repair ObamaCare. But elections have consequences. The \n     majority of the American people supported the President of \n     the United States and renewed his stewardship of this \n     country. I don't like it. But I think all of us should \n     respect the outcome of elections, which reflect the will of \n     the people.\n\n  Who said this again? Who said this? Who is this John McCain? He is a \nproven fighter, in war and in public service. This is a man who held \nthe mantle of the Republican Party's nomination to be President of the \nUnited States. He is not some gadfly but an American patriot, and \nhistory books will talk about that in generations to come. The \nRepublicans heard his message, for which the Senate and the country \nshould be grateful.\n  So there is challenge this fall, closing in on the end of the fiscal \nyear, for those of us who respect the system of government devised by \nAmerica's Founders, those of us who believe in the rule of law and that \nelections reflect the will of the American people will face a test. Can \nwe prevent an economically disastrous government shutdown, and can we \nprotect the full faith and credit of the United States?\n  From one newspaper--not lots of newspapers, one newspaper--look at \nthe headlines ``GOP hard-liners block strategy to avoid shutdown''; \n``Government shutdown would entail cost''; ``Shutdown could carry pay \nrisk even for employees kept on the job.''\n  One newspaper.\n  ``Agencies prepare to furlough workers in the face of partial \ngovernment shutdown.''\n\n[[Page S6991]]\n\n  ``Shutdown grows more likely as House digs in.''\n  This is from Governor Christy: ``Shutdown would be a failure.'' He \nsays it would be irresponsible.\n  ``As government shutdown looms, Americans brace for possible \ndisruption, disappointment.''\n  Another headline: ``Surrounding jurisdictions develop shutdown game \nplans.''\n  ``Threat of shutdown delays some Colorado flood relief.''\n  Is it any wonder the stock market is going down? Is it any wonder \nthat people are concerned? Is it any wonder that someone such as the \nwoman who works for the Park Service, who came to see me yesterday, \nsaid to me: I have been through this before. I am not going to get paid \nfor my work.\n  So the question is, Can we overcome modern-day anarchists? In just a \nfew minutes the Senate will take the first step toward wresting control \nfrom these extremists. Democrats will vote to avert a government \nshutdown, and I am confident many of my Republican colleagues will vote \nwith us to allow the government to perform its basic duties. Together, \nwe will send a message to radical Republicans that we will not allow \nthe law of the land to be used as a hostage, a law that has been in \nplace for 4 years.\n  I am pleased so many of my Senate Republican colleagues seem to \nunderstand the stakes of this debate--the economic health of a still \nstruggling Nation and the economic well-being of still struggling \nfamilies. I urge sensible Republicans in the House of Representatives \nto follow our lead, to follow the lead of Republicans in the Senate, \nand let the House Democrats vote. Don't just make it a majority-\nminority; let the 435 Members who serve in the House of Representatives \nvote and pass a clean bill to avert a shutdown. Defy the anarchists. \nRespect the rule of the law and help the Senate govern.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time remaining for Senator McConnell \nand myself be yielded back and that we begin the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  All time is yielded back.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, and pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the following cloture motion \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 195, H.J.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the Reid-Mikulski \namendment to the continuing resolution. Our amendment makes two \nimportant changes in the House CR. First the amendment clears out the \ntoxic political item in the House CR--defunding the Affordable Care \nAct. It also removes the debt-limit provision that threatens the full \nfaith and credit of the United States. It changes the date of the CR \nfrom December 15 to November 15 to see if we can't get to vote on an \nomnibus bill and end the sequester.\n  We are out of time. The fiscal year ends in 3 days. Let's pass the \nReid-Mikulski amendment, let's pass the CR, and let's keep America's \ngovernment working as hard as its taxpayers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this is the moment of truth. We need to be \nabsolutely clear about what we are voting on here. A ``yes'' vote will \nbe a vote to fund ObamaCare because it will take out of the underlying \ncontinuing resolution the House position that Republicans have \nuniversally supported to defund ObamaCare.\n\n  I ask my colleagues, before they vote yes on this important \namendment, Do you really want to be responsible for killing more jobs? \nDo you really want to be responsible for more people losing their \nhealth insurance and their own doctors? Do you really want to be \nresponsible for making full-time work part-time work? If not, then vote \nno.\n  This is a second chance, and in life we don't get many second \nchances.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak \nonce again about the floods that were of biblical proportions that \nafflicted our State just a couple of weeks ago and the necessity of \npassing a piece of legislation, as we have done in the past on the \nheels of such natural disasters, that will allow my State to access \nexisting emergency transportation funds more efficiently.\n  This is legislation my colleague and my friend and fellow Coloradan \nSenator Bennet and I have introduced.\n  It is critically important because it will allow us in Colorado to \nbegin rebuilding our battered roads and bridges and highways without \nhaving to wait years for relief. In Colorado, hundreds of miles of \nroads and approximately 50 major bridges have been damaged. I want to \ndisplay one photograph to give you a sense of what happened in \nColorado.\n  I know Senator Bennet is here. I think he and I would agree that this \nis moderate damage represented in this photograph. There are many, many \nother scenes in our State where the roads are completely gone. You \nwould not even know there was a road in the canyon like this one here. \nBut this gives you a sense of what we have to do to repair all of this \ninfrastructure.\n  Many towns, as I am implying, have seen the roads which provide \naccess in and out of their communities severely limited. In fact, there \na couple of communities that have been cut off. But the good news is \nthat there are emergency relief dollars for transportation projects \nthat have already been appropriated. They are available right now.\n  Why do I come to the floor, then, if that is the situation? There is \nan arbitrary statutory cap of $100 million per disaster that applies to \nthose funds. This could limit the flood relief that we receive and then \nunnecessarily delay repairs, not necessarily this year or next year, \nbut for decades. But historically, this is the good news, this \nopportunity we all have, as Members of the House and the Senate, to \nlift this cap. It has routinely been recognized by Congress as an \nunwise impediment to helping States recover, particularly when they are \nhit by the size of this disaster.\n  We have made exceptions to this cap for nearly every natural disaster \nin recent years. We waived it for Hurricanes Gustav, Ike, and Sandy, as \nwell as for the Missouri River Basin flooding in 2011. In other words, \nwhen States are devastated, as we have been by natural disasters, we as \na Congress have said that putting arbitrary impediments in the way of \nrelief efforts just does not make sense, especially--and this is really \nimportant to understand--when no new funds need to be appropriated.\n  The good news is, as I have alluded to, we are not asking Congress to \nappropriate any new money for transportation projects, nor does our \nbill increase budget authority or increase spending by the Federal \nGovernment. We are simply making sure that Colorado has fair access to \nthe program that was created for the very purpose of helping States \nsuch as Colorado rebuild after a natural disaster.\n  In fact, if we do not raise the cap, then we may be in the \nsituation--not just Senator Bennet and I--but the Congress may be in a \nposition where we have to pursue something more serious that does \nrequire money--in other words, additional appropriations.\n  This is critically important. We have to do this. We need to. We must \nprovide Colorado with certainty and relief as soon as possible. I want \nto again underline what happened in Colorado and what we are facing. \nBeginning on September 11, historic rains poured down. We had had a \nheat wave. We had been in the 90s, a very warm spell of weather. \nLiterally overnight, beginning on September 11, historic rains poured \ndown on our State without cessation.\n  Rivers overtopped their banks from Rocky Mountain National Park, \nwhich is our crown jewel in the National Park System in Colorado, all \nthe way out onto the eastern plains. It washed away highways, it \ndrowned family homes, and it transformed entire farms into lakes. \nCreeks such as South Boulder Creek, which runs right behind my home, \nswelled. My neighbors were evacuated. I could not get home for 24 \nhours.\n  Culverts such as those near Commerce City quickly filled with rushing \nwater. Rivers such as the Big Thompson near Estes Park turned into \nwalls of water that devastated entire communities.\n  Let me give you another set of metrics. The affected area covers \nnearly 200 square miles and over 80 percent of our State's population. \nIf we counted--Senator Bennet and I would agree--5 million Coloradans \nthat we represent or 80 percent of our State's population has been \naffected.\n  For a sense of scope--I did not know Senator Murphy would be \npresiding--the floodwaters cover an area the size of Connecticut. Nine \ncounties are considered major disasters. At least 9 Coloradans have \ndied. Thank God it was not more. We had a lot of missing people, but we \nthink we have identified where all of those people are. We lost 9 \nColoradans. Nearly 20,000 homes are damaged or destroyed.\n  Nearly 2,500 people were evacuated by the Colorado National Guard, \nthe most since Hurricane Katrina. Some bit of good news: The muddy \nwaters have begun to recede. That has given us a better look at the \nvast extent of the damage: 200 miles of State highways and 50 bridges \nare damaged or destroyed. Preliminary estimates are that the \ninfrastructure repairs could cost up to $475 million.\n  I come with a heavy heart when I think about all of that. Then I have \nto also confess that this is a natural disaster that is beyond our \ncapacity and Colorado's ability to address alone. We need help. We need \nsupport from our Federal partner.\n  I have always supported disaster aid whether I was serving in the \nHouse, as the presiding officer has, and when I have been in the \nSenate, for Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina and for all of the natural \ndisasters that have hit our country since I began serving in the House \nin 1999.\n  I have to say that Coloradans now need our Federal partner to support \nour rebuilding and recovery efforts. I want also to say, though, in the \nface of this historic disaster, that I have been so heartened to see \nour Federal partners in the administration, led by FEMA, team up with \nour State leaders, who have been tireless, with the mayors, the council \nmembers, the county commissioners, our Governor, local communities, \nnonprofit organizations, and with countless friends and neighbors who \nhave begun the hard work of recovery.\n\n  Our strong sense of community will allow us to recover and to rebuild \nstronger and more resolute than before. But we want to get going. We \nwant to access these dollars right now. Those dollars are sitting in \nthis account, waiting to help States such as Colorado rebuild and \nrepair in the wake of a disaster. In fact, the U.S. Department of \nTransportation--I see our chairman of the EPW Committee, Senator Boxer, \nwho is such a leader on infrastructure and knows infrastructure policy \nbackwards and forwards--the U.S. Department of Transportation projects \nthat Colorado, New York, and New Jersey, plus the 11 other States that \nhave projects in the queue, could receive every single dollar they need \nand there would still be $221 million in remaining funds in this \naccount available for future emergencies across our country.\n  That is right. Everyone who has disaster-related infrastructure needs \ncan receive relief, and we will still have significant funds to help \nother areas that may find themselves in need such as Colorado, New \nYork, and New Jersey.\n  I want my colleagues to know that we have a real opportunity here. \nColoradans need these dollars. These are legitimate uses of these \ndollars. Senator Bennet and I are going to be working every minute \ntoday, this weekend, next week, to make sure that Colorado can recover \nas quickly as possible. Perhaps in light of the challenges that we face \nin Congress, moving the government forward and doing what is right for \nthe American people, maybe this is an example of how we can work \ntogether and do the right thing not just for Colorado but for the \nUnited States.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I would.\n\n[[Page S6994]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wish to say to both of my friends, coming from a State \nthat has experienced too many moments like the one you are going \nthrough, I have never seen anything quite like this in terms of \nflooding. But we have the most devastating fires, droughts, floods, \nmudslides, and earthquakes and the rest.\n  I wanted to be supportive of what you are doing. We all need to come \ntogether and help each other here. So I will do whatever I can to make \nsure that happens.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when my friend Senator Bennet completes \nhis time I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My question to my friend is: Is it not critical that we \navert a government shutdown? Because if we go into a shutdown phase, \npeople who want to apply for help--businesses and all the rest--are \ngoing to be experiencing far more pain. This is just a terrible time to \neven consider a government shutdown. We have so much we have to do. I \nwonder if my friend had thought about that when he voted to keep the \ngovernment open?\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I certainly did. I so appreciate the point the \nSenator from California is making. We have been assured that a shutdown \nwould not affect Colorado. But as we all know there are unintended \nconsequences. Just in the last 24 hours, Senator Bennet and I came to \nunderstand that the Utah National Guard, which was sending over a unit \nthat has engineers and experts in flood recovery, probably cannot come \nto Colorado because their funds are going to be limited by the \ngovernment shutdown.\n  For all of the assurance that this is emergency aid and emergency \nsupport--there are always situations where the full weight, if you \nwill, and the focus of all of those good people who serve us, it is \nlocal, county, State, and Federal Government--they will be affected by \nthis shutdown.\n  It is all the more important. We feel it in Colorado. The other thing \nI would add, and I wish to cede the floor to my good friend Senator \nBennet, but what has been remarkable in Colorado is the partnership \nbetween the local, county, State and Federal governments. It has been \nseamless, for the most part. Then you mix in the NGOs, the Red Cross, \nthe Salvation Army, and citizens who would hear the call and come to \nwork to muck out basements, cut up debris. The spirit of community in \nColorado has never been stronger. We ought to reflect that here. We \nwere sent here to reflect that approach. That is America at its best.\n  I thank the Senator. I very much look to hearing the remarks of my \nfriend and colleague Senator Bennet.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. I wish to first say thanks to the great Senator from \nCalifornia at this time for her words. We need to pull together for \nother places, Sandy and other things. Now it is time for the country to \nembrace Colorado, as my senior Senator so eloquently said. I know he \nmay have to leave the floor, but I wish to say how much I have \nappreciated his leadership in all of this. It has made a huge \ndifference.\n  The work that is really being done is the work on the ground, as \nSenator Udall was saying. That is the most important work--the first \nresponders, neighbors helping neighbors. But it also has been a time \nwhen our political leadership has come together in a way at least for \nonce not to get in the way and actually try to support the people who \nare just trying to serve their friends and neighbors. I wish to say \nthank you to Senator Udall, my senior Senator and my friend, for his \nleadership.\n  As he mentioned, our State is a long way from recovering from the \nfloods that have inflicted so much damage over this month. The damage \nhas been historic. Based on the latest estimates, over 16,000 homes \nhave been seriously damaged. Thousands have been destroyed. The \nfloodwaters consumed more than 2,000 square miles across Colorado's \nFront Range--an area about twice the size of Rhode Island. To give some \nsense of scale, it would be as if Rhode Island were completely \nunderwater twice or, as Senator Mark Udall said, as if it covered a \nState the size of Connecticut. The floods have tragically killed at \nleast nine Coloradans. We hope that number won't go up, but we don't \nknow if it will.\n  Over the weekend I went to Jamestown, which is a small community \nabout 14 miles northwest of Boulder, CO. Tara Schoedinger, the mayor of \nthe town, showed me around. The damage to this one town was simply \nunbelievable. It was as if a bomb had gone off in the middle of this \ncommunity. The flooding destroyed over a fifth of Jamestown's homes, \nhalf of its roads, both of its bridges, a central fire hall, and much \nmore.\n  The storm killed Joe Howlett, age 72, a beloved pillar of the \nJamestown community. The mayor's house is right next to Joe's house. \nThe mayor's house is fine. Joe Howlett's house was destroyed by a \nmudslide that came down from the very top of the hillside, the very top \nof the mountain behind his house, killing somebody who had been the \nglue of that community.\n  I have a couple of photos from the visit that I wish to share to give \na sense of scale of this damage.\n  This used to be Main Street in Jamestown. We can see it passing \nbetween these two utility poles on either side of what is now a raging \nriver. Main Street is gone. It is not the asphalt that is gone; the \nwhole street, the roadbed is gone. All that remains is a torrential \nriver that ran in a completely different place than it does today.\n  This photo shows the end of Main Street in Jamestown. My deputy chief \nof staff took that picture. This is what Main Street used to look like. \nThis is what Main Street in Jamestown, CO, looks like as we stand on \nthe floor of the Senate today.\n  I will say, as the senior Senator is still here, it was amazing, the \nresilience of the people of this community, the sense of humor people \nhad, and the sense of community they had. There were probably 30 people \nor so left out of a town of 300. They had come back to see their \nbelongings and to secure what was left of their homes. What they were \ntalking about was how they were going to rebuild this community \ntogether. There were tears from time to time, as you naturally would \nexpect there to be, but what really came through, as it always does at \nthe back end of these disasters, was the human spirit we see in each \none of our States. We are particularly proud of the Coloradans who are \nstruggling together to get through this incredibly difficult time.\n  In my mind, these are the most heartbreaking pictures, people who \nhave dedicated their lives to being able to secure homes for their \nfamilies.\n  They, by the way, had no expectation there and in other parts of the \nState that they would ever be affected by a flood and see everything \nlost.\n  One woman came up to me while I was there and said, ``this was our \nhouse.''\n  It was in reasonably decent shape compared to some of the others I \nhad seen. She also had a rental property down the road in which she had \ninvested her life savings. She had no flood insurance.\n  She said: I just don't know how we are not going to go broke as a \nresult of this piece of bad luck.\n  I also saw in Evans, CO--a rural community near Greeley in the \nnortheastern part of the State--two trailer parks that had been \nentirely destroyed by floodwaters from 1 mile or 1\\1/4\\ miles away. In \nthe middle of these trailer parks, there was a cement pipe that was \nabout this tall sitting underneath a carport. The thing must have \nweighed tons. It was a huge culvert pipe that had come from 1\\1/2\\ \nmiles away through these raging waters to position itself in this \ntrailer park.\n  The people who live there work in agriculture in our State, clean \nhotels in our community, and work in our oilfields in northeastern \nColorado. When I went to the trailer park, the people were assessing \nthe damage. They have lost everything. Because they couldn't qualify \nfor financing for those trailer homes, they bought them with cash.\n  One person there said: Senator, it is awfully lucky this happened \nduring the day and not at night because our kids were at school during \nthe day. If they had been there at night, we don't know how many of \nthem would have been killed by these floodwaters.\n  In addition to the human dimension of all of this, which is the most \nimportant dimension, the flooding also inflicted enormously costly \ndamage to\n\n[[Page S6995]]\n\nColorado's infrastructure. Over 200 miles of roads in Colorado have \nbeen affected by this flooding. The mountainous terrain in the State is \ngoing to make repair work exponentially more expensive and \nexponentially more difficult. I salute our Governor and everybody who \nis working to make sure that at least temporary roads are built to \nthese communities in the next 90 days, which would otherwise be \ncompletely cut off.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe Colorado Department of Transportation that estimates the total \ndamage just to Colorado's federally maintained roads and highways. \nThese are not our State and local roads; federally maintained roads and \nhighways will exceed $400 million.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                State of Colorado,\n\n\n                                 Department of Transportation,\n\n                                   Denver, CO, September 25, 2013.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner, Majority Leader Reid, Minority Leader \n     Pelosi, and Minority Leader McConnell: As you know, this week \n     Colorado begins the process of rebuilding. Over a dozen \n     Colorado counties were devastated due to record-setting rains \n     and heavy flooding. Today, thousands of our neighbors are \n     without homes, power, or drinking water. For us to begin the \n     rebuilding process, we must repair our roads, bridges, and \n     culverts that were swept away by the floodwaters. We need the \n     help of Congress to begin this process.\n       Multiple counties received over a foot of rain, which \n     turned to floodwater. Those floodwaters destroyed many \n     critical transportation connectors throughout our state. This \n     week, the waters are receding and the Colorado Department of \n     Transportation (CDOT) has begun to assess the damage. At this \n     time, we have identified a number of bridges in need of \n     significant repairs or replacement, and approximately 200 \n     state highway lane miles that washed away. In the interim, \n     CDOT is working with the National Guard to restore access to \n     communities severed from the rest of the state. This includes \n     installing temporary crossing structures and gravel roads.\n       Although cost estimates will certainly change as we \n     continue to inspect our infrastructure, CDOT's early estimate \n     indicates that approximately $475 million is needed to \n     rebuild our highway system. This estimate includes materials, \n     maintenance, reconstruction, and contracting costs. Last \n     week, the Colorado Transportation Commission directed over \n     $100 million--CDOT's entire contingency funding line--to \n     begin reconnecting critical roadways and communities. The \n     Federal Highways Administration (FHWA) also acted swiftly to \n     release $35 million in emergency funds. While these \n     contributions provide critical initial repair funds, CDOT has \n     already secured 19 contractors and have dedicated the \n     advanced funding from the FHWA. It is clear that existing \n     resources are inadequate to fix highway damage of this \n     magnitude. Furthermore, CDOT's $475 million estimate does not \n     include costs to rebuild destroyed city and county roads that \n     are also eligible for FHWA emergency funds.\n       Approximately $1 billion is available from the FHWA \n     Emergency Relief Program. States rely on this program in \n     times of crisis and disaster to provide needed funding to \n     repair federal aid highways. Unfortunately, although adequate \n     funds are available, under the Disaster Relief Appropriations \n     Act of 2013, Colorado may receive no more than $100 million \n     in program relief. This is a significant hurdle for Colorado \n     as we anticipate damages to exceed this limit by four times \n     or more. In recent years, Congress raised the $100 million \n     cap for the most severe disasters. For example, the cap was \n     raised by Congress to $500 million for those states \n     devastated by Hurricane Sandy. And, for Hurricanes Gustav and \n     Ike, the cap was waived entirely for affected states. This \n     flood was of a magnitude that Colorado will likely never see \n     again and the total devastation will easily surpass several \n     billion dollars. For this reason, we urgently need help from \n     Congress.\n       I join Governor John Hickenlooper and the Colorado \n     congressional delegation in asking for your leadership in \n     raising the program limit to $500 million for Colorado. \n     Before Coloradans can begin rebuilding their homes and lives, \n     we must rebuild the roads to their communities. Increasing \n     this cap swiftly is of the utmost importance so that we may \n     restore Colorado's transportation network. Please contact \n     Kurt Morrison at (303) 757-9703 or me should you have \n     questions. Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Donald E. Hunt,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Earlier this year Congress passed funding for Federal \nHighway Administration emergency relief. States such as Colorado that \nhave been hit with significant natural disasters are eligible for \nfunding. Our State will be in desperate need of these funds, as New \nJersey and New York were in desperate need. The scale of the damage far \nexceeds what our States and local governments can cover.\n  As my senior Senator said, there is a catch. There is a cap of $100 \nmillion per incident, per State, on this Federal highway assistance.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nGov. Hickenlooper urging Congress to raise the current cap on emergency \nfunding and explaining why this is something Colorado desperately needs \nto have done.\n                                                State of Colorado,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                   Denver, CO, September 23, 2013.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner, Majority Leader Reid, Minority Leader \n     Pelosi, and Minority Leader McConnell: As you may know, this \n     month massive rains and heavy flooding left over a dozen \n     Colorado counties in devastation. With the rains, highways, \n     bridges, and culverts were washed away. As a result, even now \n     many communities still are cut off and isolated from the rest \n     of the state. Colorado is in dire need of help.\n       Communities across Colorado's Front Range and Eastern \n     Plains are starting to deal with aftermath of the flooding \n     and destruction. The affected counties include Boulder, \n     Adams, Larimer, Weld, Arapahoe, Broomfield, Clear Creek, \n     Denver, El Paso, Fremont, Jefferson, Logan, Morgan, Pueblo, \n     and Washington--an area so expansive, that it surpasses that \n     of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and Rhode Island combined. \n     Early analyses show that the flooding was so severe that it \n     may not occur again for 500 to 1,000 years.\n       Thousands of Colorado families are without homes, potable \n     water, or power. Before the state can fully restore essential \n     services to impacted towns and cities, and allow residents to \n     permanently return home, we must repair our devastated \n     highway system. Early estimates are that at least 50 bridges \n     will need significant repair--30 of which must be fully \n     replaced. Approximately 200 highway lane miles must be \n     reconstructed. Temporary crossing structures are needed in \n     the interim. And, today, numerous state highways and local \n     roads remain closed, cutting off primary, and in some cases \n     the only, access to Colorado cities and towns. Assessing the \n     damage to Colorado's highway system is underway. But early \n     assessments are that the damage will be several hundred \n     million dollars.\n       Under the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013, \n     Public Law 113-2, the U.S. Federal Highways Administration \n     (FHWA) Emergency Relief Program (ERP), received over $2.02 \n     billion to help states rebuild and repair damages to their \n     highways and bridges. In this bill, states impacted by \n     Hurricane Sandy could receive up to $500 million per disaster \n     in ERP funds; however, all remaining states--including \n     Colorado--were capped at $100 million per disaster.\n       Given the widespread devastation to our state highway \n     system, we are respectfully asking that Congress raise this \n     $100 million cap for Colorado as well. As the Colorado \n     congressional delegation stated in a letter to the House and \n     Senate Appropriations Committees, there are precedents for \n     waiving or raising this cap. For example, the $100 million \n     was waived in response to damage caused by Hurricanes Gustav \n     and Ike, and Hurricane Irene and the Missouri River basin \n     flooding. Recently, the cap was raised to $500 million for \n     those states devastated by Hurricane Sandy.\n       Based on Colorado's anticipated highway needs and the \n     precedents mentioned above, we ask that you raise this cap \n     for Colorado. Time and again, Congress has answered the call \n     to help communities during times of disaster and loss. The \n     September 2013 floods may prove to be the worst natural \n     disaster in the history of our state, and is likely the worst \n     we shall ever see in our lifetimes. Before we rebuild our \n     homes and businesses, we must rebuild our roads to reopen our \n     communities. On behalf of all Coloradans, please raise this \n     cap to $500 million, so that we may begin this process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                John Hickenlooper,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Senator Udall and I have a simple bill that would raise \nthe $100 million cap for Colorado for emergency funding for our \nhighways, matching what Congress has done, as Senator Udall has said, \nmany times previously--in fact, as far as I know,\n\n[[Page S6996]]\n\nevery time an issue like this has arisen.\n  We have already talked to the Congressional Budget Office about this. \nThey have looked at the bill. They have told us that it will not cost \nthe Federal Government one dime because the money is already there. It \nhas already been appropriated. It just needs to be used for the purpose \nCongress laid out--to help States with major disasters that inflicted \ncost damage on that State's highway system.\n  Colorado needs this Congress to act, and act now, to get this done so \nthat Colorado can access the highway aid we will clearly need to \nrecover in the coming months.\n  This $100 million cap on emergency funding from the Federal Highway \nAdministration, as I mentioned earlier, has been lifted many times \nbefore. It has been done routinely and swiftly by this Congress \nfollowing other major disasters when it was obvious--as it is in our \ncase--that federally maintained highway costs would exceed $100 \nmillion. We lifted it for the Sandy States, as I have pointed out, \nearlier this year when we passed the Sandy supplemental on January 29, \n2013. We lifted it on November 18 for Hurricane Irene and the Missouri \nRiver basin flooding. We lifted it on September 30, 2008, for \nHurricanes Gustav and Ike. We lifted it on May 25, 2007, for storms in \nthe State of California. We lifted it on December 20, 2005, for \nHurricanes Dennis, Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. All told, Congress has \nwaived this $100 million cap 14 times in the past 25 years. It is \nroutine, and it is normal when there is a major disaster that causes \nmajor highway damage in excess of $100 million.\n  Senator Udall and I have been working with our colleagues in the \nSenate. Nearly all of them have indicated a readiness to work with us \nto pass this bill. I am very grateful for that.\n  I also wish to thank my colleagues for working with us to get this \ndone quickly for Colorado in recognition of how badly we need this cap \nlifted and this Federal funding made available.\n  I urge my colleagues to pull together to work with us to quickly \nclear this bill in the coming days so we can get Coloradans the help \nthey need.\n  If you will indulge me a few more minutes--and if the Senator from \nCalifornia would as well--I wish to take a quick moment to tell you why \nthis is so important.\n  A picture tells a thousand words--especially when I am the one who is \nspeaking. I want to show the damage to Colorado highways as a result of \nthis historic flooding.\n  This photograph was taken during a helicopter tour by Vice President \nBiden, Governor Hickenlooper, and FEMA officials of flood damage in \nGreeley, CO, earlier this week. We can see that a huge portion of the \nroad has washed away and water has breached a dam.\n  I would like to say that FEMA has been doing a tremendous job with \nour local and State officials.\n  This is a section of Highway 72 that collapsed and washed away after \na flash flood tore through Coal Creek near Golden, CO, which is outside \nof Denver--maybe in Golden they would say Denver is outside of Golden. \nThis is what the road looks like there.\n  A bridge on the south side of Lyons is gone. Huge portions have \nbroken off. This is a photo of the bridge that is missing. Here is \nanother shot of large portions of U.S. 34 washed away.\n  This is a very clear example of the way these mountain roads work. In \nthis case, when the prospectors first came to Colorado, what they would \ndo is pan for gold in the bottom of the rivers, near the plains. They \nwould see whether there was gold leaf there. That would lead them to \nwalk up these valleys--very steep valleys--to see where the gold was \ncoming from. They founded towns in these places. That is the way the \nriver came, then the road followed the river, and that allowed them to \nget to their town. You can see in this case this road has been \ncompletely washed out by the river.\n  This is just another instance of mountain roads where we can see the \ndropoff below is what used to be road but no longer is.\n  Here is a roadway that, when this photo was taken, is completely \nsubmerged and with extensive damage. And then this, what used to be a \nribbon of pavement, is now in fragments in the remaining water.\n  In times of disaster in this country, we have stood together time and \ntime again. Working on behalf of the people of Colorado, along with \nSenator Udall, that is what we are asking for again. We have pulled \ntogether with all of our colleagues and we are going to need all of you \nto pull together with us.\n  The Founding Fathers had a lot of work to do and they are often \nquoted around this place, but they were engaged in founding a country, \nnot dismantling one. This is a reminder of why this vision was so \nimportant and why people, frankly, are counting on us to carry this on \nfor this generation of Americans and for the generations that will \nfollow us.\n  With that, I thank the Chair for his indulgence, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The Senator from California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/27/senate-section/article/S6996-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6996-S7000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONING\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me say to my friend from Colorado he is right about a \npicture being so powerful. Having shown my share of those types of \nphotos, I think the Senator underscores why it is important to have a \nnational government. He and his colleague from Colorado makes the \npoint, as did the Senators from New Jersey, New York, and California--\nregardless of party--that many times these natural disasters are just \ntoo much for any one State, and that is why we need a national \ngovernment that works well, not one that teeters on the brink of \nshutdown because political parties get into these partisan disputes and \nseem to lose their way.\n  As one who feels we have a very clear path ahead, there is no reason \nfor us to add to the uncertainty the people in Colorado face right now \nbecause we don't have that particular funding laid out clearly at this \npoint. We don't need to add a layer of fear that this government is not \ngoing to function. So I wish to thank my friend.\n  But I will say that we did vote 54 to 44 in the Senate to keep the \ngovernment open and to make sure we don't get involved in clashes about \nother matters and add it to the resolution that keeps this government \ngoing.\n  Listen, there is no shortage of arguments we could have. Even within \nour own parties there are different views on many issues: how best to \nbring this economy back, how best to reform education, how best to have \na very strong, lean military--we have arguments about all these \nthings--how to deliver health care. All these things are worthy of \ndebate, but they should remain separate and apart from our basic \nfunctions, one of which is to keep the government running and doing the \nthings government does, and the second is to pay our bills, which \nrequires us to make sure the debt limit is raised. When we see games \nbeing played in these areas, we know we are in deep trouble.\n  I see our leader Senator Reid is on the floor. With his leadership we \npassed a bill to keep the government open. All John Boehner has to do, \nas Speaker of the House--and I know the House well. I served there for \n10 years--is to put our bill on the floor and let the Members vote. \nThat is democracy. We don't have to have every Republican support it. \nWe don't have to have every Democrat support it. Just put the bill on \nthe floor.\n  When I served in the House I served with many different Speakers. I \nhave to say, in my time, Tip O'Neill was the greatest. Why was Tip \nO'Neill great and why can John Boehner learn from Tip O'Neill? Because \nTip O'Neill knew what his function was. It was to keep this country \ngoing. It was to give a sense of certainty and calm to the people that \neven though we could debate all kinds of things, including whether to \ngo to war or how to deal with many problems, we would keep the \ngovernment going. We would pay our debts.\n  When Tip O'Neill was Speaker, Republican Ronald Reagan asked Tip \nO'Neill to increase the debt ceiling many times. Over the period Reagan \nwas President, he asked to raise the debt ceiling 18 times. Did all of \nus agree the debt ceiling should be lifted? No. A few voted no, and \nthat was fine. No one played games. Ronald Reagan was very clear on the \ndebt ceiling. He said even any talk about not raising it was a problem \nfor this economy, and he\n\n[[Page S6997]]\n\nsaid it way more eloquently than I, being the great communicator. He \nsaid even the thought of a default was dangerous for our economy. Yet \nhere we have Republicans, in the House in particular, marching down \nthat path and also marching down the path right now to shut down this \ngovernment. We are just a few short days away.\n  I don't know about the Chair, but I know I did have a meeting with my \nstaff to explain what could happen. People act as if a government \nshutdown doesn't mean pain. It is a dangerous game and it has \ndevastating consequences for our families and not only for the people \nwho rely on their work for their country--whether they are serving on \nthe military or civilian side of the Defense establishment or in the \nSocial Security Administration or the Medicare administration or the \nFBI or the food inspectors or the highway inspectors.\n  I have to say, Republicans keep saying: We don't want to shut down \nthe government. Believe me, we don't want to shut down the government. \nWe just want to stop the Affordable Care Act. You tried 42 times. You \nhad an election over it. Give it up. This is a democracy. Run \ncandidates who want to repeal it. That is fine. That is fine. We had \nthat in the last election and President Obama won. I know people aren't \nhappy about it. I understand that. I wasn't happy when Republicans beat \nmy Democratic candidates for President. I wasn't happy, but I didn't \nshut down the government. I didn't demand their signature \naccomplishments be repealed. I lived with it, and I am not the only \none. We all did. We all accepted it.\n  That is democracy. You have an election. There are winners and \nlosers. Suck it up. Stop complaining. Go register your friends. Tell \nthem to vote against Barbara Boxer. Go tell them to vote against the \nDemocrats. Go do it. That is fine. That is what elections are for. But \nonce the election is over--and in this last case it was a central \nissue--work with us to make it better.\n  Senator Cardin and I were on the floor the other day pointing out we \nvoted against the prescription drug benefit for Medicare for basically \ntwo reasons; one, we thought it was going to cost too much money for \nthe government because in there it said Medicare could not negotiate \nfor lower drug prices. So it was a giveaway to the drug companies. They \ncouldn't negotiate for lower drug prices. Also, there was a great big \ndoughnut hole so after you got a certain amount of drugs, you got no \nbenefit at all, and seniors were risking their lives to get through \nthat period of time.\n  We didn't try to repeal the prescription drug benefit; we tried to \nfix it. Here is the great news. In the Affordable Care Act, also known \nas ObamaCare, we fixed the doughnut hole. We are closing it. Now senior \ncitizens are not going to have to cut their pills in little pieces \nwhile they wait for that doughnut hole period of time to pass.\n  So there are a lot of pathways forward for the Republicans in the \nHouse. Follow history and tradition, which says we have two basic \nthings we must do: keep this government open and pay the bills that we \nincur. Simple. It is not complicated. If anyone tells you it is \ncomplicated, laugh, because it isn't.\n  If you are a family and you incur bills, you pay them or you are a \ndeadbeat. In the old days, people used to go to jail. We stopped that. \nNow we have bankruptcy filings. Pay your bills, Republicans. Pay your \nbills. Keep the government going--a very simple path. Take the bill we \njust passed. It is neutral. It has no policy in it. It keeps the \nspending going. We haven't added any of our wonderful things we would \nlike to see and do. We kept it clean. Put that bill on the floor--it \npassed 54 to 44 here--and vote on it. People who want to shut down the \ngovernment will vote no. That is their right. People who want to keep \nthe government open will vote yes. There will be Republicans on either \nside. There will be Democrats on either side.\n  What we hear happening is they are going to bring it back and they \nare going to put more of their favorite things in it. Who knows what \nthey will pick. They have a lot. They want to shut down the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. They want to stop us from cleaning up \nthe air and the water. They want to stop us from addressing the issue \nof coal ash piling up all over the country. That is what they want to \ndo, from what I read in the paper. Then they want to delay this health \ncare bill, just as it is about ready to kick in.\n  We have been down this road before. We know what happens when the \ngovernment shuts down. I asked my staff to go back, to go to the press \nand look at the stories. I am not speaking make believe. I am speaking \nhistory. When Newt Gingrich and the Republicans shut down the \ngovernment in the 1990s, we all know what happened. It hurt our \ncountry. It hurt our economy. It hurt our seniors, our veterans, our \nbusinesses. It hurt anyone who even had 100 shares of stock in the \nstock market. It hurt the American people.\n  Mark Zandi, an economist who advised Republican Members of the \nSenate, predicts a shutdown lasting just a few days would reduce our \ngross domestic product by two-tenths of a point.\n  How does that help us when our economic growth is curtailed by a \nshutdown? How does it help our economy when more than 169,000 Federal \nemployees in my State and many more nationwide are furloughed without \npay? It will be more than 1 million Federal employees and 169,000 in \nCalifornia. These are real people, with real families, with real bills \nto pay who get up and go to work for their Nation. How does that help \nour economy?\n  We know the last shutdown cost the Federal Government $1.4 billion. \nIf we factor in inflation, that is $2 billion, and that was for 2 \nweeks. A 2-week shutdown cost $2 billion. Great, just what we need to \ndo--throw money out the window. Because we can afford it, right? No.\n  Agencies are making their shutdown plans. Federal employees are \npreparing to be furloughed. You know what happens when you get scared \nyou will not get a paycheck? You pull in. You don't go out to the \nmovies and you don't go out for dinner because you are worried. That \nhas a trickle-down effect on small businesses.\n  How does it help our seniors when the Social Security Administration, \nduring a shutdown, cannot process benefits for retirees? What happens \nif someone is widowed and she needs the help from Social Security to \nget those burial benefits she is entitled to? Is that making the \nRepublicans excited over there, to hurt our seniors with Medicare, with \nSocial Security?\n  Medicare can't take any new patients because they won't be able to. \nIn the last shutdown, 10,000 people a day were turned away. People who \nwere waiting to turn 65 so they could get their Medicare card called up \nMedicare, and no one is there. Sorry. Oh, that is a lovely thing to do \nto your mothers and dads, I say to my colleagues over there. Lovely.\n  How does it help our veterans and their families when a new \ndisability claim or GI bill claim cannot be processed? I can tell you, \nit hurts them. There is already a huge backlog. This is just what we \ndon't need, a shutdown, where the backlog of claims gets worse and \nworse. We all say we love our veterans, and I believe it when we say \nthat. Don't shut down the government and hurt our veterans.\n  Republicans say they care about small businesses more than Democrats. \nHow does it help our small businesses when they can't bid on government \ncontracts or get small business loans through the SBA? I tell you, it \nhurts them. How is it going to help the more than 14,000 government \ncontractors in California who may not get paid for their work on time? \nThey will be hurt badly. They have bills to pay, they have employees to \npay, and they won't be able to pay them. If you ask the average working \nperson how close they are to seriously being homeless, not being able \nto pay the rent, it is only a few weeks for a lot of our people.\n  I would ask, how does it help our health in this country when the EPA \ncannot clean up toxic superfund sites? Those sites harm our families, \nthey harm our children, and they will be shut down.\n  How does it help our fight against cancer and Alzheimer's when the \nNIH cannot enroll patients in drug trials? If you ask people who the \nreal enemies are, a lot of times they will say we worry about someone \nin the family getting a heart attack, getting a stroke, getting \nAlzheimer's. How does it help our families when the NIH can't enroll \npatients in drug trials and the CDC can no longer monitor new avian flu \ncases?\n  And tell me, Republicans who want to shut down this government, how\n\n[[Page S6998]]\n\ndoes it help our businesses like our restaurateurs and people who run \nhotels when tourist visas cannot be processed and people who are \nwaiting to come to America to stay in our hotels are turned away? That \nis bad for this economy.\n  How does it help a family buy a house when the FHA can't process a \nloan for the American dream of owning a home? But that is what is going \nto happen.\n  And tell me, how does it help a single mom when she can't get help \nfrom HHS in collecting child support to feed her family? How does it \nhelp the families in Colorado, their homes and roads and bridges \ndestroyed, when the National Guard--we just learned from Senator \nUdall--cannot start their work until the government reopens? It is \ndownright dangerous.\n  How does it help our schoolkids who come to Washington to learn about \nour great Nation, they go to the Mall, and they can't get in any \nmuseums?\n  And do we want to hear the ultimate outrage? These Senate and House \nMembers who want to shut down the government will get paid during a \ngovernment shutdown that they caused. These Senate and House Members \nwho want to shut down the government--they personally will still get \npaid. Their families will have a paycheck during a government shutdown.\n  In March of 2011, the Senate passed S. 388, the Boxer-Casey bill, to \nprevent Members of Congress from getting paid in the event of a \ngovernment shutdown or a default. It is a very simple bill:\n\n       Members of Congress and the President shall not receive \n     basic pay for any period in which there is more than a 24-\n     hour lapse in appropriations for any Federal agency or \n     department as a result of a failure to enact a regular \n     appropriations bill or a continuing resolution; or if the \n     Federal Government is unable to make payments or meet \n     obligations because the debt limit has been reached.\n\n  Our bill, I am proud to say, passed the Senate. Senator Casey and I \nwrote a letter--signed by 14 of our colleagues--to Speaker Boehner and \nthe Republicans, asking that they bring up and pass our bill. In that \nletter we said:\n\n       Members who want to shut down the government should not \n     continue to receive a paycheck while the rest of the Nation \n     suffers the consequences. Members of Congress and the \n     President should be treated no differently than every other \n     Federal employee. We too should have to face the consequences \n     of our actions.\n\n  Speaker Boehner had time to put lots of other things on the docket, \nbut not our bill. So we introduced a new one. I am here to say we have \na bill that is called S. 55. It says the same thing, we are not going \nto get paid if we don't do the two basic functions we have to do: keep \nthis government running, and raise the debt ceiling.\n  I want to ask: How is it that Republicans, who are urging a shutdown \nof the government by virtue of their votes--and we have them in the \nSenate--why are they not cosponsors of our bill? They don't care if the \ngovernment is shut down. Get on my bill. I invite Senator Cruz and \nSenator Lee. They spoke for 21 hours. That took a lot of strength. \nMaybe they have strength left to pick up the phone and call me and go \non my bill so they won't get paid, because as of now they will. They \nwant to protect their pay. They want to protect their families.\n  Some of them even suggest taking away the employer contribution from \nour staff, that is treated like almost every other employee with a big \nemployer, an employer contribution to health care. They want to take it \naway, but they want to get paid during a shutdown.\n  So pick up the phone, Senator Cruz, and call me. I will be delighted \nto hear from you, and let me put you on my bill because that would be \nhelpful. Then we can e-mail all of your friends and tell them to get \neverybody else on the bill. And maybe, just maybe, we can make a little \nsacrifice if things go wrong.\n  By the way, there is no reason for things to go wrong. We just passed \na good bill, a clean bill. We know we are going to have arguments over \nhealth care, we are going to have arguments over Social Security, we \nare going to have arguments over the best way to move forward \nwith sequester. That is fine. There is a time and a place. You don't \nput those issues on a continuing resolution to fund the government. You \ndon't put those issues on a debt ceiling and, as Ronald Reagan said, \nput our economy in a very dangerous and precarious situation.\n\n  If you listened to the speeches of my colleagues, the 21-hour speech, \nand if you take away the time that was devoted to Dr. Seuss, most of it \nwas about the Affordable Care Act. So I think we ought to take a look \nat the Affordable Care Act. This is the terrible piece of legislation \nthat certain colleagues of the Republican side say is so terrible they \nare willing to shut the government down:\n  Right now, because of the Affordable Care Act, 3 million young adults \nare on their parents' plan. Isn't that terrible? Three million of them \ncan stay on their parents' plan. I want to know why they would shut \ndown the government and kick those youngsters off their parents' plan, \nbecause that is what they will do. They don't tell you that, but we \nwon't be able to enforce this law. We won't have the funds. They would \nkick these kids off their parents' plan because, frankly, the law would \nin effect be suspended. And if an insurance company said, We are not \ngoing to do this anymore, those youngsters are out of luck. So that is \nthe first question I ask them: Why do you want to kick 3 million \nyoungsters off their parents' plan?\n  Now 71 million Americans are getting free preventive care, such as \ncheckups, birth control, and immunizations. Now when you don't fund \nthis bill, delay it, or fool around with it, forget this. So now 71 \nmillion people who could have gotten immunized don't get immunized, a \ngood bunch of them, because they can't afford it--under the Affordable \nCare Act it is free--then they get sick and then others catch what they \nget. Tell me how that makes America a better place. I am waiting to \nhear. No one has told me how it makes America a better place when we \nkick children off their parents' plan or we take away immunization or \nbirth control or checkups from our people.\n  I mentioned this before. Senator King was talking about how when he \nwas a youngster he worked here and he had health insurance, and the \nhealth insurance allowed him to get a free medical checkup. He got a \nfree checkup, and he found out that he had a melanoma, a mole that had \ngone cancerous. It was very serious. He was a youngster. This is a long \ntime ago for him. As a result of that, he is with us today, living and \nwell and here to fight for health care. That is a story we should think \nabout. Because he went to the doctor, the doctor looked at him and \nfound this mole, he got that mole removed, and he is alive.\n  Tell me why Republicans want to take away free preventive care from \n71 million Americans. That is what the Affordable Care Act does. They \ncall it ObamaCare because they polled it, and when they say ObamaCare, \nit is less popular. So I will call it ObamaCare. I thought the \nPresident was funny when he said that after this law is out there a few \nyears and people like it, the Republicans will stop calling it \nObamaCare, a moment of levity that had a lot of truth to it.\n  This is another benefit the Republicans would delay, stop, and put in \njeopardy. They will even shut the government down. They don't like the \nfact that 17 million children with preexisting conditions such as \nasthma and diabetes can no longer be denied coverage. So I have to ask \nthem, What is it you have against kids? I have met the parents. If a \nchild had diabetes, if a child had asthma, the insurance company said, \nSorry, you are out of luck. Because of the Affordable Care Act, \nObamaCare, children can no longer be denied coverage.\n  I have met these little kids who have benefited, who have gotten the \ncare, who are doing well because the moms and dads don't have to wait \nuntil they are gasping for air or have an absolute breakdown and then \nthey have to rush them to the emergency room where they are patched up \nand don't get the kind of care they need.\n  Here is another thing. I don't understand why the Republicans feel it \nis a good thing for insurance companies to be able to cancel your \nhealth insurance when you get sick. That is what used to happen before \nObamaCare, before the Affordable Care Act. Remember, this law has been \nin effect for 3 years, so all these benefits have gone into play. No \nmore lifetime limits.\n  I remember once looking at our insurance policy many years ago that \nmy\n\n[[Page S6999]]\n\nhusband got through his employer, and we thought it was a great plan. \nThen we looked at the little print that said when you reach a cap of \n$250,000, no more health insurance. Anyone who has the misfortune to \nget a serious condition, a disease, can bump up against that cap fast \nand you have no more insurance until, you pray to God, you are 65 and \nyou can get Medicare. We immediately said we have to look for a \ndifferent policy that has no caps--and of course it costs more. Under \nObamaCare or the Affordable Care Act, no more lifetime limits, no more \nannual limits. The Republicans are so distraught at these reforms they \nare even willing to shut down the government. They are willing to delay \nObamaCare. They are willing to defund ObamaCare. They are willing to \nrepeal ObamaCare.\n\n  Let me tell you, this is a pattern. I am going to tell you the \npattern. I am going to show you what happened when a Democratic \nPresident in the 1960s came up with the idea for Medicare. I am going \nto tell you what the Republicans said then. This is not something that \njust happened to the Republican Party. They have been fighting these \nkinds of benefits, I think, for decades. They fought Social Security in \nthe 1930s. But I will go to Medicare. Dick Armey said in 1995--he was \nRepublican House majority leader. He had Eric Cantor's job. He said \nMedicare is ``a program I would have no part of in a free world.''\n  Earth to senior citizens: Wake up. The Republican leader of the House \nin 1995 said Medicare is ``a program I would have no part of in a free \nworld.'' That same year, after leading an effort to raise premiums and \ncosts for senior citizens, Newt Gingrich predicted that Medicare was \n``going to wither on the vine.''\n  So when you hear these Republicans rail against ObamaCare, they \nrailed against Medicare. They railed against Social Security. This is \nhistory. This is why there is a difference in the parties.\n  Listen to this. In 1965, this is what Senator Bob Dole said on the \nfloor. Remember he bragged about this in 1996 during the Medicare \nfight. He said ``I was there, fighting the fight, voting against \nMedicare, because we knew it wouldn't work in 1965.''\n  Really? The Republicans knew that Medicare wouldn't work in 1965. \nHere it is, 2013, and people are saying: Don't you mess with my \nMedicare. Don't you touch it. Whether they are tea partiers or \nrightwing Republicans, moderate Republicans, liberal Republicans, \nDemocrats--from left to right, they all say don't mess with my \nMedicare. Look at where the Republicans were. Don't forget, Paul Ryan's \nbudget destroys Medicare. It would never look the same if he had his \nway.\n  I will even go back further in history and show you some of the \nthings that the Republicans said about Medicare when it was brought to \nus by the Democrats. Sixty percent of the Republicans in the Senate \nvoted against it, and one Representative, Durwood Hall of Missouri \nsaid:\n\n       We cannot stand idly by now, as the nation is urged to \n     embark on an ill-conceived adventure in government medicine\n\n  --that's what he called Medicare--\n\n     the end of which no one can see, and from which the patient \n     is certain to be the ultimate sufferer.\n\n  This man had it wrong. People love their Medicare. People tell me \nthey are down on their hands and knees, praying to get the Medicare \ncard, hoping they can hold out. Republicans have had it wrong. Why \nshould we trust them and believe them when they say the Affordable Care \nAct is no good when we already see how many people it is helping?\n  Then there was Senator Milward Simpson, way back when, in the 1960s. \nHe said:\n\n       I am disturbed about the effect this legislation would have \n     upon our economy and upon our private insurance system.\n\n  He didn't have to be concerned. Medicare has worked beautifully. In \nthe Affordable Care Act we make it better. We fix the prescription drug \nbenefit. We make sure that our people on Medicare can have free \ncheckups and immunizations. We strengthened it.\n  Let's look at Medicare's success. Before Medicare became law, the \nmajority of seniors had no health insurance. Today nearly all seniors, \n50 million, are receiving guaranteed health care through Medicare, and \n80 percent of folks on Medicare believe the program is working. If you \nlook over history, over the years Medicare has been more successful \nthan private insurers at holding down health care costs.\n  Let me sum up. What we saw here today is some good news. Working with \nour Republicans, we managed to bring up a bill and modify it and make \nit clean, strip it of any kind of debate, and fund the government until \nthe middle of November. That will give Senator Murray time to sit down \nwith her counterparts and try to get a long-term solution.\n  If you want a long-term solution to our deficit and debt, you have to \nhave a budget. Yet Republicans over here have stopped us from going to \nconference. Once this is done we can have a conference move forward, a \ndebate go forward. Let's keep these arguments where they belong, which \nis separate and apart from keeping the government going. Let's keep \nthese separate and apart from paying the bills we have already \nincurred.\n  I also want to say this. If you listen to Republicans, you would \nthink this deficit has gone up under President Obama. President Obama \ninherited a $1.2 trillion deficit. It is now down. It has been cut in \nhalf. But if you listen to them, you think: Oh my God, everything is \nawful. I took a look at the charts. I took a look at deficits under \nDemocratic and Republican Presidents. Oh my God, I am so proud to be a \nDemocrat. Under Democratic Presidents we have had surpluses. Under Bill \nClinton we had surpluses. As soon as the Republicans took over, \nPresident George W. Bush said, I am going to have a party. I am going \nto put 2 wars on the credit card. I am going to give the biggest tax \ncuts to billionaires and millionaires. Do know what happened? We had a \ncrisis. Not only the worst recession since the Great Depression, but \nthe deficit skyrocketed.\n  All those supply-side economists were proven wrong. Give tax cuts to \nthe mightiest among us and the deficit will go down. That is voodoo \neconomics, as it was once called by a really good Republican President. \nThat is voodoo economics.\n  You are going to hear all kinds of things today in these speeches. \nBut history is history. Bill Clinton had the surplus. George Bush \nturned it into the worst deficit in history. Barack Obama cut that in \nhalf. He rescued us with the Democrats and some brave Republicans who \nvoted for economic stimulus--thank the Lord. And we are getting out of \nthis mess.\n  Now we have Republicans, on the far right in the House, who are \nholding our country hostage because they do not like the Affordable \nCare Act, otherwise known as ObamaCare. They voted 42 times to repeal \nit. They are ignoring the fact that we had an election about it, and \nthey are ignoring the fact that they do not run the Senate or the White \nHouse. They run one-third of the government. Fine. God bless them. But \nthey have to work with us, not against us. We need to work together.\n\n  I served 10 proud years over there. I have never seen a situation \nwhere you are stopped from making any progress because 20 people belong \nto the tea party and are threatening the Speaker. The Speaker has to \nact like the Speaker of the House. He is not the Speaker of the \nRepublicans, he is the Speaker of the House. Take our bill that just \npassed and put it on the floor. Some will vote aye, some will vote nay. \nLet's see what happens.\n  Meanwhile, there are a lot of people who are very worried today. They \nare worried that this government is going to shut down. They are \nworried that when they call about their Social Security check, if they \nhave a problem, no one will be there. They are worried, if they have a \nproblem, and they want to sign up for Medicare--no one will be there. \nThey are concerned that their FBI agents are furloughed. They are \nconcerned.\n  Maybe this concern may not sound like a big deal, but they saved for \n2 years to take their kids to the Capitol, and they want to take them \nto all the great museums and the national parks and they are closed.\n  Why is this happening? Self-inflicted wound, self- inflicted wound.\n  Do your job. For God's sake, don't get paid if you can't keep the \ngovernment open. Sign on in this body to S. 55 and say I won't get paid \nif the government shuts down. Tell Speaker Boehner to do that. They did \nit over there\n\n[[Page S7000]]\n\nfor the budget. They said if we didn't pass a budget we should not get \npaid. We did pass a budget. Now they won't let us go to conference and \nfinish the work.\n  What a mess we are in--self-inflicted--because people are in denial \naround here that there was an election. It was about health care. It \nwas about being moderate. It was about working together. It was about \ncompromise. It was not about who is the Presidential candidate who \ncould lead us into the darkness and despair of complete warfare.\n  Let's end that warfare. We showed we could do it today. I thank my \nRepublican colleagues who voted to allow us to offer our amendment. I \nappreciate it so much. I know they are getting yelled at. They should \nbe praised. But it shows, right here in this Senate, that we can come \ntogether. We may not like our options or our choices. Believe me, I do \nnot like the amount of money we are spending to run the government. It \nis really hurting my people back home. But I am not going to shut down \nthe government about it.\n  Madam President, you are such a great new addition to the Senate. I \nam disappointed that you are not able to unleash your legislative \nprowess and move us forward, but we will get past this if we can work \ntogether.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/27/senate-section/article/S7000-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7000-S7002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I want to share some remarks about the \ncomments. I want to say Senator Boxer is a great advocate and does a \ngood job as chair of our Committee on the Environment and Public Works. \nPretty much we have had unanimous votes on bills that came out, \nRepublicans and Democrats voting unanimously on the bills that came \nout. Sometimes we have differences and we fight over them, but a lot of \ntimes things are getting done around here.\n  But I will just say it is not actually fully correct to say the \nRepublicans opposed the President's health care bill, the Affordable \nCare Act, ObamaCare. The American people opposed it by huge numbers. \nThey, through an election, a remarkable election, and in some very \nclose wins, found themselves with 60 votes in the Senate of the United \nStates. They had a majority in the House, and they decided to move this \nbill. They shut out Republicans, moved a partisan bill, and they got it \nthrough--even when Scott Brown, if you remember, was running for the \nSenate in Massachusetts to fill the late Senator Kennedy's seat. He \npromised he would be the vote that would deny the 60 votes and stop \nthis bill, and he won in Massachusetts. But he couldn't get here \nquickly enough. They were able to get the bill passed before he got \nhere to kill it.\n  This has never been a popular bill and the polling number shows it is \neven less popular today than it was when they rammed it through. So \nthis is not a little bitty matter. It threatens our Republic, I think, \nin a lot of different ways. I have talked about that earlier. But I \nwould say--to understand the dynamics on the floor of the Senate--you \nhave to understand that the majority leader, having gotten his bill \npassed on Christmas Eve 2009, after all kinds of maneuvers to get that \naccomplished, has protected it from any further debate and discussion. \nHe has blocked any ability to bring up the legislation and to be able \nto amend it and fix some of the obvious flaws in it. One of the top \ndrafters, the Senate Democratic chairman of the Finance Committee, has \ncalled it a train wreck, and it at least at needs reform. It really \ncannot succeed in its present form. Senator Reid has blocked any effort \nto bring up a bill and fix it. The American people might find that hard \nto believe, but I will repeat it: Since that time there have been \nnumerous efforts on behalf of Members from this side to call up \namendments and call up legislation to alter, amend, and replace the \nObamaCare legislation.\n\n  He has utilized parliamentarian maneuvers, filling the tree, to block \nthat. It cannot continue. This is about to become a law. It is going to \nhammer the American economy. It is already hammering the economy. The \nAmerican people don't want it, and we are not going to go silent. So \nthis is the beginning of the fight.\n  Senator Cruz--maybe people can disagree with his tactics--but he \ndrove and raised the issue. We need to keep talking about it; we just \ndo. It is time for this Congress to listen to the voice of the American \npeople.\n  Senator Boxer is a good person, and she said President Bush had $1 \ntrillion deficits and President Obama has reduced them in half. The \nhighest deficit President Bush ever had in the 8 years he served as \nPresident was $487 billion, which is a lot of money--too much. The year \nbefore, it was $168 billion.\n  When President Obama took office, what was the first thing that was \npassed within weeks? A $1 trillion stimulus bill to supposedly \nstimulate the economy, but the money went out to government agencies \nand departments, and it had no stimulus impact at all. It was $1 \ntrillion--every penny of which was borrowed. That year the deficit went \nup well over $1 trillion. The next year it was well over $1 trillion, \nthe next year well over $1 trillion, and the next year well over $1 \ntrillion.\n  In the first 4 years of President Obama's leadership, we had the \nhighest deficits ever recorded in America. It is a stunning event, and \nhe fought every day--and there were fights on the floor--to spend more \nand borrow more.\n  Some of his advisers would say: The reason this economy isn't growing \nso well is because we didn't borrow and spend enough. We didn't have \nenough. We should have created more debt and should have spent more. It \nhas resulted to this date in the lowest rebound economically from a \nrecession since World War II, and we are not doing well in that regard.\n  It is absolutely not so that President Obama bears no responsibility \nfor the unprecedented debt that he has run up during this time. He is \nstill advocating for $1 trillion more in spending above the Budget \nControl Act levels that he agreed to in the summer of 2011. He wants to \nspend $1 trillion more than what he signed as an agreement to raise the \ndebt ceiling.\n  I know he didn't want to, but Congress said: We are going to cut back \non your credit card. Now we are going to raise the debt ceiling $2 \ntrillion, as you said you need, but we demand that you reduce the \ngrowth of spending over 10 years by $2 trillion.\n  We were projected to have spending growth to $10 trillion over the \ncurrent rate of spending, which is about $3.6 trillion a year. We were \ngoing to increase it by a total of $10 trillion. Under BCA, if we \nadhere to it, we would increase it by $8 trillion, not $10 trillion. \nThat is not going to bankrupt America. There is no reason we can't run \nthis government by growing the spending by $8 trillion instead of $10 \ntrillion. So it is unbelievable that we make that point.\n  I know the budget balanced in the last years of the 1990s, and \nPresident Clinton proudly claims credit for that, and he was a part of \nit. But I haven't forgotten that the Republican House was in a constant \nbattle over Democratic President Clinton's spending levels, and there \nwas actually a fairly long shutdown of the government to contain the \ngrowth of spending, and it resulted in a balanced budget. That is how \nit happened. There was credit enough to go to both sides of that.\n  We need health care reform. It needs to be smartly and effectively \ndone. We can improve health care in our country, but it does not have \nto tank the American economy, and that is what has been happening in \nrecent days. I was going to talk about that, without much reference to \nObamaCare and the health care bill--which is a negative factor of \neconomic growth of very large proportions--but I just followed my \nfriend and able colleague, Senator Boxer, and I wanted to share those \npoints.\n  Last Thursday I delivered the first in a series of speeches looking \nat the state of our economy. I directed my staff on the Budget \nCommittee--I am the ranking Republican there--to specifically analyze \nconditions facing working Americans so I could share those findings \ndirectly with the Members of the Senate. Both parties need to focus \ntheir efforts on defending working Americans from policies--Washington \npolicies too often--that damage their financial well-being. It is \nhappening. Last week I discussed the falling incomes and social \nchallenges eroding the security of the middle class.\n\n[[Page S7001]]\n\nToday I will focus on the jobless recovery and the general problem of \nunemployment.\n  Few things matter more to a working family than the pace of the \neconomy, especially after a hard recession. If on the one hand, it is a \nrapid, strong recovery, jobs will return quickly, people will return to \nthe workforce, and a great deal of social suffering will be averted.\n\n  If, on the other hand, it is a slow recovery, then businesses don't \ncreate many new jobs, wages stagnate or fall, as they have been doing, \nand families continue to borrow from their savings to pay their bills. \nLife is spent wondering and worrying about the future.\n  We live today in the slowest economic recovery--they called it an \neconomic recovery--since the end of World War II. No recovery from a \nrecession since the end of World War II has been as slow as this one. \nNot counting the Great Recession, we have had 11 recessions since 1945. \nAll had faster, stronger recoveries than this one--with all of them we \nbounced back quicker.\n  How slow is this economic recovery? Well, it has been nearly 6 years \nsince the recession began in December of 2007. We still have not \nreturned to the number of jobs we had 6 years ago. We haven't come back \nto the number of people working that we had 6 years ago. We are \n1,988,000 jobs--almost 2 million--short of the 146,273,000 jobs we had \nwhen the recession began. This is not good.\n  Let's compare that with the other two bad postwar recessions: the \ncontractions of 1973 through 1975 and 1981 and 1982--serious \nrecessions. The recession of 1973 lasted 16 months. The recession of \nthe 1981 collapse lasted 16 months, and the recession of 2007 lasted \nuntil June of 2009, or 18 months.\n  Working people were hit hard by these two earlier recessions. The \nunemployment rate rose to 9 percent in 1975 and 10.8 percent in 1982. \nThe highest monthly unemployment rate for the Great Recession of 2007 \nto 2009 was 10 percent. Our unemployment rate didn't hit as high as \n1982. There is not much difference in the severity and length of these \nrecessions. They were pretty similar.\n  Even so, total jobs had recovered by 25 months after the start of the \n1973 recession and by 28 months after the recovery from the 1981 \nrecession. It has been 70 months, however, since the start of the 2007 \nrecession, and employment has not yet recovered.\n  Lost hours of work is another and even better way to gauge the \nfailure of the current recovery. It is not simply the number of jobs in \nthe economy but the number of hours worked that strongly influences the \npace of economic activity.\n  In the fourth quarter of 2007, just as the recession was starting, \nAmericans worked about 236 billion hours--that is a lot of hours. We \nstill have not returned to that level.\n  In the third quarter of 2013, this last quarter, the Labor Department \nestimated Americans still only worked 232 billion hours. That is a \nshortfall of 3.5 billion hours. This decline is greater per worker \nsince the population of available workers has increased by 9 million. \nSo we have got 9 million more workers and a decline in the number of \nhours worked, and it is still well below what the number was in 2007. \nThis is not the kind of recovery we need to be looking for.\n  Still another way to show the slowness of this recovery is to measure \nhow much higher GDP--the economy today--is compared to the start of the \nrecession. It turns out that economic output is 4.4 percent higher. \nCompare this with the 1973 and 1981 recessions. By this time after the \n1973 recession, GDP was 17.9 percent higher, and GDP after the 1981 \nrecession by this time was 20 percent higher. That is, the economy was \n20 percent bigger by this time after the 1981 recovery.\n  Our current economy is only 4.4 percent larger. The 1981 economic \ngains were five times as great as this.\n  These are the top line numbers. What do they mean to real people? \nBelow this surface we find extensive economic suffering throughout our \nNation. There are 25 percent more discouraged workers today--988,000 \nversus 793,000--than there were in June of 2009 when the recession \nended. We had 366,000 discouraged workers when the recession started in \n2007, which means we have had an increase of 172 percent in this sad \nnumber in 6 years.\n  One of the most stunning developments of this recovery has been the \ndecline in the labor force participation rate. This is a fundamental \nindicator of the breadth and depth of a recovery and of economic \ngrowth. Today 58.7 percent of the noninstitutionalized population 16 \nyears of age and older is working--58.7 percent today. In 2007 that \nnumber stood at 62.7 percent. The current rate of labor force \nparticipation is the lowest this Nation has seen since 1978. The \npercentage of the population working today in the age group of workers \nis the lowest it has been since 1978, and it is not getting better.\n  This decline is due to two factors: increased unemployment, and labor \nforce dropouts--discouraged people who are no longer even looking for \nwork.\n\n  How many people are we talking about? If the same percentage of the \npopulation was working today as was working in 2007, we would have \n154,089,000 workers. Since we currently only have 144,285,000 million \npeople working, it appears that 9,804,000 people are out of the labor \nforce--9 million normally expected to be working are out of the labor \nforce.\n  When they are out of the labor force, it does not show up in the \nunemployment rate. It is only people who are actually applying for jobs \nwho show up in the unemployment rate. So the unemployment rate we see \ntoday hides the real depth of the unemployment problem we have in \nAmerica.\n  Of the 5.7 million who totally dropped out, more retirements and more \ndisability than in 2007 explain about two-thirds of those dropouts. \nPeople went on disability, went on retirement. Many of them went on \nretirement at 62 when it would have been better if they could have had \na decent job opportunity to work to 65, 66, 70, but they have dropped \nout because they are older workers, perhaps, and were unable to find \ndecent work. But it cannot be good for America for millions of people \nto take their Social Security at 62 rather than later, too often \nbecause no work is available.\n  More than 4 million unemployed Americans have been out of work for \nmore than 27 weeks--4 million--more than half the year they have been \nunemployed. All told, 11.5 million Americans want to work but cannot \nfind jobs.\n  The unemployment rate for those between the ages of 16 and 19 who are \nnot in school or in the military or in prison stands at 24 percent. So \nteenagers have a very large number, and the number is much higher for \nminority teenagers and young men particularly. This is the highest \nteenage unemployment has ever been this far into a recovery. It is very \ndangerous for our society to have so many young people--especially \nyoung men whose unemployment rates are even higher than females--out of \nwork. This is not good for America.\n  We need to have a growing economy that creates jobs, and we don't \nneed to be bringing in--under the immigration bill that passed the \nSenate, we don't need to be bringing in twice the number of low-skilled \nworkers as we have been doing, as we have a generous immigration \npolicy. This bill would double the number of guest workers coming into \nAmerica to take jobs that children need to be doing. They need to be \nworking. We don't need teenagers and young people--19, 20, 22, 23--with \nnothing to do month after month, year after year.\n  At 13 percent, unemployment among African Americans is about twice \nthe national average of 7.4 percent. Unemployment among Hispanics \nstands at 9.4 percent. Unemployment among those with less than a high \nschool education is 11 percent. But we want to bring in millions of \npeople without high school educations to compete for the few jobs that \nare out there.\n  Again, these statistics, as bad as they are, mask the real-life \nimplications of the slow economy. These are young careers that have \nfailed to launch when they should, marriages perhaps put off until the \neconomy improves, families not started until couples can afford \nchildren--a generation of children that arrive out of wedlock. We have \nretirements taken too early, loss of homes, perhaps; older children at \nhome who should be out on their own, and we would normally expect them \nto be working; and lots of part-time, extra jobs at lower pay just to \nmake ends meet.\n  Indeed, one of the most devastating statistics is the growth in part-\ntime work instead of full-time work. It is a\n\n[[Page S7002]]\n\nstunning number. We have 5,188,000 fewer full-time jobs today than in \nDecember of 2007--5 million fewer. That equals a decrease in full-time \nemployment of 4.3 percent, even though our population is growing.\n  At the same time, part-time employment has grown by 3 million over \nthis same time period. That is an increase in part-time jobs of 13 \npercent. So make no mistake, the total number of jobs since 2007 is \ndown, and for the people who are finding work, the work they find too \noften can only be part time.\n  Now 77 percent of the people who got a job since January of this year \ngot a part-time job, not a full time job. When we see, colleagues, the \nreports of 190,000 jobs, 200,000 jobs, remember, 77 percent of those \nare part-time jobs. Those numbers hide the reality of the danger in our \nworkforce.\n  Nearly 90 percent of the increase in part-time work represents people \nwho, according to the Labor Department, ``could only find part-time \nwork.'' In other words, they would like full-time but could only find \npart-time work. At the end of 2007, this number stood at 1.2 million. \nHowever, the most recent data shows that this population has grown by \n127 percent to 2,714,000--a 127-percent increase in this number.\n  Job growth in the economy since 2007 has been principally in part-\ntime work. We are becoming a part-time economy.\n  The President's health care law, without any doubt--I don't believe \nany economist, even if they try to sugar-coat it the best they could, \nwould deny that the President's health care law is playing a major \nfactor from the shift from full-time work to part-time work. As we all \nknow, part-time workers don't enjoy the same health, retirement, \nvacation, and other benefits as full-time workers do. It is exceedingly \nhard indeed to succeed in this economy and in a career with only a \npart-time job.\n  We must recognize one of the biggest contributors to the decline in \nfull-time jobs is the health care bill we have been debating. As others \nhave observed, it is destroying the 40-hour workweek. That is what a \nunion leader said: It is destroying the 40-hour workweek. It is even an \nassault on workers.\n  Let me tell my colleagues about one constituent who wrote my office. \nLinda Askew, from Sheffield, AL, wrote in July, asking Congress to do \nsomething to help. Ms. Askew has a small neighborhood business. She \nemploys less than 10 people. According to Ms. Askew:\n\n       We have been here for almost 50 years. We have tried to \n     help our employees have health care for over 10 years now . . \n     . The new premiums are $590 per month for single coverage and \n     $1,520 for family coverage. . . . These costs are almost \n     becoming unbearable for our company. More troubling than \n     that, in the letter--\n\n  she got a letter from her insurance company--\n\n     was that part of the reason for this increase was blamed on a \n     new health care reform fees and taxes that health insurers \n     must pay on behalf of all their groups . . .\n\n  So to reduce the cost of health care in America, the health care bill \nraised taxes on the insurance companies that provide it. It gets passed \nalong.\n  She continues:\n\n       Small businesses cannot keep up with these increases.\n\n  In the coming days, as I document the conditions facing American \nworkers, I will also address the many causes of this economic \ndeterioration--and there are many. There are many causes for the \ndeterioration in the economy. Republicans and Democrats need to heed \nthese problems I have stated, including a decline in wages, beginning \nin 1999 through a different administration.\n  The question is, What are we going to do about it, Republicans and \nDemocrats? We need to consider these issues and deal with them.\n\n  What we are seeing is immensely troubling. As Washington grows \nlarger, Washington grows wealthier and more powerful, American workers \nare being impoverished, sidelined, and marginalized. We see the numbers \nshowing that the only area of America that has been showing raised \ngrowth is Washington. Washington! The government class is being \nenriched at the expense of the middle class. From deficit spending to \nFederal regulation to the immigration bill, Washington is pursuing \npolicies that benefit lobbyists, the well-connected, government \nemployees, regulators, and bureaucrats, but that are reducing the wages \nand job opportunities for everyday American workers. The numbers are \nclear.\n  Both parties need to shut out the special interests, work to develop \npolicies that will restore our history of dynamic economic growth--and \nwe can do so--growth that benefits all the people of our Nation.\n  What is the response we get from the governing class? What do they \ntell us the problem is? On the deficit, what do they say the problem \nis? We haven't spent enough money. It is your problem, American people. \nJust send us more money and we won't have deficits anymore. Trust us. \nSend us more money. The President proposed a $1 trillion tax increase \nin his budget. It was rejected, but that is what he proposed and that \nis what he advocates for. So they want to spend more.\n  They believe they can invest. We give the government more money, and \nit is going to invest in the economy and everybody is going to be \nbetter off. But we have seen that movie. It has been going on for 5 \nyears, to a degree unprecedented in the history of America. They say, \nDon't worry, borrow and spend. Don't worry about the debt. We can just \nborrow more and spend more and that will stimulate the economy.\n  They say we need to regulate more. We need to block more American \nenergy and import more, I suppose, from Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and \nthat is going to improve our economy. Really? We are going to drive up \nthe cost of energy and coal and that is going to improve jobs in \nAmerica? That is going to help a working person who now has to pay \n$200, $250 a month for his gas bill to commute? That is supposed to be \ngood for us?\n  All we have heard is more taxes, more regulation, more government, \nmore debt. That is the policy we are seeing here. I haven't seen \nanything that has the power to produce the growth and prosperity that \nwe need.\n  So I say we have to get over this. We have tried this. It is not \nworking. These policies have made it worse. We have to get back to \nclassical American policies that validate individual responsibility, \nthat allow people to progress and make more, that don't drive us to \nimport more oil, that don't put regulation by massive numbers all over \nthe economy, driving down productivity and driving up costs. That is \nthe kind of thing we need to be doing. If we will do that, and if we \nwill allow the vitality of the American spirit to flourish and flower \nand get this burden off the backs of our people, I think we will be \nsurprised how much better things can be.\n  It is a serious crisis. This trend has been going on far too long. We \ncan't ignore it. We can't say it is just the recession. We have been \ngoing along like this since 2007. We have not seen the growth we need. \nThe tax and spend and borrow policies haven't worked. It is time for us \nto confront that. I hope my colleagues will.\n  I will continue to examine the data we are seeing out there and share \nit with my colleagues and maybe we can surprise ourselves how much good \nwe can do in the long run.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/27/senate-section/article/S7002-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7002-S7005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE DEBT CEILING\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I thank the Chair for recognizing me and \nallowing me to follow the Senator from Alabama whose remarks I agree \nwith.\n  I am disappointed in what happened this week. Those of us in the \nminority learned another lesson for the minority, is to get to a bill \nwe wanted to get to, the majority then has the votes to amend that bill \nunless some of the majority would happen to side with us. And they did \namend the bill in ways that I didn't agree with, taking the provisions \nout that would have defunded the move toward the health care plan that \nI think we are going to see more and more of the country isn't ready \nfor. But the bill did go back to the House. The bill was changed from \nthe bill the House sent over.\n  So the bill went back to the House, and they have a chance to see \nwhat else they might be able to do--hopefully, in the next few days. \nBut between now and the end of the fiscal year--which is Monday, by the \nway--\n\n[[Page S7003]]\n\nhopefully, we will find a way to make the system work better, will do \nwhat we should have done in the budget debate process.\n  As I said here on the floor just a day or 2 ago, the great \ndisappointment is that over and over we have failed to let the process \nwork. Over and over we have failed to bring the bills to the floor, \noffer amendments, and set the priorities for the country.\n  So here it is, the last Friday of the spending year, the last Friday \nof our budget year, the last Friday of the fiscal year, and the Senate \nhas not passed one single appropriations bill--except the 6-week CR \nthat says we cannot decide how to do anything new, so let's just do for \nanother 6 weeks what we did last year. Surely that is not good enough, \nand we need to get beyond that.\n  The vote today, taken on the Senate floor, did not send a bill to the \nPresident to be signed. It sent the bill back across the Capitol \nBuilding to see what the House of Representatives may want to do next, \nand I look forward to working with them and with my colleagues here in \nthe Senate to see what that might be.\n  I want to talk for a few minutes about the debt ceiling itself. The \nWhite House announced just in the last few days that we reach that debt \nceiling in about 3 weeks. That number always seems to me to be pretty \nmuch a number that can be worked with. It is not like the end of the \nfiscal year. But it is a date that the Secretary of the Treasury has \nsaid we need to look at.\n  The President said he would not negotiate on the debt ceiling. That \nis a very interesting position to take, and it is what is wrong with \nthe government right now. I suppose the Congress could now say: And we \nwill not negotiate on the debt ceiling either. So maybe that just means \nwe do not have a debt ceiling increase because nobody wants to \nnegotiate.\n  Then the President said to a group in Washington this week that--I \nthink he said that nonbudget items have never been attached to the debt \nceiling before. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks an article from the Washington Post of \njust a few days ago by Glenn Kessler who actually looked at that. Is \nthat really accurate? Is what the President said accurate--that we have \nnever done this before? This is totally new? This is a new demand that \nno Congress has ever made before--except, by the way, the Budget \nControl Act 2\\1/2\\ years ago that the President signed and a few other \nthings that have happened?\n  It has happened before, and I want to talk about that a little bit.\n  This is not new moment for us. When Members of the Congress have been \nconcerned about spending--certainly since the 1970s Budget Act, but \neven before that--when the debt ceiling had to be increased, Members of \nCongress wanted to talk about spending and other things that they could \nnot get attention to any other way.\n  In 1953, during the Eisenhower administration, fiscal conservatives \nin the Congress--at that time led by a Democrat from Virginia, Harry \nByrd--did not believe we would be able to fund the Interstate Highway \nSystem. So they used the debt limit vote, the debt limit debate as a \nplace to try to find out what they could do about the Interstate \nHighway System and how it was going to be funded. In 1953--that was a \nlong time ago; almost longer ago now than the lifetime of most Members \nof the Senate--that is how it was used then.\n  In 1973, when Richard Nixon was President, Democrats in the Senate \nsought to attach a campaign finance bill to the debt ceiling. This was \nduring Watergate and, of course, I guess that would certainly meet the \ndefinition of a ``nonbudget item''--a campaign finance bill that there \nwas a great effort to do in 1973 and to add to the debt ceiling \nlegislation.\n  In 1993, a study of the politics of the debt limit, for Public \nAdministration Review, said that ``during this period, the genesis of a \npattern developed that would eventually become full blown in the mid-\n1970s and 1980s: the use of the debt ceiling vote as a vehicle for \nother legislative matters.''\n  So certainly that is something we could talk about. Some would have \neconomic consequences, others would not. I know one thought is, let's \nnot move forward with the individual mandate in health care. Now, if \nyou do not move forward with the mandate, there may be significant \nadvantages in the pressure that takes off the spending in the exchange. \nBut whether it is an economic issue or not, it is a fairness issue.\n  The President, who now has suspended the requirement that businesses \noffer insurance in 2015--it seems to me the only fair thing to do, if \nyou take the obligation off businesses to offer insurance, is to take \nthe obligation off individuals who the law would require to have \ninsurance if they did not get it at work. You have just taken away the \nrequirement for businesses. Surely you cannot justify saying businesses \ndo not have to pay the penalty but individuals do.\n  I think that is a fair debate to have. It is a fair debate to have \neither over the weekend as part of how we move forward with funding the \ngovernment or a fair debate to have if we are going to increase the \nFederal Government's ability to borrow money. We ought to talk about \nthings that are going to result in spending lots of money.\n  Remember, the requirement for the individual mandate that the \nPresident also waived was the requirement to prove income. Now, why \ndoes that matter? On the exchange, depending on how high your income \nis, you get a taxpayer subsidy for the insurance you buy. But the \nPresident said the requirement to verify income will not be there in \nthe way the law envisioned for this first year.\n  So again, how is that fair to the taxpayers that the taxpayers are \nsubsidizing somebody's estimate of income? We just got through with the \ntaxpayers subsidizing a lot of mortgages that could not be paid because \nthat structure allowed people to estimate what their income would be on \ntheir mortgage application without submitting anything but their \nestimate of what their income could be. As it turned out, when people \nwere trying to buy a house and prove they could make a mortgage \npayment, a significant number of people estimated they would make more \nmoney than they made. I think it is going to be equally true when it \ncomes time to qualify for taxpayer assistance, a significant number of \npeople may estimate--maybe even on some level of good faith--it could \nwork out that way, that I am going to make less money than I made last \nyear or less money than I am likely to make this year, but I am going \nto have a level of income that allows me to have a higher subsidy. I \nthink it is certainly a possibility.\n\n  One of these two things is happening right now. We need to look at \nthe equity and fairness of having an individual penalty and the \nPresident saying we do not have a penalty for businesses that do not \nprovide insurance.\n  Let me get back to a few more examples.\n  In one of the debt limit debates, major changes in Social Security \nwere attached. An amendment in one of the debates was to end the \nbombing in Cambodia. Twenty-five amendments that were nongermane to \nspending were in this discussion between 1978 and 1987.\n  The President maybe is proving here more than anything else that you \nbetter be very careful when you say something has never happened, \nparticularly if it has happened over and over, and particularly if you \nthink that somehow, as President, you can decide that the future of the \ncountry is nondebatable, that you can decide that how high the debt \nlimit is is nondebatable. Whatever the Secretary of the Treasury says, \nthat is what we need. And what would the President say about that? He \nwould say, well, that is because we have already obligated this money. \nThe fact that this money may be already obligated does not mean we \nshould not look at every other way we are spending money or every way \nwe control spending and do what we need to do about that.\n  In 1982, the Senate majority leader at that time, Howard Baker, said \nwe will have a free-for-all on the debt ceiling legislation, and 1,400 \nnongermane amendments became part of that debate. They included \nlimiting Federal jurisdiction over school prayer and other things.\n  In 1980, the House and Senate rejected a central part of President \nCarter's energy policy--an oil import\n\n[[Page S7004]]\n\nfee--as part of the debt ceiling discussion. No bigger stretch than not \ngoing forward with the individual mandate as part of the debt ceiling \ndiscussion.\n  Less than 10 percent of the debt limit bills passed between 1978 and \n2002 contained amendments not related to the debt or budget. But many \nof them contained an amendment that was related to how we spend our \nmoney. When you are spending too much money, when you already owe $17 \ntrillion, it is time to talk about: How are we spending this money and \nwhat can we do to do something about it before we further extend the \nline of credit?\n  If any of us went to a banker and said: We have spent all the money \nwe have already borrowed. We still have a lot of bills coming in, and \nwe need to borrow a lot more money, frankly, under any of the rules \nthat this Congress has passed in the last several years, the banker \ncould not loan you money, and if they could loan you money, they would \nnot loan you money without saying: Tell us again, what are you trying \nto do to get your spending under control so you are not back here in a \nfew days or a few months asking for more credit.\n  The thing we know is, under almost any imaginable circumstance, this \nis not the last debt ceiling increase we will ever make. So if we are \ngoing to be back in a few weeks, a few months, a year--however long \nthis debt ceiling extends to--asking for more money, we ought to be \ntalking about how we are spending the money we have.\n  October 17 will not be as far away as it might seem. It is very close \nto us now. The Secretary of the Treasury says that the country will \nhave only approximately $30 billion to meet our country's commitments. \nBut on October 17, money does not stop coming in. On October 18, you \nmight be able to arrange the books in a way where you do not have quite \nenough money to pay all the bills coming in, but this is not a \ngovernment shutdown scenario.\n  We need to solve the problem of this weekend and early next week and \nthen get to the debt ceiling. Whether the President wants to debate it \nor not, it is going to be debated. I think it is going to be \nnegotiated. The idea that this is going to be a so-called clean debt \nlimit increase that will not be negotiated because it impacts the full \nfaith and credit of the United States of America--we are going to pay \nour bills. I think we all know that. We have paid our bills since the \nfounding of this government. But we are not going to pay our bills, we \nare not going to get another advance on our allowance, without somebody \nsaying: Exactly how are you spending this money as fast as you are \nspending it? And why are you back again saying you need more of it?\n  The American people have overwhelmingly rejected the idea that this \nshould not be negotiated. According to a new Bloomberg poll out this \nweek, Americans by a 2-to-1 ratio disagree with the President's \ncontention that the Congress should raise the debt ceiling without \nconditions. Instead, 61 percent said that it is ``right to require \nspending cuts when the debt ceiling is raised,'' and they said ``even \nif it risks default.''\n  The American people want us to fight--as we have this week and we \nwill continue to--to try to defund a health care system that will not \nwork. But they also want us to fight, to be sure that the money we are \nspending that we get from taxpayers--the money that we obligate future \ngenerations to, the bills that we are building up for somebody else to \npay--to have the kind of debate, the kind of negotiation, the kind of \nimportant view of the future that they deserve to have.\n  I would urge the President and the majority leader of the Senate to \nsit down with leaders of the House and others and try to work this out \nas soon as we can. Understand, frankly, that whether you want to \nnegotiate or not does not matter. There is nowhere in the Constitution \nthat says when we owe more money than we pay, the President can decide \nwhether there is going to be a discussion or not. That is not how this \nsystem works. It is not how it is going to work over the next 2 weeks \nor the next month or whatever it takes to resolve the debt limit. \nHopefully, we will all be working hard over the next 2 days to do \nwhatever it takes to keep the government of the United States working \non October 1. Just because we have failed for the entire year to do the \nwork the Senate is supposed to do does not mean we can continue to fail \nin a way that punishes the American people by not having a government \nthat is functioning on the first day of the spending year.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 19, 2013]\n\nObama's Claim That Non-Budget Items Have ``Never'' Been Attached to the \n                              Debt Ceiling\n\n                           (By Glenn Kessler)\n\n       ``You have never seen in the history of the United States \n     the debt ceiling or the threat of not raising the debt being \n     used to extort a president or a governing party and trying to \n     force issues that have nothing to do with the budget and \n     nothing to do with the debt.''\n       --President Obama, remarks to the Business Roundtable, \n     Sept. 18, 2013\n       When a president makes a lawyerly comment, it's time to \n     start looking for the trap door. At first President Obama \n     uses a sweeping ``never in the history of the United States'' \n     but then he concludes with a caveat: ``nothing to do with the \n     budget and nothing to do with the debt.''\n       The issue at hand is the Affordable Care Act, aka \n     Obamacare, which many congressional Republicans would like to \n     repeal or delay as part of a vote to extend the debt \n     ceiling--even though establishment Republicans, such as \n     former Bush aide Karl Rove, regard the effort as a kamikaze \n     mission with little hope of success.\n       Generally, raising the debt ceiling has been routine and \n     not especially controversial. But, as we have noted before, \n     starting in 1953 during the Dwight Eisenhower administration, \n     fiscal conservatives in Congress at times have used the debt \n     limit as a way to force concessions by the executive branch \n     on spending. Eisenhower, a Republican, had particular trouble \n     with a Democrat, Sen. Harry F. Byrd of Virginia, over the \n     debt ceiling because Byrd was skeptical of Eisenhower's plans \n     to build the national highway system.\n       That dispute was about a budget issue, which the president \n     seemed to exclude in his comment. But unfortunately for the \n     president's claim, there are other, compelling examples that \n     contradict it.\n\n\n                               The Facts\n\n       In 1973, when Richard Nixon was president, Democrats in the \n     Senate, including Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Sen. \n     Walter Mondale (D-Minn.), sought to attach a campaign finance \n     reform bill to the debt ceiling after the Watergate-era \n     revelations about Nixon's fundraising during the 1972 \n     election. Their efforts were defeated by a filibuster, but it \n     took days of debate and the lawmakers were criticized by \n     commentators (and fellow lawmakers) for using ``shotgun'' \n     tactics to try to hitch their pet cause to emergency must-\n     pass legislation.\n       President Obama said that GOP lawmakers now are trying to \n     ``extort'' repeal of the health care law via the debt limit, \n     but that's also what Democrats wanted to do with President \n     Nixon, who opposed the campaign-finance reforms.\n       Indeed, Linda K. Kowalcky and Lance T. LeLoup wrote in a \n     comprehensive 1993 study of the politics of the debt limit, \n     for Public Administration Review, that ``during this period, \n     the genesis of a pattern developed that would eventually \n     become full blown in the mid-1970s and 1980s: the use of the \n     debt ceiling vote as a vehicle for other legislative \n     matters.''\n       Previously, they noted, the debt limit bill had been linked \n     to the mechanics of debt management, but now anything was \n     fair game. Major changes in Social Security were attached to \n     the debt bill; another controversial amendment sought to end \n     the bombing in Cambodia. Kowalcky and LeLoup list 25 \n     nongermane amendments that were attached to debt-limit bills \n     between 1978 and 1987, including allowing voluntary school \n     prayer, banning busing to achieve integration and proposing a \n     nuclear freeze.\n       In 1982, Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker unleashed a \n     free-for-all by allowing 1,400 nongermane amendments to the \n     debt ceiling legislation, which resulted in five weeks of \n     raucous debate that mostly focused on limiting federal court \n     jurisdiction over school prayer and busing. The debt limit \n     only passed after lawmakers decided to strip all of the \n     amendments from the bill.\n       One of the most striking examples of a president being \n     forced to accept unrelated legislation on a debt-ceiling bill \n     took place in 1980. The House and Senate repealed a central \n     part of President Jimmy Carter's energy policy--an oil import \n     fee that was expected to raise the cost of gasoline by 10 \n     cents a gallon. Carter vetoed the bill, even though the \n     United States was close to default, and then the House and \n     Senate overrode his veto by overwhelming numbers (335-34 in \n     the House; 68-10 in the Senate).\n       ``Foes of the fee succeeded in linking the two measures to \n     gain added leverage for killing the fee,'' The Washington \n     Post reported on Carter's stunning defeat. ``The Treasury \n     Department immediately announced it was resuming the sale of \n     bonds, which it suspended Thursday night when the debt \n     ceiling expired.''\n       To be sure, the success rate of attaching nongermane \n     amendments to a debt-limit bill is relatively low. Anita S. \n     Krishnakumar, in a 2007 paper for the Harvard Journal on \n     Legislation, said that less than 10 percent of the\n\n[[Page S7005]]\n\n     debt limit bills passed between 1978 and 2002 contained \n     amendments not related to the debt or budget. Only twice--in \n     1980 and in 1995--did Congress successfully pass amendments \n     opposed by the president. But as Carter's defeat shows, \n     Congress has used the debt limit to repeal a key legislative \n     priority of a president.\n       In response, the Obama White House provided us with \n     information on the negative impact on the economy during the \n     2011 debt-ceiling impasse, but did not comment on the \n     examples listed above.\n\n\n                           The Pinocchio Test\n\n       Clealy, Obama's sweeping statement does not stand up to \n     scrutiny, even with his caveat. Time and again, lawmakers \n     have used the ``must-pass'' nature of the debt limit to force \n     changes in unrelated laws. Often, the effort fails--as the \n     GOP drive to repeal ObamaCare almost certainly will. But \n     Kowalcky and LeLoup speculate that one reason why Congress \n     has not eliminated the debt limit, despite the political \n     problems it poses, is because lawmakers enjoy the leverage it \n     provides against the executive branch.\n       There's an old reporter's rule that you want to avoid using \n     the word ``unprecedented.'' Otherwise, a professor might call \n     or e-mail the next day to dispute it.\n       Let's add this rule for politicians: Never say ``never.''\n\n  Mr. BLUNT.

Madam President, I rise today to engage my colleagues \nSenator Wyden, Senator Murkowski, and Senator Moran in a colloquy \nregarding legislation the Senate adopted yesterday for the \nmodernization of the Federal helium reserve. I first would like to \ncommend the leadership of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee for their commitment to this effort and to thank my friend \nfrom Kansas for his partnership in this process. I know how long and \nhard the Chairman and Ranking Member and their staffs have worked on \nthis complex piece of legislation, and they deserve our appreciation.\n  I think it is important that we discuss one of the aspects of the \nproposed new auction program. The text before us today creates an \nauction and Section 6(b)(5)(A) allows the Secretary to auction less \nthan the statutorily mandated amount if the Secretary determines the \nadjustment necessary to minimize market disruptions. The Secretary may \nmake such adjustments only after only after submitting a written \njustification to the congressional committees of jurisdiction. I wish \nto ask Chairman Wyden whether he believes this provision will be \nexercised?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Connecticut for his \nhelp in crafting this bill and I appreciate that he has taken the time \nto raise this issue. One of the primary goals in drafting this \nlegislation was to ensure stability of supply. The Senator is correct. \nThe Secretary may lower the amount of helium that is auctioned if he or \nshe determines the adjustment is necessary to minimize market \ndisruptions that pose a threat to the economic wellbeing of the United \nStates and only after submitting a written justification to Congress. I \nexpect the Secretary would exercise this provision if those criteria \nare met.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I again wish to thank the Chairman and the \nRanking Member for their tireless efforts and their willingness to work \nwith us on these important issues. I yield the Floor to the Senator \nfrom Kansas, Mr. Moran.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I rise to echo the Senator from \nConnecticut's comments and to ask the Committee leaders for one more \nclarification.\n  The issue is the definition of ``excess refining capacity'' and its \nrequirement that it be made available at commercially reasonable rates \nas a condition of continued participation in the sales and auctions \nprovided for in this legislation. I ask Senator Murkowski if it is the \nintent of the legislation that the BLM consider the economic impacts of \ndefining ``excess refining capacity'' once the auction level reaches \n100% of the Federal helium reserve.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Yes, it is our expectation that BLM will consider \neconomic impacts throughout the implementation of this bill and develop \nregulations for this and other provisions in the bill accordingly. I do \nnot anticipate that the definition of ``excess refining capacity'' \nwould change over the course of the law's implementation, however. Our \nintent is to ensure that refiners with excess refining capacity make \nthat capacity available at commercially reasonable rates. As the \nauction system is phased in, I look forward to working with my Senate \ncolleagues and the BLM to ensure that market disruptions are avoided \nand American taxpayers are protected.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I thank the Committee leadership for their \ndedication and cooperation, and I yield the Floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/27/senate-section/article/S7005-3", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7005-S7006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING MARYLAND NAVY YARD VICTIMS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN.

I \nthank our Federal, State and local first responders and law enforcement \nfor swiftly and dutifully responding to this appalling attack despite \nthe personal dangers. I thank our dedicated doctors, nurses, and staff \nat the MedStar trauma center who helped care for the injured that day.\n  Today I want to remember the six Marylanders who died in this \nterrible tragedy, and to express my condolences to their family and \nfriends.\n  Sylvia Frasier was 53 years old and lived in Waldorf, MD, in Charles \nCounty. She was a computer expert and served as the enterprise \ninformation assurance manager at Naval Sea Systems Command. And she \nworked a second job as well, working several evenings a week as a \ncustomer service manager at the Wal-Mart in Waldorf. The assistant \nmanager at the store said she often gave co-workers rides home, and he \nonce asked her, ``How come you work a second job?'' She just said, `I \nlove it. I like working with people.' '' Her co-worker said that Sylvia \ncould talk to customers and turn negatives into positives, and that \nthey will miss seeing her smile and gold-colored hair at the store. She \nleaves behind her two parents and six siblings.\n  John Roger Johnson was 73 years old and lived in Derwood, MD, in \nMontgomery County. He was a civilian contractor and performed \nenvironmental assessments of systems used to located mines. He also \nprovided support to the NAVSEA's Command Information Officer. He often \ngreeted colleagues with a ``How ya doin', buddy?'' He leaves behind a \nwife and four daughters, and his 11th grandchild is due in November.\n  Frank Kohler was 50 years old and lived in Tall Timbers, MD, in St. \nMary's County. He was a computer systems specialist. Frank had been the \npresident of the Rotary Club. He had earned the nickname of ``King \nOyster'' for his service, and received a crown and robe, leading the \nnational oyster shucking competition. He leaves behind a wife and two \ndaughters.\n  Vishnu Pandit was 61 years old and lived in North Potomac, MD, in \nMontgomery County. He was born in Bombay, India, and moved to the \nUnited States in his early 20's. His family said in a statement that \n``He took great pride in being employed by the United States Navy, \nwhich he very proudly served in various capacities as a civilian for \nover 25 years. He felt extremely privileged to have contributed to the \nsuperiority of the U.S. Navy and the country that he served.'' He \nleaves behind a wife and two sons.\n  Kenneth Bernard Proctor was 46 years old and lived in Waldorf, MD, in \nCharles County. He worked as a civilian utilities foreman, and had \nworked\n\n[[Page S7006]]\n\nfor the Federal Government for over two decades. His oldest son \nrecently enlisted in the Army. He leaves behind his ex-wife and two \nsons.\n  Richard Michael Ridgell was 52 years old and lived in Westminster, \nMD, in Carroll County. He was a Maryland State Police Trooper for \nnearly two decades, and spent 3 years working in Iraq, helping train \ncivilian in local policing. He was known to text his children several \ntimes a day to check up on them and tell them he loved them, and \ncoached his daughters' softball teams. He was an avid photographer and \nloved taking pictures of his family. He leaves behind his wife and \nthree daughters.\n  Mr. President, the tragedy of every recent mass shooting in America \nhas underscored the importance of Congress passing sensible, Federal \ngun safety legislation. We know that we won't be able to stop every \ntragedy, but we absolutely can save lives. Earlier this year, some 4 \nmonths after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, there was a glimmer \nof hope that the Senate was finally working together on a bipartisan \nbasis to pass reasonable background checks for all gun purchases. This \neffort was fleeting, but it must be revived.\n  We must use common sense and act responsibly. I am sympathetic to the \ninterests of legitimate hunters and collectors, but we should follow \nthe lead of states like Maryland and reinstate the Federal ban on \nassault weapons and prohibit high-capacity ammunition clips. We should \nenact universal background checks. We must take steps to strengthen our \nmental health system so that individuals who need help with mental \nillness can get appropriate help and not have access to hand guns or \nother weapons. I know that we can protect our communities while still \nprotecting the Constitutional rights of legitimate hunters and existing \ngun owners.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/27/senate-section/article/S7006-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO HELYSE S.

Madam President, today I wish to address the \nserious issue of childhood hunger in my home State of Arkansas, and the \nimportant work of the Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance and the Arkansas \nNo Kid Hungry campaign in addressing this issue.\n  New data released by the United States Department of Agriculture on \nour Nation's food insecurity showed that nearly 20 percent of Arkansas \nhouseholds struggle to provide adequate food during the year. Today, \nmore than one in four kids in Arkansas face hunger. Since 2010 the \nArkansas No Kid Hungry campaign, a partnership between the Arkansas \nHunger Relief Alliance under the leadership of Kathy Webb, the office \nof Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe, and other stakeholders, has been \ncommitted to ending childhood hunger and food insecurity for families \nin my State.\n  Fortunately for Arkansas, the No Kid Hungry campaign is hard at work \nto make sure that kids across the State have access to the healthy, \nnutritious foods they need. Since the No Kid Hungry campaign came to \nArkansas, it has brought 1.2 million additional meals to kids who need \nthem. They are dedicated to expanding access to school breakfast, free \nsummer meals, and afterschool meals. Additionally, through its Cooking \nMatters nutrition education program, the Arkansas No Kid Hungry \ncampaign empowers families with the skills, knowledge, and\n\n[[Page S7007]]\n\nconfidence to prepare healthy meals on a budget. More than 1,800 \nfamilies across the State have already participated in Cooking Matters \nprogramming.\n  Research shows eating breakfast has a dramatic and positive effect on \nstudents, and as Arkansas kids head back to school, more will be \nstarting their days with a healthy breakfast. However, there is a large \ngap in the number of kids who are eligible for free or reduced-price \nmeals at school and those who are accessing the Federal School \nBreakfast Program. In Arkansas, only about 55 percent of the students \nwho eat free or reduced-price school lunches each day are also getting \nschool breakfast. The Arkansas No Kid Hungry campaign is working to \nchange that by moving school breakfast out of the cafeteria and making \nit a part of the school day, ensuring more low-income students are able \nto start with a healthy meal. In 2012, the campaign helped to connect \napproximately 4,400 additional kids to the School Breakfast Program.\n  Summer continues to be a challenging time for low-income kids. The \nArkansas No Kid Hungry campaign ensures that kids have continued access \nto healthy meals. Again, the Arkansas No Kid Hungry campaign stepped up \nto the challenge, increasing the number of meals served to kids during \nthe summer by more than 730,000 between 2010 and 2012.\n  ``Hunger in Our Schools,'' a new report by the No Kid Hungry \ncampaign, found that three in four public school teachers see their \nstudents arrive at school hungry. In the report, an Arkansas teacher \nspoke about kids in her classroom impacted by hunger. She said, \n``Asking a student to come to school and learn while they're hungry is \nlike trying to tell an adult to sit in their cubicle and work with a \nnail in their foot; the pain is all you'd be able to concentrate on, \njust like food is the only thing hungry kids can focus on. Before you \ncan focus on grades or behavior, you have to make sure kids have the \nbasic necessities of life.''\n  There is still work to be done across Arkansas to ensure kids and \nfamilies have consistent access to healthy, nutritious foods. I am \nconfident that with the continued strong work of the Arkansas No Kid \nHungry campaign and the Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance, with its six \nFeeding America member food banks, we can create an Arkansas where no \nchild goes hungry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/27/senate-section/article/S7007-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:32 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2600.

This is \nthe only legislation that can avert a government shutdown and that time \nis ticking as we speak. The Senate will be back in session on Monday. \nIn the meantime, if Speaker Boehner wants to avoid a government \nshutdown, he will pass our resolution; otherwise, it is a government \nshutdown.\n  The President just spoke on national TV outlining how bad that would \nbe. We have said it on the floor, but it doesn't have the power of the \nPresident telling everyone how bad it will be, and it will be very, \nvery negative for our economy and for the American people in general.\n  House Republicans should think long and hard about what is at stake \nand who would be hurt by a government shutdown. Each of us, all 535 \nMembers of Congress, were elected by the American people to serve them, \nand the American people deserve better than a government that lurches \nfrom crisis to crisis caused by a handful of people. American families \ndeserve a government that works for them, not against them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/27/senate-section/article/S7009-3", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 2013\n\n  Mr. REID.
