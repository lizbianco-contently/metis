Mr. President, following leader remarks the Senate will \nresume consideration of the immigration bill. The time until 11:30 will \nbe equally divided between the two managers of the bill, Senators Leahy \nand Grassley. At 11:30 there will be three rollcall votes--one on \nconfirmation of the Secretary of Transportation, Anthony Foxx; the next \nvote will be on adoption of the committee-reported substitute \namendment; and then we will have cloture on the final bill, as amended, \nif amended. We hope to complete action on this immigration bill--I will \ntalk about that in a minute.\n  Everyone knows we are poised to pass a historic immigration bill. It \nis landmark legislation that will secure our borders and help 11 \nmillion people get right with the law.\n  I have indicated that we have three votes this morning. We hope to be \nable to work something out so we can have a vote sometime late \nafternoon or evening. There is no reason, after these votes today, to \ndelay this. If people want to delay it, they can, but it will point \ntoward the inevitable, which will be about 6 o'clock tomorrow evening. \nWe can either wrap this up today, have some final speeches, vote on it, \nor wait until tomorrow because during this 30 hours postcloture nothing \ncan happen procedurally.\n  I once again applaud the Gang of 8 for their work, which is \ncommendable and very important for this institution. Without their \ndiligent efforts, we would never have been able to come this far.\n  I commend Chairman Leahy for the work he did in the committee with \nthe markup, which took place over many weeks. I commend him for his \nwork on this bill as manager during the weeks it has been on the floor, \nand my friend Charles Grassley. Senator Grassley and I disagree on \noccasion about substantive issues but never on a personal issue. He is \na very remarkably good Senator and a fine man. I have enjoyed my \nrelationship with him all these many years.\n  Whenever the vote is scheduled, whether it is tomorrow or today, I am \ngoing to ask that Senators be seated for the vote. I have had a number \nof requests from Democrats and Republicans that we do this. They are \nabsolutely right. This vote is important. No matter how you feel about \nthe legislation, it is important enough that we should do that. When it \ncomes time for the vote, whenever it is worked out, we are going to \nhave Senators here on the floor. If not, I am going to have a live \nquorum to get everybody here. This is not a vote where people should be \nstraggling in and raising their hands at the Chair. We should have this \nin an orderly fashion.\n  I repeat, whenever we are able to schedule this vote, we are going to \nhave people here before the vote starts or we will have a live quorum \nand get some activity in the Senate so we can do that.\n  My friend the Republican leader is not here. I would ask the Chair to \nannounce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/27/senate-section/article/S5315-7", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, at the outset of the debate we have \nbeen engaged in, I expressed my hope that we could do something about \nour Nation's broken immigration system. Millions of men and women are \nliving among us without any documentation or certainty about what the \nfuture will bring for themselves or their families. Many of those who \ncome here legally end up staying here illegally. We have no way of \nknowing who or where they are. And current law simply does not take \ninto account the urgent needs of a modern rapidly changing economy.\n  Beyond all of this, it has long been a deep conviction of mine that \nfrom our earliest days as a people immigration has been a powerful \nforce of renewal and national strength. Most of the people who have \ncome here over the centuries have come as dreamers and risk-takers, \nlooking for a chance for a better life for themselves and for their \nchildren.\n  I can think of no better example of this than my wife, who came here \nat age 8 in the cargo hull of a ship because her parents did not have \nthe money for a plane ticket. When she entered the third grade at a \npublic school in New York, she did not speak a word of English. Yet, in \njust a few short decades, she would be sworn in as a member of the \nPresident's Cabinet--an honor and an opportunity she could hardly have \nguessed at when she was just a little girl. This is the kind of story \nthat has made this Nation what it is. Legal immigration makes that \npossible.\n  So, yes, I had wanted very much to be able to support a reform to our \nNation's immigration laws. I knew it would be tough, and the politics \nare not particularly easy either. But the fact is that our constituents \ndid not send us here to name post offices and pass Mother's Day \nresolutions; they sent us here to tackle the hard stuff too.\n  Broad bipartisan majorities agree that our immigration system needs \nupdating. In my view we had an obligation to our constituents at least \nto try to do it, to try to do it together and in the process show the \nworld we can still solve national problems around here and reaffirm the \nvital role legal immigration has played in our history. So it is with a \ngreat deal of regret--for me, at least--that the final bill did not \nturn out to be something I can support. The reason is fairly simple. As \nI see it, this bill does not meet the threshold test for success that I \noutlined at the start of this debate. It just does not say--to me, at \nleast--that we have learned the lessons of 1986 and that we will not \nfind ourselves right back in the same situation we found ourselves in \nafter that reform.\n  If you cannot be reasonably certain the border is secure as a \ncondition of legalization, there is no way to be sure millions more \nwill not follow the illegal immigrants who are already here. As others \nhave rightly pointed out, you also cannot be sure that further \nCongresses will not just reverse whatever assurances we make today that \nborder security will occur in the future. In other words, in the \nabsence of a very firm results-based border security trigger, there is \nno way I can look at my constituents, look them in the eye and tell \nthem that today's assurances will not become tomorrow's \ndisappointments.\n  Since the bill before us does not include such a trigger, I will not \nbe able to support it. It does not give any pleasure to say this or to \nvote against this bill. These are big problems. They need solving. I am \ndeeply grateful to all the Members of my conference and their staffs \nwho have devoted so much of their time and worked so hard over a period \nof many months to solve these problems. I am grateful to all of them.\n  While I will not be voting for this bill, I think it has to be said \nthat there are real improvements in the bill. Current immigration \npolicy, which prioritizes family-based immigration, has not changed in \ndecades. This bill would take an important step toward the kind of \nskills-based immigration a growing economy requires. Through new and \nreformed visa programs, for instance, this bill would provide many of \nour most dynamic businesses with the opportunity to legally hire the \nworkers they need to remain competitive and to expand. Some industries, \nsuch as construction, could and should have fared better, but on \nbalance I think the improvements to legal immigration contained in the \nbill are very much a step in the right direction.\n  We have learned an important lesson in this debate. One thing I am \nfairly certain about is that we will never resolve the immigration \nproblem on a bipartisan basis either now or in the future until we can \nprove--prove--that the border is secure as a condition for \nlegalization. This, to me, continues to be the biggest hurdle to \nreform. Frankly, I cannot understand why there is such resistance to \nit--almost entirely, of course, on the other side. It seems pretty \nobvious to me, and I suspect to most Americans, that the first part of \nimmigration reform should be proof that the border is secure. It is \nsimply common sense.\n  Hopefully, Democrats now realize that this is the one necessary \ningredient for success and they will be a little more willing to accept \nit as a condition for legalization because until they do, I for one \ncannot be confident that we have solved the problem, and I know a lot \nof others will not be confident either.\n  So this bill may pass the Senate today but not with my vote. In its \ncurrent form, it will not become law. But the good news is this: The \npath to success, the path to actually making a law is fairly clear at \nthis point. Success on immigration reform runs through the border. Let \nme say that again. Success on immigration reform runs through the \nborder. Looking ahead, I think it is safe to say that is where our \nfocus should lie.\n\n\n                              Senate Rules\n\n  Mr. President, briefly on another matter, another day has passed and \nthe majority leader has still not confirmed that he intends to keep his \nword, which was given back in January of this year, with regard to the \nrules of the Senate. To refresh the memory of my colleagues, we had a \nbig discussion at the end of the year about the rules and procedures in \nthe Senate on a bipartisan basis.\n  Out of those bipartisan discussions came two rules changes and two \nstanding orders that were passed consistent with the current rules of \nthe Senate. In the wake of that bipartisan agreement, the majority \nleader gave his word to the Senate that the issue of the rules under \nwhich we would operate this year was settled.\n  Regretfully, he continues to suggest to outside groups, and \noccasionally on the floor as well, that maybe he didn't mean that, and \nthat if our behavior--meaning the minority's behavior--doesn't meet his \nstandards, he is still open to breaking the rules of the Senate to \nchange the rules of the Senate.\n  We all know how this would occur if it did occur. The Parliamentarian \nwould advise the occupant of the chair the way to change the rules of \nthe Senate is with 67 votes. The majority leader, under that scenario, \nwould move to overrule the Chair and with 51 votes establish a new \nprecedent that would turn the Senate into the House.\n\n[[Page S5317]]\n\n  It has been suggested maybe that would only apply to nominations, but \nas Senator Alexander and I pointed out last week, of course, that would \nnot be the case. The next time the other side had a majority--my side--\nI would have a hard time arguing to my Members we should confine a 51-\nvote majority to simply nominations, and I would be under intense \npressure to say: Why not legislation. Senator Alexander and I laid out \nwhat some of the top priorities would be that he would recommend to \nme--and many of them I agree with--for an agenda I would be setting \ninstead of the majority leader. These are things such as the national \nright-to-work, repealing ObamaCare, establishing Yucca Mountain, the \nnational nuclear repository. One gets the drift. These are many things \nthe current majority would find abhorrent.\n  I hope this crisis will be averted. All it requires from my friend \nthe majority leader is simply an acknowledgment that he intends to keep \nhis word.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/27/senate-section/article/S5317-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5317-S5329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STUDENT LOAN RATES\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, July 1 is less than 1 week away. We need to \nreassure students who will be taking out loans for school this fall \nthat their interest rates will not double.\n  It is safe to say most of us on both sides of the aisle would want to \nsee a long-term approach to setting student loan interest rates rather \nthan a temporary extension of the current rate. We have been working, \nSenator Harkin, Senator King, Senator Manchin, Senator Burr, Senator \nCoburn, Senator Warren, and many others about finding a way forward.\n  Unfortunately, all of the proposals that are on the table today would \nleave students worse off in the future, frankly, worse off than simply \nallowing the interest rate to double. There is a year or two, perhaps, \nwhere interest rates would stay below the rate of 6.8 percent. Then \nlooking at rate trends, it looks quite convincing that these rates \nwould surpass the current fixed rate and go higher.\n  We can not enact a long-term solution that is going to be bad for \nstudents. In fact, student groups and advocates have urged us to reject \nthe so-called deals that are circling around with variable rates that \nare not capped that could lead to very high interest rates for students \nin a very short period of time.\n  One thing we have all been aware of for the last week or two is the \ndramatic movement of rates based on comments by the Federal Reserve \nwith respect to their elimination of the quantitative easing program. \nThe future looks as though we are going to see increased rates.\n  If we let them rise on students without any type of cap, I think we \nare going to, in a very short period of time, regret that we didn't \ntake more time--be more thorough, and look at not just issues of rate \nstructure but also incentives to keep costs down in college, and at \nrefinancing options, because it is a staggering debt load already on \nstudents. We haven't done any of this.\n  As a result, today, I introduce, along with many of my colleagues, \nthe Keep Student Loans Affordable Act. I wish to thank Senators Hagan, \nFranken, Warren, Harkin, Stabenow, Boxer, and many other colleagues.\n  This legislation will simply extend the current rate at 3.4 percent, \nthe rate we have today for need-based loans. These are the subsidized \nloans that go to low- and moderate income students. It would extend \nthem for 1 more year so we do have the time, and let's say we should \nand must take the time to thoughtfully develop a long-term approach to \nthe student loan program. It is not just coincidental that we must \nreauthorize the Higher Education Act this Congress. We can use this \ntime properly to ensure that we do, in fact, have a comprehensive \nsolution that will make students better off, not just in the next \nseveral months but in the long run.\n  Instead of charging low and moderate income students more for their \nstudent loans, our legislation would extend the 3.4-percent interest \nrate by closing a loophole in the tax laws, which allows fairly wealthy \nindividuals to defer taxes on their IRA or 401(K) type accounts. This \nprovision would save taxpayers $4.6 billion over 10 years, which will \nmore than cover the cost of extending the rate on subsidized student \nloans.\n  We are moving forward on a basis where we are not increasing the \ndeficit. What we are doing is giving students another chance to \nmaintain an appropriate loan level at 3.4 percent for an additional \nyear. We have to take action to stop the interest rates from doubling.\n  Student loan debt is the next big financial crisis facing this \ncountry. We already understand from analysts that people in their \ntwenties are putting off home purchases, automobile purchases, and are \nnot doing what their parents' generation did because they have so much \ndebt. They cannot move into the economy as their parents did. It is the \nsecond most outstanding household debt behind mortgage debt in the \ncountry. It surpassed credit card debt. It is affecting the trajectory \nof young people's lives.\n  Again, my generation thought by their late twenties they would own a \nhome, in fact, perhaps moving on, fixing up, and looking at second \nhomes. This has all changed.\n  Today students are caught between a rock and a hard place as they \nhave all this debt they must carry forward.\n  The other thing that is so interesting is we are scrambling around \nhere trying to figure out ways to deal with this issue. It turns out, \nin fact, the Congressional Budget Office has projected the loan program \nis actually generating revenue more than $50 billion this year and over \n$180 billion between now and 2023. We are actually making money on \nthese loans. Frankly, if we don't look at the program and fix it, the \nirony will be students will pay more and the government will take in \nprofits. In the long run, I think we will be worse for it because we \nwill be depriving a whole generation of the kind of education \nopportunity they need.\n  I think we have to do more. I introduced a long-term solution in \nApril, the Responsible Student Loan Solutions Act, which will set \nstudent loans based on the actual cost of financing and administering \nthe program. It will also protect students with a cap. I think that is \nessential. We have to understand the interest rates might rise to a \npoint where we need to cap them to protect students. It would also \nallow refinancing, which is something that has not been seriously \ndiscussed. We frankly need more time to discuss that. We need the time; \nlet's take the time.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me. Let's take up and pass the Keep \nStudent Loans Affordable Act. Give students the chance to go to school \nthis fall with a 3.4 percent subsidized interest rate. Give us not only \nthe chance but give us the incentives and give us the marching orders \nto fix this problem comprehensively.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the bill before us, S. 744, 1,200 pages, \nis promoted with high ideals, but it does not do what is promises. It \nis fatally flawed. If passed, it will not work--not because of the \ngoals it states to have but because it won't work.\n  This flawed bill did not come about because of inadvertent errors \nthat were a part of it, chance, ignorance, or mistake. The policies \nreflected in this piece of legislation came about as a direct result of \nthe fact that the forces that shaped it had goals that were important \nto them, but these goals are not coterminous with and are not in \nharmony with the interests of the Nation as a whole.\n  The real politique Gang that put it together seems fine with that. \nThey openly reported for weeks that these interests were in meetings in \nsome room in secret, working through this legislation and their \ndifferences. Soon, they said, the Gang of 8 would have a bill that, \nhaving been blessed by these powerful special interests they had \ninvited to the meetings, would be delivered to the Senate floor, \nmasters of the universe that they are, all for us to adopt without \ncomplaint and with celebration.\n  They were so proud of this process that the eight would stick \ntogether all for one and one for all and defeat any amendment that \ndared to alter the delicate agreement they talked about. They would \nconsider amendments, of course, oh, certainly. We will consider\n\n[[Page S5318]]\n\namendments, but nothing serious that impacts the fundamental agreement \nthat we have. One would not want to disturb that delicate balance, of \ncourse, of those very sensitive forces that were in the meetings. The \nfolks who came together only for the common good--who understood the \nreal needs of working Americans who are out of work, who have seen \ntheir paychecks decline, who have their spouse, their husband, their \nwife not able to find a job, their children not able to find a job, \ntheir grandchildren not able to find a job--they weren't thinking about \nthem.\n  They included Mr. Richard Trumka, the top union boss; Mr. Tom \nDonohue, the top Chamber of Commerce boss; the agribusiness \nconglomerates; the activist group La Raza. Also there were the \nimmigration lawyers association, high-tech billionaires, having \ndelivered magnificent computers, who now desire to deliver public \npolicy; and the meat packers.\n  One must know, friends, that when the Gang of 8 said there was a \nfragile balance, a delicate agreement, they weren't talking primarily \nabout the agreement they had among themselves as Senators. That was \nsecondary. The agreement they were referring to was the special \ninterest forces that were in that secret room writing that bill.\n  Those interests, those forces, had signed in blood. The Gang of 8 \nthen signed in blood to fight off any serious objections or ideas that \nwould violate that agreement.\n  Although the Gang and the cabal that had confederated and combined \ntogether to set the immigration policy for the United States of America \nwere desperate to keep it secret, there was another dominant force \ninvolved in the legislation, and that was President Obama. His team was \nthere every step of the way. His team, which has done more to undermine \nlaw enforcement in the immigration area than any President in history, \nwas there every step of the way. They were surely providing much of the \ndrafting work, the legal work, and the support to get the detail done, \nwhich the Senators, of course, didn't have time to do. They didn't have \ntime to study all the language of the bill.\n  We know about this because this week Ms. Munoz, President Obama's top \nimmigration official, formally a top official in La Raza who said it \nwas immoral for businesses to be checked as to whether they were hiring \nillegal workers--she couldn't keep it a secret. She made sure to reveal \nto the New York Times that she and President Obama were there every \nstep of the way, writing the bill, being engaged in it. All of this \nwas, of course, much to the discomfort of the Gang, especially the \nRepublicans, who had been anxious to declare the bill was written by \nthe job creators, entrepreneurs, and the Chamber of Commerce.\n  It went to the Judiciary Committee for a markup, and a very favorable \nJudiciary Committee it was. Four of the Gang of 8 are on the committee. \nThey started executing their plan. Senator Schumer on occasion would \ngive Republican Gang members on the committee a pass. He was overheard \non the mike saying to a staffer that Republicans can have a pass on \nthis vote. They could break ranks--the Republican Gang members--and \nvote with the people on an issue that came up in Judiciary Committee as \nlong as there were enough votes otherwise to kill that pesky \namendment--and so it was in committee.\n  One other important thing, the money. There would be money to run \ncampaign-like ads all over America to promote the bill, to promote the \nSenators, and to protect the Senators from criticism. And who knows, \nmaybe to provide some political contribution sometime in the future for \nthose who vote right.\n\n  The combine had it all rolling until last week on the floor of the \nSenate when the wheels almost came off. Senators and the American \npeople saw that S. 744 had more holes than Swiss cheese. Clearly, the \nbill lacked the simple conviction that after the amnesty occurred, the \nlawlessness must end. There was not a conviction anywhere displayed in \nthat legislation that the people who wrote it had a determination not \nto do more than provide the amnesty and actually provide a lawful \nsystem in the future to ensure that lawlessness would not be a part of \nour future. You can see it in hundreds of different places.\n  For example, the metrics--the standards for enforcement at the border \nin the bill--were weakened. Current law had higher standards of \nenforcement at the border than the new bill, which promised to be so \ntough--toughest bill ever, those TV ads said. Tough as nails, Senator \nSchumer said. But it weakened the standards for enforcement at the \nborder.\n  The E-Verify system for the workplace, which can be effective in \neliminating the hiring of illegal workers, was pushed back for five \nyears, and a whole new system was designed instead using the one \ncurrently in existence. It can occur now. The system is 99 percent \neffective now. Why would we want to wait 5 years, unless we really \nweren't interested in seeing it happen?\n  Interior enforcement was diminished. The ICE officers have written us \nand told us this will make it worse. They are diminished in their \nability to enforce the law. All kinds of discretion is given that will \nallow lawyers to block deportations and allow politicians to avoid the \ncarrying out of the law.\n  The citizenship process is deeply damaged and unable to function \neffectively, according to the Citizenship and Immigration Services \nofficers who process these applications. They say there is no way they \ncan process these applications.\n  An amendment I offered to have at least face-to-face interviews with \nmany of the people--at least those who may pose some risk--was voted \ndown. They are not even going to have interviews with the people who \napply for legal status under this bill.\n  The entry-exit system, which provides that an individual must be \nclocked in when they come into the country and clocked out with a \nbiometrics--fingerprint--system, that system was destroyed. Current law \nrequires a biometric entry-exit system at all land, sea, and airports. \nThis bill weakens that dramatically, makes it utterly unenforceable by \nchanging biometric to electronic, whatever that means, and only \nrequiring it to be at air and seaports.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent to have 1 additional minute, \nMr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So, Mr. President, I would say this bill fails at point \nafter point after point after point. It is not a bill that reflects a \ncommitment to a lawful system of immigration in the future. We will \nadmit dramatically more people than we ever have in our country's \nhistory at a time when unemployment is high. The Congressional Budget \nOffice has told us that wages, average wages, will go down for 12 \nyears, that the gross national product per capita will decline for 25-\nplus years, and that unemployment will go up.\n  This is not the right thing for us to pass because the amnesty will \noccur, but the enforcement is not going to occur and the policies for \nfuture immigration are not serving the national interest.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on cloture, to not let this bill pass \ntoday but require that it be subjected to more amendments and more \nstudy at a time to come when we can pass legislation that will actually \nwork. This cannot work as it is. We should not let it go to final \npassage today.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I understand I have 10 minutes allotted; \nis that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CORKER. I want to thank my friend from Alabama, who has been down \nhere vigorously and shows a lot of stamina. I have a sense he is not \ngoing to support this legislation.\n  I do want to talk, though, a little bit about this legislation this \nmorning. I was asked yesterday by a reporter about the folks back home \nin Tennessee and how they feel about the legislation. No doubt there is \na lot of controversy around this legislation. There have been a lot of \nstatements made that, candidly, don't pass the trying-to-get-it-right \ntest.\n\n[[Page S5319]]\n\n  What I said to this reporter was that I have a lot of faith in \nTennesseans. I believe Tennesseans, at the end of the day, will look at \nthis legislation and study it, not just listen to what has been said by \nnumbers of bloggers and people who are trying to spin things in such a \nway as to create confusion. At the end of the day, I believe when \nTennesseans see what is in this legislation, the majority of them, the \nlarge majority of them, will believe this legislation improves the \nconditions from where we are today. I believe they will believe that.\n  Of course, it is my job to go back home to explain to Tennesseans \ndirectly, as I do on all controversial issues, why I support this \nlegislation and why I think this is good for our country. But let me \nwalk Tennesseans and Americans and people here in the Senate through, \nfrom my perspective, where we have been on this piece of legislation.\n  First of all, this bill was introduced to the Judiciary Committee \nmonths ago, and hundreds and hundreds of amendments were added in the \nprocess and dealt with during that judiciary markup. It went through \nregular order, something all of us around here have been hoping would \noccur with all legislation, which is that it goes through the committee \nprocess and comes to the Senate floor.\n  The bill has been on the floor now for 3 weeks, and I know a lot of \npeople around here are complaining about the number of amendments. But \nlet's face it, for a long time people on my side of the aisle would not \nlet amendments be heard. It is just the truth. I mean, it is what \nhappens with controversial legislation. A lot of times when people \ndon't want to see something pass or see it improved, there are \nopponents to actually even hearing amendments.\n  So we had this ruse on the floor of the Senate yesterday about all \nthis. Look, I would like to have 100 amendments on the floor. I am all \nfor it. Bring it on. But the fact is, let's face it, both sides have \nbeen involved in keeping that from happening, and most recently it has \nbeen many of my friends on this side of the aisle.\n  Republicans gathered around the trigger that a Senator offered \nrelative to border security, and it had to do with a 90-percent \neffectiveness trigger. That is where negotiations around this bill \nreally hung up. But let me talk to people a little about this trigger.\n  When we look at the trigger that was in the border security bill, \nthat I candidly supported, and many folks on my side did, the trigger \nwas so subjective I would call it the Cheetos bag trigger or the \ngranola wrapper trigger or the plastic bottle trigger. I want to make \nsure people understand the way this trigger was and why it wasn't \nacceptable to the majority of people in the Senate.\n\n  The way this trigger works is it uses something called sign cuttings. \nThis is a term that is used to track people through the desert and \ntrack them through the mountains. It has been used in the country for \nhundreds of years, especially in places that are less urban. So here is \nwhat was happening with that trigger.\n  Border Patrol agents were going to be able to look at a Cheetos bag \nor an empty granola bar wrapper or an empty Coca Cola can and say: I \ndon't know, did 10 illegal aliens eat out of that Cheetos bag or did 1? \nI don't know. And it was that very subjectivity that people realized \nwas going to cause people to be able to move the goalpost.\n  I am making light of it, but it is just true. This is the way, \nbelieve it or not, we keep stats on the border right now, in this very \nsubjective manner. How many people attempted to get through? We didn't \nsee them, but we think maybe 10 people went up through that crevice.\n  It reminds me of when I go hunting once a year down in Albany, GA. I \nhave a friend who allows me to hunt on his place, and when a covey of \nbirds flies by, he says: I think there were 12, and he marks that down \nin his hunt log. Now, I am sure at the end of the year he gets somewhat \nclose to how many birds were on his plantation, if you will, but we are \nlooking at something that was going to matter as it relates to green \ncards, and it was subjective and was put in place, candidly, in such a \nway many people thought the goalpost was going to be moved.\n  So Senator Hoeven and myself, working with a lot of others in the \nbody, came up with tangible--tangible--triggers and not triggers some \nBorder Patrol agent could fudge one way or the other. Not that anyone \nwould attempt to, but one can understand, again, when someone is trying \nto guess how many people came through that they didn't even see--let me \nsay that one more time.\n  One of the denominating factors was the Border Patrol agents were \ngoing to have to say how many people came through the border that they \ndidn't see. Let's guess. By the way, let's make it exactly 90 percent.\n  So Senator Hoeven and I came up with an amendment that everybody \ncould understand with 20,000 Border Patrol agents, a doubling along the \nsouthern border--20,000 agents. Every American can know whether that \nhas happened. We added $4.5 billion worth of technology, and we listed \nthe inventory. Every American can see whether that has happened. We \nhave a fully implemented E-Verify. We don't want employers paying \npeople under the table. We don't want people hiring folks who are here \nillegally. So that is fully implemented--fully implemented before a \ngreen card.\n  We also have an entry-exit visa program. I think many people know the \nreason we had the terrorist attack on\n9/11. We had people who overstayed their visas. Americans don't want to \nsee that happen. So we have a tangible trigger--a tangible trigger--of \nmaking sure we have an entry-exit visa program.\n  We also have another 350 miles of fencing. Now, a lot of people say \nthat is not required, but it is absolutely required. Anybody who would \nsay that hasn't attempted to read the legislation.\n  So these are five tangible triggers. It is not a Cheetos bag \ntrigger--not a Cheetos bag trigger but five tangible triggers that \nallow people to know whether we have actually met the goals that are in \nthis bill.\n  There was a lot of discussion yesterday about an E-Verify amendment. \nAs has been said, it is an amendment that could have easily been added \nto this legislation. It is a fine amendment. I would certainly be glad \nto support it. Candidly, I think it is an amendment, if it made it to \nthe floor, that would be one of those 100-to-0 or 98-to-2 votes. Maybe \nit could pass by voice vote. It is not controversial. But the fact is \nthe bill has a lot in there relative to E-Verify, and no doubt the \nHouse can make that even stronger.\n  Some of my friends are saying this is an amnesty bill. I don't know \nif people have looked at the provisions about people coming in out of \nthe shadows and having to pay taxes--back taxes--and they will have to \npay fines. They will have to pay taxes, by the way, into the U.S. \nsystem for 10 years and cannot receive a single benefit from the U.S. \nGovernment. That is the reason this bill scores so favorably from the \nstandpoint of generating revenues into the Treasury.\n  But let me just say this. Nobody in this body has offered an \namendment that would round up everybody in this country who is here \nillegally and deport them out of this country. Not a single soul has \noffered an amendment to do that.\n  Basically, what we have is a situation where we can cause people to \ncome in out of the shadows, pay fines, pay taxes and receive no \nbenefits and go to the back of the line. Everybody who came here \nproperly or who has applied properly would be processed first. It is \ngoing to be a minimum of 10, maybe 13, 14, 15 years before people even \nhave the ability to get a green card.\n  The option is to vote against this bill and basically say we are not \ngoing to do anything about the people who are here; we are OK with \nemployers continuing to pay them under the table; we are OK with them \ncontinuing to not pay taxes, because not a single one of my colleagues \nhas offered an amendment to round up these 11 million people in our \ncountry and ship them out. I call that de facto amnesty.\n  Some people have talked about the process. One of my closest friends \nin the Senate said, I don't like the process. We should have been \nworking with the House from the very beginning.\n  I am not a Member of the Gang of 8, but we had eight Senators who \nworked for a long time to create a bill. The same thing is happening in \nthe House right now.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n[[Page S5320]]\n\n  Mr. CORKER. I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. The process is that the House passes legislation, if they \nso choose. They may not choose to take up immigration. My sense is they \nwill not take up this bill; they will take up their own bill. The way \nthe process works is we conference those, and we end up with a better \npiece of legislation.\n  Fiscally, if this bill passes, we are spending a lot of money on \nborder security--and some people have said it is too much. But, again, \nI have had no amendments over here trying to lower the standards that \nwere put in place by the Hoeven-Corker amendment. The fact is we would \nbe spending $46 billion on border security to have these five tangible \nthings occur, and we would be getting $197 billion back in the Treasury \nif we do this. I have never been able to vote for a piece of \nlegislation that had this much fiscal benefit for our country that \ndidn't raise anybody's taxes. Then we have seen the whole issue of the \neconomic growth that is going to be created for our country if we pass \nthis bill.\n  I believe voting against this bill is voting against border security. \nWhat that means is that things are going to stay exactly as they are. \nWe are going to have porous borders, no entry-exit visa program, no E-\nVerify system. I think voting against this bill is voting for the \nstatus quo, which is, in essence, de facto amnesty.\n  I believe this bill takes a step forward. I believe it is good for \nour country in every single way I can imagine, and later today I plan \nto support this bill. I hope it is improved in the House.\n  I cannot imagine there is anybody in this body who believes where we \nare today is satisfactory. I came here to make progress, to solve \nproblems, and I appreciate those involved in allowing me to help with \nthat process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all quorum \ncalls prior to the votes at 11:30 a.m. today be equally divided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       Nomination of Anthony Foxx\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I rise to say a few words about Anthony \nFoxx, the President's nominee to head the Department of Transportation \nthat we will be voting on later this morning. While I am going to be \nsad to see him leave our local government in Charlotte, I am pleased \nthe entire country will soon benefit from his leadership.\n  Anthony Foxx earned an undergraduate degree in history from Davidson \nCollege in North Carolina and blazed a trail as the school's first \nAfrican-American student body president. He then received a law degree \nfrom New York University and held positions in all three branches of \nthe Federal Government. Beginning as a judicial clerk on the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, he served ably as a lawyer for the \nDepartment of Justice and counsel for the House Judiciary Committee.\n  In 2005, Anthony was elected as an at-large member of the Charlotte \nCity Council. During his 4 years of service as a councilman, he chaired \nthe Transportation Committee and was a member of the Economic \nDevelopment and Planning Committee. Since 2009, he has served as mayor \nof Charlotte, one of the country's fastest growing cities.\n  When taking office, Charlotte's unemployment rate was almost 13 \npercent. Through his tireless efforts, Mayor Foxx helped attract and \ncreate more than 8,400 new jobs. Most important, Mayor Foxx has been a \ntrue champion of transportation and infrastructure development, \nsecuring forward-looking investments in Charlotte's roads, airports, \nand mass transit. Under his leadership, I-485 has been approved for \nexpansion; he secured funding toward the completion of the Blue Line \nLight Rail Extension Project, and oversaw the opening of the third \nrunway at Charlotte Douglas International Airport. All of these \nprojects occurred as we worked--and are still working--to climb out of \nthe recession.\n  These smart investments in infrastructure and transit-oriented \ndevelopment are continuing to fuel Charlotte's economic growth.\n  Light rail has played an important role in sustaining this growth, \nwith more than 19 million riders since it opened in 2007 and an average \nof 15,000 riders every day. The light rail is helping to revitalize \nCharlotte's historic South End neighborhood, which saw the city's first \nrailroad line in 1850. The neighborhood is now home to more than 750 \nbusinesses and 11 new residential districts.\n  Investments at Charlotte airport are establishing the city as an \ninternational hub. With direct flights to London and soon Brazil, \nCharlotte and North Carolina are increasingly connected to businesses \nacross the globe.\n  The I-85 Corridor Improvement Project, which has been a top priority \nfor the State for many years, I am pleased to say, is finally moving \nforward. This improvement project relies heavily on support from local \nleaders, including Mayor Foxx, and is expanding and improving this \nintegral roadway so it can meet the needs of businesses and residents \nfor years to come.\n  Anthony's direct experience working with the transportation \ndepartments at the Federal, State, and local levels and his proven \nrecord of success make him well prepared to serve as the next Secretary \nof Transportation.\n  I have worked closely with Mayor Foxx during my time in Washington, \nand I have the utmost confidence he will serve in this role with great \ndistinction. I thank him for his dedication and willingness to step up \nwhen service is needed, and I am pleased the Commerce Committee \napproved Anthony Foxx's nomination with unanimous bipartisan support.\n  Mayor Foxx is a true champion of transportation and infrastructure \ndevelopment, and I encourage my colleagues to support his nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Gang of 8 in their framework for \ncomprehensive immigration reform said the following:\n\n       Our legislation will provide a tough, fair, and practical \n     roadmap to address the status of unauthorized immigrants in \n     the United States that is contingent upon our success in \n     securing our borders and addressing visa overstays.\n\n  It sounds good, doesn't it? They said their plan would be contingent \nupon success.\n  But the bill doesn't do that. The bill doesn't say the border has to \nbe secured. It doesn't say that we need to see results. It only throws \nmore money at the problem and puts more boots on the ground. Of course, \nthat is a good start. But as we have seen before, that is not enough. \nIt is not enough to ensure we will not be back here in the same place \n25 years down the road, devising new plans. So I am going to take a few \nminutes to discuss the legalization program created in this bill.\n  Since I was here in 1986, I know that loopholes allowed people to \ngain legalization even if they weren't entitled to it. We had problems \nwith fraud and abuse back then, and I am afraid it will be the same if \nthe bill is passed in its current form.\n  Time and time again we have been told the bill will allow people here \nillegally to register and earn legal status, then become contributing \nmembers of society. Yet the bill fails to address how to prevent a \ncontinued influx of individuals who will replace those currently living \nin the shadows.\n  Take the CBO report as an example. CBO said illegal immigration would \nonly be reduced by 25 percent. That is not acceptable, especially given \nthe promise of the Gang of 8 that the bill would ``be a successful \npermanent reform to our immigration system that will not need to be \nrevisited.''\n  The legalization program begins upon the mere admission of a strategy \nsubmitted by the Secretary of Homeland Security. So almost immediately, \nmillions of people will come forward and be made lawful.\n  Remarkably, the bill virtually suspends enforcement during the 2\\1/\n2\\-year legalization application period. It prohibits law enforcement \nfrom detaining\n\n[[Page S5321]]\n\nor removing anyone claiming eligibility without any requirement to \nprove they are, in fact, eligible. Law enforcement is even required to \ninform those here illegally about legalization and give them the \nopportunity to apply.\n  Under the bill, undocumented immigrants already here can apply for \nand receive legal status, even if they have committed document fraud, \nprovided false statements to authorities, and absconded court-ordered \nremoval proceedings.\n  During this time, there is an enforcement holiday. Enforcement \nofficers would be limited in detaining or removing any individual who \nmerely claims eligibility for RPI status, regardless of whether there \nis proof to back that up.\n  Perhaps the enforcement holiday would be mildly concerning if we were \ndealing with individuals who only violated civil immigration laws. \nUnfortunately, the bill extends to those with criminal records. This \nincludes individuals who have gang affiliations, even felony arrests, \nand even multiple misdemeanor criminal convictions.\n  Moreover, the bill permits individuals who attain legalization to \ncontinue criminal behavior, so long as their behavior and subsequent \nconvictions remain below the eligibility threshold. In fact, the bill \ngoes even further and--can you believe this--provides the Secretary \nwith waiver authority in order to dismiss misdemeanor criminal \nconvictions for purposes of determining eligibility for legal status.\n  The bill does not limit those outside the country from applying for \nlegalization. The bill states that individuals who have previously been \ndeported or otherwise removed from the country are ineligible for RPI \nstatus. However, one need only turn a few pages to discover that the \nSecretary has sole, as well as unreviewable, discretion to waive this \nprovision and permit large classes of individuals to apply for \nlegalization.\n  There is yet another way of providing and allowing individuals who \nhave been removed or reentered illegally to apply for status, if they \nare fortunate enough to have a relative who does, in fact, qualify for \nlegalization. This weakens and undermines even current law where \nCongress has already declared that individuals who reenter illegally \nare not entitled to immigration benefits.\n  Amendments to prohibit those ordered removed, those currently in \nremoval proceedings, and those who have absconded and failed to show up \nfor removal proceedings from applying or being granted legal status \nwere voted down during committee considerations. An amendment to \nprevent spousal abusers, child abusers, drunk drivers, and other \nserious criminals from obtaining legal status was also rejected.\n\n  I know the public listening or reading these records will not believe \nthat Congress could do those things, that it is OK to have those people \nwith that sort of criminal activity being legalized, but that is what \nthe bill allows. These amendments also could have been voted on during \nfloor debate, but the majority refused to allow their consideration.\n  Now, the process for obtaining legalization is ripe for abuse and \npotentially encourages crafty behavior for individuals to game the \nsystem.\n  Under the bill, individuals applying for legal status are permitted \nto file numerous amended applications in the event their initial \napplication is denied for failure to complete properly or provide \nrequired documentation. In practice, one could continue to file \nnumerous amended applications, knowing each application is incomplete, \nresulting in a perpetual limbo where an individual can remain here for \nan indeterminate time without any possibility of removal.\n  Another area of potential abuse permits otherwise ineligible \nindividuals to remain indefinitely in the United States.\n  The bill provides for a stay of removal until a newly created \nadministrative appellate review process of the application has been \nexhausted. One need only imagine the vast loophole created that will \nallow ineligible applicants to remain in the United States pending a \ntypically extremely lengthy review process.\n  When combined with a never ending application process and an \nexpansive, time consuming appeals process, individuals can remain here \nfor years without ever obtaining legal status, and without any fear of \nremoval.\n  Under the bill, people with RPI status must prove that they have been \nemployed during the duration of their status. Yet, the bill allows \npeople to prove that employment--which is required to get a green \ncard--using merely a sworn affidavit.\n  We know from our 1986 experience that sworn affidavits are highly \nunreliable, and incentivize massive fraud. They are not verifiable or \ntrustworthy.\n  A New York Times article from 1988 shows just how easy it was for \nimmigrants to get false affidavits. During one investigation, the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service arrested seven people for \nselling fraudulent affidavits to new immigrants.\n  One of these seven fraudsters ran a scheme that sold affidavits to \n1,400 people here illegally. They had thousands more applications \nfilled out and waiting for others. In fact, while investigators were on \nsite seizing the evidence, dozens of individuals arrived to purchase \nmore fraudulent affidavits. Buying and selling fake documents was a \nthriving business and can be again.\n  According to the article, one person arrested had 364 fraudulent \naffidavits on her five-acre farm.\n  A third of these fraudsters went from farm to farm, offering false \naffidavits to farmers for prices from $950 to $3,000.\n  The Majority has rejected several amendments that would improve on \nthe 1986 legalization. That is unfortunate. The bill will lead to \nfurther fraud. It is my hope these provisions can still be fixed before \nany bill is sent to the President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nimmigration reform bill that we are going to vote on soon. I want to \nbring a Minnesota perspective to this debate. I want to talk about how \nthis bill will help Minnesota businesses and agriculture while also \nhelping and protecting Minnesota workers. I also want to talk about how \nthis bill will help Minnesota families and communities.\n  Minnesota was admitted to the Union in 1858. For the first 30 years \nafter Minnesota's founding, no fewer than one-third of Minnesotans were \nimmigrants born abroad. Our State did not suffer from that--it thrived. \nOur fields were first tilled by Swedish immigrants. Their crops filled \n2 million acres. Our iron mines in the north depended on Finnish labor. \nNorwegians were critical to our logging industry, while the Danes, who \ncame to Minnesota after the Civil War, made our State a leader in dairy \nfarming.\n  Today, immigrants are about 7 percent of Minnesota's population. Most \nof them come from Asia, and Latin America, and Africa, rather than \nEurope. But the contributions of immigrants to Minnesota's economy and \nto our communities are no less important.\n  I am going to vote for this bill because of what it will do for \nMinnesota's economy. This is clearest when it comes to Minnesota's \nagricultural industry, particularly our dairy farms. Minnesota is the \nNation's sixth largest dairy producer. Five percent of our nation's \ncows are in our State.\n  But for years, I have been meeting with dairy farmers and they told \nme they can't get the workforce they need. They can't find enough \nAmerican workers--and the Nation's agricultural guestworker program is \nopen only to seasonal workers. Unfortunately, you can't milk cows \nseasonally. If you did, they would just get cranky, the cows.\n  For years, I have been calling for an immigration bill to fix this \nproblem by opening our guestworker program to dairy farmers. This bill \ndoes just that.\n  This bill will not just help agriculture. A lot of industry in \nMinnesota is in the high tech and medical sectors--companies like 3M \nand Medtronic. Unfortunately, our visa system works against these \ncompanies because, while the University of Minnesota is minting new \nPh.D.'s in STEM fields, our system sends many of our top foreign \ngraduates right back to their home countries.\n  Thanks to the work of my fellow Minnesota senator, Senator Klobuchar, \nthis bill will make it easier for Minnesota companies to recruit and\n\n[[Page S5322]]\n\nhire top minds, regardless of where they come from.\n  I am also proud that this bill includes two amendments that I wrote \nthat will protect small businesses.\n  A major component of this bill is to create a mandatory electronic \nemployment verification system called E-Verify. But small businesses in \nMinnesota were initially concerned about how E-Verify would affect \nthem.\n  My first amendment creates a special office within the Department of \nHomeland Security whose sole job will be to give workers and small \nbusinesses quick, in-person assistance if E-Verify does not work the \nway it should. My other amendment will keep pressure on DHS to lower E-\nVerify error rates that, in the past, have caused major headaches for \nsmall businesses and employees alike.\n  While this bill will help our businesses, it also has solid \nprotections for American workers.\n  In negotiations, the AFL-CIO demanded that before an American \nemployer can hire a foreign guestworker, that employer has to \naggressively advertise for and recruit American workers. If a business \nbreaks these rules, it can get kicked out of the guestworker program. \nIf the protections in this bill prove insufficient, I will fight to \nimprove them. But for now, I think protections negotiated by the AFL-\nCIO are adequate for moving forward.\n  So this bill will protect workers today. But it will also help them \nfor decades down the line by bolstering our Nation's safety net. Our \nchanging demographics have put a strain on our Social Security system. \nMore young workers paying into the Social Security system will help \nease that, and that is precisely what this bill will provide: Census \nfigures show that 48 percent of immigrants in the U.S. are between the \nages of 20 to 44; for native-born workers, that figure is about 31 \npercent.\n  Finally, this bill will help our economy by helping our Nation's \nbottom line. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, \nimmigration reform will decrease our deficit by $175 billion over the \nnext decade, and an additional $700 billion over the following decade. \nThat's $875 billion dollars--close to a trillion dollars in deficit \nreduction.\n  This bill will be a boon to Minnesota's economy, and to our Nation's \neconomy too. But this bill is not just about economics. It is also \nabout our values. It is about living up to the promise engraved on the \nbase of the Statue of Liberty:\n\n       Give me your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. Send \n     these, the homeless, the tempest-tost [sic] to me. I lift my \n     lamp beside the golden door.\n\n  Minnesota played a special part in that promise. For decades, \nMinnesota has welcomed more refugees and asylees than almost any other \nState.\n  We have welcomed the Hmong and Somalis and so many others because it \nis the right thing to do. In the same way, a big part of this bill is \nabout doing the right thing and helping the least of our brothers and \nsisters.\n  Last October I traveled to Northfield, MN, where I visited a program \nfor Latino high school students called the ``TORCH'' program--that \nstands for Tackling Obstacles and Raising College Hopes. This is an \namazing program that has more than doubled the high school graduation \nrate for Latino students.\n  During my visit I met many undocumented students who were brought \nhere by their parents as young children--and who were thus undocumented \nthrough no fault of their own.\n  For years, these kids watched their classmates apply to college and \nplan for their careers, but they knew that was not for them--because \nthey could not work legally or serve in our military.\n  Then, last June, the President took executive action to protect these \nkids from deportations and let them work legally. Their teachers told \nme what an enormous difference it made for these kids. For the first \ntime, they could see they had a future--they could go to college or \njoin the military. And that was just because an executive order that \ndid not have the force of a statute.\n  With this bill, thanks to the inclusion of the DREAM Act, authored by \nSenator Durbin, their hope for the future will be a certainty. Good for \nthose kids. And you know what, good for us, because those kids are \ngoing to work wonders.\n  I am especially proud of a bill I wrote that also helps children and \nthat is included in the larger bill we are debating, and that is the \nHELP Separated Children Act.\n  My bill was inspired by what happened in Worthington, MN in December \n2006, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement carried out enforcement \nactions in 6 States and arrested hundreds of unauthorized immigrants. \nTragically, those raids also left many children--most of them \ncitizens--without their parents and with no way to find them. One 2nd \ngrader in Worthington came home from school to find his 2-year-old \nbrother alone and his parents gone. For the next week, he cared for his \nbrother while his grandmother drove from Texas to meet them.\n  Over the past 2 years, more than 200,000 parents of citizen children \nwere deported. These children are often abandoned at home or at school \nand can go for months without speaking with or visiting their parents. \nMy HELP Separated Children Act will lay down basic humanitarian \nprotections for children in immigration enforcement. It will make sure \nthat parents and children can stay in contact, and will make sure that \nparents can participate in court proceedings relating to their \nchildren.\n  My bill was co-sponsored by Senators Grassley, Coons, Cornyn, Hirono, \nCruz, Feinstein, Leahy and Blumenthal. Of the 200 or so amendments that \nwe debated in the Judiciary Committee, this was the only one that was \npassed on a unanimous 18 to 0 vote.\n  I am also proud that the bill includes amendments I proposed to help \nvictims of domestic violence, as well as young children who are \nthemselves involved in immigration proceedings.\n  We have a rare opportunity before us. We have a chance to vote on a \nbipartisan bill written by a bipartisan group and supported by both the \nAFL-CIO and the Chamber of Commerce. The bill will help our economy, \nsecure our border, and give millions of undocumented people a tough but \nfair path to get right with the law. And on top of all of this, this \nbill will save the American people hundreds of billions of dollars. I \nam proud to support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Before I close, I want to take a moment to congratulate the members \nof the Gang of Eight--Senators Schumer, McCain, Durbin, Graham, \nMenendez, Rubio, Bennet and Flake. This bill is an example of the \nSenate at its best. It speaks not just to the ability of the Senators \nin the Gang--but also to their courage.\n  I would also like to recognize Chairman Leahy for managing this \nmarkup and this debate so expertly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I just want to speak for a few minutes. \nI spoke at length earlier this week.\n  I thank Senator Franken for his kind words and the work he has done \non this bill, and also Senator Leahy, as well as all of those involved \nwith this bill. Managing the bill this morning, it is, again, awe \ninspiring to see all the work that has been done on both sides of the \naisle--whether people will vote for the bill.\n  I expect we will have a strong bipartisan vote on this bill after the \ncivil debate we have had. This is an incredibly big and important issue \nfor this country. I have been involved in this debate since 2007. We \nhave seen everyone come together from labor, business, farm groups, \nmigrant workers, immigrant workers, and religious groups. We are \nfinally going to get this incredibly important bill done.\n  As Senator Franken noted, the piece that has been most important to \nme--in addition to the DREAM Act and all of the work that had to be \ndone in law enforcement--was the work we have done to improve our legal \nimmigration system. We are a country built on immigration. Thirty \npercent of our U.S. Nobel Laureates were born in other countries; 90 of \nour Fortune 500 companies were formed by immigrants. We cannot continue \nto compete in the global economy if we close our doors to those who \nthink and make things and invent things. In part, that is what most \nexcites me about this bill, the\n\n[[Page S5323]]\n\nwork we have done to improve the legal immigration system.\n  I thank my colleagues, the Gang of 8, and our great Judiciary \nCommittee that debated and marked up this bill into the night day after \nday. We should be proud of this bill, and I ask my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  With that, I yield for Senator Lee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, before beginning my remarks, I would first \nlike to thank my friend and colleague, the distinguished Senator from \nIowa, for his tireless efforts in managing this process from the \nRepublican side. It has not been easy, and his effort has reflected a \ncertain level of statesmanship that is to be commended.\n  I rise today in support of immigration reform. I support \nstrengthening our borders and ensuring that they are secure before \nbeginning a pathway to citizenship because it is the only way we can \navoid the mistakes of the past.\n  I support robust interior enforcement and a biometric visa tracking \nsystem because without those things in place, we will not solve the \nproblem of illegal immigration. I support modernizing and streamlining \nour visa system because we need an efficient process of legal \nimmigration that meets the needs of our economy. I support immigration \nreform that is tough on those who have chosen to break our laws and \nfair to those who have obeyed them and have been patiently waiting \ntheir turn in line trying to come here legally.\n  Today there is reason for disappointment, but there is also great \ncause for encouragement. The bill we have before us is an enormous \ndisappointment. The American people deserve better. As a matter of \npublic policy, this bill fails to meet many of the goals we set at the \nbeginning of the process.\n  It is full of promises to beef up border security, but it makes no \nassurances. This legislation cuts the American people out by cutting \nout any congressional oversight of the opening and progression of the \npathway to citizenship. It remains grossly unfair to those who have \nlanguished in our current legal immigration system, unable to get \nanswers for decades in some cases. It transfers enormous authority and \ndiscretion to the executive branch, exacerbating an already widespread \nproblem within our Federal Government.\n  It also fails perhaps the most important test. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, this bill will reduce illegal immigration \nby just a mere 25 percent over the next 10 years. This should be reason \nalone to scrap the entire bill.\n  As a matter of process, Members of this body should be embarrassed \nabout how this bill has moved through the Senate. From day one the \ncountry was misled about what was in the bill. The talking points never \nmatched the reality of what was in the bill.\n  We were told if we didn't like what was in it, we would have an \nopportunity to fix it. But that wasn't true either. During the \ncommittee markup, Democrats and the Gang of 8 Republicans voted as a \nblock to defeat virtually all substantive amendments proposed to \nimprove the bill.\n  They said there would be regular order on the floor of the Senate, \nbut that turned out to be a false promise as well. For a 1,200-page \nbill, the Senate, including the 92 Members not on the Judiciary \nCommittee or the Gang of 8, was allowed exactly 10 rollcall votes \nbefore the process was shut down.\n  By contrast, during the 2007 debate on immigration reform, the Senate \nvoted 32 times to amend the bill. Some would argue even that was too \nsmall. But certainly 10 votes on a 1,200-page bill does not suggest \nthat the proponents of the bill are interested in regular order.\n  For the grand finale, at nearly the end of this process, the \nproponents substituted what is effectively a brandnew bill in place of \nthe one we have been debating for over 2 months. They gave us very \nlittle time to read it before we had to vote on it. Once we were on the \nnew bill, they did not allow a single vote on any amendments.\n  This is an embarrassment to this institution, and it is an assault on \nthe principles of democracy, but like a Phoenix rising from the ashes, \nfrom this low point in the Senate springs an encouraging path forward \nfor those who, like me, truly want immigration reform.\n  First, this exercise has laid out in front of the American people all \nthe problems inherent in passing massive pieces of legislation presumed \nto fix all of our problems at once. The so-called comprehensive \napproach has been utterly discredited. From denying votes to buying \nvotes with special interest carve-outs, our experience over the last 2 \nmonths only reaffirms why the vast majority of Americans don't trust \nWashington.\n  The special interests had a huge hand in writing the bill, while the \nAmerican people had none. Almost all of the discussions and \nnegotiations took place in secret backroom deals. Rather than debate \npolicy differences, the debate was a daily fact check on misleading and \noutright false claims made by some of the bill's proponents.\n  The good news is the House appears to have learned this lesson and \nwants no part of this. Already the Speaker has said the Senate bill is \ndead on arrival. So today's vote is largely symbolic.\n  The House Judiciary Committee has recently passed two significant \npieces of immigration reform--the one on interior enforcement and \nanother dealing with agricultural workers. It proves that reform can be \npassed in a step-by-step process. Indeed, the only reason immigration \nreform is so controversial is because the Senate refuses to pass it one \npiece at a time. There is simply no legitimate reason we have to pass a \none-size-fits-all, 1,200-page take-it-or-leave-it bill.\n\n  Although it is likely this bill will pass today, I strongly encourage \nmy colleagues to consider where we started, where we are now and, most \nimportantly, what lies ahead of us. They said it would secure the \nborder; it does not. Congress has been fooled by false promises before. \nWe should not go down that same path again.\n  They said illegal immigration will be a thing of the past. Under this \nbill, it will not. The Congressional Budget Office confirmed that under \nthis bill, there will be 6- to 8-million illegal aliens in the country \n10 years from now. They said it would be good for the economy. It \nisn't.\n  CBO also confirmed that it would lower wages and increase \nunemployment. They said it would be tough but fair. It is neither. It \nis not tough on those who have broken the law, and it is not fair for \nthe people who have been trying to come here legally.\n  If this bill passes today, it will be all but relegated to the ash \nheap of history as the House appears willing to tackle immigration \nreform the right way. The sponsors of this bill had the best of \nintentions but, in my opinion, intentions are not always enough.\n  As I said at the outset, I stand here today strongly in support of \nimmigration reform, but this bill is not immigration reform. It is big \ngovernment dysfunction, and that is why I cannot support it and urge my \ncolleagues to vote against it.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 21 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I yield myself up to 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Utah in many of \nhis remarks, if not all of his remarks. I come here to speak on the \npending immigration bill more in disappointment than in anger because \nof the lost opportunity we had in the Senate to come up with a bill \nthat would actually do the job of restoring legality and order to our \nbroken immigration system, create a system of legal immigration which \nwould benefit our economy, and reflect our basic values.\n  It has been 5 months since the Gang of 8 first released their \nframework of principles for immigration reform. At the time, they were \nsaying many of the right things--things that gave me great \nencouragement that we would come up with a better product than we have \ntoday. They promised their bill would secure our borders once and for \nall.\n  I live in a border State with 1,200 miles of common border with \nMexico. We know that border permits not only illegal entry into the \nUnited States because of inadequate resources and personnel there, but \nalso it is a benefit to\n\n[[Page S5324]]\n\nthe United States because of the legitimate trade that passes through \nthe ports of entry that create and support up to 6 million jobs in \nAmerica.\n  They promised a tough but fair legalization program. They promised \nthat permanent legalization would be contingent on border security. \nThis is a recurring theme in my remarks because I actually was so naive \nto believe the representations made by the Gang of 8.\n  In January 2013 Senator Durbin, the distinguished majority whip, \nsaid: A pathway to citizenship needs to be contingent upon securing the \nborder. That is what he said in January. Instead of a delivery on that \npromise, what we got was his statement 6 months later in June of 2013: \nThe gang has delinked the pathway to citizenship and border \nenforcement.\n  So the American people have been asked to extend an act of common \ngenerosity and compassion that is typical of the American people, but \nwhat they get in return is no assurance that the system has been \nrestored to order or that the border has been secured. Unfortunately, \nonce again, it is business as usual in Washington, DC.\n  The promises the Gang of 8 made were encouraging and they raised \nhopes in me and others that we truly would have a bipartisan \nimmigration bill voted out of the Senate that was worthy of the name. \nBut, unfortunately, the bill now bears little resemblance to the \ninitial promises of the Gang of 8.\n  I know we talked a lot about border security, but in addition to a \nnational security issue this is a matter of restoring the public's \nconfidence that the Federal Government will actually do its job.\n  The fundamental problem with this legislation is that it demands \nborder security inputs but not outputs or results. In other words, the \nidea is--and the Washington Post editorial seemed to get it today--if \nyou promise to buy enough stuff, then somehow the job will miraculously \nget done.\n  This bill asks us to believe that quadrupling the size of the Border \nPatrol and expanding the border fence will solve the problem of illegal \nimmigration. I certainly agree that what the Border Patrol calls \ntactual infrastructure or fencing--and particularly in urban areas--can \nbe a tool that is effective. I certainly believe that additional Border \nPatrol--my proposal was that we add about 5,000 Border Patrol--would be \nhelpful. Once the technology identifies people crossing the border \nillegally, they have to have somebody go pick them up.\n  I actually agree with Senator McCain when he initially opposed my \namendment to add 5,000 Border Patrol agents, when he said he thought \nthe answer was mainly in the area of improved technology. I agree with \nthat. But imagine my surprise when Senator McCain and Senator Schumer, \nthe two main advocates of this surge in the underlying bill for border \nsecurity, said: We think 5,000 Border Patrol agents is a budget buster, \nonly to come back a few days later and offer 20,000 Border Patrol \nagents at an increased cost of at least $30 billion.\n  So without a coherent strategy or mechanism for ensuring results, \nadding 20,000 Border Patrol agents--assuming that it ever actually \nhappens--and a few hundred miles of additional fencing could turn out \nto be a massive waste of taxpayer dollars. Again, there is something \nfundamentally wrong with the idea that if we throw enough money at the \nproblem, it will somehow miraculously be resolved.\n  What we need is a plan, and what we need to know is how we can invest \nin this plan to accomplish measurable results, and this bill does not \nproduce that.\n  So if a person believes the Federal Government is going to hire \n20,000 additional Border Patrol agents and spend all this money over \nthe next 10 years, well, as the song goes, I have some oceanfront \nproperty in Arizona I would like to sell you.\n  My colleagues don't have to take my word for it. In recent days \nexperts from across the political spectrum have told us this bill takes \nthe wrong approach to border security. And contrary to what my good \nfriend from Tennessee says, it is not ``this bill or nothing.'' This is \nnot the only alternative. So one could say this bill is flawed and \ndoesn't accomplish the job but still be for immigration reform and a \nsolution, which I am.\n  The former Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service \nDoris Meissner said the border security provisions in this bill are \ndetached from reality. Former Customs and Border Protection \nCommissioner Robert Bonner, also formerly head of the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, said the bill ``is simply throwing a phenomenal amount \nof money at a problem to gain political support''--which it apparently \nhas done--``but is not likely to solve the problem.''\n  Meanwhile, former DHS official John Whitley has reminded us that we \nshould be focusing on border security outputs instead of inputs. In \nother words, we should be looking at not just what is put into this but \nwhat it actually produces in terms of results. That makes sense. Just \nspending a lot of money on stuff we are going to buy without any plan \nand without measuring outputs isn't going to get the job done.\n  An output-based trigger would assure the American people that we will \nnot grant legal status until after our borders are secured. And the \nreason is because this is not a punitive measure; this is a way of \nrealigning all of the incentives so that Republicans, Democrats, \nIndependents, liberals, and conservatives can all pressure the \nexecutive branch and the bureaucracy to actually accomplish the \npromises set out in the bill rather than just throw money at it.\n  The Presiding Officer has heard me say that the amendment I offered \nwould have made legalization contingent on 100 percent situational \nawareness of the U.S.-Mexico border and full operational control of the \nborder. I have been criticized by some of my friends who say that is an \nunreasonable requirement and then ask: Where in the world did you get \nthose figures? Well, I got that out of the Gang of 8 proposal. The \ndifference is that mine would have guaranteed accomplishing the goal; \ntheirs merely promises it but will never keep that promise.\n  I would have also made it contingent on a nationwide biometric entry-\nexit system--something this Federal Government has been promising for \n17 years since President Clinton signed that requirement into law, but \nthat promise hasn't been kept either.\n  I also included in my amendment nationwide E-Verify, which is a way \nfor employers to verify the eligibility of workers who apply for a job, \nthat they can legally work in the United States.\n  As I said, ironically, the Gang of 8 promised all of these same \nthings, but the only mechanism I have seen that would have actually \nguaranteed it to happen was the amendment I offered that was tabled.\n  What I have described is a real border security trigger, not just \nanother promise--the kind of trigger that will be necessary to get \nbipartisan immigration reform not just out of the Senate but out of the \nHouse of Representatives and on to the President's desk. I don't think \nwe should be so shortsighted as to pat ourselves on the back and say: \nHey, the Senate has passed an immigration reform bill, only to find it \ndead on arrival in the House of Representatives and to make it harder, \nnot easier, to get a consensus bill on the President's desk for him to \nsign. That is not success.\n  Not surprisingly, the Congressional Budget Office reports that this \nbill will have only the slightest impact on illegal immigration.\n  The American people are not fooled. A recent Rasmussen poll says that \nonly about 28 percent of Americans actually believe this bill will \nsecure America's borders. The American people have been fooled in the \npast, which is another reason they are skeptical now, and they don't \nbelieve this bill will get it, and I don't either.\n  In short, we are about to vote on a bill that repeats the mistakes of \nthe past and does not learn from them, offering merely promises but no \nresults. But it also makes a few new mistakes as well.\n  Despite earlier promises of a tough but fair legalization program, \nthis bill grants immediate legal status to people with multiple drunk \ndriving convictions and people with multiple domestic violence \nconvictions. And for people who have actually already committed these \ncrimes and been deported, this bill would allow them to come back and \nregister for RPI status.\n\n[[Page S5325]]\n\n  I simply do not understand, nor has anyone attempted to explain, how \nwe can in good conscience support legalization, of violent criminals. I \nam not talking about just people who have come here to work and \notherwise been law-abiding citizens; I am talking about people who come \nhere and, in contempt of our laws, have committed crimes of violence, \nand they are now going to be rewarded under this bill with probationary \nstatus and a pathway to citizenship. A few days ago I challenged my \ncolleagues to come to the floor and explain or perhaps defend these \nprovisions. I didn't find any takers.\n  I also mentioned the tragic stories of husbands and wives, fathers \nand mothers, brothers and sisters who lost their lives after being hit \nby an illegal immigrant drunk driver. Just to give some perspective, in \n2011 alone Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported nearly 36,000 \npeople with DUI convictions. This bill legalizes people who have \ncommitted driving under the influence offenses as well as people with \nmultiple domestic violence offenses.\n  Some might argue that multiple misdemeanors aren't that big of a \ndeal, but tell that to the family of a loved one who has lost their \nson, their daughter, their mother, their father, their brother, or \ntheir sister because of drunk driving by people who have illegally \nentered our country. It is worth remembering that the difference \nbetween a misdemeanor and a felony can be just 1 day in custody.\n  These are not minor offenses. It is worth remembering that, \nparticularly in a domestic violence context, a felony is often pleaded \ndown to a misdemeanor because of challenges getting cooperation from \nthe complaining witness, who frequently lives with the defendant.\n  No fewer than 23 States classify certain domestic violence offenses \nas misdemeanors. In Minnesota, misdemeanor domestic violence even \nincludes domestic abuse with a deadly weapon. That law may call it a \nmisdemeanor, but it is a serious crime.\n  So for one last time, I will issue my challenge: Are there any \nsupporters of this bill who will come to the Senate floor and tell the \nAmerican people why drunk drivers, domestic abusers, and already \ndeported criminals should be given immediate legal status under this \nbill? Well, I won't be holding my breath. No one has taken me up on \nthat yet.\n\n  I have just a few final points. We have been told this bill reduces \nthe Federal budget deficit over the next 10 years. Amazingly, in some \nsort of Washington-style accounting, we can spend about $50 billion and \nstill save money. That is amazing. It is magical. And it is pure \nfantasy. We were told that previously on the Affordable Care Act, but \nwe know this bill is premised on accounting tricks. The reality is that \nit will actually increase the on-budget deficit.\n  This is the amazing thing to me. We have some of our colleagues who \nare some of the most effective deficit hawks in this Chamber--those who \nhave been champions fighting against special spending projects that \ntend to corrupt the political process--yet they support this bill and \nseem to have turned a blind eye to the on-budget deficit and the fact \nthat this bill is littered with de facto earmarks, carve-outs, and pet \nspending projects.\n  We have been told this bill modernizes the southern border. Yet it \ndoes absolutely nothing to facilitate the flow of lawful trade and \ncommerce across our border and to allow law enforcement to focus on the \ncriminal element, which would represent a tremendous step in the right \ndirection.\n  I wish to reiterate that I agree with the Gang of 8 and those who \nsupport some aspects of this bill that we need a nationwide E-Verify \nsystem. I know Senator Portman from Ohio, for example, had an E-Verify \nimprovement amendment, but, like 45 other amendments denied an \nopportunity to be heard as part of this process wherein we have only \nseen 10 votes on amendments, he was unable to offer that improvement to \nthis bill.\n  I agree with the Gang of 8 and those who say we need stricter \npenalties on employers who hire illegal immigrants. I agree with those \nwho say we need to increase the number of visas for highly skilled \nimmigrants with advanced STEM degrees. I agree with the goal of \nunifying families. All of these measures enjoy broad bipartisan \nsupport, and I want to offer my congratulations to the Gang of 8 for \nincluding them in this bill.\n  However, I can't support a bill that repeats the mistakes of the past \nby making a promise of future action that will never be kept, \nparticularly on border security, and one that repeats the mistakes of \n1986. I certainly can't support a bill that offers immediate legal \nstatus to drunk drivers, wife-beaters, and violent criminals.\n  I was disappointed when my RESULTS amendment was tabled, and I am \ndisappointed that today we are about to pass deeply flawed legislation \nthat will not be taken up by the House of Representatives. But I take \nsome comfort in knowing that while the initial Senate debate is ending, \nthe broader nationwide debate is just beginning. In the weeks and \nmonths ahead, I want to continue to play an active and constructive \nrole, particularly working with our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives, to pass real immigration reform that promotes security \nand prosperity for the American people.\n  I note that one of our colleagues in the House called this bill a \nrunaway train in the Senate, but that train is getting ready to slow \ndown, and I think the American people will benefit from the Congress \ntaking its time to make sure that we not simply pass a bill but we pass \na good bill, one that reflects our values and one that also benefits \nour economy. I think they will benefit from a careful discussion and \ndialog between the Senate and the House about what ultimately will be \nthe bill that goes to the President's desk.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have noticed on several occasions the affection my \nfriend from Texas has for this poster board that contains this reputed \nquote from me. I wish to ask the Senator from Texas, since he has used \nthat repeatedly on the floor, is he aware of the fact that when I was \nasked about the relationship between the path to citizenship and border \nenforcement, it was in the context of the Cornyn amendment which \nestablished a percentage requirement as part of border enforcement? Is \nthe Senator aware that the bill itself includes a dramatic commitment \nto resources on the border of the Senator's State with the nation of \nMexico--literally doubling the number of Border Patrol agents and \nbillions of dollars being spent to make sure we stop as much as humanly \npossible illegal immigration--and that before the path to citizenship, \nthe bill requires an E-Verify system as well as an exit-entry visa \nsystem? Is the Senator aware that is not included in that reference he \nhas made to my statement?\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would say to my good friend, the \nassistant majority leader, I am aware of the promises that are made in \nthe underlying bill. My point is there is no mechanism to guarantee the \ngoals the Gang of 8, on which the assistant majority leader has \nserved--the promises that are made in terms of 100-percent situational \nawareness and operational control--there is absolutely nothing there \nthat will guarantee the American people that promise will be kept, \nwhich is a serious problem, which is the reason why, when I saw the \nbipartisan framework for comprehensive immigration reform, I was \nencouraged. Because I could support a bill that did make a pathway to \nlegal permanent residency contingent upon a certification that these \ngoals have been met. But I cannot based on sad experience dating back \nto 1986 and 1996, and other times in the past, where Congress has made \nrepeated promises of future performance--promises that are never kept.\n  I would say, in conclusion, the American people are asked to be \nextraordinarily generous here in terms of providing probationary status \nand the possibility of legal permanent residency, and maybe even \ncitizenship in the future. That is an act of extraordinary generosity \nand compassion they are being asked to demonstrate. But to be given \njust promises that will not be kept by throwing money at the problem, \nwithout any real plan to make sure it is going to be effective, this \nbill falls way short of its promises.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n[[Page S5326]]\n\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would notify the assistant Republican \nleader I will be making a unanimous consent request in a few minutes \nafter my remarks. I do not want him to be surprised by that.\n  Members representing all corners of this great Nation have been \nworking hard on amendments to improve this comprehensive immigration \nbill. For a week now we have been trying to negotiate a package of \nnoncontroversial amendments to be included in this legislation.\n  In my experience over the years, both in the majority and in the \nminority, for whatever bill you had before the Senate, when you have a \nlist of noncontroversial amendments, they are simply agreed to by \neverybody and put in a managers' package so as not to take up a day \nvoting on things that are going to pass anyway.\n  Last week I filed a managers' package of amendments. I removed from \nthis list the ones that have been objected to by other Members. \nInstead, though, the Republican minority has taken the position that in \norder to even clear a few noncontroversial amendments--which includes \nboth Republican and Democratic amendments--the majority must agree to \nvote on dozens of highly contentious measures, including amendments \nbeing offered by Senators who have said that no matter what happens \nthey are going to oppose the legislation. In my experience, under both \nDemocratic and Republican leadership in the Senate, that has never been \nconsidered reasonable.\n  Many of my friends on the other side of the aisle have complained we \nhave not had more votes on this bipartisan immigration bill, and I \nshare that frustration. From the outset, Republicans have delayed the \nbill's consideration and the ability of Members to file amendments by \nfilibustering the motion to proceed to the bill. We all know the bill \nis going to get cloture, but they still filibustered the motion to \nproceed--just as one more delaying tactic. In fact, 15 Members refused \nto even cut off a filibuster, not for a vote on the legislation, but \njust to bring it on the floor so we could begin to debate it--delay \nafter delay after delay.\n  Then once we overcame the filibuster and we could debate the \nlegislation, I offered an amendment, and then I agreed to set it aside \nso Senator Grassley could call up a Republican amendment--again, the \ncomity we usually have in this place. Well, then, when the next set of \namendments was ready to be made pending, the Republicans, instead of \ndoing what we Democrats did--allowing them to come up--objected to \nsetting aside the pending amendment and prevented the next two \namendments from becoming pending and ready for a vote. Then they \nobjected to time agreements on votes. They even objected to allowing \nthe leader to modify my amendment late last week, last Thursday night.\n  They complain about delays--why aren't we voting? Every time we try \nto vote, they object.\n  The lack of cooperation on this bipartisan bill has been frustrating \nfor Senators on both sides of the aisle. I have had a lot of Republican \nSenators who have come to me saying they do not agree with these \ndelays. It has been clear since day one that a small minority of \nRepublican Senators is going to do anything to thwart this bill's \npassage. It is hard to sympathize with those who complain they cannot \nget a vote on their amendments, when they have objected to even the \nmost minor consent agreements to make progress on the bill. The \nexpression ``crocodile tears'' comes to mind.\n  We have tried to find a way forward for votes on both sides, but it \nhas been thwarted. It makes one wonder whether some would rather have \nthe ability to complain about process rather than take votes to improve \nthe bill. I had hoped we could agree to a reasonable number of votes \nthis week.\n  Unfortunately, some people here want to vote maybe. They do not want \nto vote yes or no. We are elected to vote yes or no, not maybe.\n  Yesterday we proposed votes on 17 Republican amendments and a smaller \nnumber--15--of Democratic amendments, but Republicans objected. It is a \nshame we have not been able to continue the momentum of bipartisan \ncooperation that marked the Judiciary Committee's process that has \nbrought this bill so far.\n  In the Judiciary Committee we had 301 amendments filed. We approved \naround 140 amendments. All but two or three were passed with bipartisan \nvotes--both Democrats and Republicans. And when we finished all those, \nI asked if anybody wanted to bring up any further amendments. They did \nnot. And we passed the bill out with a bipartisan majority. But we \nvoted. Sometimes we voted a dozen times in 2 hours.\n  We still have a chance to move a package of noncontroversial \namendments. Instead of insisting the Senate vote on dozens of \ncontroversial amendments designed to harm the careful balance in this \nlegislation, Republicans should clear the noncontroversial and good \nideas on which many Republican and Democratic Senators have worked so \nhard. The amendments included on my manager's list have widespread \nsupport. They have been filed by Senators--both Republicans and \nDemocrats--over the past 3 weeks. Many have already been discussed at \nlength here on the Senate floor.\n\n  I will take some examples. This package of noncontroversial \namendments contains bipartisan amendments to improve oversight of \ncertain immigration programs. It contains entirely technical amendments \nto the bill. It contains a bipartisan amendment by Senators Nelson and \nWicker to provide for maritime security, as they have so correctly \npointed out on this floor that we have a long border--not just our land \nborder; we have very long borders on two oceans. It contains an \namendment by a group of northern border Senators, led by Senator \nHeitkamp, to ensure border security measures at the northern border. \nThere are several amendments from our colleagues from New Mexico to \nhelp facilitate cross-border travel and commerce.\n  The list includes an amendment by Senator Brown to ensure that the \nborder fence is constructed of materials made in America. Who could \nvote against that? The list contains an amendment by Senator Cochran \nand Senator Landrieu. She is the chairwoman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Homeland Security. It requires increased reporting on \nthe EB-5 program--something that should be a no-brainer. The list \ncontains two amendments championed by Senators Coats, Klobuchar, and \nLandrieu to ease the process for international adoptions--a \nhumanitarian measure that should get strong bipartisan support. But \nthese are just a few examples of what we have in here that we have all \nagreed should be able to be passed.\n  I wish the list were longer. Early yesterday morning, I learned there \nwere Republican objections to a number of Democratic amendments that \nhad been on my list, including several that have Republican cosponsors. \nI was surprised to hear there are concerns about several of these \namendments. One of those that has apparently raised Republican concerns \nis an amendment by Senator Hagan to authorize a border crime prevention \nprogram and reauthorize the Bulletproof Vest Program to protect law \nenforcement officers. The Bulletproof Vest Program is from the days \nwhen Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell and I first introduced it, and it \nhas gotten overwhelming support because of all the lives of police \nofficers it has saved.\n  I hope those who are objecting to it will--the next time we have a \npolice memorial here on the Mall in remembrance of those police \nofficers who have died--explain to those police officers in attendance \nwhy they are opposed to them having bulletproof vests.\n  Yet another is an amendment Senator Feinstein, Senator Cornyn, and \nothers have championed to provide the judiciary with the resources to \nhandle the large number of immigration cases.\n  I do not understand why these are considered controversial. I was \ndisappointed we had to remove the Feinstein-Cornyn amendment from this \nlist because Republicans objected to the Feinstein-Cornyn amendment on \nresources for the judiciary.\n  Nonetheless, I took these off, even though I thought they would be \nnoncontroversial. I liked the Feinstein-Cornyn amendment, and the \nothers--the bulletproof vest amendment--but we took them off because \nRepublicans objected.\n\n[[Page S5327]]\n\n  So now I am going to propose a list--and I want to make sure the \nRepublican leader is on the floor--that contains 32 sensible, \nnoncontroversial amendments that strengthen the bill and makes it \nbetter. They deserve to be adopted. I recognize and share the \nfrustration of many Senators who have worked on their amendments and \nwant their chance to influence the bill. Amendments that have broad \nsupport should not be held hostage by the partisanship that has impeded \nour work.\n  I am going to offer now--incidentally, before I do, I note there are \n32 in here; the majority of them--17--have Republican support.\n  I ask unanimous consent the following amendments be called up en \nbloc; that the clerks be authorized to modify the instruction lines, \nwhere necessary, to match the intended page and line numbers of the \ncommittee-reported substitute, as amended; and the Senate then proceed \nto vote on adoption of the amendments en bloc: Baucus-Tester No. 1512; \nBoxer No. 1240; Brown No. 1597; Cardin-Kirk No. 1286; Carper-McCain No. \n1558, as modified with changes that are at the desk; Carper No. 1590; \nCoats No. 1288; Coats No. 1373; Coburn No. 1509; Coons No. 1715; Flake \nNo. 1472; Heinrich No. 1342; Heinrich No. 1417; Heinrich No. 1559; \nHeitkamp No. 1593; Klobuchar-Landrieu-Coats-Blunt No. 1261; Klobuchar-\nCoats-Landrieu-Blunt No. 1526; Landrieu-Coats No. 1338; Landrieu-\nCochran No. 1383; Leahy No. 1454; Leahy No. 1455; Murphy No. 1451; \nMurray-Crapo No. 1368; Nelson-Wicker No. 1618; Reed No. 1223; Reed No. \n1608; Schatz-Kirk No. 1416; Shaheen-Ayotte No. 1272; Stabenow-Collins \nNo. 1405; Toomey No. 1236; Udall of New Mexico No. 1241; and Udall of \nNew Mexico No. 1242.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want to \ncompliment the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee for \nthe open process he conducted in committee to process amendments on \nboth sides of the aisle and the open and transparent way that was done. \nThat stands in stark contrast to what has happened here on the floor, \nwhere we have only had 10 amendments that have had rollcall votes, \ncompared to 46 rollcall votes the last time we debated comprehensive \nimmigration reform in 2007.\n  I would point out for my distinguished colleague that of the 32 \namendments that are being offered now by unanimous consent to be voted \nupon, 27 of them are Democratic amendments and 5 of them are Republican \namendments.\n  Senator Leahy noted that one of my amendments was excluded. Actually \nall of my amendments have been excluded, including the one that would \nprohibit legalization of drunk drivers and spouse beaters and other \ncriminals, as well as one that is designed to root out fraud in the \nprogram.\n  On behalf of my ranking member, we object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the compliments. But I am \nthinking of Shakespeare, ``I came here not to praise Caesar, but to \nbury him.'' Unfortunately these amendments have been buried by the \nobjection.\n  I would note that yesterday we offered 17 Republican amendments and \n15 Democratic amendments to be voted on. That was objected to. Those \nwere offered by the distinguished majority leader. It is frustrating.\n  I know we are about to go to executive session. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senator from Hawaii, Ms. Hirono, have 2 minutes before \nthe executive session.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I have talked about how this bill treats \nimmigrant taxpayers, specifically the restrictions on access to Federal \nsafety net programs. The bill prohibits immigrant taxpayers from using \nprograms they helped to fund with the hundreds of billions of dollars \nof taxes they pay. This is truly unfair. I filed an amendment to \ncorrect this unfair treatment. This amendment is No. 1317. My amendment \nsimply says immigrant taxpayers who are lawfully present and working \nand who have paid all of their tax liabilities should be able to use \nthe Federal programs their taxes pay for. This is simply common sense.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Boxer, Rockefeller, and Schatz \nbe added as cosponsors of amendment No. 1317.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. HIRONO. I thank these Senators for their support.\n  This amendment is supported by over 180 organizations including the \nNational Immigration Law Center, National Council of La Raza, the Asian \nPacific Islander American Health Forum, National Latina Institute for \nReproductive Health, the AFL-CIO, U.S. Council of Catholic Bishops, the \nNational Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.\n  I have several letters from these organizations that attest to their \nsupport of my amendment. I ask unanimous consent that one of these \nletters, which is signed by 179 organizations, be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  I have also been working with many Senators on an amendment to \nprovide additional opportunities for women in the new merit-based \nimmigration system created in the bill. Amendment No. 1718 would create \na new tier 3 category with 30,000 merit-based visas. Tier 3 is \nstructured in a way that allows women a fairer chance to compete for \nthese visas.\n  The Hirono-Murray-Murkowski amendment currently has 19 cosponsors. I \nask unanimous consent that Senators Whitehouse and Schatz be added as \ncosponsors of amendment No. 1718.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Amendment 1718 is a modified version of amendment No. \n1504. I made those modifications after working with Senator Graham, and \nhe has agreed to support this new amendment. I thank him for his \nsupport.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. HIRONO. I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional seconds.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. HIRONO. I also have letters from over 100 organizations in \nsupport of amendment Nos. 1718 and 1504. I ask unanimous consent that \nsome of these letters of support be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  I thank UNITE HERE, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human \nRights, We Belong Together, and the Asian American Justice Center for \norganizing these letters and for their support. I also thank the AFL-\nCIO and SEIU for their support.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 18, 2013.\n       To All Members of the U.S. Senate: We welcome the Senate's \n     consideration of comprehensive immigration reform as the \n     Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration \n     Modernization Act (S. 744) proceeds to the Senate floor. As \n     advocates for the health of the most vulnerable in our \n     communities, we have deep concerns about provisions in S. 744 \n     that would harm the health and well-being of aspiring \n     citizens and their families. Immigrants on the roadmap to \n     citizenship will be paying taxes, and as taxpayers, aspiring \n     citizens should have access to taxpayer-funded programs like \n     all Americans.\n       Senator Hirono (D-HI) plans to introduce an amendment to \n     restore taxpayer fairness to aspiring citizens. The amendment \n     provides that all immigrants who are lawfully present, \n     employed, and have satisfied their federal tax liability \n     shall not be prohibited from using any federally-funded \n     program or tax credit solely on the basis of their \n     immigration status. Allowing immigrants to use the programs \n     they pay for will enable them to be more economically \n     successful. We urge you to stand with Senator Hirono and \n     others to correct the unfair restrictions on access to \n     health, nutrition, and economic supports, thereby ensuring \n     that the roadmap to citizenship allows immigrants equal \n     opportunity to succeed in our country.\n       As currently proposed, S. 744 bars most individuals in RPI \n     status from vital federal health coverage, nutrition \n     assistance, and economic security programs for the entire \n     period they are in provisional status, which would be at \n     least 10 years. When RPIs become Lawful Permanent Residents \n     (LPRs) and earn their green card, current law further \n     restricts LPRs from accessing these vital federal programs \n     for another five years. S. 744 also bars aspiring citizens in \n     RPI status from the premium tax credits and cost-\n\n[[Page S5328]]\n\n     sharing reductions that will allow them to participate in the \n     new health insurance marketplaces established under the \n     Affordable Care Act (ACA). Individuals in blue-card and V \n     visa status are similarly restricted from accessing safety \n     net programs, premium tax credits, and cost-sharing \n     reductions.\n       The restrictions in S. 744 mean that most aspiring citizens \n     may have to pay into programs for 15 years before they can \n     use them if their kids get sick or if they lose their jobs. \n     For about half a million children who may soon be on the \n     roadmap to citizenship, these restrictions could impact their \n     development and ability to learn in school. For pregnant \n     women, it could mean no access to prenatal care that is \n     critical to the health of infants and women. For women with \n     undetected breast or cervical cancer, a 15-year wait to see a \n     doctor could be the difference between life and death. These \n     restrictions will result in poorer health outcomes, wider \n     health disparities, lower worker productivity, and higher \n     costs to the healthcare system. The restrictions are also out \n     of line with the views of most Americans: 63% believe those \n     on the roadmap to citizenship should be eligible for Medicaid \n     and 59% believe they should be eligible for affordability \n     options under the ACA. Entrenching struggling parents and \n     families in poverty prevents economic competitiveness and \n     productivity; additionally, these programs exist so people \n     can take economic risks like starting a business. Instead, \n     better immigration policy will facilitate the integration of \n     aspiring citizens into the social and economic fabric of our \n     country.\n       Moreover, denying aspiring citizens access to the very \n     programs that they pay into with their tax dollars is \n     inherently unfair. Aspiring citizens currently pay $11.2 \n     billion annually in taxes. Already, immigrants have paid $115 \n     billion more in taxes into the Medicare system than they have \n     used. As aspiring citizens move forward on the roadmap to \n     citizenship, they will contribute even more to government \n     revenue in fines, fees, and taxes.\n       Senator Hirono's amendment to restore taxpayer fairness to \n     aspiring citizens will enable those on the roadmap to \n     citizenship to succeed and will promote the health of our \n     families, communities, and economy. We urge you to stand with \n     Senator Hirono to ensure that the roadmap to citizenship is \n     fair and allows aspiring citizens to live with health, \n     dignity, and justice.\n       Thank you for your time and consideration to these issues.\n           Sincerely,\n       9to5, 9to5 Atlanta, 9to5 California, 9to5 Colorado, 9to5 \n     Milwaukee, Abortion Care Network, ACCESS Women's

                               ____\n\n                                                    June 21, 2013.\n       Dear Senator: We, the undersigned organizations that \n     advocate on behalf of women, children and families, urge you \n     to support Hirono #1504, co-sponsored by Senators Hirono, \n     Murray, Baldwin, Boxer, Cantwell, Gillibrand, Klobuchar, \n     Landrieu, Leahy, Mikulski, Murkowski, Shaheen, Stabenow and \n     Warren. Hirono #1504 goes to the heart of making the \n     immigration system fair and inclusive by adding a new tier to \n     the proposed merit-based system that is more inclusive of \n     women's contributions.\n       We are all deeply committed to ensuring that any \n     immigration reform bill treats women fairly and acknowledges \n     the many specific situations and contributions of women. We \n     believe that the proposed merit-based system for employment \n     green cards in S. 744, as currently written, will \n     significantly disadvantage women who want to come to this \n     country, particularly unmarried women. Awarding points \n     primarily for education and employment experience fails to \n     recognize the lack of opportunities and barriers that women \n     face in accessing both education and employment in their home \n     countries, barriers that are significantly worse than for \n     men. This, in effect, cements into U.S. immigration law \n     barriers and inequities that women face in their home \n     countries and inadvertently restricts the opportunities \n     available to women across the globe.\n       Currently, approximately 70% of immigrant women come to \n     this country through the family-based system. Employment-\n     based visas favor men over women by nearly a four to one \n     margin because U.S. immigration law places a premium placed \n     on male-dominated fields like engineering and computer \n     science. However, women perform essential work as primary \n     caregivers, domestic workers, in-home health care workers and \n     nurses. They also are often the backbone of families, taking \n     care of those in an extended family who\n\n[[Page S5329]]\n\n     are ill or unable to care for themselves. Economically, women \n     are increasingly the primary breadwinners in immigrant \n     families, making it more likely for the family to open a \n     small business or purchase a home. Women are also the primary \n     drivers of immigrant integration for the entire family, \n     encouraging others to learn English and integrate effectively \n     into the community.\n       We believe that Hirono #1504 is essential to ensuring that \n     we do not inadvertently cement discrimination against women \n     into U.S. immigration law. The amendment would establish a \n     Tier 3 merit-based point system that would provide a fair \n     opportunity for women to compete for merit-based green cards. \n     Complementary to the high-skilled Tier 1 and the lower-\n     skilled Tier 2, the new Tier 3 would include professions \n     commonly held by women so as not to limit women's \n     opportunities for economic-focused immigration. It would \n     provide 30,000 Tier 3 visas and would not reduce the visas \n     available in the other merit-based Tiers.\n       America has always held out hope and opportunity to \n     millions of women across the world. Women move here to make \n     life better for themselves and their families. They move \n     seeking freedom and opportunity often denied in other places. \n     As Americans, we honor and celebrate our unique commitment to \n     protecting families and giving equal opportunities and \n     respect to women and girls. We need our immigration system to \n     reflect that commitment, and to provide opportunities to \n     everyone, including women.\n       We urge you to support Hirono #1504 and help ensure \n     fairness for women in immigration reform.

Madam President, on July 12, 2012, the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, HHS announced a new initiative to allow \nStates to experiment under the temporary assistance for needy families, \nTANF, block grant. The HHS initiative would waive some Federal \nrequirements for qualifying states and instead allow them to develop \nand use ``alternative and innovative strategies, policies, and \nprocedures that are designed to improve employment outcomes for needy \nfamilies.'' States would be required to improve employment by 20 \npercent in order to keep one of these waivers. Some of my colleagues \nobject to this approach.\n  I was a supporter of 1996 welfare reform and stand by the tenets of \nthat reform. However, it has been seventeen years since that debate on \nwelfare produced the TANF program. We would not expect a car to run for \n17 years without maintenance. It is time to tune-up our Nation's \nantipoverty program. It is time to take a look under the hood.\n  In the past, TANF has provided crucial benefits to struggling \nAmericans. As poverty rates for women and children increase, it is \nvital to ensure our programs are adequately meeting the needs of this \nvulnerable population. The Congressional Research Service estimates \nthat in 1995 over 14 million children were living in poverty. After \nwelfare reform, the number of kids living in poverty decreased to about \n11 million by 2000. Since then, these gains have been eroded. There \nwere over 13 million kids in poverty by the start of the recession in \n2007. Now there are over 16 million children in desperate need of \nassistance. These numbers do not indicate a healthy safety net. We must \nensure that disadvantaged women and children continue to have access to \nthe vital resources they need.\n  In 2005, after several attempts to pass a TANF reauthorization bill \nin ``regular order,'' the TANF program was reauthorized as part of the \nDeficit Reduction Act. But it was not the comprehensive bipartisan TANF \nreauthorization voted out of the Finance Committee. Rather, it was a \nslimmed-down version placed in a budget reconciliation bill that \nfocused on tightening up the work standards and adding grants for \nmarriage promotion and responsible\n\n[[Page S5331]]\n\nfatherhood. Furthermore, the reauthorization was solely written by \nRepublicans without any Democratic input.\n  I have nothing but the utmost respect for my distinguished colleague \nfor Utah. I share in my colleague's strong belief that work is \nhonorable and that it should be a cornerstone of our welfare system.\n  While I certainly share in my colleague from Utah's concern over the \nunilateral waiver of legislative requirements, I am also a strong \nsupporter of finding ways to improve Federal programs. I agree with the \nadministration that innovation often comes from our partners in the \nStates. As chairman of the Finance Committee, I have provided Montana \nand the other 49 States numerous opportunities to take initiative and \nimprove our programs. Justice Louis Brandeis said, ``It is one of the \nhappy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous state \nmay serve as a laboratory, and try novel social and economic \nexperiments without risk to the rest of the country.'' Giving the 50 \nStates an opportunity to experiment and improve on Federal programs \nallows us to determine what works and what doesn't.\n  Allowing our States to have the flexibility to increase their work \nrates by 20 percent is a noble goal that improves the very foundation \nof our welfare system. I understand that there are concerns about how \nthe 20 percent is calculated. However, the goal of increasing \nemployment is my highest priority, a goal that I believe is shared by \nmy friend from Utah.\n  No matter how noble the goal, I agree that there are better ways to \ngo about making improvements to the TANF program than bypassing the \nCongress. The Finance Committee has jurisdiction over the TANF program. \nAs a committee, we have never shirked our legislative responsibilities \nand could have been engaged in a more productive manner.\n  However, this impasse around TANF waivers has prevented productive \ndialog on the needs of this Nation's most vulnerable women and children \nfor almost a year. It is time to get back to business. I am willing to \nwork with Senator Hatch to end this impasse. The American people \ndeserve our best attention on getting people jobs that will support \ntheir families.\n  With an eye toward reform, I asked the Government Accountability \nOffice, GAO, to evaluate TANF. Since 1996, the number of families \nserved by federal welfare programs has dropped from 3.9 million to 1.9 \nmillion in 2010. The GAO noted that this decline was not due to an \nincrease in income but a decline in participation. GAO noted that \nStates have erected increasingly more stringent barriers, making it \ndifficult for families and children to qualify for TANF.\n  The GAO also noted that current policies may be discouraging States \nfrom preparing difficult-to-serve families for the road back to work \nthrough TANF. Some options suggested for serving families with complex \nneeds include adjustments to state requirements and a focus on \nemployment outcomes. We may need to make some modest changes to ensure \nthat the program runs smoothly, our tax dollars are spent efficiently, \nand that we provide a useful safety net for Americans.\n  A safety net that encourages and inspires resiliency in the face of \nhardship is crucial to our growth and success. We have worked together \nto provide States with the opportunity to find solutions while \nmaintaining rigorous standards in the child welfare programs. \nContinuing this trend is important, even more so when it involves \nlifting families out of poverty. We have had a strong bipartisan \nrelationship on the Finance Committee, and I look forward to working \nwith the ranking member to improve our welfare system.\n  Women should not be faced with the hard choices like staying in \nabusive relationships in order to provide for their kids or leaving \ntheir children with less than trustworthy guardians to find a job. We \ncan do better. Input from the administration, States, and other \nstakeholders on what they think might improve the program is welcome \nand needed. I am looking forward to working with my colleague from Utah \non a legislative solution that improves the TANF program in real ways \nfor women and children.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, last July, in an unprecedented over-reach \nof executive authority, the Obama administration violated congressional \nintent and breached over a decade of precedence by granting themselves \nthe authority to waive critical Federal work requirements.\n  As ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, which has \njurisdiction over the temporary assistance for needy families, or TANF, \nI strongly opposed this effort of the Executive branch to bypass the \nlegislative branch of government.\n  It is the sole responsibility of the Senate Finance Committee to \ndevelop, debate, and enact changes to the TANF programs.\n  The TANF programs have not been fully reauthorized for over 10 years \nand have been funded by a series of short term extensions since 2010. \nDuring this time, poverty and, most distressingly, child poverty have \nrisen. It is imperative to families struggling in this dire economy \nthat the Senate Finance Committee act in a bipartisan manner to reform \nand improve the TANF programs.\n  In December of last year, colleagues may remember that I sent a \nletter to President Obama and then subsequently went to the Senate \nfloor and formally asked the President to instruct the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to withdraw their unconstitutional welfare \nwaiver rule and submit a comprehensive welfare reform plan to the \nCongress. In my letter and my remarks, I made it clear that if the \nPresident withdrew this waiver scheme and sent up a proposal to \nCongress, that I would commit to working with him and other Democrats \nto enact comprehensive welfare reform.\n  However, in the months since I sent my letter, I have not gotten a \nresponse from the President. The welfare waiver rule remains in effect. \nThe Secretary of Health and Human Services has failed to propose a \ncomprehensive welfare reauthorization.\n  According to HHS, no State has applied for a welfare work waiver. In \ntheir Statement of Administration Policy, to H.R. 890, the ``Preserving \nWork Requirements for Welfare Programs Act of 2013,'' the \nAdministration writes that the reason no state has applied for a \nwelfare work waiver is due to ``inaccurate claims about what the policy \ninvolves.''\n  However, the Obama administration has refused to elaborate further on \nthese waiver policies, and Democrats in the Congress have steadfastly \nresisted any effort to rescind the administration's welfare waiver \nscheme.\n  The insistence on the part of the administration that the welfare \nwaiver rule remain intact demonstrates to me that the administration \nwants the option to waive Federal welfare requirements at some later \ndate.\n  Therefore, it behooves those of us who support robust welfare work \nrequirement to oppose the administration's welfare work waiver scheme \nand work to remove the possibility that the Obama administration would \napprove proposals to gut welfare reform.\n  This has become even more imperative because, as we learn more about \nhow the Obama administration developed their welfare work waiver rule, \nthe more it becomes apparent that the Obama administration has been \ndisingenuous in it characterization of the policy and its intended \noutcomes.\n  HHS initially justified their welfare work wavier scheme by \nsuggesting that they were merely doing the bidding of the State. They \nreferred to comments solicited by them from my State of Utah, in 2011, \nrequesting administrative flexibility as justification for advancing \npolicies that could undercut key provisions of welfare reform.\n  However, in exercising the due diligence oversight role of the \nlegislative branch, Ways and Means chairman Dave Camp and I were able \nto compel HHS into providing an internal memo relating to the \ndevelopment of the welfare work waiver rule. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave this memo printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  As my colleagues will see, contrary to claims that the Obama \nadministration was simply capitulating to State's requests for \nflexibility, this memo reveals that, as far back as 2009, policy makers \nin the Obama administration were working to determine which provisions \nof welfare reform could be\n\n[[Page S5332]]\n\nwaived or disregarded. Therefore, the claim that the Obama \nadministration was merely capitulating to states' request for \nadministrative flexibility is disingenuous, at best.\n  A careful review of this memo further reveals that HHS attorneys have \nconcluded that the Secretary has the authority to allow States to \nignore prohibitions on Federal welfare spending which would ``permit a \nstate to extend assistance to a family for which assistance would be \nprohibited under Section 408 of the Social Security Act.''\n  Mr. President, the following individuals and activities are \nprohibited under section 408 of the Social Security Act: fugitive \nfelons and parole violators, families where the adult has exceeded 5 \nyears of assistance, noncitizens with a five-year ban on assistance as \ndescribed in title IV of the Personal Responsibility and Work \nOpportunity Reconciliation Act, and medical services, such as abortion.\n  Under S. 744, the legislation before the Senate today, the \nprohibitions detailed in title IV of PRWORA for Federal means-tested \npublic benefits, such as cash welfare, are extended to registered \npermanent immigrants, blue card holders, and aliens admitted to the \nUnited States under 101(a)(15)(V) or 101(a)(15)(Y).\n  However, under HHS's current interpretation of section 1115 \nauthority, since title IV can be ignored, Federal welfare benefits \ncould be paid to these groups of noncitizens.\n  I have always wanted to support the current bill before the Senate, \nand I committed to working with Senator Rubio and others to try and \nimprove the bill so that it can garner broad bipartisan support.\n  I initially filed an amendment that would have prevented the Obama \nadministration from potentially gutting welfare reform and explicitly \nprohibited them from permitting the types of spending outlined in \nsection 408 of the Social Security Act. This amendment was deemed too \nbroad to be relevant to the immigration debate by the Democratic \nmajority.\n  So, in the spirit of compromise, I agreed to limit my amendment to \nonly apply to the section of 408 dealing with noncitizens--in other \nwords, the ability of Obama administration to waive work requirements \nand permit Federal welfare spending on certain prohibited individuals \nand activities remains.\n  The Obama administration's interpretation of their 1115 waiver \nauthority is and will remain an impediment to successfully improving \nand reauthorizing the TANF programs. This is because any compromise \ncould be undermined by this or any other administration. I take the \nchairman at his word that he intends to pursue a bipartisan consensus \non improvements to the TANF programs, but I need to stress that \nconsensus will be difficult to reach as long as this or any future \nadministration can waive key features of a compromise reached by the \nCongress.\n  This Senator remains baffled why the Obama administration is so \nreluctant to engage in a discussion of welfare reform.\n  To this date, nearly a year after the Obama administration went \npublic with their welfare work waiver rule, they have not issued a \nsingle clarification on what work or work related activity they wanted \nto allow states to count as work and why the current flexibility in \nTANF is insufficient.\n  It appears that despite my entreaty last year for the Obama \nadministration to engage in a dialogue about improving the TANF \nprograms, their strategy for the immediate future appears to be one in \nwhich they will simply let TANF wither on the vine.\n  I do not want that to happen. TANF provides critical support of \nworking families and helps States provide services to vulnerable \nchildren. But too much of TANF spending is unaccounted for, and \nprograms funded by TANF dollars may not be coordinated with other \nefforts directed towards at risk populations.\n  The robust welfare-to-work programs from 20 years ago have virtually \nvanished.\n  I know that the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee shares my \nconcerns about the future of TANF. I understand he has a different \nperspective on the administration's intentions relative to their \nwelfare waiver policies.\n  I hope to be able to work with Chairman Baucus and the other members \nof the Senate Finance Committee to propose commonsense reforms to the \nTANF programs during this session of Congress.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Department of Health\n\n\n                                             & Human Services,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 15, 2009.\n     To: Mark Greenberg, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Children \n         and Families\n     From: Chief of Litigation, Children, Families and Aging \n         Division\n     Subject: Authority Under Section 1115 of the Social Security \n         Act\n       This memo responds to your request for a legal opinion \n     regarding the breadth of the Secretary's authorities under \n     section 1115 of the Social Security Act (Act), 42 U.S.C. \n     1315, with respect to title IV-A of the Act. Specifically, \n     you are interested in better understanding her ability to \n     waive particular state plan requirements for the Temporary \n     Assistance for Needy Families (TA') program and to allow \n     states to spend TANF, Healthy Marriage and/or Responsible \n     Fatherhood program funds for certain purposes beyond those \n     specified in sections 403 and 404 of the Act. As explained \n     below, for a proper section 1115 demonstration project, the \n     Secretary may waive compliance with any state plan \n     requirements in section 402 of the Act, as well as any other \n     requirement incorporated therein. The Secretary also may \n     allow a state to use IV-A Funds for costs that otherwise \n     would be impermissible under that title. Section 1115 does \n     not provide direct relief from state penalties under section \n     409 of the Act but may factor into the penalty relief \n     available under section 409 itself. Thus, the Secretary may \n     take most of the actions proposed in your November 17, 2009, \n     e-mail, under section 1115 of the Act.\n\n\n                        Section 1115 Authorities\n\n       Section 1115(a) of the Act provides the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services (``the Secretary'') with two types of \n     discretionary authority to exempt a State from otherwise-\n     applicable IV-A rules so that it may implement a \n     demonstration project that, in the Secretary's judgment, ``is \n     likely to assist in promoting the objectives'' of title IV-A. \n     42 U.S.C. Sec. 1315(a).\n       First, under section 11.15(a)(1) of the Act, the Secretary \n     ``may waive compliance with any of the requirements of \n     section . . . 402 . . . to the extent and for the period \n     [s]he finds necessary to enable [a] State . . . to carry \n     out'' an approved demonstration project. id. Sec. 1315(0(1). \n     Section 402 of the Act sets forth state plan requirements for \n     title IV-A, Id. Sec. 602. ``In granting a Sec. 1315(a) \n     waiver, the Secretary allows the state to deviate from the \n     minimum requirements which Congress has determined are \n     necessary prerequisites to federal funding.'' Beno v. \n     Shalala, 30 F.3d 1057, 1068 (9th Cir. 1994).\n       Second, under section 1115(a)(2)(B), ``costs of an approved \n     demonstration project] which would not otherwise be a \n     permissible use of funds under part A of title IV . . . shall \n     to the extent and [or the period prescribed by the Secretary, \n     be regarded as a permissible use of funds under such part.'' \n     42 U.S.C. Sec. 1315(a)(2). This authority permits the \n     Secretary to use 1V-A funds for expenditures that would not \n     be allowable under, for example, section 404 of the Act, 42 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 604, which prescribes permissible uses of a \n     state's TANF grant.\n\n\n                Prerequisites for Section 1115 Projects\n\n       Section 1115 applies to only (1) experimental, pilot, or \n     demonstration projects that (2) in the judgment or the \n     Secretary are likely to assist in promoting the objectives \n     of, in this case, title IV-A of the Act. (3) to the extent \n     and for the period she finds necessary. Thus, while the \n     Secretary has considerable discretion to decide which \n     projects meet these criteria, she must, at a minimum, \n     consider each of these issues.\n       Because Congress enacted section 1115 to ``test out new \n     ideas and ways of dealing with the problems of public welfare \n     recipients,'' S. Rep. No. 1589, 87th Cong., 2d Sess. 20, \n     reprinted in 1962 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1943, 1962. the Secretary must \n     first determine that that the project has a research or \n     demonstration value. See Beno, 30 F.3d at 1069 (``she must \n     determine that the project is likely to yield useful \n     information or demonstrate a novel approach to program \n     administration'').\n       In addition, the Secretary must determine that the proposed \n     project is likely to further the objectives of title IV-A. \n     These objectives, as identified in section 401 of the Act, 42 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 601, are as follows:\n       (1) provide assistance to needy families so that children \n     may be cared for in their own homes or in the homes of \n     relatives;\n       (2) end the dependence of needy parents on government \n     benefits by promoting job preparation, work, and marriage;\n       (3) prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock \n     pregnancies and establish annual numerical goals for \n     preventing, and reducing the incidence of these pregnancies; \n     and\n       (4) encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent \n     families.\n       Finally, the Secretary may issue a waiver ``to the extent \n     and for the period [s]he finds necessary,'' id \n     Sec. 1315(a)(1), and may regard otherwise impermissible \n     expenditures as permissible ``to the extent and for the \n     period [she] prescribe[s],'' id. Sec. 1315(a)(2)(B). Thus, \n     pilot projects are limited in scope and duration, consistent \n     with their experimental nature.\n       Section 1115 waivers are subject to judicial review under \n     the Administrative Procedure\n\n[[Page S5333]]\n\n     Act. See Beno. 30 F.3d at 1067; G. v. Hawaii, 2009 U.S. Dist. \n     LEXIS 39851 (D. Haw. May 11, 2009). Courts have recognized \n     that the Secretary has broad authority under section 1115, \n     and her decision to approve a project under section 1115 \n     should he upheld unless it is arbitrary, capricious, or \n     contrary to law. See Georgia Hospital Ass'n v. Department of \n     Medical Assistance, 528 F. Supp. 1348 (N.D. Ga. 1982); Crane \n     v. Mathews, 417 F. Supp. 532 (N.D. Ga. 1976); California \n     Welfare Rights Org. v. Richardson, 348 F. Supp. 491 (N.D. \n     Cal. 1972); Aguayo v. Richardson, 352 F. Supp. 462, 469-70 \n     (S.D.N.Y. 1971), affd 473 F. 2d 1090 (2d Cir. 1973).\n       Assuming that a state's project satisfies these \n     prerequisites, the Secretary may address the particular 1V-A \n     provisions referenced in your e-mail as follows:\n       Can the Secretary permit a state to operate under a \n     different set of participation rate requirements other than \n     those specified in Section 407, or to be accountable for \n     negotiated outcomes rather than the TANF participation rates?\n       Yes. Although work participation rates are found in section \n     407, which may not be waived directly under the terms of' \n     section 1115a)(1), section 402(a)(1)(iii) requires that the \n     State plan ``[e]nsure that parents and caretakers receiving \n     assistance under the program engage in work activities in \n     accordance with section 407.'' Because this section 402 \n     requirement incorporates section 407, ``Mandatory Work \n     Requirements,'' the Secretary's waiver authority may \n     reasonably extend to section 407, as well.\n       However, the extent to which section 407 may be \n     incorporated for purposes of section 1115 is unclear. Section \n     402(a)(1)(iii)'s limitation, ``in accordance with section \n     407,'' could be read to modify or apply only to section \n     407(d), because section 402(a)(iii) expressly refers to \n     ``work activities'' in section 407, which are defined in \n     section 407(d). Thus, a more conservative approach to section \n     1115(a)(1) would limit a waiver of section 402(a)(1)(iii) to \n     enable a state to define work activities differently than \n     Congress did in section 407(d), but otherwise leave the rest \n     of section 407, including participation rates in section \n     407(a), intact.\n       Alternatively, ``in accordance with section 407'' could he \n     read to modify the entire clause that precedes it, i.e., \n     ensuring that recipients engage in the prescribed work \n     activities. In other words, if section 402(a)(1)(iii) \n     requires not merely that the work activities be those defined \n     in section 407(d) but also that the state have in place \n     section 407's comprehensive scheme to ``ensure'' that \n     families work, including through the participation rates, \n     then a waiver could reasonably reflect the breadth of the \n     state plan requirement itself. In short, section \n     402(a)(1)(iii)'s use of ``in accordance with section 407'' \n     (rather than, for example. ``section 407(d)'') is \n     sufficiently ambiguous that a broader view of the scope of \n     the potential waiver is a defensible, though perhaps riskier, \n     interpretation.\n       Can the Secretary permit a state to spend TANF funds for a \n     benefit or service beyond those allowable under Section 404?\n       Yes. Under section 1115(a)(2), the Secretary may allow a \n     state to use its IV-A funds to pay for costs that would ``not \n     otherwise be a permissible use of funds under part A of title \n     IV,'' regardless of which section of title IV-A would render \n     the cost impermissible.\n       Can the Secretary broaden allowable expenditures under \n     healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood promotion grants \n     beyond those specified in Section 403?\n       Yes. Unlike other titles covered by section 1115(a)(2), \n     title IV-A is referenced in its entirety with respect to the \n     otherwise impermissible costs for which Federal program funds \n     may be used. For example, for title IV-D, section \n     1115(a)(2)(A) only allows the use of IV-D funds to pay for \n     expenditures that would not be allowed under section 455 of \n     the Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 655. Thus, section 1115(a)(2) would \n     not authorize the use of IV-D funds to pay for costs that \n     would not be allowed under section 469B (Grants to States for \n     Access and Visitation), 42 U.S.C. Sec. 669b, even though this \n     latter section is part of title IV-D, too. As stated above, \n     under section 1115(a)(2), the Secretary may allow a state to \n     use its IV-A funds to pay for costs that would ``not \n     otherwise be a permissible use of funds under part A of title \n     IV,'' regardless of which section of title IV-A would render \n     the cost impermissible. Thus, even though section 404 of the \n     Act generally prescribes a state's use of its TANF grant, the \n     Secretary may apply section 1115(a)(2) to other funds and \n     costs under title IV-A, including those in section 403.\n       Can the Secretary permit a state to extend assistance to a \n     family, Or which assistance would otherwise be prohibited \n     under Section 408?\n       Yes. Section 408 of the Act lists additional (i.e., non-\n     state plan) prohibitions and requirements on the use of IV-A \n     funds. To the extent that this section prohibits the use of \n     IV-A funds for certain purposes, the Secretary may use \n     section 1115(a)(2) to regard a state's expenditures therefor \n     as permissible. For example, section 408(a)(7) prohibits the \n     use of its TANF grant to provide assistance to a family for \n     more than five years. Although this is not a state plan \n     requirement, and thus may not be waived under section \n     1115(a)(1), the Secretary may allow a state to use its TANF \n     grant to provide assistance beyond this five-year period as \n     part of a demonstration project, using her authority under \n     section 1115(a)(2).\n       Can the Secretary provide that a penalty otherwise \n     applicable under Section 409 does not apply?\n       No. Section 1115 does not reference section 409 of the Act, \n     42 U.S.C. Sec. 609, which provides for penalties against \n     states that violate various provisions of the Act. Section \n     409 is neither incorporated by section 402 as a state plan \n     requirement that can be waived under section 1115(a)(1) nor \n     reflective of costs that would otherwise be impermissible \n     under title IV-A. However, if the goal is to provide \n     opportunities for a state to avoid a penalty while \n     encouraging experimentation, it may be possible to work \n     within the existing framework of section 409 to find \n     ``reasonable cause,'' if a state's section 1115 project were \n     to cause it to incur the penalty.\n       Depending on the kind of penalty at issue, section 409(b) \n     prohibits the Secretary from imposing a penalty ``if the \n     Secretary determines that the State has reasonable cause for \n     failing to comply with the requirement.'' To the extent that \n     a state fails to meet a requirement due to its participation \n     in a section 1115 project, it may be appropriate for the \n     Secretary to find ``reasonable cause'' for the state's \n     failure. For example, if a State has a section 1115 project \n     that allows it to spend IV-A funds on assistance beyond the \n     five-year period authorized in section 408(a)(7), it may be \n     possible to justify forgoing a penalty under section \n     409(a)(9) based on the reasonable cause exception, because \n     the State had permission to use the funds in that manner. \n     This is similar to the approach taken with respect to waivers \n     for penalties attributable to providing federally-recognized \n     good cause domestic violence waivers. See 45 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 260.58(a) (state must demonstrate that it met work \n     participation rate requirements except with respect to any \n     individuals who received a federally-recognized good cause \n     domestic violence waiver of work participation requirements). \n     Although section 1115 waivers are not expressly referenced in \n     the IV-A ``reasonable cause'' regulation, see 45 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 262.5, the preamble to the rule clarifies that the list \n     of factors in the rule is not exclusive. Temporary Assistance \n     for Needy Families Program, 64 Fed. Reg. 17720, 17805 (Apr. \n     12, 1999) (``we no longer limit ourselves to considering only \n     these factors. While we do not anticipate routinely \n     determining that a State had reasonable cause based on other \n     factors, we do not want to preclude a State from presenting \n     other circumstances.'').\n       In addition, section 409(c) of the Act requires that a \n     state have the opportunity to enter into a corrective \n     compliance plan for certain penalties. 42 U.S.C. Sec. 609(c). \n     To the extent that a state's participation in a section 1115 \n     demonstration project adversely impacts its ability to \n     satisfy requirements covered by section 409, the state may \n     take this into account in the corrective compliance plan.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       Most of the proposals identified in your November 17, 2009, \n     e-mail appear to be defensible exercises of the Secretary's \n     discretion under section 1115 of the Act. However, whether a \n     particular project is legally supportable will depend on the \n     facts and circumstances surrounding that project. We are \n     available to assist you, if you decide to pursue further any \n     of these or other ideas using IV-A funds.\n       Please contact me at 202-690-8005, if you have any \n     questions.\n\n\n                                 ichia\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I would like to take a few moments \nwith my friend Chairman Leahy to discuss the ongoing importance of the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act's impact on \nlawfully residing noncitizen children and pregnant women. In that 2009 \nlegislation, States were given the option to provide Medicaid and State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program--CHIP--benefits to these \npopulations without first imposing a waiting period, and many did so as \nan investment in future generations. Throughout the debate on S. 744, \nsome of my colleagues spent a considerable amount of time seeking to \ndeprive lawfully present noncitizens of the protections of our vital \nsafety net programs. I consider these efforts to be contrary to the \nvalue that we, as Americans, place on protecting the most vulnerable \namong us.\n  Chairman Leahy's leadership has been critical to the passage of this \nhistoric legislation in the Senate, and I thank him for being a strong \nvoice in favor of protecting health care benefits for children and \npregnant women. As you know, children's health has been one of my top \npriorities throughout my time in the Senate. Although the immigration \nreform bill that passed the Senate does limit certain noncitizens' \neligibility for some Federal benefits, I am pleased the Senate chose to \npreserve States' rights to extend full Medicaid and State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program benefits to children and pregnant women \ngranted legal status under the bill, particularly individuals and \nfamilies granted Registered Provisional Immigrant--RPI, Blue Card, and \nV-visa status.\n\n[[Page S5334]]\n\n  Commonly referred to as the Immigrant Children's Health Improvement \nAct--ICHIA, the success of this State option cannot be overstated. In \nthe 4 years since its passage, 27 States and territories have decided \nto exercise the option to extend coverage to lawfully residing \nnoncitizen children or pregnant women under Medicaid or CHIP without \nfirst imposing a waiting period: California, Colorado, Connecticut, \nNorthern Mariana Islands, District of Columbia, Delaware, Hawaii, \nIllinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, \nNebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, \nPennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and \nWisconsin. This extension of coverage has literally been a lifeline to \nchildren and pregnant women who cannot afford to wait 5 years for \nimmunizations, treatment of infections, prenatal care, and other \nnecessary medical services.\n  Because the bipartisan immigration bill contains multiple provisions \nrelating to certain noncitizens' eligibility for federal benefits, \nincluding those under means-tested programs, I would like to take some \ntime to walk through how the Senate-passed immigration bill does not in \nany way limit a State's ability under ICHIA to extend coverage to \nchildren and pregnant women who receive RPI, Blue Card, or V-visa \nstatus.\n  Under the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services'--CMS--guidance \non the definition of ``lawfully residing'' in ICHIA, as long as a \nnoncitizen child or pregnant woman has established residency in a State \nand is ``lawfully present'' in this country, he or she may qualify for \nbenefits at the State's option. Children and pregnant women granted \nRPI, Blue Card, and V-visa status as part of the bipartisan immigration \nbill clearly meet this definition. The bill explicitly states that \nthese categories of noncitizens are ``lawfully present'' in the United \nStates for all purposes, except for specific benefits and obligations \nunder the Affordable Care Act.\n  I will now turn it over to Chairman Leahy to provide some additional \ncontext from the Senate negotiations and the Judiciary Committee mark-\nup of S. 744.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Thank you, Senator Rockefeller. The issues we are \ndiscussing today are extremely important, and I appreciate your \nleadership during CHIPRA to allow States to extend Medicaid and CHIP \nbenefits to pregnant women and children in the first place.\n  Last week, I came to the floor to express my opposition to amendments \nthat were designed to punish immigrant families who are living on the \nverge of poverty by preventing them from accessing our Federal safety \nnet. The Judiciary Committee refused to add many of these amendments to \nthe bill, and I am pleased that the Senate heeded my call to reject the \nharshest of these amendments as well.\n  Now, I would like to repeat something that Senator Rockefeller just \nsaid. The bipartisan immigration reform bill explicitly states that \nchildren and pregnant women granted RPI, Blue Card, and V-visa status \nare considered ``lawfully present'' in the United States. It is true \nthat the bill contains language making these three categories of \nimmigrants ineligible for ``any Federal means-tested public benefits'' \nas ``defined and implemented'' in section 403 of the Personal \nResponsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act,--PRWORA, the \nFederal law that limits some noncitizens' eligibility for certain \nFederal programs. However, this language does not eliminate the States' \nright to exercise the ICHIA option.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Now, I would like to direct a question to my friend \nChairman Leahy. Just to be clear, provisions in the bipartisan \nimmigration reform bill do not eliminate a State's right to extend \nMedicaid and CHIP to any lawfully residing noncitizen child or pregnant \nwoman, including those receiving RPI, Blue Card, or V-visa status. Is \nthis correct, Mr. Chairman?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, that is correct. Nor was it our intention throughout \nthe negotiations to eliminate this State right.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. A closer look at the language in PRWORA and the \nSocial Security Act confirms that the immigration reform bill does not \neliminate the States' right to use the ICHIA option to provide coverage \nto lawfully residing children and pregnant women. The States' option to \nextend coverage to these individuals is not ``implemented'' in section \n403 of PRWORA, the provision of law impacted by the immigration bill, \nbut instead exists independent of PRWORA under sections 1903 and 2107 \nof the Social Security Act.\n  I would also like to point out to our colleagues that the \nCongressional Budget Office--CBO--had a similar interpretation of the \nlanguage in S. 744. CBO made an assumption that, under this language, \nFederal agencies would permit some individuals with RPI, Blue Card, or \nV-visa status to receive benefits from Federal means-tested programs, \nand specifically incorporated into its estimate of the bill the costs \nof providing Medicaid and CHIP coverage under ICHIA to children and \npregnant women.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Senator Rockefeller is correct. The Senate had full \nknowledge of CBO's interpretation and cost estimate when it negotiated \na bipartisan amendment that became the text of the final bill. We chose \nnot to modify the provisions relating to the application of benefits \nunder PRWORA, thus retaining the language that permits coverage under \nICHIA of individuals with RPI, Blue Card, or V-visa status.\n  During the negotiations, the Senate did accept an amendment which \nstates that ``No officer or employee of the Federal Government may \nwaive'' compliance with PRWORA, or the bill's prohibition on accessing \nbenefits that are defined and implemented in PRWORA. But these \nprovisions, too, are inapplicable to a State's option under ICHIA. As \nmy colleague Senator Rockefeller mentioned before, the ICHIA option is \nnot a product of PRWORA. It exists as an independent right under the \nSocial Security Act and is therefore unaffected by this section.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Moreover, by using the term ``waive'' in section \n2323, the Senate is attempting to prohibit Federal officials from using \ntheir waiver authority under certain means-tested programs--such as \nthose afforded to agencies in relation to demonstration projects--in a \nway that would result in noncompliance with PRWORA. This narrow \nprohibition on the use of waivers by Federal officials cannot be \nconstrued to prevent the continued implementation of an explicit, \nindependent statutory right afforded to the states under ICHIA. The \nICHIA option is not a waiver and remains available for States \nregardless of any action by an ``officer or employee of the Federal \nGovernment.''\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would like to point to one final, yet unfortunate, \nindication of the Senate's intent to preserve benefits under Medicaid \nand CHIP for children and pregnant women granted RPI, Blue Card, and V-\nvisa status--section 4417. This section was added during negotiations \non the amendment that became the final text of the bill. It directly \namends ICHIA to prohibit States from covering certain individuals who \nare lawfully present in the United States on student and tourist visas. \nHad the Senate intended to similarly exclude from ICHIA individuals \ngranted RPI, Blue Card, and V-visa status, it would have explicitly \ndone so.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I share the Chairman's disappointment that the \nSenate decided to add section 4417 to explicitly exclude students and \ntourists from ICHIA coverage, but I also agree with him that by not \nexcluding other categories of lawfully residing noncitizens in section \n4417, such as those granted RPI, Blue Card, or V-visa status, the \nSenate intended to preserve their benefits.\n  One of the hallmarks of our Nation is our willingness to protect the \nmost vulnerable among us. People from all over the world want to be \npart of America because of our deeply-rooted respect for human dignity.\n  Although it is not perfect--few laws are--the bipartisan immigration \nbill passed by the Senate this week lives up to those values in so many \nways. It brings millions of hard working people out of the shadows, \ngives young students an opportunity to earn citizenship by furthering \ntheir education or serving in the military, reunites families who yearn \nto spend time with their loved ones, protects victims of domestic \nviolence, and preserves health care coverage for noncitizen children \nand\n\n[[Page S5335]]\n\npregnant women who earn legal status under the bill.\n  Immigrants are not under any illusions that they will qualify for \nlavish benefits under our Federal programs when they arrive on our \nshores. But under this bill, they at least know that when medical needs \narise or a medical disaster strikes, the vast majority of noncitizen \nchildren and pregnant women will be covered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, I would like to discuss my J-1 visa \namendment to the immigration bill, which was incorporated into the \nCorker-Hoeven amendment. The purpose of the amendment is to increase \ntransparency and accountability of exchange visitor programs that \noperate under the J-1 visa category, while ensuring the continued \nexistence of the J-1 program.\n  I proposed the new subtitle I in title III, with the support of my \nfriend from Wisconsin Mr. Johnson. While the original subtitle F \nprotections applied across a range of visas that have a work component, \nthe J-1 visa category is fundamentally different from the other visas \noriginally included in subtitle F. The J-1 category simply required \nseparate treatment to ensure increased protection of J-1 visa holders \nand the long-term viability of this important diplomatic program.\n  I appreciate the support of the senior Senator from Connecticut, the \noriginal sponsor of subtitle F, and would like to further clarify the \nintent of our amendment.\n  Throughout the crafting of our amendment, I acknowledged that there \nare legitimate concerns with some J-1 programs. There have been \ninstances in the Summer Work Travel Program where student placements \nhave been inappropriate for the purposes of true cultural exchange.\n  As S.744 was reported from the Judiciary Committee, however, the \nintended reforms would have made it impossible for high quality \nsponsors to continue to administer the Exchange Visitor Program. \nWithout an amendment, this important public diplomacy tool would have \nbeen lost.\n  Our amendment strikes ``exchange visitors'' from the definition of \n``worker'' in subtitle F. Subtitle F is aimed at foreign labor \ncontracting activity and creates important new protections for foreign \nworkers in the U.S.--we did this because J-1 exchange visitors are not \nprimarily workers, but instead cultural exchange participants. We \nbelieve this amendment to the bill makes clear that neither exchange \nvisitors nor sponsors of J-1 programs are subject to the new \nrequirements of Subtitle F, and that J-1 sponsors are not considered \nforeign labor contractors or recruiters.\n  As with any compromise, subtitle I is not 100 percent perfect. But it \nincludes several important elements. Most vital, the amendment allows \nthese valuable programs to continue and provides key protections to \nensure participants remain safe. The Department of State has \nstrengthened its regulations in recent years, and our amendment will \nhelp further that process. I believe our amendment makes the exchange \nvisitor program stronger and ensures that international students and \nAmerican businesses have clearer rules to continue this important \npublic diplomacy tool.\n  I appreciate the collaborative effort of my colleagues, particularly \nthe Senators from Connecticut and Wisconsin, for helping to craft \nlegislation that improves the J-1 exchange visitor program. I look \nforward to continuing to work with them as this bill moves forward.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise to speak about why this body should \nreject the amended version of the immigration bill. I believe our \nimmigration system is broken. As a matter of fact, I know the Senate \ncould agree unanimously on the fact that our immigration system is \nbroken. This includes both the legal system which allows individuals to \nvisit and work in our country in addition to the failures which \ncontinue to allow others to reside illegally within our borders. The \nintentions of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the sponsors of this \nbill are correct. Those Senators deserve credit for their work on the \nbill over the past few months. However, as we approach final passage on \nthis legislation I have to say I respectfully disagree with the final \nproduct and its failures to make fixes in several key areas.\n  The first key fix rests in the fact that the United States remains a \nplace of opportunity. The whole reason why people want to come to the \nUnited States is because of jobs. In order for immigration reform to \nwork we must have a strong, workable employment verification system in \nplace. If Congress can ensure that only authorized job seekers gain \nemployment in this country, then we remove the incentive for illegal \nimmigration. Workers who cannot get jobs cannot afford to stay in the \nUnited States illegally. This immigration bill works towards making E-\nVerify mandatory. I agree with this goal, but as a former small \nbusiness owner familiar with this process, I also recognize that this \nbill fails to strengthen protections against the fraudulent use of \nidentifiers used in the employment process--particularly Social \nSecurity cards and Social Security numbers. Small business owners by \nnature do a lot. They mop floors, make sales, greet customers, do the \naccounting, set up computers, and pay the bills. However, you should \nnot have to ask a business owner to act as a customs agent and \ndetermine if the government issued documents presented to them are \nauthentic. One recent study suggests that the current E-Verify error \nrate for unauthorized workers is 54 percent. This is attributed to the \nfact that even though the system says that a particular person is \nlegal, there is no way for the employer to know for certain if that \nworker is really who they claim to be.\n  The proposal before us attempts to address this problem through a \nphoto-matching tool. However, the verification system does not have \nphotos for the more than 60 percent of Americans who do not have a U.S. \npassport and relies on States to be able to provide driver's license \nrecords on a voluntary basis. This legislation allows a fundamental \nflaw in the E-Verify system to exist, making it even more difficult for \nemployers to ensure that the people they hire are lawful. Several of my \ncolleagues have filed amendments to fix these problems. I know that \nthis is something Senator Portman has worked on extensively and I \nsupport his efforts. Unfortunately, the necessary changes have not been \nmade to E-Verify and it is difficult for me to support a bill knowing \nthat it fails to provide small business owners with the tools they need \nto efficiently and accurately verify the identity of new employees.\n  Another draw to the United States happens to be the Federal welfare \nand tax benefits that workers receive. My colleague Senator Hatch has \nbeen working on several amendments, which I support, that ensures non-\ncitizens do not benefit from these federal programs. Amendment No. 1246 \nclarifies that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services cannot \nundermine welfare reform so that non-citizens receive welfare. \nAdditionally, I support Hatch amendment No. 1247 that ensures back \ntaxes are collected for applicants under the Registered Provisional \nImmigrant program. Failing to fix these draws to our country undermines \nimmigration reform, incentivizes illegal behavior and adds costs to \nAmericans who lawfully pay their taxes.\n  Second, dependable border security and interior enforcement is \ncrucial to the entire immigration system. I voted for several \namendments in this debate which would enact firm border security and \nenforcement triggers. One lesson from previous immigration efforts is \nthat we cannot reduce illegal immigration without better border \nsecurity and entry/exit enforcement measures. I cannot support the \namended version of the bill because it offers false promises about \nborder security and enforcement measures. I do not understand how the \nsubmission of a border security plan makes our nation safe, \nparticularly when current law is not being enforced. Border agents are \nadded but not before the provisions of the underlying bill go into \neffect. I think the Senate should take a lesson from history. Failing \nto secure the border and ignoring enforcement will not reduce illegal \nimmigration.\n  Finally, I think it is also important to discuss why more hasn't been \ndone to fix the underlying bill. The Senate has been on this bill for \nnearly 3 weeks. In that time, the Senate has only voted on nine \namendments. It appears clear\n\n[[Page S5336]]\n\nnow that few if any more amendments will be considered as we approach \nfinal passage which makes it difficult to make some real common sense \nchanges to the bill. I believe that part of the reason is because the \nbill is being considered as comprehensive reform. Comprehensive bills \ngive everyone reason to oppose the bill. This Senate wants a legitimate \nfix to immigration. The best way to do that is to focus on it one piece \nat a time. For example, had more attention been placed on E-Verify as a \nstandalone bill, I am confident that we could find a way to ensure that \nthe program works effectively for small businesses and helps deter the \nincentive for illegal behavior.\n  For these reasons I will be voting against final passage. I \nunderstand that we all want to fix our immigration system, but I cannot \nfind the resolve to support legislation that misses the mark on so many \nlevels. I am hopeful that more work will be done on fixing our \nimmigration system in the interest of our economy, national security \nand moral obligations as a country.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the passage of \nthe comprehensive immigration reform bill. For the first time in a \ngeneration, the Senate has passed a bill that brings us one crucial \nstep closer to sensible immigration laws. This is a historic day for \nthe Senate, for our economy, and for families across our country, but \nthere is more work to be done before this bill becomes law.\n  When we began consideration of the Border Security, Economic \nOpportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, I gave a speech in \nwhich I quoted from a book that John F. Kennedy wrote while serving in \nthis Chamber. He wrote, ``Immigration policy should be generous; it \nshould be fair; it should be flexible. With such a policy we can turn \nto the world, and to our own past, with clean hands and a clear \nconscience.'' Today we can turn to the world proudly, with a clear \nconscience, and say this bill lives up to our ideals and our American \nvalues, to say that it will provide millions of aspiring Americans the \nopportunity to come out from the shadows, realize their dream of \ncitizenship, and be strong threads in the rich fabric of this great \nnation.\n  From the beginning of this process, I have been very clear with my \ncolleagues regarding my priorities for immigration reform, and this \nbill takes steps to achieve each of them. First, this legislation \nprovides a real pathway to citizenship for the 230,000 undocumented \npeople already living in Washington State. These families already work \nalongside us, attend our churches, and send their children to our \nschools--and they deserve the benefits and responsibilities of American \ncitizenship. This bill also makes important reforms to help our \neconomy, from agricultural businesses in central and eastern Washington \nto our expanding high-tech corridor in the Puget Sound. It can and \nshould do more, but this legislation includes provisions to treat \nimmigrants with dignity and help reunite families separated by our \noutdated laws. Finally, it provides Washington State's 35,000 DREAMers, \nchildren brought to this country at a very young age, with the chance \nthey deserve to succeed in America. This bill allows thousands of \nundocumented families in my home State of Washington who work hard and \nplay by the rules to leave the shadows--to no longer live in constant \nfear of being separated from their loved ones.\n  I am also pleased this bill offers important reforms in the \nemployment-based immigration system. There is a clear need to expand \nlegal avenues for workers to immigrate to the United Sates in a safe \nand orderly manner. The size of this workforce must be flexible to meet \nthe needs of our diverse industries and must be responsive to changes \nin our economy. This bill is a step in the right direction. It will \nallow the immigration system to be more responsive to the needs of the \nmarketplace and will enable businesses to attract and retain a capable, \nstable, and legal workforce.\n  This bill isn't perfect and it is not the bill I would write on my \nown, but it is the result of a bipartisan compromise, and I am proud to \nsupport it as a strong step in the right direction. Although I have \nconcerns about some elements of the bill, it makes critical changes to \nour broken system that will strengthen our country and grow our \neconomy.\n  Over the past weeks, I offered a number of amendments that would have \nmade commonsense improvements to the bill. Importantly, three of my \namendments would have made this bill more inclusive of women.\n  Too often women in the developing world are not offered the same \neducational and employment opportunities afforded to men in those \ncountries. This fact places women at a competitive disadvantage under a \nmerit-based system that rewards education, job promotion, and career \nadvancement. That is why I worked with my colleagues, Senator Mazie \nHirono of Hawaii and Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, to introduce my \nfirst amendment, which would provide 30,000 green cards for occupations \nheld by lower income immigrant women in the United States. Our \namendment would accomplish this by creating a third tier in the merit-\nbased point system that would have complemented the highly educated \ntier one system and the moderate to lower skilled tier two system.\n  I was deeply disturbed to learn that some pregnant women in \nimmigration detention are shackled, including during labor and \ndelivery. While the Department of Homeland Security recently adopted \nperformance standards that prohibit the shackling of pregnant detainees \nabsent extraordinary circumstances, a significant portion of \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, detainees are held in county \njails by local law enforcement. These holding centers are not required \nto follow the Department's standards.\n  Shackling during labor, delivery, and postpartum recovery increases \nthe risk of harm to the fetus, it inhibits medical staff's ability to \nrespond to emergencies, and it increases the discomfort and pain of the \nchildbirth. That is why I introduced my second amendment to extend the \nprohibition against shackling to include all pregnant women held for \nimmigration purposes, including those held under an immigration \ndetainer issued by a Federal agency. This bipartisan amendment, \ncosponsored by Senator Mike Crapo of Idaho, provided for certain \nexceptions to the ban due to extraordinary circumstances, while also \nprohibiting certain types of restraints known to cause tripping, \nfalling, or that stop a mother from using her hands to break her fall. \nSimply put, a woman should never have to endure the pain, embarrassment \nand extreme discomfort of being restrained while giving birth to her \nchild, nor should she have to fear she will lose her child because of \nthe way in which she is detained. Our immigration enforcement policy \nshould always uphold our commitment to civil liberties and safeguard \nthe dignity that every mother deserves. My amendment would have done \njust that.\n  My third amendment would have extended protections for the most \nvulnerable, including domestic violence survivors whose visa depends on \ntheir abuser's sponsorship. I drafted a comprehensive amendment \ndesigned to protect immigrant survivors of domestic violence, sexual \nassault, human trafficking, stalking, and dating violence. It would \nhave extended judicial review in certain cases, would have modified the \nViolence Against Women Act, VAWA, cancellation of removal process, and \nwould have provided training for Federal officers on vulnerable \npopulations, among other protections. It would have also extended \ncertain safety-net benefits to immigrant survivors to help them escape \nviolence, gain independence, and recover from physical and emotional \nabuse.\n  I am going to keep working to improve this bill as it continues in \nthe legislative process, and when it becomes law, I am going to work to \nensure it is implemented in a way that works for families and \ncommunities. We must start by pairing unprecedented spending on new \nborder security with responsible oversight, so I will be working \nclosely with the Department of Homeland Security to ensure our efforts \nto secure the border do not violate the civil liberties of American \nfamilies and communities. I am proud my amendment to address \nwarrantless stops and searches in broad border zones is included in \nthis bill, but for immediate border communities, we can't stop there.\n\n[[Page S5337]]\n\n  That is why I offered an amendment that would have strengthened the \nDepartment of Homeland Security's Office for Civil Rights and Civil \nLiberties by amending current law to clarify its jurisdiction and the \nscope of its authority to conduct investigations, require greater \ntransparency in its reporting requirements to Congress, and ensure the \nDepartment's timely implementation of its recommendations and findings. \nEssentially, the amendment would have provided the office with the \ntools it needs to conduct effective oversight, provide substantial and \ntimely responses, and to protect the Department's commitment to civil \nrights and liberties.\n  I also authored an amendment that would have required the Department \nto report on the use of force during immigration enforcement. By better \nunderstanding how and why force is being used, the Department would \nhave been better equipped to ensure its policies and training promote \nand protect effective and humane enforcement practices. While I am \ncommitted to proving Federal law enforcement and border security the \nresources, training, and personnel they require, Congress must also \nensure detainees are treated with respect and dignity. I will be \nworking closely with the Department of Homeland Security to ensure our \nefforts to secure the border don't violate the civil liberties of \nAmerican families and communities.\n  I have also introduced a number of other amendments over the past \nweeks, including an amendment to provide DREAMers access to affordable \ncollege education. I was disappointed these amendments were not added \nto the bill, but I will continue to work with my colleagues to push for \nthese commonsense reforms.\n  Although I have concerns about some elements of the bill, it makes \ncritical changes to our broken system that will strengthen our country, \ngrow our economy, and finally allow millions of families to gain \ncitizenship and chase their dreams without fear of deportation. This \nsweeping legislation is a step in the right direction, and I am proud \nto cast my vote today in support of S. 744, Border Security, Economic \nOpportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I will support the Border Security, \nEconomic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act.\n  This comprehensive approach will bring order to the visa program for \nH-1B applications and H-2A agricultural guest workers, thereby \nenhancing their contributions to the U.S. economy.\n  The legislation protects our workforce by ensuring that employers who \nknowingly hire, recruit, refer, or continue to employ an unauthorized \nimmigrant or fail to comply with E-Verify requirements are \nappropriately sanctioned.\n  I believe that it is imperative that those who followed the rules \nreceive legal status before those who didn't, and this bill does that. \nThe bill also creates a tough but fair legalization process for \nundocumented immigrants to apply for registered provisional immigrant, \nRPI status if they have been in the U.S. since December 31, 2011, have \nnot been convicted of a felony or three or more misdemeanors, pay their \nassessed taxes, pass background checks, and pay penalty fees.\n  The bill recognizes those who came here as young children illegally, \nthrough no fault of their own, and provides them with an expedited \npathway to legal permanent residence status.\n  The bill also includes provisions supported by both labor and \nbusiness organizations that update the nonimmigrant visa processes to \nrespond to workforce needs. It includes important provisions to help \nunify families and to support adoptions. And it corrects problems that \nwe currently have in the immigration removal, detention, and court \nprocesses and increases penalties for those who engage in criminal \nactivity.\n  It protects refugees, who come to our country seeking protection from \npersecution. The bill streamlines processing in refugee and asylum \ncases by eliminating the 1-year asylum filing deadline, eliminating \nfamily reunification barriers for asylees and refugees, authorizing \nstreamlined processing of certain high-risk refugee groups, giving \ntrained asylum officers initial jurisdiction over an asylum claim after \ncredible fear is shown, and permits qualified stateless individuals to \napply for lawful permanent resident status.\n  This legislation will help our economy grow. And according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, the legislation will decrease Federal \nbudget deficits by about $197 billion over the 2014-2023 period. It \nwill increase Federal revenues by $459 billion over the 2014-2023 \nperiod.\n  I congratulate and thank my colleagues for all of their hard work on \nthis important legislation. The Senate worked in a bipartisan fashion \non a nonpartisan issue. I am hopeful that the House of Representatives \nwill do the same.\n\n\n                           Logging Employment\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise to speak on an issue of \nsignificant importance to the forest products industry in Maine. I am \npleased to be joined here by my colleague from Maine, Senator King. We \nhave both heard from a number of our constituents in Maine who are \nconcerned about the ambiguity in the bill that is currently before the \nSenate, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration \nModernization Act, with regard to the definition of ``agriculture \nemployment'' for the purposes of the proposed W agriculture visa \nprogram. I would like to turn to Senator King to elaborate on the \nconcerns that we've heard from constituents in our State.\n  Mr. KING. I thank Senator Collins for her work on this issue. During \nthe last logging season, 79 logging workers were granted H-2A visas for \nwork in Maine. They were able to do this because the Department of \nLabor included logging employment as a covered occupation for the H-2A \nprogram by a December 18, 2008 rule. In the rule, the Department noted \nthat they received two comments in support of including logging \nemployment and no comments in opposition for purposes of the H-2A \nprogram. The Maine companies we have heard from are not looking for a \nspecial carve-out for the logging industry, but they want to make sure \nthat their industry, which currently uses the H-2A program, is not \nexcluded from the new W program that would replace the H-2A program. I \nask the Senator from Vermont, who had such a hand in crafting this \nlegislation, whether it is his understanding that the logging industry, \nspecifically logging employment, as defined in title 20 of the Code of \nFederal Regulations in section 655.103(c)(4), would be able to access \nthe new W agricultural program just as they have the H-2A program.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senators from Maine for raising this issue. I \nwould be glad to clarify that the intent of the legislation is not to \nexclude logging employment as defined in title 20 of the Code of \nFederal Regulations in section 655.103(c)(4) from the definition of \n``agriculture employment'' for purposes of the new W agricultural visa, \nwhich will eventually replace the H-2A program. Consequently, logging \nemployment would be covered in the definition of ``agricultural \nemployment'' for purposes of the new W agricultural visa program. I \nalso understand from Senator Feinstein, the author of these provisions, \nthat it was not the intent of the measure to exclude logging employment \nfrom the new W visa program for agricultural workers.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I do not support the overall Senate legislation as it \nis drafted. On this particular matter, I agree with Chairman Leahy that \nlogging employment would be covered in the definition of ``agricultural \nemployment'' for purposes of the new W agricultural visa program. Those \nworkers that previously had access to the H-2A program should have \naccess to the new W agricultural visa program.\n  Ms. COLLINS: I thank my colleagues for this clarification. This will \nmaintain the status quo by allowing loggers, who currently enter the \nUnited States under the H-2A program, to enter the United States under \nthe new W agricultural visa program. A reliable supply of labor, when \nAmerican workers are not available, is critical for downstream \nindustries such as paper mills in Maine.\n  I now wish to speak on an issue of significant importance to the \nforest products industry in Maine. The immigration bill before the \nSenate contains an ambiguity related to the definition of \n``agricultural employment'' for purposes of the new W agriculture visa\n\n[[Page S5338]]\n\nprogram. Currently, logging employment is included in the H-2A visa \nprogram, pursuant to a rule adopted by the Department of Labor in 2008. \nThe new W agricultural visa program will replace the H-2A visa program. \nTherefore, I wanted to make sure the logging workers who are currently \neligible for the H-2A visa will be eligible for the new W agricultural \nvisa program. My constituents are not asking for a carve-out or special \nfavor. They are simply asking that the status quo be maintained in the \nnew program.\n  Consequently, my colleague, Senator King, and I engaged in a colloquy \nwith the managers of the bill, Senators Leahy and Grassley, to clarify \nthat the intent of the legislation is not to exclude logging \nemployment, as defined in title 20 of the Code of Federal Regulations \nin section 655.103(c)(4), from the definition of ``agricultural \nemployment'' for purposes of the new W agricultural visa program. I am \ngrateful to my colleagues for making this clarification.\n  In addition, I received a letter from Secretary Vilsack of the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  In this letter, Secretary Vilsack said that he is committed to \nworking with Congress on this issue and working ``to implement the W \nAgricultural Visa program so that it covers logging to the extent \npossible, since those workers have historically been eligible for the \nprior H-2A agricultural worker program.'' I thank Secretary Vilsack for \nhis commitment and look forward to working with him on this topic.\n  This is an important issue to my State of Maine and I thank my \ncolleagues and Secretary Vilsack for working with me on this issue.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                U.S. Department of\n\n\n                                                  Agriculture,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 2013.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n      U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: Thank you for taking the time to meet \n     with me on Monday to discuss S. 744, the Border Security, \n     Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act and \n     the benefits it brings to agriculture and rural communities. \n     As I mentioned, S. 744 will create a new role for the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture (USDA) and a new structure for \n     agricultural labor. This new program is the product of \n     extensive bi-partisan negotiations and also reflects a \n     consensus among agricultural and farm worker leaders.\n       During our meeting, you expressed concern about temporary \n     logging employees and whether they will be included in the \n     new W agricultural visa. As you mentioned, these workers will \n     no longer be considered agricultural workers because S. 744 \n     uses the definition set forth by the Migrant Seasonal Worker \n     Protection Act, which excludes logging employees.\n       At my request, USDA staff looked into this and provided \n     clarification and perhaps some good news. Logging employees, \n     to the extent they would be considered non-agricultural \n     workers, would be eligible to enter under the new W non-\n     immigrant visa for low-skilled guest workers. Moreover, I am \n     committed to working with you and members of Congress to \n     address this important issue as legislation moves forward. I \n     would also work to implement the W agricultural visa program \n     so that it covers logging to the extent possible, since those \n     workers have historically been eligible for the prior H-2A \n     agricultural worker program.\n       I am convinced that S. 744 is essential to the continued \n     success of American agriculture.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Thomas J. Vilsack,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n\n                             National Guard\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I wish to enter into a colloquy with my \ndistinguished friends, Senator Schumer and Senator McCain, concerning a \nprovision in the underlying immigration bill, S. 744. They have both \nplayed a crucial leading role in moving this important legislation \nforward.\n  Section 1103 of the immigration bill concerns the authority of \nNational Guard forces to provide support to U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection to assist in the security of the southern border of the \nUnited States. The Department of Defense has a number of concerns about \nthis provision and has proposed several ideas for our consideration to \naddress their concerns at the appropriate time.\n  The Department's concerns are related to language in section 1103 \nthat might have unintended consequences, such as potentially breaching \nthe personnel end-strength levels that are authorized and funded in the \nannual National Defense Authorization Act or imposing large costs on \nthe Defense Department for a mission of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. The Department would also want to ensure that the authority \nfor Defense Department support for border security, including National \nGuard support, resides with the Secretary of Defense.\n  These concerns are entirely consistent with the crucial objective of \nprotecting the security of our southern border and making sure that the \nDepartment of Defense can provide support to U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection to ensure the success of that mission, as the Department has \nalready been doing for more than half a decade.\n  I would ask my colleagues if they are aware of the concerns of the \nDepartment of Defense with respect to section 1103 and of the \nDepartment's suggestions to address those concerns. I would also ask if \nthey would be willing, at the appropriate time, to consider the \nDepartment's concerns and its suggestions for potential adjustments to \nthe legislation that would address the Department's concerns.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I would tell my friend from Michigan, \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee, that I am aware that the \nDepartment of Defense has some concerns with respect to section 1103 \nand also that it has some suggestions for our consideration to address \nthose concerns. I would also tell my friend from Michigan that I would \nbe willing, at the appropriate time, to consider such suggestions in \norder to address the Department's concerns.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I join my friend from New York in \nstating that I am aware that the Department of Defense has a number of \nconcerns with section 1103 and some ideas on how to address those \nconcerns while allowing us to take the necessary steps to ensure the \nsecurity of our southern border. I would also tell my friend from \nMichigan, with whom I have served for many years on the Armed Services \nCommittee, that I would be willing, at the appropriate point, to \nconsider ideas to address the Defense Department's concerns.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I now ask unanimous consent that at 4 p.m. \ntoday all postcloture time be considered expired; the bill, as amended, \nbe read a third time, and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the \nbill, as amended; that the time until 4 p.m. be equally divided between \nthe Chair and ranking member or their designees, with the final 20 \nminutes equally divided, with the majority leader--that's me--\ncontrolling the final 10 minutes; further, the following Senators have \n8 minutes each from the majority's time: Flake, Bennet, Rubio, \nMenendez, Graham, Durbin, McCain, and Schumer; and Senator Landrieu has \n5 minutes from the majority's time; and on all quorum calls, if there \nis a quorum call, time will be equally divided between the two parties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, let me begin by thanking the majority \nleader for his extraordinary leadership on this bill--and both sides, \nit has been a very tough negotiation. The Gang of 8--Senator Flake, \nSenator Bennet, Senator Rubio, Senator Menendez, Senator Graham, \nSenator Durbin, Senator McCain, and Senator Schumer--have worked very \nhard to bring a bill to the floor that, in my view, is not perfect, but \nit is balanced. It accomplishes many of the principles of fixing our \nbroken immigration system. They have worked extraordinarily hard.\n  Let me also thank Senator Leahy and Senator Grassley as the chair and \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee that considered more than 300 \namendments and voted on 121. I am disappointed, as are many people, \nthat we did not get more votes on the floor, but I came to the floor \nearlier in the week and predicted that would happen. It is unfortunate, \nbut it is not the first time. I have seen this movie.\n  Members on the other side are disappointed, some of us are \ndisappointed, and we are hoping we can find a more\n\n[[Page S5339]]\n\nproductive way forward. That is why I have spent some time on the floor \ntalking about a step toward a more productive way.\n  A few of us on both sides of this debate--some of us are voting \nagainst the bill, and some of us are voting for the bill--have been \nworking on a small package of amendments that have bipartisan support, \nno substantive objection, and we are trying to get a short, small list \ncleared by both sides. We have been working on this all week.\n  I appreciate the patience of every Member of the Senate because this \nhas been a very tense, very emotional debate for many Members. As I \nhave said, in a goodwill attempt to get the Senate moving in a little \nbit better direction toward bipartisanship and goodwill, I am not going \nto ask to push this vote back--which would be my right to do, but I \nwill not. Many Members have important schedules to keep and commitments \nto keep, as do I.\n  I will be circulating a list. I believe I will be circulating it with \nSenator Coats, who is going to be voting against the bill. I am going \nto be voting for the bill. We are going to be circulating within the \nnext 2 hours a short list of the amendments that we believe have been \ncleared by both the Judiciary Committee and the majority and minority. \nI am not going to provide the list at this period because it has been \nreviewed in various shapes and ways throughout the week.\n  We are working with Senator Leahy and working with Senator Grassley. \nJust so people understand--hopefully, if they are not convinced how \nsincere I am about this, I want my colleagues to know I am removing my \namendments from this list. There will be no Landrieu amendments on this \nlist. This is not an attempt to get Landrieu amendments passed, as \nimportant as I think they are. I am fortunate that I got in at least \none amendment for adopted kids on the bill. I am not complaining. That \nis the way it goes. But I don't want people to think I am trying to get \na unanimous consent on my amendments, so I am taking my amendments off \nthe list. It will not be circulated.\n  The list that will be circulated is by leaders, both Republicans and \nDemocrats, who have--could I have order, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The list of amendments that will be circulated has \nDemocratic and Republican sponsors that have been cleared by Senator \nGrassley and Senator Leahy. They will work with their individual \nMembers to see if the list can be cleared. There will be no votes, as \nis the unanimous consent. It will have to be done, as we call it here, \nhot-lined, and we will have to have 100 of us say yes. But I am asking \nmy colleagues to say yes. I am asking them to say yes, to take a step \nin the right direction. I am not accusing anyone of anything. I am not \nblaming the Democrats or the Republicans.\n  I am just saying I think we should take a small step toward trying to \nget the Senate back on track. I don't know what is going to happen \nafter the immigration bill, if we are going to engage in any rule \nchange. I have tried not to make any inflammatory statements about that \none way or the other.\n  This is a sincere effort on my part--and Senator Coats has been \nhelpful as well--to try to put forth a small package. I am not asking \nfor a debate or a rollcall vote. It would have to be done by consent in \na small package, and I am removing my amendments.\n  I thank the Senate. I am asking all of my colleagues--it is going to \ntake 100 of us. If one person says no, this will be stopped. I hope we \ncan end on a more positive note. A lot of hard work has gone into this \nbill. I know there are terrible disappointments. I am not one of those \nwho are disappointed. I am happy with the outcome.\n  I am trying to help get a small package that people have been working \non that will not affect the number of this vote in any way. The vote is \ngoing to be the same. It is going to be 68 to 32. Was that the final \nvote? That is what it is going to be at 4 p.m. It is not going to \nchange a thing. It will solve some problems several people have on \nsubjects that are important to the constituents we represent at home.\n  Again, I am taking my amendments off the list.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Madam President, I rise today as the Senate is on the \nverge of passing immigration reform by what may well be a historic \nbipartisan majority. It has been my honor and privilege to have a role \nin moving this legislation forward.\n  We are moving one step closer to fixing our broken immigration \nsystem. This is a system Arizonans have dealt with for far too long. \nThe situation along our southern border has grown increasingly \nuntenable. The Tucson sector just recently lost the dubious distinction \nof being the most active Border Patrol sector.\n  The status quo is now a considerable volume of traffic as well as \ntheft, vandalism, and drug smuggling. This has created a situation that \nis ever more dangerous for Arizona border residents. Never was this \nmore poignant than with the tragic 2010 death of Rob Krentz, a \nprominent member of the ranching community on the border. He was most \nlikely killed by an incident related to illegal smuggling. I last spoke \nto Rob's brother Phil just this morning.\n  Despite claims that the border is now more secure than ever, Arizona \nranchers know quite the opposite. Beyond the border area, Arizona \nremains a State struggling under the weight of a sizeable undocumented \npopulation.\n  As I said before, this situation helps no one. It doesn't help those \nwho are undocumented and living in the shadows, it doesn't help State \nand local governments that are bearing the burden, and it doesn't help \nemployers who are struggling to find a legal workforce.\n  It is against this backdrop that the Senate moves toward approving \nlegislation that takes dramatic steps in addressing border security, \nprovides a tough but fair solution for those who are here illegally, \nand spurs economic growth by modernizing our legal immigration system.\n  Obviously, this legislation is not without its critics. Opponents \nwill point to the legislative process and claim it was flawed. I must \nadmit that while no process for considering legislation is perfect, \nthis bill was made available early. It was also thoroughly vetted under \nregular order in the committee. While I share the frustration that \nthere haven't been more amendments considered on the Senate floor, this \nbody has now spent 3 weeks debating the bill on the floor.\n\n  We have heard that the bill affords too much discretion to the \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security and does little for \nborder security. The Hoeven-Corker amendment, adopted by a wide \nbipartisan majority, removes much of that discretion from the Secretary \nwhen it comes to border strategy by designating a minimum level of \ntechnologies to be deployed per sector.\n  In addition, the Hoeven-Corker amendment dramatically increases the \nresources provided to secure the border by requiring double the number \nof Border Patrol agents and 700 miles of fence. These have to be \ncompleted before anyone adjusts status.\n  We have heard claims the bill weakens existing law. To the contrary, \nthis legislation takes credible steps toward implementing an entry-exit \nsystem to tell us who has and who has not left the country. It makes \nprogress toward achieving the goal of a biometric approach to this \nsystem.\n  At this point it is difficult to take seriously criticism that the \nbill does not go far enough on border security.\n  I should point out that the very day the Hoeven-Corker amendment was \nfiled, a CNN headline read ``Four Bodies Found in Arizona Desert.'' \nFour more deceased immigrants had been located near Gila Bend.\n  This is an issue that plays for keeps. It is in everyone's interest \nthat we gain control of the border.\n  The unprecedented level of resources this bill provides, coupled with \nthe mandatory employment verification system and guest worker plans to \nallow for future flows, is much needed and it takes the right steps to \nget us there.\n\n[[Page S5340]]\n\n  As in previous immigration debates, there are those who claim this \nlegislation is amnesty. To the contrary, this legislation provides for \na provisional status for those who are already here as a means to \nbringing undocumented immigrants out of the shadows. It requires them \nto meet eligibility criteria, pass a background check, make good on any \ntax liability, and pay a fee and a fine. Before anyone can apply for a \ngreen card, they have to pay an additional fee and fine, pass another \nbackground check, continue paying taxes, learn English and civics, and \nprove that they have been employed.\n  Even then, there is no less than a 10-year waiting period before \nanyone can begin to apply, and that can only happen if the border \nagents have been hired, the border strategy has been employed, the \nmandatory E-Verify system is being used by all employers, 700 miles of \nfence are on the border, and an entry-exit system is implemented for \nall air and sea ports of entry.\n  Much of the focus of the legislation has been on the border security \nand legalization provisions, but just as important are the critical \nsteps included to modernize our legal immigration system.\n  The U.S. economy has to stay on the cutting edge of innovation and \nglobal competitiveness. When the best and brightest come here to study, \nwe need to allow them to stay.\n  I am pleased to say the provisions I have previously pushed for as \npart of the STAPLE Act were included in this legislation. Those with \nadvanced degrees in the so-called STEM fields will be exempt from caps \non green card applications.\n  This bill moves our legal immigration further toward a merit-based \napproach, increases the cap on H-1B visas significantly, provides an \navenue for foreign-born entrepreneurs, and creates better programs for \nboth agricultural and nonagricultural temporary workers.\n  When asked about the impact of these changes, the Arizona Chamber of \nCommerce and Industry president, without missing a beat, said:\n\n       These will provide rocket fuel to the economy.\n\n  The Congressional Budget Office, in different words, said much the \nsame thing. Over the period of the next 10 years, GDP is estimated to \nincrease by 3.3 percent as a result of this legislation and by 5.4 \npercent by 2033.\n  Let me say in the few minutes I have remaining that for me, coming \nfrom rural Arizona, there is a personal background for immigration \nreform. Much of my youth was spent on a 200-acre alfalfa field north of \nSnowflake, AZ, where I grew up. Along with my father and six brothers, \nI planted hay, cut hay, hauled hay, and moved sprinkler pipes--miles of \nsprinkler pipes. I even lost the end of my right index finger on that \nalfalfa field. The chores we performed changed with the season, but \nthere was one constant: We worked alongside undocumented migrant labor, \nlargely from Mexico, who worked harder than we did under conditions \nmuch more difficult than we endured.\n  Since that time, I have harbored a feeling of admiration and respect \nfor those who have come to risk life and limb and sacrifice so much to \nprovide a better life for themselves and their families.\n  As I explained earlier in my remarks, there are many who are here in \nan undocumented status who do not fit the sketch I have just described. \nIt is our lot here in Congress to fashion an agreement that deals with \nthe myriad motives, reasons, intentions, and purposes that have brought \npeople here illegally.\n  Along those lines, let me close by saying a few words about the path \nto citizenship included as part of this legislation. I recognize that \nthere are those who are here who hold the position that no one who has \nentered this country illegally should ever be able to become a U.S. \ncitizen. My own feeling is citizenship should be treasured and valued--\nand possible--for those who qualify and who are willing to comply with \nthe provisions set forth in this legislation. If someone is going to be \nin this country for 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 years, I want them to \nassimilate. I want them to have the rights and, more importantly, the \nresponsibilities that come with citizenship. Such assimilation is what \nsets our country apart. It is quintessentially American. It is the \nright policy.\n  I will be proud to cast my vote in favor of this legislation, and it \nis my hope it will become law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wish to start by thanking the able \nSenator from Arizona for his statement, for his leadership, and for his \nincredible work on this bill. I wish to thank all of my colleagues who \nhave been in this so-called Gang of 8, both Democrats and Republicans, \nincluding Chuck Schumer and Dick Durbin and Bob Menendez on the \nDemocratic side. But today I especially want to thank the Republican \nMembers of this group, led by John McCain, and including Lindsey \nGraham, Jeff Flake, and Marco Rubio, for their extraordinary \nleadership. For reasons everybody in this Chamber understands, their \nwillingness to be at the table and to stay at the table was an act of \nleadership unlike any other I have seen in this Chamber in the 4 years \nI have served here. We would never be here today voting to fix our \nbroken immigration system were it not for them. So on behalf of the \npeople I represent in Colorado I thank them.\n  For me this all started in Colorado, because everywhere I went I \nheard people talk about how the broken immigration system was affecting \nthem. I would hear the peach growers in Palisades say one thing and the \ncattle ranchers on the eastern plains say something else. The immigrant \nrights community, many of whom represented children in my old school \ndistrict, our high-tech community, our ski resorts--everybody was \nfeeling the pain of a broken immigration system that Washington was \nrefusing to fix and they had actually given up hope that Washington \nwould fix it.\n  They didn't know each other cared about this issue, so we pulled them \ntogether over about a 2-year period. We had hundreds of meetings and \ntraveled thousands of miles in the State to create something called the \nColorado Compact, a statement of six principles about what Colorado \nexpected immigration reform to look like.\n  Now that we have come to the end of this process--we have come to the \nend of the Gang of 8, finishing the Judiciary Committee proceedings, \nthe work on the floor--I can say this bill is entirely consistent--it \nis not identical, but it is entirely consistent with those principles.\n  The first of those principles of the Colorado Compact is immigration \nis a Federal responsibility. This is not something that should be done \nState by State by State in this country. The Founders themselves \nrecognized this because they put the regulation of immigration in the \nConstitution and charged the U.S. Congress as our obligation to deal \nwith it. That was the first principle.\n  The second principle was ensuring our national security. This bill \nmeets that test as well. It is the strongest border security bill ever \npassed in the Senate. It doubles the number of Border Patrol agents on \nthe southern border. We build 700 miles of fencing. It adds new \ntechnologies. We spend nearly $50 billion on border security.\n  I believe we should have a secure border. In Washington this becomes \na trade. For me, it is not a trade. We should have a secure border, and \nwe should have a pathway to citizenship, and this bill accomplishes \nboth.\n  The people in Colorado who wrote this Colorado Compact called for \nmore effective enforcement of our immigration law, and this bill will \ngive them that. It includes a fully operational, biographic, and \nbiometric entry-exit system, more effective measures to detect fraud \nand abuse of our visa system, and an employment verification system to \nbe used by all employers. This is all in this bill. That has not been \nin prior efforts that either passed or failed in the Congress, but it \nis in this bill, and it is a critical part to making sure we don't end \nup here again.\n  The Colorado Compact said we should have a bill that strengthens our \neconomy. This bill meets that test with a visa system much better \naligned for our 21st century economy--a merit-based system. We have \nhigh-tech and INVEST visas, visas for agriculture that will give our \nfarmers and ranchers a fighting chance to hold on to their\n\n[[Page S5341]]\n\nfarms and to their ranches, and give the people who are working in that \nindustry much-needed relief. There are great benefits for our tourism \nand ski industry as well. And, on top of everything else, the \nCongressional Budget Office tells us this bill doesn't increase our \ndeficit but reduces it over the first 10 years by $197 billion and over \nthe next 10 years by $700 billion.\n  Colorado said we want a bill that is focused on families and keeping \nfamilies together. This bill does that by clearing the green card \nbacklog and ensuring family members are able to reunite more quickly. \nThere is better protection for children in detention and the \nimmigration court system.\n  Finally, we call for a commonsense approach to the 11 million, and \nthis bill does that with a tough but fair path to citizenship for the \n11 million.\n  As so many people in this Chamber, my life story is a story of \nimmigration because I am the son of an immigrant. My mom was born in \nPoland in 1938 while Nazi tanks massed at the border. She and her \nparents miraculously survived one of the worst human events in our \nhistory: The Holocaust. After going to Sweden and Mexico City, they \nwere able to come to New York City in 1950. My mom was almost 12 years \nold. She is the only one in the family who can speak any English at \nall.\n  On my first birthday--this is 1965, so 15 years after they came to \nthe country--my grandparents sent me a birthday card. This is the card \nthey wrote. Here is what they said, in English, by the way. They said \nthis in English:\n\n       The ancient Greeks gave the world the high ideals of \n     democracy, in search of which your dear mother and we came to \n     the hospitable shores of beautiful America in 1950. We have \n     been happy here ever since, beyond our greatest dreams and \n     expectations, with democracy, freedom, and love, and \n     humanity's greatest treasure. We hope that when you grow up, \n     you will help to develop in other parts of the world a \n     greater understanding of these American values.\n\n  They had only been in this country for 15 years. They didn't speak \nEnglish when they got here. They had survived the most horrific event \nof the 20th century, and this was the place that gave them hope and, \nmore than that, it allowed them to rebuild their lives in the only \ncountry in the world where they thought they could.\n\n  This bill reaffirms we are a Nation that respects the rule of law and \nreaffirms our history that we are a Nation of immigrants, and it will \nkeep that hope alive for millions of people, both here and abroad, for \nyears to come.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to ask how much time has been \nconsumed by the proponents of the measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately 23 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time has been consumed by the opponents of the \nmeasure?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time has been consumed by the opponents.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Well, I am going to suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask that the time in the quorum call be charged against the opponents' \ntime, up to 23 minutes, so we can have some equalization in terms of \nuse of time on the floor. It is my understanding--unless Senator Blunt \nis coming to the floor to speak?\n  Mr. BLUNT. I am.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I thank you for the time.\n  I want to talk about the hard work my colleagues have put in on this \nbill. It looks as though it is going to get a number of votes today. It \nwill not be getting mine.\n  I think it is important, as we look at these issues, to understand \nthat once a bill actually gets to the President's desk and gets signed \ninto law, we are probably not going to visit this again for a long \ntime.\n  I think it does not put border security first or it does not address \nwhat I have more and more grown to think of as the other border, which \nis the hiring desk. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said \nthe underlying Senate bill would only cut illegal immigration by 25 \npercent. It does not seem to me that is nearly good enough.\n  I think the estimate was that if this bill did not pass, 10 million \npeople would come into the country in the next 10 years. If it does \npass, 7.5 million people would come into the country in the next 10 \nyears illegally. Some of them will come across the border. A lot of \nthem come here now legally and then they just stay. I do not see \nanything in this bill that does what we could be doing there.\n  I voted against proceeding to the amendment this week, the Hoeven-\nCorker amendment, because I did not think it really focused--as the \nCornyn amendment did that I cosponsored--on granting legal status only \nafter we get the border secured rather than doing it before.\n  In my view, these challenges need to be met. What do we do about the \nworkforce needs of the country? What do we do about people who came \nhere illegally or came here legally and stayed then illegally?\n  But it is important to understand that as long as it has taken to \neven get to this point, once a bill passes, we are probably not going \nto go back and say: Gee, I wish we had done this or I wish we had done \nthat.\n  In addition, under the bill, the only requirement before legalization \ncan begin is for the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security \nto simply submit a border security plan to the Congress. There are lots \nof plans and a lot of them are talked about in this building. Some of \nthem work; some of them do not work. But this does not require any \nfurther approval or verification of the plan.\n  The amendment I supported that Senator Corker was the principal \nsponsor on said you would have to meet some metrics, you would have to \nhave some measures you know you could prove and would be willing to \ncertify.\n  Everybody seems willing to admit that 100-percent awareness of what \ngoes on on the border is possible. So if 100-percent awareness is \npossible, why isn't it possible--if you know 100 percent of what is \ngoing on and can watch the whole border--why isn't it possible to be \nable to certify a certain number of people are being stopped every year \nand that the border is not totally and completely and absolutely secure \nbut meets a level of operational control the American people have a \nright to expect?\n  The $46.3 billion for border security is mandatory funding, but the \namendment only requires $8.3 billion of that $46 billion to come from \nfees, leaving taxpayers on the hook for another $38 billion, again, \nwithout the other half of the problem--people who come to our country \nlegally for a short period of time and then stay--being dealt with. If \nwe do not deal with that, we have not dealt with the problem.\n  Mr. President, 20,000 additional border agents and $4.5 billion for \nadditional border technology is not a strategic plan. It seems to me it \nis throwing a lot of money at a plan and hoping it works.\n  I read lots of people's comments on this who say: Well, we have \noverdone what needed to be done here, but we have underdone the things \nyou ultimately are going to have to do to fix this problem.\n  This measure also provides $1.5 billion over the next 2 years to \nprovide jobs for Americans between the ages of 16 and 24. While jobs \nfor young workers are a priority, it has nothing to do with immigration \nreform. I think it had something to do with one of the additional \nvotes. If what I read is true, this is something someone insisted be in \nthis bill. I think we have to understand we would do a lot more to put \nyoung Americans to work if we had commonsense regulatory policies and \ncommonsense energy policies.\n  Several editorial boards criticized amendments I cosponsored as \npoison pills because they considered them too costly to enforce what we \nwere trying to do. One of the amendments I sponsored said we would have \n5,000 extra people at the border, and editorial board after editorial \nboard said: Oh, that is too expensive. It is a poison pill that will \nkill the bill. Those same people are now supportive of the bill that \nadds 20,000 people working at the border.\n  During the debate I cosponsored other amendments I sought that were \ndefeated. These amendments were in\n\n[[Page S5342]]\n\naddition to Senator Cornyn's amendment, the RESULTS amendment, \nrequiring DHS to have situational awareness and control of the border.\n  Senator Lee had an amendment requiring congressional approval of the \nborder plan that would come from the Department of Homeland Security. \nWhat would be wrong with that: congressional approval, so every year \nCongress continues to be engaged with the funds it takes to do what \nneeds to be done, as well as the plan it takes?\n  Senator Grassley had an amendment requiring the border would have to \nbe ``effectively'' secured for 6 months before the Department of \nHomeland Security Secretary could grant the provisional status. Others \nhave pointed out, and I agree, once you begin to grant that provisional \nstatus, I do not see any realistic way a Congress ever goes back and \nsays: We know we told you that you could stay, but now you have to \nleave.\n  Senator Paul had two amendments I supported. One was ``trust but \nverify,'' much like Senator Lee's amendment, where Congress would have \nto be sure the integrity of the border was being protected. Another one \nwould protect the integrity of the ballot process from illegal voting. \nNobody is here advocating illegal voting. Why we would not get an \namendment that did something to ensure it would not happen is \nsurprising to me.\n  Congress has one shot to address immigration reform in the right way. \nUnfortunately, I cannot vote for this bill because I think it fails to \nprioritize what needs to be prioritized. I also do not think this bill \nwill be a bill that can pass the House of Representatives.\n  I hope the Senate will now work with the House to find a better \nsolution for long-term immigration reform and we can meet those three \ncriteria of: how do you secure the border, how do you meet the \nlegitimate workforce needs of the country, and what do we do about \npeople who are already here, and in many cases these are people who go \nto church where we go to church, their kids go to school where our kids \ngo to school.\n  I, frankly, think those last two issues are pretty easily dealt with \nif the American people ever believe the government has met its \nresponsibility to control our borders. One way to do that is to look at \nthe actual border. Another way to do that is to give employers the \nkinds of tools they need so we can clearly identify who is in the \nUnited States who is eligible to work and who is not.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Chair inform me how much time has \nbeen used on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have consumed approximately 23 \nminutes. The opponents have consumed approximately 9 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Unless there are other speakers in opposition, I would--I \nam sorry. Senator Grassley is here. I once again withdraw and yield the \nfloor to Senator Grassley.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I did not come to speak. I came to object to the \nSenator's unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator, here is the state of play. Unless \nwe can agree to come to the floor and debate the issue, your absence \ndelays the time when you will be speaking until the end of the debate, \nwhich creates an advantage for you by staying away.\n  What we are trying to do is to be fair and give each side a chance to \nspeak on the bill, one side or the other. Senator Blunt has been here. \nI would welcome any Senator in opposition. We have used--I think the \nmeasure was 23 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-three minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And your side has used 9. So I wish to offer the \nopportunity for the Senator to speak in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator for his courtesy. I think there is \nan insinuation in his comment that there is a strategy on our part not \nto speak. That is not true. It is that there is a Republican meeting \ngoing on right now. I went to that meeting and said to the people in \nthe meeting they ought to be out here speaking and they had an \nopportunity to do it. And, for the group, I have objected for that \nreason.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if no time is used at this point, how will \nthe time be taken off, how will it be calculated?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time spent in quorum calls is equally \ndivided between the two sides.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I come to the floor at the end of a long \nbut fruitful bipartisan process. I come here thinking of what this bill \nwill mean for families. I come here thinking of my family, of my \nmother, who came from Cuba, who worked hard and made it possible for me \nto stand here today as 1 of 100 Senators on the verge of passing a \nhistoric piece of legislation that she would have wanted me to vote \nfor.\n  This is a bipartisan compromise that will finally fix our broken \nimmigration system and bring 11 million immigrants out of the shadows--\nnot just the millions who have been here for years without status, but \nthe millions more who have been waiting in line to be reunified with \ntheir families lawfully.\n  When the moment comes to cast that vote, I will be casting it in \nmemory of my mother and for every immigrant like her who came to this \ncountry in the last century to give their families a chance to \ncontribute to America's exceptionalism and for all of those who will \nnow have a chance to contribute to America's exceptionalism in this \ncentury.\n  It will be a vote for the long history of immigrants in America, for \nthe millions of immigrant families: Irish, German, French, Italian, \nScandinavian, Jewish, Greek, Polish, Portuguese, and many others whose \nblood, sweat, and tears ushered in America's industrial age; a vote for \nthe immigrants of the ``greatest generation'' who brought this Nation \nthrough the Depression, fought a World War, and ended the Cold War. It \nwill be a vote for America's new, young, skilled, educated DREAMers and \nentrepreneurs who will now have a chance to become citizens and help \nlead this Nation into a brighter, more prosperous, more productive \nfuture.\n  It will be a vote in memory of a long list of immigrants and the \nchildren of immigrants who made this Nation great: Marine Cpl Jose \nAntonio Guitierrez, not even a citizen of the United States when he \nbecame the first casualty of the Iraq war; Thomas Edison, from my home \nState of New Jersey, the Wizard of Menlo Park, who has made New Jersey \nthe home of invention in America--and there will be an immigrant who \ncarries on that legacy who will make the next great discovery--Jonas \nSalk, whose parents came here and gave him the education he needed to \ngo on and discover the vaccine for polio and save millions of lives. \nThere will be a DREAMer who will be the next Jonas Salk. Colin Powell, \nadmired on both sides of the aisle, his was an immigrant family. Be \nassured, there will be another great military leader and statesman who \nwill be the son or daughter of parents who will become citizens under \nthis legislation.\n  Madeline Albright is an immigrant who became a citizen and went on to \nbecome one of the most respected and admired Secretaries of State. The \nlist goes on: Albert Einstein, Henry Kissinger, Joseph Pulitzer--all \nimmigrants who contributed to America's exceptionalism. This \nlegislation is for all those immigrants and immigrant families who \nhelped make America better.\n  This is the culmination of a long journey for me. I have been \nfighting for immigration reform for 20 years between my time in the \nHouse and the Senate and have been blazing a pathway to citizenship \nthat will help families stay together and give them a chance at a \nbetter life. This bill does that.\n  The road has been fraught with the same obstacles, the same pitfalls \nand prejudices that have stood in the way of every generation of \nimmigrants who wanted nothing more than a pathway\n\n[[Page S5343]]\n\nto acceptance and opportunity. As the saying goes: The hardest steel \nmust go through the hottest fire.\n  What we are about to do today has been a generation-long drive for \njustice and tolerance. It has been and remains the civil rights issue \nof our community. I believe when this legislation finally becomes law, \nit will make us stronger as a nation, just as the Civil Rights Act \nstrengthened this country. We are on the verge of historic change.\n  I am proud to have been part of the Gang of 8 that hammered out a \nstrong bipartisan effort. Now, I say to my friends in the other body: \nDo the right thing for America and for your party. Find common ground. \nLean away from the extremes. Opt for reason and govern with us. The \ntime has come to act in the interests of all Americans. I hope that \nmessage will be heard loudly and clearly in the House.\n  In my view the leadership in the other body has a chance to be \nAmerican heroes, a chance to bring both sides together in an alliance \nthat will ensure passage of this bill. I believe a vast majority of \nAmericans who want immigration reform to pass will thank them for doing \nwhat is right.\n  I hope they will have the political will and courage to unite the \nNation and send this bill to the President's desk, a bill that will \nincrease the gross domestic product, reduce the deficit, promote \nprosperity, and create jobs. This chart shows the cumulative economic \ngains of the legislation over 10 years after passage. Look at the \nnumbers.\n  Fixing the broken immigration system would increase America's gross \ndomestic product by over $800 billion over the first 10 years, it will \nincrease wages of all Americans by $470 billion over 10 years, and it \nwill increase jobs by 121,000 per year for 10 years. That is 1.2 \nmillion jobs. Immigrants will start small businesses, they will create \njobs for American workers. It is time to harness that economic power.\n  The next chart shows that the CBO report also tells us it will reduce \nthe deficit by $197 billion over the next decade and by an additional \n$700 billion more between 2024 and 2033 through changes in direct \nspending and revenues. We are talking about almost a trillion in \ndeficit spending that can be lifted off the backs of the next \ngeneration of Americans.\n  What other single piece of legislation increases GDP growth, \nincreases wages for all Americans, increases jobs and lowers the \ndeficit? What we realize now has been confirmed by the numbers; that \nis, giving 11 million people a clear and defined pathway to citizenship \nis, in effect, an economic growth strategy and exactly the right thing \nto do.\n  It will be a long road for those who have earned the right to become \ncitizens. Citizenship will not be easy. It never is. The new Americans \nwho follow the pathway we lay out will have to have played by the \nrules. They will have to pass background checks, pay a fine, pay their \ntaxes. But, if they do, there will be no obstacle they cannot overcome \nto the day when they raise their right hand and take their \nnaturalization oath.\n  Too many families have waited too long for that day. Too many have \nwaited too long to say those words that will change their lives \nforever.\n  They changed my mother's life and, in turn, gave me the chance to \nstand here today and vote for a pathway to citizenship that can change \nthe lives of millions of others.\n  Today is a victory, not for me or the Gang of 8. It is not a victory \nfor the Senate or for any one community. By passing comprehensive \nimmigration reform, we will have taken the next historic step on \nAmerica's long journey to exceptionalism. I am proud to have been part \nof the process that will continue that journey.\n  In 2007, when we failed at our last attempt at immigration reform, I \nquoted the last phrase of Emma Lazarus's poem emblazoned on the inner \nwall of the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty which says:\n\n       I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\n\n  I said then:\n\n       That lamp [since we failed] is somewhat dimmer, but it will \n     shine again . . . [that] the course of history is \n     unalterable, the human spirit cannot be shackled forever, the \n     drumbeat for security, economic vitality and, most \n     importantly, justice will only grow stronger until we pass \n     this legislation.\n\n  My friends, today when we pass comprehensive immigration reform, the \nlight will shine brighter and it will shine forever.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have talked a lot about how the \nimmigration bill would or would not prevent illegal immigration in the \nfuture. This is a huge concern because we don't want to be back in 25 \nyears proposing the same short-term solutions to the problems.\n  I wish to take a few minutes about the national security implications \nof the bill. There are valid concerns that the bill will put public \nsafety and the homeland at risk. I will walk through some of the issues \nand point out how we tried in committee to change the bill in this \neffort and, of course, we failed.\n  First, the bill contains a dangerous national security loophole that \nwould render the U.S. Government unable to share information with \nforeign governments about immigrants who have had their status revoked. \nAn amendment to preserve the ability of law enforcement to access \ncritical, national security, public safety information and at the same \ntime authorize the Secretary of State to share limited information with \na foreign government while protecting legitimate privacy interests was \nrejected.\n  Second, the bill provides the Secretary of State with authority to \nlimit in-person interviews of visa applicants abroad. The Secretary of \nHomeland Security is not required to interview anyone who applies for \nregistered provisional immigrant status.\n  We learned a valuable lesson after September 11, 2001, because the \nhijackers were not interviewed and applications were rubberstamped. An \namendment to require individuals who may be a threat to national \nsecurity to submit to an in-person interview with consular officers \nwhen applying for a visa was voted down.\n  Third, there were gaping holes in the student visa process. Yet the \ncommittee rejected attempts to delay the expansion of the student visa \nprogram until the tracking system in place was improved.\n  Fourth, the amendment makes it almost impossible to revoke a person's \nvisa when they are on U.S. soil. An amendment to clarify the authority \nof the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State to \nrefuse or revoke visas when, in the national interest, as was the case \nwith the Christmas Day bomber, was rejected.\n  Fifth, the bill does not address the concerns brought to the surface \nby recent events such as the Boston terrorist bombing. We are \nprofoundly troubled with the lack of concern about lessons that can be \nlearned from the failings of the immigration process, which may have \ncontributed to recent events such as the Boston terrorist bombing.\n  We need to understand and we need to address these failures before \nproceeding with some of the provisions in this bill, especially the \nasylum and student visa expansion measures.\n  Putting revised procedures in place before gaining an understanding \nof what does not work in our current system is not good stewardship of \nthe trust of the American people and the trust people placed in us as \ntheir representatives in Congress.\n  Our Nation's security is at risk and we cannot ignore it. We need to \nunderstand what is wrong with the system to prevent events such as the \nBoston bombing from happening again. However, an amendment to delay an \nexpansion of asylum and student visa programs until there has been a \ncoordinated review detailing the intelligence and immigration failures \nof the Boston Marathon terrorist attack was also voted down in \ncommittee.\n  Our national security must be a paramount concern with any \nimmigration reform. Eliminating weaknesses in our system, including \nalong the border and the interior, would make our Nation much safer. \nRegrettably, this bill falls far short of this goal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S5344]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, my father had a rough childhood. His mom \ndied just 4 days shy of his ninth birthday. The small catering business \nhis parents ran together had collapsed, so as a young child he was \nforced to leave school and go to work, and he would work virtually \nevery day for the rest of his life. My mother grew up just as hard. Her \nfather was disabled by polio as a child, and he struggled to provide \nfor his seven daughters.\n  My parents met at a small store where my mother was a cashier and my \nfather was a security guard. He actually lived and slept in the storage \nroom of that store. Like all young couples, they had dreams. My mother \nwanted to be an actress, and my father tried hard to get ahead. In \nfact, after work he would take correspondence courses to become a TV \nand radio repairman, but it was hard because he barely knew how to \nread.\n  They did everything they could to make a better life, but living in \nan increasingly unstable country, with limited education and no \nconnections, they just couldn't. So they saved as much as they could, \nand on May 27, 1956, they boarded a plane to Miami. They came to \nAmerica in search of a better life.\n  Like most recent arrivals, life in America wasn't easy either. My \nfather had someone actually phonetically write on a small piece of \npaper the words ``I am looking for work.'' He memorized those words. \nThose were literally the first words he learned to speak in English. He \ntook day jobs wherever he could find them.\n  They both went to work at a factory, building aluminum chairs. My dad \nstarted working as a bar boy on Miami Beach, eventually becoming a \nbartender. He saved money and tried to open some businesses. When that \ndidn't work, they tried Los Angeles and they tried Las Vegas, but that \nalso didn't work. So he found himself back on Miami Beach behind a bar. \nThe truth is that they were discouraged and homesick for Cuba too. In \nfact, in the early days of Castro's rule, before he came out as a \nMarxist, they even entertained going back permanently. But, of course, \ncommunism took root in Havana, and that became impossible too.\n  I am sure that on their worst days they wondered if it would ever get \nbetter. Then the miracle we know as America began to change their \nlives. By 1967 they had saved enough money to buy a house within \nwalking distance of the Orange Bowl, where on Sundays they would make \nextra money by letting people park on their lawn. My older sister was \nin ballet; my older brother, the star quarterback at Miami High. But it \nwasn't just their lives that changed, it was also their hearts. They \nstill spoke Spanish at home and kept all the customs they brought with \nthem from Cuba, but with each passing year this country became their \nown.\n  My mother recalls how on that terrible November day in 1963 she wept \nat the news that her President had been slain. She remembers that \nmagical night in 1969 when an American walked on the Moon and she \nrealized that now nothing was impossible, because, you see, well before \nthey ever became citizens in their hearts, they had already become \nAmericans.\n  It reminds us that sometimes we focus so much on how immigrants can \nchange America, we forget that America has always changed immigrants \neven more.\n  But this is not just my story. This is our story. It reminds us of \nthe words etched on the marble above the rostrum of the Senate: ``E \nPluribus Unum''--out of many, one.\n  Now, no one should dispute that, like every sovereign nation on this \nplanet, we have a right to control who comes in. But unlike other \ncountries, we are not afraid of people coming in here from other \nplaces. Instead, inspired by our Judeo-Christian principles, we \nAmericans have seen the stranger and invited him in, and our Nation has \nbeen blessed for it in ways that remind us of these ancient words:\n\n       God divided the sea and led them through and made the \n     waters stand up like a wall. By day he led them with a cloud; \n     by night, with a light of fire. He split the rocks in the \n     desert. He gave them plentiful to drink as from the deep. He \n     made streams flow out from the rock and made waters run down \n     like rivers. He commanded the clouds above and opened the \n     gates of heaven. He rained down manna for their food and gave \n     them bread from heaven.\n\n  Our history is filled with dramatic evidence that God's hand is upon \nour land. Who among us would dispute that we Americans are a blessed \npeople? In the harbor of our most famous city, there is a statue of a \nwoman holding a lamp, and at the base of that statue is a poem that \nreads:\n\n       Keep ancient lands, your storied pomp! . . . Give me your \n     tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe \n     free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, \n     the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the \n     golden door!\n\n  For over 200 years now they have come in search of liberty and \nfreedom for sure but often just in search of a job to feed their kids \nand a chance at a better life. From Ireland and Poland, from Germany \nand France, from Mexico and Cuba, they have come. They have come \nbecause in the land of their birth, their dreams were bigger than their \nopportunities. Here they brought their language and their customs, \ntheir religions and their music, and somehow they have made them ours \nas well. From a collection of people from everywhere, we became one \npeople--the most exceptional Nation in all of human history.\n  Even with all of our challenges, we remain that shining city on the \nhill. We are still the hope of the world. Go to our factories and our \nfields, go to the kitchens and construction sites, go to the cafeterias \nin this very Capitol, and there you will find that the miracle of \nAmerica is still alive. For here in America, those who once had no hope \nwill give their kids the chance at a life they always wanted for \nthemselves. Here in America, generations of unfulfilled dreams will \nfinally come to pass. And that is why I support this reform--not just \nbecause I believe in immigrants but because I believe in America even \nmore.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I appreciate the excellent remarks \nfrom the heart of my good friend Marco Rubio. He is a great addition to \nthe Senate. And I would say the heart of America is good. The heart of \nthis country is good. For 30 years they have been pleading with \nCongress to keep a generous immigration policy afoot in America, but at \nthe same time they have been pleading with us to end the illegality \nthat has continued for years now. The people have pleaded with us to do \nsomething about it, and year after year after year Congress has \nrefused, the President has refused. That is why we now have 11 million \npeople in the country illegally.\n  I think the heart of America is good and people are willing to deal \ncompassionately and not try to deport 11 million people. They want to \ndo the right thing about this, but by a 4-to-1 margin they have said \nthey want to see this Congress do what Members of Congress have \nrepeatedly promised and never delivered on--create a lawful system, a \nsystem we can be proud of, a system that serves the national interests.\n  As I explained this morning, rather than working with law enforcement \ngroups and prosecutors and considering the needs of everyday citizens, \nthe sponsors of this bill have spent months in negotiation with special \ninterests and lobbyists to produce a bill that will not work. That is \nthe problem we have before us today. This will create even more \nlawlessness in the future.\n  I want my colleague to hear what our Nation's immigration officers--\nmen and women on the frontlines--have to say about this legislation. \nShouldn't we listen to them? They asked to be able to participate in \nthese secret negotiations, and they were rebuffed. I asked that they be \nallowed to participate, but they were rebuffed. Let's hear what they \nsay about the bill--the bill Senator Schumer said in committee was \ntough as nails, and the TV ads running have said it is the toughest \nbill in history, maybe the history of the world. Is that correct? Is \nthat correct, I have to ask? I think not.\n\n[[Page S5345]]\n\n  This is a joint statement issued today by the councils representing \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement officers--the ICE officers--and the \nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service officers, a joint statement of \ntwo associations representing these tens of thousands of officers. \nShouldn't we listen to what they are saying? Please listen, colleagues.\n\n       ICE officers and USCIS adjudication officers have pleaded \n     with lawmakers not to adopt this bill. The Schumer-Rubio-\n     Corker-Hoeven proposal will make Americans less safe, and \n     it will ensure more illegal immigration in the future--\n     especially visa overstays. It provides legalization for \n     thousands of dangerous criminals while making it more \n     difficult for our officers to identify public safety and \n     national security threats. The legislation was guided from \n     the beginning by anti-enforcement special interests and, \n     should it become law, it will have the desired effect of \n     these groups: blocking immigration enforcement.\n       This is an anti-public safety bill and an anti-law \n     enforcement bill. We urge all lawmakers to oppose the final \n     cloture vote on Thursday and to oppose the bill. We call on \n     all Americans to pick up the phone and call their members of \n     Congress.\n\n  So who do we trust on this question of whether we have a bill that \nwill work? Our good political Senators who work hard but haven't been \nout on the frontlines doing the work or the people we pay who try to do \nthe work every day, putting their lives at risk?\n  There is something else I would like to touch on. I think it is one \nof the least-discussed parts of the conversation. I am sure we will \nhave others talk in more detail about enforcement failures of the \nlegislation, but in many ways this could be the most important. I know \nour friends in the media certainly haven't given a lot of coverage to \nit, but I hope we will think about it more; that is, the future flow or \nthe legal immigration part of the bill.\n  The Congressional Budget Office tells us that the bill's large \nincrease in mostly lower skilled legal workers will push down wages and \nincrease unemployment. That needs to be talked about. It must be fully \nunderstood. Hundreds of people are hurting today.\n  There was an article recently in the New York Times--I think 700 \npeople camped out for 5 days to get a few jobs as elevator repairmen. \nThey waited in the rain, they camped out, they waited in line hoping to \nget one of those jobs.\n  There was an article involving Philadelphia about individuals who had \nprior convictions and wanted work. They set up an opportunity for them \nto apply to find a job. They expected 1,000, and 2,000 showed up. They \ninterviewed a number of them, and the stories they gave are \nheartbreaking.\n  Don't we need to consider the impact this policy could have on \nworking Americans? It is a sensitive topic but a crucial one.\n  Here is what David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, said \nrecently:\n\n       There are those who say you can't have a sensible debate \n     because it's somehow wrong to express concerns about \n     immigration. Now I think this is nonsense. Yes, of course it \n     needs to be approached in a sensitive and rational manner, \n     but I've always understood the concerns--the genuine concerns \n     of hard-working people, including many in our migrant \n     communities, who worry about uncontrolled immigration. They \n     worry about the pressure it puts on public services, the \n     rapid pace of change in some of our communities and of course \n     the concerns, deeply held, that some people might be able to \n     come and take advantage of our generosity without making a \n     proper contribution to our country.\n\n  Mr. Cameron goes on to say:\n\n       It is our failure in the past to reform welfare and \n     training that meant that we left too many of our young people \n     in a system where they didn't have proper skills, they didn't \n     have proper incentives to work, and instead we saw large \n     numbers of people coming from overseas to fill vacancies in \n     our economy. Put simply, our job is to educate and train our \n     youth, not to rely on immigration to fill the skill gaps.\n\n  Does that resonate with any of our people today? Have we thought \nthrough this as to how we should handle these matters?\n  Let's look at our own situation right here in America. Twenty-one \nmillion Americans are unable to find full-time work. One in three \nwithout a high school diploma is unemployed. Forty-seven million \nAmericans are on food stamps. Labor force participation is the lowest \nsince the 1970s.\n  The percentage of Americans actually working is lower and has been \ncontinually falling since the 1970s. It goes back to that date when \nwomen were just beginning to enter the workforce.\n  One in three youth in our Nation's Capital is living in poverty. It \nappears we are in an era of a new normal--economists have been talking \nabout this--a new normal where we see slower growth in developed \neconomies than we normally would see. There is more robotics, and \nbusinesses are looking to contain the growth of employment. Low job \ncreation has been the result.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be notified after 20 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Our own Congressional Budget Office has done a 10-year \neconomic projection, as they do every year. They did this in January, \nunconnected to immigration. They found in the second 5 years of our 10-\nyear window, 2018 to 2023, we would only create 75,000 jobs.\n  Some have said we are going to bring in workers, and that is going to \ncreate jobs. We will talk about what economists really say about that. \nBut what does this legislation do? I think this legislation has not \ngiven thought to the plight of these unemployed Americans.\n  Colleagues, the legislation that is before us today has four times \nmore guest workers. These are people who come only to work. They are \nnot just seasonal workers, they come for years at a time with their \nfamilies, but they come specifically to take a job--four times more \nthan in the 2007 bill that failed and many objected to on the grounds \nit would hurt workers.\n  It also triples the grants of permanent status awarded to legal \nimmigrants over the next decade relative to current law. That was the \nresult of the legalization process. Experts who have looked at this and \nother factors have come to the same conclusion: There would be at least \n30 million people who would be given legal status over the next decade, \nwhereas normally we would give 10 million people legal status. Yet to \nthis day the sponsors of the legislation refuse to tell us how many \nwould come into the country.\n  What we do know is that the plan is not a merit-based plan as \npromised, but it is mostly lower skilled, meaning it will hurt our poor \nand working-class citizens the most. We have data that shows that. This \nwill be a hammer blow for working-class Americans.\n  The Civil Rights Commission had hearings, and members wrote us. They \nsaid it is going to devastate poor workers. They said,\n\n       We don't have a shortage of lower-skilled workers. We have \n     a glut of lower-skilled workers.\n\n  That is a direct quote from their letter. So let's compare our \ncurrent situation when the legislation was introduced in 2007. Today, 5 \nmillion more Americans are unemployed than in 2007; 20 million more \nAmericans are on food stamps; and unemployment among teenagers is 54 \npercent higher than in 2007. Meanwhile, median household income is 8.9 \npercent lower than in 1999. That is huge.\n\n  Professor Borjas at Harvard, himself an immigrant who studies \nimmigration and economics, has said a large part of that decline is \ndriven by the large immigration flow that comes into our country. This \nwould increase it dramatically. We want to have immigration. We are not \ngoing to stop immigration. We are going to maintain a generous \nimmigration flow. But the people need to know this bill increases it \ndramatically.\n  CBO did a report on the legislation. This is what they found: \nUnequivocally, the legal immigration surge in this bill will reduce \naverage wages for a decade. There is a chart in CBO's report. I had it \non the Senate floor earlier. Wages will remain lower for many years \nafter that than if the bill had never passed.\n  What about unemployment, the number of people out of work? According \nto CBO, it will increase, and per capita, GNP will be lower for the \nnext quarter of a century.\n  Yes, you are going to have an increase in GDP--and our colleagues are \nquick to say that--because of the large new group of people. But that \nincrease per person in America doesn't occur. It reduces the per capita \nGNP. And these are extremely conservative estimates. Dr. Borjas in his \nreport suggests the situation will be worse than this.\n\n[[Page S5346]]\n\n  To whom do we owe our allegiance? To these groups who want more \npeople in the high-tech world, agriculture world, meatpacking, or other \nbusinesses, or to the American citizens, who work hard, pay their \ntaxes, fight our wars, and obey our laws? Who is speaking up for their \nlegitimate interests?\n  So the time is long past, as Prime Minister Cameron has said, for a \nnational discussion over illegal immigration policies. We all believe \nin it. No one proposes ending immigration. It is a deep part of our \ntradition as a nation. But a nation has not only a right but a duty to \nestablish a responsible flow that promotes assimilation of those who \ncome here, promotes self-sufficiency, rising wages, and helps identify \npeople who can flourish.\n  The last thing we want to do is to invite people to come to America \nto work and find out there are no jobs for them here or that they are \nputting Americans out of work in order to get a job. That doesn't make \nsense. We have not had the kind of discussion we need. The data \nindicates, objectively speaking, that this will be a detriment to \nworking Americans.\n  A great nation needs a policy that promotes its legitimate national \ninterests, that considers the tough time workers are having today as a \nresult of high unemployment and falling wages, a policy that rejects \nideas that will pull down even further the wages of hurting workers; \nthat could, as Senator Sanders has said, create a permanent underclass \nin America. It is a dangerous thing. We need to do it right.\n  The legislation before us is a dramatic step. I urge my colleagues to \nreject the bill and to work on a positive reform plan that serves the \nnational interests of all Americans--immigrant and native born.\n  Sadly, this legislation advances the interests of those who wrote \nit--many of them with very special interests--at the expense of the \ngeneral public.\n  The vote we are about to have is for final passage. The promises of \nan open and fair process have been as hollow as the promises that this \nbill would be the toughest ever and will end the lawlessness in the \nfuture forever. It just will not happen. Our law officers have told us \nthis.\n  This legislation is amnesty first. The legality occurs first. It \nplainly lacks the kind of mechanisms that are necessary to create a law \nenforcement system that will work. There is a lack of commitment to \nthat. You can see it throughout the bill. It is not written by people \nwho are out there every day and who know the problems with enforcement. \nIf it were, they would have fixed so many of these problems that are \nfully shown throughout the bill.\n  Yes, more money has been promised with the recent amendment for the \nborder, but that is in the distant future. What about the rest of the \nbill? The E-Verify workplace enforcement system is terribly flawed. It \nhas been delayed. It could be put to work right now. We don't need to \nwait 5 years as this bill does. Why it would be delayed that long is \nbeyond me, unless you are not very interested in getting started and \nmaking sure that half the people are legalized and others can't come in \nand take a job who enter illegally.\n  The entry-exit visa system in this bill, S. 744, this 1,000-page \nbill, is much weaker than current law. Current law says you must have a \nbiometric entry-exit system at sea, air, and land ports. This bill says \nyou only have to have an electronic system at airports and seaports, \nmaking the system incomplete and unable to identify who stays and who \nhas returned home on time.\n  Interior enforcement is much weaker--read the passionate letters from \nour law enforcement officers as I read this morning, pleading with us \nnot to pass the bill because, they say, it will hurt enforcement and \nweaken national security.\n  The method of processing those given legal status will not work. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services, which manages this, has one big \nobjection to this bill. They say there is no way they can accomplish \nwhat will be asked of them if this bill is passed. They say it will \nlead to lawlessness, and they will be unable to identify dangerous \npeople who should not be in the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 20 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair. I will be wrapping up. Far from \nhaving fines pay for the cost of this amnesty as the sponsors promised, \nthis is a huge budget buster--a huge budget buster now. The ObamaCare \nprovision that was supposed to ensure that persons who were given legal \nstatus did not get subsidized health care now provides an incentive for \nbusinesses not to hire American workers because they will have to pay \nthe ObamaCare premiums but would hire foreign workers, the illegal \nworkers who are now given legal status--they would be having \nmultithousand-dollar advantages in hiring them over American workers.\n  The legislation will not work. Let's continue to work through all \nthese problems together. I do believe that this--our bill's sponsors \nare clearly correct to say we need to fix this broken system. A bill \nthat will respond to the pleas of the American people for a lawful \nimmigration system that serves our national interest and in which we \ncan take pride is what I will support. How can we vote for a bill our \nown Congressional Budget Office says will reduce average wages in \nAmerica for 12 years.\n  We have in this group of American workers thousands, millions of \nimmigrant workers, millions of minorities and African Americans and \nothers at low wages. This legislation, at a time they are hurting very \nbadly will reduce average wages for 12 years, will increase \nunemployment, and will reduce per capita GDP for over 25 years. This is \npolicy we have to ask serious questions about, all this at a time of \nhigh unemployment, long-term falling wages, surging welfare and \ndisability and dependency.\n  It is not a healthy trend in America. We have to ask these questions. \nOur real focus, as Prime Minister Cameron has said, should be to work \nhard to train our people, our unemployed, our young people for jobs \nthat pay a decent wage, have a health care and a retirement plan. This \nlegislation will not end the lawlessness as our professional officers \nhave repeatedly told us. It will not do so. It will give legality--\nimmunity, if you want to call it that--virtually immediately. There is \na promise of enforcement in the future, but our officers say it will \nnot happen. It is not going to happen now.\n  I believe they are correct. I had the honor to be a Federal \nprosecutor for quite a long time and I know law officers and I know \ntheir difficulties and I totally agree with them.\n  This was a letter that was written today from the ICE officer head, \nMr. Chris Crane, a true patriot. He has worked so hard to do this. He \nsaid one of the problems with the bill:\n\n       . . . is a failure to enforce the nation's immigration laws \n     on the interior of the United States. It is not a border \n     issue. It cannot and will not end as a result of increased \n     border security. It must be resolved through increased \n     interior enforcement.\n       40% of all illegal immigrants currently in the United \n     States did not illegally cross the border, but instead \n     entered legally with a visa and didn't leave when it expired. \n     40,000 border patrol agents provided in your legislation will \n     never come into contact with these individuals. . . .\n\n  Do you hear that, colleagues? These Border Patrol agents are never \ncoming in contact with the people who are in the interior who came on \nvisa and chose not to return. He goes on to say:\n\n       Systems like E-Verify and biometric Entry/Exit--still \n     missing from your bill--may identify millions of illegal \n     immigrants and status violators, but ICE officers will not \n     exist to locate and apprehend them rendering the systems \n     useless. The majority of foreign nationals identified by \n     these systems will remain in the United States. . . .\n       500,000 ICE fugitives are currently at large in the United \n     States. ICE estimates 2 million criminal aliens at large in \n     the United States, 900,000 criminal aliens are arrested by \n     local police each year.\n\n  They go on to note there are only 5,000 ICE officers in America. This \nadministration sued State and local governments that try to help the \nICE officers get their job done.\n  Then the joint statement today from the ICE and USCIS Officers \nAssociation says this:\n\n       ICE officers and USCIS adjudications officers have pleaded \n     with lawmakers not to adopt this bill, but to work with us on \n     real, effective reforms for the American people.\n\n  This bill, they say, is an:\n\n       . . . anti-public safety bill and an anti-law enforcement \n     bill. We urge all lawmakers to oppose the final cloture vote \n     today and to oppose the bill.\n\n  This legislation will not end the lawlessness. I wish it were \ndifferent, but\n\n[[Page S5347]]\n\nthose are the facts. It does not create a merit-based future flow as \nhas been promised, and it leaves us in a very difficult position. I \nfeel like there is no choice for us today. Let's vote no on the \nlegislation. It is not going to end the efforts. We are going to have \nto continue to wrestle with this.\n  The good news is that the House, at least initially, what I have seen \nin their work indicates they are giving a far more prudent approach to \nit. The first bill they produced--I tried to offer it as an amendment, \nbut it did not get brought up--has an effective effort at improving \ninterior law enforcement. That is the kind of thing we need to be \ndoing. Then we can win the confidence of the American people, and we \ncan move past this very difficult time in our history.\n  I reserve the remainder of the time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, if I may, I say thank you to my good \nfriend from Alabama. He is consistent. He has conducted himself \nincredibly well. He is a man of passion, and I agree with David Cameron \nand Jeff Sessions. Let's have a debate about immigration. But I am in \nthe camp of let's stop talking about it and start doing something.\n  This bill, in my view, is a giant step forward in many ways; No. 1, \nfor the Senate. We are at 10 or 12 percent in approval rating for the \nCongress. My question is, Who are the 10 or 12 percent and what bill do \nthey like? I am in the body and I don't disapprove of what we have been \ndoing here. But I see this as a significant step toward the Senate \nbeing able to work together in a bipartisan fashion to do something \nthat matters.\n  Is this bill perfect? No. Is it like Senator Sessions described? No. \nIt is a good solution to hard problems that can always be made better.\n  But to the American people, you have to be frustrated by your \nCongress not being able to do the hard things or sometimes even the \nsimple things. This should give people a little bit of hope that for \nthe first time since 2007, the Senate, in a bipartisan fashion, is \nabout to pass legislation on an important topic that is emotionally \ntough but needs to be dealt with.\n  To the critics, I appreciate the debate this time around. It has been \nso much better, but some of the criticism I am going to address.\n  Senator Rubio spoke in the most eloquent fashion about his family's \nhistory and about who we are as Americans. But everybody has a story. \nMarco's story is an exceptional story. I am the first person in my \nfamily to go to college. Neither one of my parents graduated high \nschool. My dad and mom ran a restaurant, a liquor store, and a pool \nroom, and I learned everything I needed to know about politics in the \npool room--a great place to learn about people.\n  But one of the critics of this bill, one of the organizations, said \nthat the average illegal immigrant has a 10th-grade education. All I \ncan tell you is you have a Senator who came from parents who did not \nhave a 10th-grade education.\n  To those who believe that how long you go to school determines your \ncharacter, how much money is in the bank determines your worth, they do \nnot understand America. Only in America can you do what Senator Rubio \nhas done.\n  My parents have long since passed. When I was 21, my mom died; 17 \nyears younger than my dad. We thought he would go first, but life is \nnot so understandable and predictable. She went first and 15 months \nlater he passed. As my sister was 12, an aunt and uncle helped raise my \nsister. They never made over $30,000 in their life. They worked in \ntextile plants. She has turned out great in spite of having an \noverbearing brother. But I am in the Senate today. Why? Because I live \nin a country where anything is possible.\n  There are a lot of self-made people in America. I am not one of them. \nIf it were not for my family and my friends, I would not be here today.\n  To those who say that among this illegal immigrant population they \nare just not well educated, you have no idea how offensive that is to a \nguy like me. So you can take your criticism and--we will just end it at \nthat.\n  Eighty million baby boomers are going to retire in the next 40 years. \nTo my good friend from Alabama, who believes we have too much legal \nimmigration, I am taking Strom Thurmond's place. He got married and \nstarted having kids when he was 67. Unless all of us start doing that, \nwe have a problem because in 1955 there were 16 workers for every \nSocial Security retiree; today there are three and in 20 years there is \ngoing to be two. Unless there is a baby boom that I don't see coming--\nand I am part of problem. I am not married and I don't have any kids. \nUnless there is a baby boom we don't see, we better hope we can improve \nour legal immigration system.\n  To my good friend from Alabama, I could not disagree with him more. \nWe are going to need a lot more legal immigration than is in this bill. \nI wish we could do more. Who is going to take care of the baby boomers \nwhen we retire? Who is going to replace the workers in our economy if \nwe do not have better legal immigration?\n  What did the CBO say about this bill? If we pass this bill, over the \nnext 20 years we reduce the deficit by $890 billion. How can that be? \nThat means it is good for the economy. How can you reduce the deficit \n$890 billion if you do not create economic activity?\n  To the American worker, the biggest threat to you is illegal \nimmigration. Tell me how it is better for America to continue amnesty--\nwhich is doing nothing and paying people under the table with no \nregulation. How did that help the American worker to compete against \nsome person who is being paid under the table? This bill stops that. It \nbrings people out of the shadows on our terms, not theirs.\n  You get to stay here if we decide you can stay. We are regaining our \nsovereignty that has been lost. How do you get 11 million illegal \nimmigrants in this country? Your system is broken from top to bottom. \nEvery nation, including America, has the right to control its borders \nand control who gets a job and this bill does that and I am glad to \nhave my name on it--and doing nothing is the worst thing for the \nAmerican worker.\n  We are going to stop paying people under the table. We are going to \ngive you access to labor you have today if you can't find it. Have you \never been to a meatpacking plant? You go and find out who is working in \nthat plant. Mostly Hispanics, people from other parts of the world, not \nbecause native-born Americans are lazy; we have higher hopes. There are \nparts of our economy, like it or not, that are dependent upon immigrant \nlabor and our population is declining and our needs for legal \nimmigration are growing. This bill does that.\n  As it affects the economy, it will increase our GDP by 3.5 percent \nover time because it is good for America to have legal immigration. As \nto the 11 million, you will be brought out of the shadows and you will \nstay on our terms.\n  If they committed a felony or multiple misdemeanors, they are not \neligible. Here is what we are going to allow: They will go through a \ncriminal background check, pay a fine, get right with the law, and then \nthey will have legal status. Here is what they will get to do: They \nwill get to pay taxes, like the rest of us, and get to know the IRS. \nWelcome to America.\n  We are going to create order out of chaos. We are going to get people \nworking and paying in rather than taking out under the table. What we \nare going to do above all else, ladies and gentlemen, is we are going \nto prove to ourselves that we can work together for the common good.\n  I have never been more proud to be involved in an issue than I have \ntrying to fix illegal immigration because it is a national security \nthreat, it is an economic threat, and it is a cultural threat.\n  As to my politics, I am doing great among Hispanics in South \nCarolina. The bad news is that there are not very many who vote in the \nRepublican primary. I think the good news for me is I have tried \nworking with my colleagues, the Gang of 8, and our staffs to start a \nprocess that will pay great dividends.\n  To Senators Grassley and Leahy, thank you.\n  To the Democratic and Republican Members, thank you so much. I have \nnever been more proud to be in the Senate than I am today.\n\n[[Page S5348]]\n\n  To my critics, I respect their criticism. I thank them for a healthy \ndebate.\n  To the American people, slowly but surely we are beginning to come \ntogether in your Senate, the greatest deliberative body in history, to \ndo important work.\n  And to the 11 million, you will have a second chance. Take advantage \nof it. Embrace the fact that you are being given a second chance.\n  To the American people, our best days lie ahead, and what makes us \nspecial--and I will close with this--is that being French means you are \nFrench, being German means you are German. Being an American means \nnothing about where you come from, your race, religion, background, or \nethnic origin. Being an American is an idea that so many people \nembrace.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, being an American is something everybody wants \nto be part of, apparently. Unfortunately, we cannot allow everybody in \nor it will create a chaotic situation.\n  I thank Senator Durbin, who has protected the American worker, but I \nwant to tell my colleagues in the Senate that this is a day I have been \nhoping and waiting for.\n  Thank you all so very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, first let me thank Senator Graham, \nSenator McCain, Senator Rubio, Senator Flake, and on our side Senator \nSchumer, Senator Menendez, and my friend Senator Bennet. The eight of \nus came together to create a bill, and in the end we did a lot more--we \ncreated a bond of friendship and trust and a life experience that none \nof us will ever forget.\n  Each of us brought our special pleadings to this negotiation. I \nargued for the protection of refugees, American workers, access to \nimmigration courts and counsel, reforming the flawed H-1B program, a \npath to citizenship that was a challenge but fair. But my colleagues \nknew from the start that there was one issue that was more important to \nme than any other.\n  It was 12 years ago when I first introduced the DREAM Act. I did it \nfor this young woman, Tereza Lee. They were about to deport her from \nChicago back to Korea. She was 18 years old. She didn't know any other \ncountry but the United States. She had been accepted at the Manhattan \nconservatory of music. She was an outstanding pianist. And she was \nabout to be deported. I thought that was wrong. I introduced the DREAM \nAct to help her, and it turns out, hundreds of thousands just like her.\n  Incidentally, this story ends well. She finished her education, and \nshe is now working on a Ph.D. in music. She played in Carnegie Hall. \nShe married an American, and she is a citizen. Would America have been \na better place if Tereza Lee had been deported? Of course not.\n  Over the years the plight of Tereza Lee and this bill, the DREAM Act, \nbecame a cause--a national campaign. In the beginning teenagers used to \ncome up to me in Chicago, filled with emotion, in the dark of night, \nand meet me at my car with tears in their eyes and say: I am a DREAMer. \nCan you help me? Over time, their numbers grew, and so did their \ncourage. They stood up, as they have so many times and in so many \nplaces, and said: I am willing to fight to be part of America's future. \nIt wasn't easy for them.\n  A few years ago I had a press conference right here in the Capitol. I \ninvited the DREAMers to tell their stories. A hate-filled Congressman \nfrom Colorado called the immigration authorities and said: Arrest those \nkids. Well, they were not arrested. They left that press conference \neven more determined to see the DREAM Act become a reality.\n  Time and again we called the bill on the Senate floor and it failed. \nWe couldn't break the filibuster. Two and a half years ago the \ngalleries were filled with DREAMers in caps and gowns. We called the \nbill for a vote, and we lost. We had 55 votes, and we couldn't break \nthe filibuster.\n  One of the saddest meetings I ever had took place afterwards. I went \ndownstairs and met with these DREAMers after the bill failed.\n  Their heads were down and they were crying and they said: What can we \ndo?\n  I said to them: I am never giving up on you. Don't give up on me.\n  Well, today I have a message for Gaby, Tolu, and all the DREAMers in \nthe galleries here and all around the country: Your courage inspired \nus, your determination kept us going, and your faith in the only \ncountry you have ever called home has been rewarded. This bill before \nus has the strongest DREAM Act ever written.\n  I listened to my colleagues come to the floor and speak about \nimmigration. Those of us who support this bill haven't talked a lot \nabout the details of the bill. We have talked about what this means to \nus in our personal lives and what immigration means to America. So in \nfull disclosure I have to tell everyone that the first DREAMer in my \nlife was brought to America at the age of 2. She was the child of \nLithuanian immigrants, and she grew up in poverty but was determined to \nbecome a citizen. Her dream came true when she was naturalized at the \nage of 24. That was my mother, and I dedicate this vote today to her \nmemory.\n  For anyone in this Chamber who believes this is just another vote, go \nto a naturalization ceremony. Watch those new citizens with those flags \nin their hands as they take that oath to be part of this country. One \ncannot help but feel the emotion that courses through them at that \nmoment.\n  Let me say a final word about the Senate. I am proud to represent the \ngreat State of Illinois, and I am proud to be one of the 1,947 \nAmericans who have ever had this honor--to stand on the floor as a \nMember of the U.S. Senate. We were elected to make this Nation better.\n  The eight of us came together across the aisle. We cussed one \nanother, we cheered one another, and we wrote a bill together. Now, to \nmy fellow colleagues in the Senate, it is your turn. Reach across the \naisle and show the American people that this Senate can still rise to \nthe challenge. Show this skeptical Nation that their faith in our \nFounding Fathers will be honored by our generation of Senators.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank Senator Durbin for his \ncompelling remarks and his deep and abiding concern for many years for \nthe so-called DREAMers. I thank my other my six colleagues for their \ninvolvement, and I also thank Senator Corker and Senator Hoeven for \ntheir effort on this bill. I thank my colleague Senator Flake for his \noutstanding work. I would like to also mention Senator Lindsey Graham, \nwho gave his own unique perspective, as well as my friend from Colorado \nSenator Bennet and also Senator Schumer, who has played such an \nimportant and valuable leadership role.\n  The word ``friend'' is tossed around this body quite often, perhaps \nwith not as much sincerity as we would like, but these seven \nindividuals are my friends. More importantly, they are friends of \nAmerica. They are friends who realize that we were sent here by our \nconstituents to achieve results, and I don't know at this particular \ntime of a greater issue in which we should be involved.\n  We have heard a lot of personal stories here today, and I am deeply \nmoved by all of them. There is another human story. In fact, there are \nmillions of them. I would like to tell a few of them.\n  Over the last week the Arizona newspapers have reported that eight \nbodies were found in the Arizona desert. The Arizona desert today, my \nfriends, is in triple-digit temperatures.\n  On June 21 the Arizona Republic reported:\n\n       Four men may have been dead three days before their bodies \n     were found in the Arizona desert by U.S. Border Patrol agents \n     . . . Two men had Mexican identifications, and the other two \n     didn't have identification.\n\n  On June 24 the Associated Press reported:\n\n       Maricopa County Sheriff's deputies found another dead body \n     in the Arizona desert near Gila Bend . . . just days after \n     four bodies were found in the same area . . . No \n     identification was found on the body and there were no signs \n     of trauma or foul play.\n\n  On June 27, today, the Arizona Daily Star reported:\n\n       Three decomposing bodies were found by Tucson Sector Border \n     Patrol agents in the desert in two separate incidents over \n     the weekend.\n\n  The Yuma Sun reported yesterday:\n\n       There have been 12 people rescued from the desert by Yuma \n     Sector agents. Six others were not located and died in the \n     wilderness.\n\n\n[[Page S5349]]\n\n\n  The list goes on and on.\n  Since 2007--the last time we tried to pass this legislation--more \nthan 2,425 immigrants have died trying to cross our southwest border. \nThese are people who wanted to come to this country because they wanted \nto realize the American dream. That is what they wanted. That is what \nthey risked their lives and, in fact, gave their lives for--and, yes, \nthey did so illegally. They were willing to pay a penalty for crossing \nour border illegally. Shouldn't we give them the same chance we have \ngiven generation after generation of immigrants who have come to this \ncountry? There has been wave after wave of Irish, Italians, Jews, \nPoles, and now people from all over the world who want to come to this \ncountry. Shouldn't we do that? Isn't it in us to bring 11 million \npeople out of the shadows who are now being exploited and have none of \nthe protections of citizenship?\n  Well, how do we address that? This legislation does secure the \nborder, and I can tell everyone, from 30 years of being on the border, \nthis bill secures the border, and anyone who says it doesn't does not \nunderstand our security needs. I have been there, and I have seen the \ntechnology. This is technology that was developed in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, which will give us surveillance. Yes, there is a bill with \n20,000 new Border Patrol agents, but the fact is that the technology \nthat is there now will give us the ability for 100 percent situational \nawareness and the ability to intercept. I guarantee it to my friends \nbecause I saw it work. There are 700 miles of total fencing that will \nbe added--700 miles. As we all know, we will also have additional \nBorder Patrol agents.\n  What is the key to this bill? The key to this bill is not only that \nwe have the fencing on the border and the Border Patrol, but it is the \n40 percent of the people who are here illegally who came here and \noverstayed their visas. They didn't cross the southwest border. What do \nwe do about that? We dry up the magnet, and that is the E-Verify \nprogram, which makes sure that every person who wants to come to this \ncountry illegally will know they cannot get a job here. Within 5 years \nwe will have an E-Verify system that I am confident--and more \nimportantly, so are the people who are really knowledgeable about \nthis--will be a full-proof system with 95 percent effectiveness.\n  This legislation will not only give us a secure border, but it will \naddress the key element because people who now want to come here \nillegally will know they cannot. Employers will know that if they hire \nsomeone who is here illegally, they will pay a severe penalty for doing \nso. We have to dry up the magnet.\n  So today there are 11 million people who are in violation, and they \ndon't have the protection of our laws. I would like to mention again \nthe people who are coming across our borders. There is a thing called \ncoyotes. Does anyone know what coyotes are? They are drug cartel \npeople. They are the most evil people on Earth. They take these people \nin groups, and they bring them across the border. Many times, the \nreason we find these bodies in the desert is because they say: We are \nleaving you here. Tucson is right over the hill. Thousands have died in \nthe desert. Do my colleagues know what they do sometimes when they get \nthem all the way up to Phoenix? They keep them in drop houses jammed \ntogether and they hold them for ransom under the most unspeakable \nconditions. Do my colleagues know what else they do? They abuse the \npeople they bring up. I won't go into the details of how they do that. \nIt is an unacceptable situation.\n\n  Fifty thousand Mexican citizens have been killed by the drug cartels. \nLast year, hundreds of migrants were missing or killed in Mexico, more \nthan 20,000 were kidnapped, and many are regularly beaten. The Mexican \nGovernment doesn't know exactly how to handle this situation, and it is \nall complicated by drugs which we are creating the demand for.\n  I have had the great opportunity in my life to have many experiences, \nand the one I will never forget was on July 4 of 2007. Senator Lindsey \nGraham, Senator Joe Lieberman, my beloved friend, and I were in Baghdad \nfor the Fourth of July. General Petraeus had requested that we speak at \na reenlistment ceremony where about 800 brave young men and women \nserving in the military were reenlisting to stay and fight. There was \nanother group of some 80-some who were green card holders who, because \nthey had joined the military, had an accelerated path to citizenship. I \nwas honored to be there. I was honored to speak to them. In the front \nrow, there were four empty seats with boots on them representing men \nwho were green card holders who had lost their lives in combat in the \nprevious 48 hours, men who had been willing to risk their lives and \nserve our country in order to be citizens of this country. I have never \nbeen so deeply moved.\n  Let's give these 11 million people a chance to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I know the Gang of 8 members who were \nresponsible for the basic framework of this legislation have done \ntremendous work and have advanced the substance and tone of our \ndiscussion immeasurably since 2007, which is the last time we had a \nmajor immigration bill on the floor.\n  I think the American people now understand the status quo is simply \nunacceptable. We have a broken immigration system which, in the words \nof my friend from Florida Senator Marco Rubio is effectively a de facto \namnesty, because we have a system that is lawless and it is \nuncontrolled and it operates neither in the best interests of our \ncountry economically nor represents our values.\n  The American people are famously generous and compassionate. As a \nsociety we believe in second chances. All of us have benefited from \nsecond chances in life, and I believe the American people believe those \nwho have come here to America in violation of our immigration laws, if \nthey are willing to step up, pay a fine, register, and live in \ncompliance with our laws, should get a second chance as well.\n  As a matter of fact, polling shows the American people support a \npermanent legalization program for 11 million immigrants living in the \nUnited States but only--only--if they are convinced the Congress has \nmade sure they will never ever have to do this again. In other words, I \nbelieve the American people believe if the borders were controlled; if \nthey believed we had a biometric entry-exit system which would track \nvisitors who enter the country and who never leave, which is 40 percent \nof illegal immigration; if they believed we actually had an effective \nE-Verify or employment verification system that would determine at the \nworksite when someone shows up to work they are legally qualified to \nwork in America--I believe if we had those three legs to the stool in \nplace, the American people would do, once again, the generous thing, \nthe compassionate thing, and give second chances to the 11 million \npeople who are here.\n  But the problem with this bill--and I say this more out of sadness \nthan anything else--the promises of this bill have simply not been \nkept. We were told 6 months ago the pathway to citizenship was \ncontingent upon border security and these other enforcement measures \ntaking place. When it wasn't, I proposed an amendment which would \ncondition the transfer for probationary status to legal permanent \nresidency on a certification that the objectives on operational \nsecurity of the border had been met. I believed that by doing so, we \nwould realign all of the incentives for the political parties--for \nIndependents, for conservatives, for liberals--everybody would be \nfocused like a laser on how to get this done, how to hit the mark.\n  I believe, if we had a mechanism in this bill which did not depend on \nCongress keeping future promises of performance, we could regain the \ntrust and confidence of the American people such that we could get to a \nsuccessful outcome.\n  Unfortunately, as the Presiding Officer knows, the proposal I made to \ndo exactly that has been rejected. In fact, the assistant Democratic \nleader made the point recently in June that permanent legalization has \nnow been delinked from border security.\n  But I believe the problems of this legislation go well beyond the \nborder. When I offered 5,000 Border Patrol agents, I was told that--\neven though the Gang of 8 bill offered zero Border\n\n[[Page S5350]]\n\nPatrol agents, I was told that was a budget-buster. It was simply \nunaffordable--5,000 new Border Patrol agents. But now we find 20,000 \nadditional Border Patrol agents provided for in this bill. Now we have \nbeen told that we have essentially a surge of law enforcement to the \nborder and a huge investment in new technology and boots on the ground.\n  The only thing missing is a plan to make sure those people are \nactually effectively deployed and that technology will actually be \ndeployed in a way that secures the border. I know the surge worked in \nAfghanistan, but I am not so sure we need a military surge in South \nTexas, and particularly in the absence of any plan to make sure people \nare going to be effectively utilized.\n  What is more, I would say I do not believe the promises made in this \nbill will ever be kept. I do not believe we will ever have an extra \n20,000 Border Patrol agents. I do not believe the huge investment in \ntechnology will ever be made because it depends not just on this \nCongress and this administration but future Congresses and future \nadministrations.\n  So we have, in essence, the American people being asked to grant the \ngift of a pathway to citizenship, to demonstrate the typical American \nbelief in second chances and demonstrate their compassion. But, in \nessence, they have been tricked, once again, to trade that in exchange \nfor hollow promises of future action. I think it is an unacceptable \ndeal.\n\n  The problems with this legislation also extend beyond that. This bill \ngrants immediate legal status to people with multiple misdemeanors and \nconvictions for driving while intoxicated and spousal abuse. As a \nmatter of fact, a person can have been deported out of the country for \nhaving committed a crime yet be eligible for reentry into the country \nand eligible for probationary status under this bill. I think that is \nshocking. I understand why we would want to give people who are \neconomic migrants an opportunity to get right with the law and to get \non with their lives, but why in the world would we want to extend that \ngenerosity to people who show nothing but contempt for the rule of law?\n  This bill also hinders law enforcement by making confidential the \ninformation contained in applications for probationary status that are \nrejected. This happened back in 1986. And I remember a quote, I believe \nit was from the senior Senator from New York after that time, to the \neffect that that was one of the biggest sources of fraud in the amnesty \nof 1986. My hope would be we would not repeat that mistake again by \nkeeping that information confidential and away from law enforcement \nauthorities, thereby hindering their efforts to root out fraud and make \nsure only people who legally qualify for this generosity are able to do \nso.\n  The other problem with this bill is it simply is a budget-buster. I \nwas told 5,000 Border Patrol agents that would be paid for out of the \n$8.3 billion trust fund created by this bill was too much, but now we \nhave $30 billion more in additional spending being promised. The \nargument is that somehow this is free money and it doesn't cost a penny \nbecause under the CBO score, there will actually be a reduction in \ndeficits. The problem is that is double-counting the money. It is the \nmoney coming into the Treasury because of people who are now \nregistered, who are paying into Social Security and the like. But it \ntakes that money to spend on these other programs and does not \nappreciate or recognize the fact that money is also going to need to be \navailable to pay future benefits for these same people. That is double-\ncounting. That is phony bookkeeping, and we ought to reject it.\n  The truth is, this bill adds to the budget deficit an additional \nroughly $14 billion as presently written. At a time when our debt is at \n$17 trillion, it strikes me as the wrong thing to do to say we are \ngoing to add further to that debt and jeopardize our fiscal health for \nthe country as a whole going forward.\n  I will close with this. It gives me great pain to say that I think \nthis is an opportunity we have failed to take advantage of. I think we \ncould have done better and we should have done better. This bill is \nunworthy of my support and it will be unworthy of support by a number \nof Members. But my hope is the House of Representatives takes up this \nissue and we can somehow find our way to a conference committee with \nthe House and produce a bill we can eventually put on the President's \ndesk. It will not be like this bill, I am confident of that. The House \nhas far different views. But what we do have that we didn't have in \n2007 is I think a true bipartisan consensus that the status quo is \nunacceptable and we have to do better. Unfortunately, this bill doesn't \nkeep the promises that were made originally, and for that, I truly \nregret it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, we are now approaching the final hour \nof this debate on how to fix our broken immigration system--the debate \nwe have been having for 3 weeks here on the Senate floor, for 7 months \namong the Gang of 8, and for decades in this Nation. I want to \nprofoundly thank my colleagues in the Gang of 8. I will have more to \nsay about each of them after we vote. I also wish to thank all of my \nstaff who did such a great job.\n  When I look out my window from my home in Brooklyn, I see the torch \nof Lady Liberty shining brightly and I can see and feel the promise of \nAmerica and the covenant of America.\n  There is an unwritten covenant between America and those who \nimmigrate here. It says if you come here with a dream, with a will to \nwork hard, follow the rules and contribute, we will give you a chance \nto become an American and, in the process, to make America a better \nplace than it was before you got here.\n  In choosing this country, whether it is my friend Marco Rubio's \nparents from Cuba or my grandparents and great-grandparents who fled \npersecution from Europe, immigrants bring an appreciation for the \nchoices and opportunity that are unique to America. They often love \nAmerica even more than native-born Americans. We take that appreciation \nfor granted.\n  It is, therefore, not a surprise that CBO says this bill will grow \nour economy by 3.3 percent over the next 10 years and 5.4 percent over \nthe next 20. CBO has simply enumerated a concept that many of us \nalready knew: Immigrants have always been the greatest engine of \neconomic growth, innovation, and renewal that this country has ever \nknown. There is no greater economic engine than the long hours \nimmigrants work with no complaint for the chance to achieve economic \nstability and prosperity for themselves and for their families.\n  According to CBO, it is a far greater engine for economic growth than \nany spending program Democrats might traditionally propose or any tax \ncut Republicans might traditionally propose. Whether it is highly \nskilled immigrants inventing new technologies or lower skilled \nimmigrants toiling in our fields or all of those in between, immigrants \nhave been an essential component to our American success story.\n  To reject this basic truth in this vote today would be a direct \nrebuke to the lady who shines so brightly in New York's harbor.\n  But just like today, our history has had many other instances where \nthe fate of the American covenant with our immigrants has been tested. \nAnd, in the end, it has always survived stronger than it was before.\n  It has survived because all of us know if America is to remain the \ngreatest Nation in the world, a beacon of hope and freedom for all to \naspire to, we must always live up to the covenant that is represented \nby the great Lady in the Harbor.\n  This bill is our best chance, and may be our last chance, to maintain \nthat covenant through the next generation of Americans, and to maintain \nthe greatness of America. This bill includes input from almost every \nMember of this body.\n  I cannot think of two more vocal critics of the bill than the \nSenators from Alabama and Iowa, but even they have amended the bill in \nmultiple places to make it better.\n  That is what makes this bill strong; that is what makes this bill \ngood. It has garnered support from the most diverse coalition of groups \nany bill has ever seen: U.S. Chamber of Commerce; AFL-CIO; the faith \ncommunity, including Evangelicals and Catholics; the\n\n[[Page S5351]]\n\nhigh-tech community; America's farmers and farm workers; the law \nenforcement community; the immigrant rights community.\n  Now, what does this bill do? Simply put, it does three simple things: \nIt will prevent future waves of illegal immigration; it will provide a \ntremendous boost for the American economy by rationalizing future legal \nimmigration; and it will fairly and conclusively address the status of \npeople currently here illegally.\n  Let's look at the actual facts of what the bill does to end illegal \nimmigration.\n  If the bill passes, anyone who wants to try to cross the border \nillegally will have to get over an 18-foot steel pedestrian fence and \npast border agents standing every 1,000 feet apart from Brownsville to \nSan Diego.\n  Future waves of illegal immigration will be prevented if this bill is \npassed. That is not a wish, it is not a hope, it is a fact.\n  People have argued that we should not pass this bill because past \nefforts have failed to prevent illegal immigration. But let's not be so \ndefeatist that we throw up our hands and declare we are incapable of \nlearning from our past mistakes.\n  Under their logic, the famous expression would be changed: When you \nfall off a bicycle, make sure you never ride a bicycle again.\n  Finally, I do not countenance the way the 11 million undocumented \nimmigrants living in our midst got here. But they are here now, and \ndeporting all of them is unpractical, unrealistic, and wrong to \nconsider.\n  Our bill will tell these individuals if they are willing to keep \ntheir end of the covenant, their road may be harder and longer than \neveryone else's road--a 10-year probationary period, no benefits or \nassistance of any kind--but it too can end with being given the chance \nto earn American citizenship if they work hard and pay taxes and play \nby the rules.\n  So the bill is the right thing to do from top to bottom. It has more \ndeficit reduction than our best deficit-reducing packages. It will \nstimulate the economy more than any stimulus bill, and it will make our \nborder more secure than it has ever been in our history.\n  So now there are simply no more legitimate excuses to vote against \nthis bill. Opponents of the bill have given three stated excuses for \nopposing the bill, each of which has been resoundingly refuted.\n  They said the process is unfair, but it has been the most open \nprocess we have seen in a long time. They said it was going to bust the \nbudget and take away American jobs. CBO refuted that.\n  Finally, they said the bill will not secure the border. But we have \nthe toughest border security and enforcement in any immigration bill \never written.\n  Here is what a vote against this bill says: It says it would be nice \nto reduce the debt, but not if it helps immigrants. It says it would be \nnice to grow the economy, but not if it helps immigrants. It says it \nwould be nice to end illegal immigration in our security, but not if it \nhelps immigrants.\n  Those are the three stated reasons. The only reason left to vote \nagainst this bill is the unstated reason--opposition to a path to \ncitizenship for the 11 million.\n  Make no mistake about it, the support this bill has generated in the \nSenate will make it impossible to ignore. I believe the support this \nbill will receive today in the Senate will propel it to pass the House \nand be placed for signature on the President's desk by the end of the \nyear.\n  That is because in our hearts we know immigrants have always been \npart of the fabric of America. While there have always been people who \nhave rejected immigrants--from the know-nothings to the exclusionists--\nwe have always seen the better angels of our nature prevail in the end.\n  At times like these, when our better angels are tested, to reject \nthis bill would tear the fabric of America asunder. It would declare \nthat America no longer seeks to be the shining city on the hill that \nattracts and is admired by people around the globe.\n  Pass this bill, and let's keep the American covenant alive. Pass this \nbill, and let the bright torch of Lady Liberty continue to shine \nbrightly as a beacon to those around the globe for generations to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, as I have looked at the legislation--\nand we have wrestled with what goes in it--I will just share with my \ncolleagues my perspective, having been in charge of enforcing Federal \nlaws as a U.S. attorney in the interior of the country.\n  We need to understand a couple things. The border is very important. \nThere has been wide open illegality at our borders for years.\n  San Diego, a number of years ago, was having drugs, crimes, violence. \nThey built a fence and prosperity rose on both sides of the fence. \nCrime went down. It just had to be done, and they have been very happy \nwith it.\n  That helps a lot, and it is not at all impossible for us to get our \nborder under control today. It does not require that much more than \ncurrent capacity, but what we need is an absolute commitment from the \nPresident and the Director of Homeland Security to get that done. We \nhave lacked that.\n  I want to move beyond just the requirements of the border. There are \nother areas that are critical to having a lawful system of immigration. \nThose include entry-exit visas, and that includes workplace \nenforcement.\n  Under current law, Congress has passed--and actually there have been \nsix laws to this effect in the last 10 years--these laws require that \nthere be an entry-exit biometric visa system at all air, sea, and land \nports. The 9/11 Commission recommended that. The 9/11 Commission--when \nthey had a review of what had been done toward accomplishing their \nrecommendations--they went back to it and warned that we had not \ncompleted it. It is current law. It requires a biometric entry-exit \nsystem.\n  People who come into our country today are fingerprinted, but when \nthey leave the country they are not checked. So we do not know--when \nthey got their visa and they entered the country--whether they ever \nleft.\n  There are arguments that have been made that it would cost billions \nand billions of dollars. But a pilot project, which I just discovered \nrecently--I did not know it was there--was in Atlanta and one of the \nother airports. In Atlanta, they did this: A person goes through the \nairport to depart from the United States, they go by a handheld \nfingerprint-reading machine--police officers have them in their cars; \nthey can stop a drunk driver and check their fingerprints right on the \nside of the road--they put their finger on that, they go out of the \ngate, and you know whether they have departed the country.\n  So this is a significant technological advancement. It works. In \nAtlanta, when they did that, they caught over 100 people on the watch \nlist--people for whom there were felony warrants, people on the \nterrorist watch list. They knew, and we have a record of the people who \nleft the country.\n  That is critical to our system. We have almost gotten there. But \nthere has been a failure to see it happen because some people do not \nwant it to happen. That is not in this legislation. This bill \neliminates the requirement of a biometric system, and it eliminates the \nrequirement that we have an exit system at the border. It is only air \nand sea. That is a major diminishment of an absolutely critical part of \nour system. It is going to be even more critical.\n  Why will it be more critical? Because we are going to have the \ndoubling of the number of people who come to our country on visas, and \nwe are going to have an increased problem of visa overstays. The \nCongressional Budget Office warned of that in their report. It is \nobvious. The Citizenship and Immigration Services and the ICE officers \nhave warned of it repeatedly to us in their letters. So this has to be \na part of our system. It just has to be. The fact that it is not in \nthere indicates the people who drafted the bill had no real interest in \nseeing enforcement enhanced, but they actually wanted to allow the \nenforcement to be weakened. So that is a nonstarter. This has been in \nthe law for over 10 years.\n  So the ICE officers have told us: Look, 40 percent of the people now \nwho are here illegally came by visa overstays. But that is going to \nincrease dramatically for a lot of reasons. One\n\n[[Page S5352]]\n\nof them is we are going to double the number of people who come by \nvisas under this bill.\n  So they have warned us that this concern about a de facto amnesty \nwill continue because we have no people on the interior of the United \nStates to enforce the law. You are going to 40,000 Border Patrol \nagents, but only 5,000 people inside the interior of the entire United \nStates of America.\n  This President, as part of his systematic plan to stop enforcement, \nhas sued States and broken the 287(g) agreements with States that allow \nthem to participate and help the ICE officers do their jobs. States \ncannot prosecute people. States cannot deport people. But States can, \nas part of their job, when a police officer arrests somebody for a \ncrime or drunk driving--and they identify them as being illegally in \nthe country--they can take them to the ICE officers and help them do \ntheir job. And there are agreements to do this to this effect.\n  What has happened? This administration has eliminated those \nagreements and canceled the program. I helped write the program. Lots \nof States were participating happily in it, and they were not being \nforced to do anything they did not want to do, but it allowed them to \nbe more effective in doing their job.\n  So the problem is when you see that missing in this 1,200-page bill, \nbut you see provision after provision after provision that focuses on \nother issues, focuses on issues important to special interests who \nhelped write the bill. Then you begin to get suspicious about what is \nhappening. That is why the ICE officers and the Citizenship and \nImmigration Services were so concerned about not being able to \nparticipate in the program effectively and to share their views. It is \nclear they did not want their views.\n  So President Obama--although it has been maintained pretty carefully \nthat he was not involved in writing the legislation, it appears he \nquite clearly was. They are not happy with the ICE officers. The ICE \nofficers actually sued Secretary Napolitano for stopping them from \nenforcing the law they have sworn to enforce. They say they are being \nrequired to violate their oath and their commitment to the law by \npolicies from politicians in the Homeland Security Department. They \nhave written it in letter after letter after letter, openly saying the \npoliticians in the Department are overriding the law--directing us and \nundermining our ability to do what we are sworn to do. They have a \nlawsuit pending about it. I have never heard of that, that officers \nwould do that.\n  Then we have the confusion over the E-Verify system. Senator Portman \nimproved the bill dramatically with his amendment--or would have. He \nwas not able to get it up for a vote. But the E-Verify system is in \nplace today and it is utilized by governments and by contractors who do \nwork for the government. I think people who want to voluntarily use it \ncan use it.\n  You can give a Social Security number to your boss or your employer-\nto-be and he runs it and checks. What they find is many illegal workers \nare using the same Social Security number as other people. The computer \nand the Social Security department catches that. That tells the \nemployer there are six different people using this Social Security \nnumber. You should not hire this person until he has been checked out.\n  So that is the way the E-Verify system works. It takes about 3 \nminutes. It has a 99-percent accuracy rate, but the forces out there \nhave blocked the legislation for E-Verify. Even this minimum standard \nthat is operating today, we had to fight to get an extension. I had to \nhold up legislation to guarantee that they would at least extend the \ncurrent system because there are forces out there that put in big money \nthat do not like this project. They do not like it. They want to end \nit. They are afraid it will be expanded.\n  Any plan that pretends to be serious about workplace enforcement has \nto utilize the E-Verify. Well, this bill, instead of just taking the \nsystem and expanding it--which would not take much effort; computers \nare capable of handling the numbers--instead of just doing that, they \nhave done it in a way that delays it for 5 years. So to me this \nindicates there is not an intensity of interest after the amnesty has \nbeen given.\n  After people have been given legal status, they will be given a \nSocial Security number. They will not be hurt by having to have their \nnumber checked. They will have a legitimate Social Security number. \nThey will be legal. They will take any job out there. But the people \nwho come in later, the people who did not qualify, people who otherwise \nwere criminals and should not be getting a job and do not qualify for \nthis provisional status, they would be identified for years under this \nsystem. It indicates a lack of seriousness in the commitment.\n  I see Senator Grassley is here. I will wrap up by saying that \ncreating a lawful system of immigration requires more than border \nenforcement. It is important but you have to have interior enforcement. \nYou have to have workplace enforcement. You have to have entry-exit \nvisa enforcement. This is critical.\n  As I have been stressing, we do not talk about it enough. The bill \nalso sets out in its 1,200 pages the future flow of workers into \nAmerica. Our colleagues have said it is a merit-based system. We have a \npoints system. Unfortunately, that is not substantially correct. It \nlooks to us like less than 15 percent of the people enter into our \ncountry under our plan by a merit-based system. Canada does that. They \nare very happy with that. I think about 60 percent of their people do \nso. The more education you have, the more job skills you have, the more \nfluency you have in the language, you get more points.\n  Under this merit-based system, it has about 15 percent of the people \ncovered by it in a point system. The fact that your brother is here is \nequal to 10 points. If you have a 4-year college degree, that is only \nequal to 5 points. It takes a master's degree to get 10 points, equal \nto the family connection points. So the point system is still heavily \nskewed to things other than actual job skills, education level, and the \nability to be productive and flourish in our society.\n  We want to bring people to our country who are going to be able to \nflourish, do well, be able to find a job, and not be unemployed or the \nonly skill they have is one that Americans are applying for in big \nnumbers and they would take a job from an American, unemploying an \nAmerican. So we have to create a system that serves the national \ninterest and identifies the kind of workers the country needs and we \ncan absorb as a part of the over 1 million or so people we admit each \nyear lawfully into America.\n  That makes sense to me. Also, the guest worker programs are \nexceedingly complex. There are W programs, there are E programs. There \nare different kinds of programs throughout this whole bill. The net \nresult, the number of people who come not to be permanent citizens, not \nto be immigrants, but come as guest workers will double under this \nlegislation. That makes it harder for the legal immigrant who is new in \nAmerica trying to find work to get a job. They are having to compete \nwith the guest workers. So those are the kinds of things we need to be \nthinking about as we go forward.\n  I wish to express my appreciation to the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley. He has been a student of \nthis problem since 1986. He has shared with us his perspective on it. \nHe has a deep conviction that if we go through this process again, it \nneeds to be done in a way that we can be proud of a few years later, \nnot be embarrassed about as we were after 1986.\n  So we would create a system that allows a lawful flow to occur but \nstops the illegal flow in the future. That is the problem I think this \nlegislation has, among others.\n  Senator Grassley, thank you for your efforts. Good work. I have \nenjoyed working with you and Senator Leahy, who conducted a tough \nseries of hearings. He let us have votes. We got a lot of votes in the \nJudiciary Committee. He asked if anybody else had another amendment \nwhen we finished. We got it done. That has not happened on the floor \ntoday. We have only had nine votes, and three of those were motions to \ntable very important amendments that deserved more consideration than \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n[[Page S5353]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I would like to make an inquiry about \ntime. We were supposed to start the last 20 minutes. Is it OK if I \nstart now with my final remarks?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, my colleagues have often heard me \nspeak of my opposition to the legislation that is before us. They have \nnot heard me speak about my opposition to immigration reform. As I have \nsaid so many times on this floor and in committee, or even to the \npress, I have not heard a single Senator say the existing system status \nquo ought to be maintained.\n  There are a lot of opinions about what should be done. So as we have \nseen over the last few weeks, immigration is an emotional issue that \nengenders strong feelings on both sides of the aisle. Saying it for a \nsecond time: Everyone wants reform, but everyone has their own ideas \nand different solutions.\n  Coming into the debate, I think my position has been very clear. I \nmade it very clear because I have the experience of the 1986 \nlegislation. That was legislation legalizing; it did not solve the \nproblem. We screwed up in 1986 by not securing the border first, even \nthough we had the intention that would happen. Today, we are right back \nat the same place talking about the same problems, proposing the same \nsolutions. Unfortunately, the process has not allowed us to \nfundamentally improve the bill. We have not been able to vote up or \ndown on commonsense amendments. There has been 550 amendments filed. We \nhave taken up about a dozen.\n\n  Despite the fact that the American people want the border secured \nbefore we provide a path to legalization, there appears to be a \nmajority of this body who believes legalization must come first. Next \nMonday and Tuesday I will be holding 11 townhall meetings in Iowa. I \nknow what I am going to hear from my people: Yeah, we need immigration \nlegislation. But first we need to enforce the laws that are already on \nthe books before you consider anything new.\n  Despite what the Gang of 8 wrote in their framework for immigration \nreform, legalization is not--emphasis upon ``not''--contingent upon our \nsuccess in securing our borders and addressing visa overstays. The bill \nwill not ensure that a future Congress is not back 25 years from now \ndealing with the very same problems. We need a bill that insures \nresults. We need a bill that puts security before legalization, not the \nother way around.\n  We are a nation based upon the rule of law. We have a right to \nprotect our sovereignty and a duty to protect the homeland. Any border \nsecurity measures we pass must be real and, more importantly, be \nimmediate, not 10 years down the road.\n  We also need meaningful interior enforcement, including allowing \nimmigration officers to do their job and work with State and local \nofficials. Enforcement of the immigration laws has been lax and \nincreasingly selective in the last few years because Federal \nimmigration enforcement officers have been handicapped from doing their \njob.\n  The States have tried to step in, but every time the States tried to \nstep in under the 10th Amendment to protect their citizens when the \nFederal Government would not do it, they have been denied the \nopportunity to control their own borders. The unfortunate reality is \nthe bill does almost nothing to strengthen interior enforcement \nefforts. It does nothing to encourage cooperation between Federal, \nState, and local governments.\n  The Federal Government will continue to look the other way--look the \nother way as millions of new people enter this country undocumented. \nMeanwhile, the bill gives the States no new authority to act when the \nFederal Government refuses. One of the major reasons immigration is a \nsubject of significant public interest is the failure of the Federal \nGovernment to enforce existing laws. Some 11 million people have \nunlawfully entered the country or overstayed their visas because the \nFederal Government did not deter them or take action to remove them. \nThe bill subsequently weakens current criminal laws and will hinder the \nability of law enforcement to protect Americans from criminal \nundocumented aliens.\n  In addition to weakening current law, the bill does very little to \ndeter criminal behavior in the future. It ignores sanctuary cities and \nincreases the threshold required for action of what constitutes a \ncrime. Regrettably, the bill is weak on foreign national criminal \nstreet gang members, an amendment that I tried to offer, but we could \nnot get the other side to vote on whether gang members ought to be \ndenied benefits in this immigration law.\n  Furthermore, the bill falls short in protecting American workers who \nneed and want jobs in this country. While I support allowing businesses \nto bring in foreign workers, they should only do so when qualified \nAmericans are not available. I have long argued that we must enhance \nand expand opportunities for people who wish to work legally in the \ncountry. Yet as we do that, we cannot forget the American worker. We \nneed to fight for them as well.\n  Finally, I empathize with people who come into this country to have a \nbetter life. We are proud of our country. Those of us born here do not \nappreciate how great this country is. When I talk at a naturalization \nceremony in my State, I tell the new citizens: You are new here. You \ncame from another land where you know things are a lot different than \nthey are here. When you hear Americans bellyaching about our great \ncountry, I hope you will tell these Americans who were born here--\nincluding this American--that this is the best country in the world, \nand how it is different in your own country and that you came here for \na better life.\n  We are a compassionate people, and we are also the best country in \nthe world. We are a great country because we have always abided by the \nrule of law. The rule of law is what makes opportunities that we have \npossible.\n  I am going to vote against this bill today. That is no surprise to \nanybody. I have hopes for a better product to come out of a conference \ncommittee. I hope for a bill to go to the President of the United \nStates. My hope is that we will send a bill to the President that will \nmake America stronger, make our borders more secure, and make our \nimmigration system more effective. This is what Americans deserve and \nwhat we have a responsibility to deliver.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I am informing all Senators that if they are not in their \nseats when the time arrives, we are going to have a live quorum. We are \ngoing to have everybody here when the vote starts. I know people are \nanxious to leave, but they better be here or I am going to have a live \nquorum and it will take a lot of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, if I may have the attention of the \nSenator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator from Iowa yield for 5 minutes?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield to the Senator for 6\\1/2\\ minutes. As far as I \nknow, nobody on my side wants the time, and the Senator may have the \ntime.\n  Once again, I wish to thank everybody who maybe hasn't heard me say \nit. The Senator had a fair and open process in our committee. There \nwasn't a single Member who didn't get a chance to offer amendments. \nThis is the way the process ought to work, and the chairman made it \nwork that way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Senator for his comments. He \nalso deserves credit. We worked very closely together on this schedule \nand everything else to make sure all people were heard, as the Senate \ncompletes its work on this historic legislation, I want to recognize \nSenators and staff members who were instrumental to our effort.\n  Senator Durbin, who has championed the DREAM Act for many years, \ndeserves special recognition. I commend him as the Senate approves his \nhard-fought effort that is included in this bill. Senator Durbin has \nhelped to bring these compelling stories out of the shadows. He has \nbeen dedicated to the young people who will be helped by his \nlegislation, like Gaby Pacheco. These brave and patriotic DREAMers have \ninspired all of us who support the bill's passage.\n\n[[Page S5354]]\n\n  Senator Schumer's tenacity and commitment to this effort should be \ncommended. He worked hard to build bipartisan support and was \nrelentless in his advocacy for passage. Senator Menendez fought hard to \nprotect the principles that make this legislation something we can be \nproud of. Senator Bennett and Senator Feinstein were committed to our \nagreement between agricultural workers and employers that is fair and \nthat will help America's farmers and farm workers.\n  Senator McCain, Senator Flake, Senator Graham, and Senator Rubio \nbravely led the Republican Senators throughout this process. I \nappreciate that their leadership has been a challenge in their caucus. \nI thank Senator McConnell for his advice as the Judiciary Committee \nprepared to consider this legislation.\n  And I thank Senator Whitehouse, Senator Coons, Senator Blumenthal, \nSenator Klobuchar, and Senator Franken for their work in the Judiciary \nCommittee and for their amendments to make this legislation better. I \nespecially thank Senator Hirono for her personal efforts and \ndetermination to make sure that the interests of women and families \nwere protected in this legislation. All of these Senators deserve \nrecognition for their dedication.\n  The work of the Senate could not be successful without the staff \nmembers who work behind the scenes. The work of our staff is especially \nimportant when the Senate considers legislation of the magnitude that \nwe have completed today. I take a few moments to recognize the many \nstaff members who contributed to this legislation.\n  I want to recognize and give my thanks to Bruce Cohen and Kristine \nLucius. My former Chief Counsel and Staff Director Bruce Cohen, who is \nwell known to many Senators, has been at my side for nearly 20 years. \nThough Bruce is leaving the Senate, his mark is on this legislation and \nhe leaves his mark on the Senate Judiciary Committee after years of \nservice. His dedication to the Senate, to the people of Vermont, and \nthe United States has been of the highest caliber and he will be \nmissed.\n  Kristine Lucius, who has so ably and seamlessly taken over as my \nChief Counsel and Staff Director on the Judiciary Committee has proven \nherself many times over during the Judiciary Committee's markup of this \nlegislation, and through the Senate's debate of this legislation. \nWithout her leadership, instincts, and intellect, our Committee process \nwould not have been the example of democracy that it was. Both Bruce \nand Kristine deserve my deepest gratitude.\n  My Chief of Staff, JP Dowd and my Legislative Director Erica Chabot \nwere central to this process. In addition to leading my office, JP \nguided my entire staff with a steady hand as we considered this \nlegislation. And in addition to coordinating the legislative work of my \noffice, Erica made great contributions to the process this legislation \nfollowed through the Committee. Erica's work was only interrupted by \nthe arrival of a baby boy on June 21st.\n  I thank Adrienne Wojciechowski, Tom Berry, Susan Sussman, Diane \nDerby, and John Tracy for relating this complex bill to Vermont \npriorities. Their outreach to Vermont farmers, business owners, law \nenforcement officials, and Vermonters impacted by our broken \nimmigration system was crucial to my priorities in this bill.\n  And our work in the Committee could not have been conducted without \nthe incredible efforts of our Chief Clerk Roslyne Turner, Deputy Clerk \nTheresa Reuss, Hearing Clerk Melanie Kartzmer, and former Hearing Clerk \nHalley Ross, all of whom make our committee run at the highest \nstandard.\n  And I thank Brian Hockin, who keeps the Committee's technology \nrunning and provided real-time updates during our five Committee \nmarkups by posting amendments online as they were modified. I give them \nmy thanks and appreciation for their role in making the Judiciary \nCommittee so productive and transparent.\n  I want to thank my staff members who worked long and hard on this \nlegislation. My Judiciary Committee counsels Matt Virkstis, John Amaya, \nChris Leopold, Alexandra Reeve-Givens, Josh Hsu, April Carson, Emily \nLivingston, Lara Flint, and Anya McMurray all committed themselves to \nthis process with professionalism and dedication to advancing this \nimportant legislation. My team of lawyers carefully negotiated, \nreviewed, and drafted thousands of pages of amendments. They worked \nacross the aisle to create consensus and improve our proposal.\n  I thank the Committee's Legislative Staff Assistants Emma Van \nSusteren, Charles Smith, Kelsey Kobelt, and Clark Flynt for their \ncommitment and passion to making this process run smoothly. And I thank \nmy Communications Director David Carle and my Judiciary Committee Press \nSecretary Jessica Brady for helping to make our process a transparent \none and to tell the story of the Senate's consideration of this \nlegislation.\n  The staff members of Senators in the group of eight who serve on the \nJudiciary Committee deserve recognition. Joe Zogby, Mara Silver, Leon \nFresco, Stephanie Martz, Chandler Morse, Elizabeth Taylor, and Sergio \nSarkany served the Senate well.\n  I want to recognize the staff of the Judiciary Committee's Ranking \nMember Senator Grassley, Kolan Davis and Kathy Nuebel. They served \nSenator Grassley and the Senate with weeks of tireless effort to make \nour committee process a productive one. I thank Ranking Member Grassley \nfor his cooperation during the Committee's consideration of this \nlegislation.\n  The floor staff that keep the Senate running deserve special \nrecognition and thanks. The Democratic Secretary Gary Myrick, Assistant \nSecretary Tim Mitchell, and Reema Dodin serve the Senate admirably and \ntheir assistance to Senators is indispensable. The Majority Leader's \nstaff members Bill Dauster and Serena Hoy lent their broad experience \nand expertise to this process. I thank them all.\n  I thank the members of President Obama's staff who provided \ninvaluable technical expertise and assistance to the Senate. My former \nChief of Staff, Ed Pagano, along with Miguel Rodriguez, led a \ntremendous effort in the Senate for the President. The President's \nDirector of the White House Policy Council Cecilia Munoz and her team, \nFelicia Escobar and Tyler Moran were instrumental in this effort.\n  And I want to especially thank Esther Olavarria. Esther served \nSenator Kennedy for many years on the Judiciary Committee, and has lent \nher intellect, her vast knowledge of immigration law, and her genuine \nsense of humanity to previous efforts in the Senate. I know Senator \nKennedy would be very proud of her service to the President.\n  Finally, I want to recognize the tremendous work done by the Office \nof the Senate Legislative Counsel. They are the attorneys who serve the \nUnited States Senate to turn ideas into legislative text. I especially \nthank Matt McGhie and Stephanie Easley who moved mountains to meet the \nrequests from Senate offices to draft this legislation. I thank them \nand all of the attorneys and staff in that office who serve all \nSenators with tremendous professionalism and skill.\n  Many other staff members in the Senate contributed to this effort in \nways that will be largely unheralded by the public. But it is important \nto recognize the role that the dedicated men and women who serve \nSenators play in doing the business of the American people. Their work \nbehind the scenes on this historic bill allowed Members to agree in \nprinciple and make their compromise a meaningful reality.\n  I am proud of the Senate's work today and I thank everyone who made \nthis process a successful one.\n  Our American story is a story of immigration. It is not only our \nhistory, it is our future. Over the last few weeks, many of us have \nspoken about our own families' immigration stories. We all have such \nstories. I heard the distinguished Democratic whip, Senator Durbin, \nspeak of the very moving story of his family and also what he has done \nwith DREAMers. We have talked about our parents and grandparents \nseeking better lives for us. We can all relate to the most compelling, \ninnate urge to sacrifice for the ones we love.\n  We are inspired by our forebears who wished better lives for us and \nfor themselves, and found those opportunities here in America. They \ntaught us the fundamental values of family, hard work, and fairness. \nWith this legislation, we honor those American values.\n\n[[Page S5355]]\n\nWe honor their search for freedom, for prosperity, and for the promise \nthat America has held out to so many for so long.\n  I am proud to be a Member of the Senate. Today is a good day for the \nSenate, and, more importantly, it is a good day for the country. Today, \nwith the help of many Senators, we will address a complex problem that \nis hurting our families, stifling our economy, and threatening our \nsecurity.\n  Several months ago four Democrats and four Republicans began \nnegotiating and drafting immigration reform legislation. They produced \na carefully balanced, fair, and humane proposal that at its core is \nintended to make meaningful improvements to border security and, most \nimportantly, will help millions of people who dream the same dreams our \nancestors did.\n  I am proud of the role the Judiciary Committee has played in this \nprocess, and I thank the Senators of both parties who have praised that \nrole.\n  In late April, with the full participation of all 18 members of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, with unprecedented transparency, and with \nfairness to all members in offering amendments and having the chance to \ndebate them, we held several public markups to consider that \nlegislation. Over 37 hours during the course of 3 weeks, we engaged in \nvigorous debate in full view of the American public. We considered 212 \namendments from Democrats and Republicans. We approved 136 amendments \nin a room filled with spectators on both sides of the issue. Of the \namendments approved in committee, 47 were Republican amendments and all \nbut three were adopted with bipartisan support. Even the staunchest \nopponents of this legislation have praised that fairness.\n  The world has never seen such a vibrant, cohesive, economically \nexuberant, and democratically successful experiment as our country. \nEvery one of us as Americans should be proud of that.\n  A key ingredient of our successful formula has been and will continue \nto be immigrants anxious to be part of the American experience. They \nhave helped us to be a Nation in constant renewal, welcoming and using \nthis constant influx of fresh talent and energy. Just as my \ngrandparents and my wife Marcelle's parents made Vermont and America \nbetter, they have made us better.\n  Today is another historic day in the Senate. The Senate will soon \ncomplete its work on remedies for a difficult and complex set of issues \nthat has eluded us for years. We passed immigration reform legislation \nin 2006 under the leadership of the distinguished Presiding Officer's \npredecessor, Senator Ted Kennedy. After the Senate's work, the House of \nRepresentatives declined to take up the Senate bill. I hope that won't \nhappen again. This issue is far too important to ignore or to allow it \nto languish. We shouldn't play politics with what is quintessentially \nan American issue.\n  At this moment I would like to think my dear friend Senator Kennedy \nis smiling down on this Chamber. He sat right over there. He would be \noverjoyed to see us pass this legislation on an issue he cared about so \ndeeply. I would like to think our old friend would be proud of what we \nare doing.\n  In a very few minutes the Senate will vote to pass a comprehensive \nsolution to our broken immigration system. It will reunite families. It \nwill bring millions of people out of the shadows and into our legal \nsystem. It will spur job growth and reduce our deficit. It will make us \nsafer.\n  I would urge all Senators to join with us to ensure a bright future \nfor this great Nation we all love by passing comprehensive immigration \nreform. In doing so, you make us an even greater Nation than we are.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. I yield time to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I appreciate both leaders for giving \nsome time for this.\n  Several of us have been working all week on a package of amendments \nthat were bipartisan and cleared by both Senator Grassley's and Senator \nHatch's staff. We appreciate their work so much. We are, unfortunately, \nnot able to get unanimous consent. We tried. I thank them very much for \ntheir effort. They stuck with us all the way to the end.\n  Hopefully this bill will begin to build a bipartisan coalition of \nSenators who wish to truly solve problems for our country. Our \ncoalition that worked on this is both people for and against the bill. \nWe were not able to get it cleared. We are not discouraged and will \ncontinue to work.\n  I thank Senator Hatch and Senator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Mr. Leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are here today to talk about people, not \npages of legislation. This bill represents human beings, real people--\nyes, immigrants. I am going to talk about two of them today.\n  Over 20 years ago Astrid Silva crossed the Rio Grande River in a \nrubber raft wearing a ruffled dress and patent leather shoes. She was 4 \nyears old. She was a baby. She doesn't remember Mexico, the country \nwhere she was born. She does remember the day she left Mexico. She \ncried. She cried because the only thing she could take with her was her \nbaptismal cross and a doll. Her mother cried because although the river \nwas narrow, she knew the current was swift and dangerous--very \ndangerous. Mother and daughter survived, ducked under a border fence, \nand began their new lives in America.\n  A decade passed before Astrid realized she had come to America \nillegally, without proper immigration papers. Her parents cautiously, \nslowly explained this to their daughter.\n  Astrid's eighth grade class was going to leave Las Vegas and take a \ntrip back here to the Nation's Capital. Astrid couldn't go. She didn't \ngo. Her parents were afraid to let her travel for fear she would be \narrested. She was undocumented. Flying, you see, without \nproper identification meant running the risk of being detained or \ndeported.\n\n  A few years later, when Astrid's friends learned to drive, Astrid \nonce again was separated from her friends. She couldn't learn to drive. \nShe didn't have even the right to study for the driver's test because \nshe wasn't eligible.\n  When Astrid's classmates headed off to school across the country, she \nstayed home. She couldn't leave, so she went to school at a local \ncommunity college.\n  Astrid has accepted every challenge, every setback with grace, \nknowing the obstacles would never outweigh the advantages of growing up \nin the United States, her home.\n  Four years ago Astrid's grandmother died. Neither Astrid nor her \nfather could go to Mexico because her dad was also undocumented. They \nweren't able to go to the funeral. If she left the United States, she \ncouldn't come back. She couldn't come back to the only country she had \never called home.\n  Then there came a time, and it came slowly, very cautiously, but \nfinally Astrid knew it was time to raise her voice. In effect, she had \nhad enough. It was time for her to come out of the shadows and share \nher story with her friends and with others. A lot of her friends were \njust like her, and she could share the stories with them and they could \nshare the stories with each other. It was time for her, her classmates \nin many instances, and her community to learn who Astrid Silva really \nwas. She spoke up. She told her story.\n  She decided to find a public place where I would be at a public event \nand give me the first of many heartfelt letters. I only have a few of \nthem. A few of them didn't make it to my office, but I appreciate each \nand every one of those letters. Astrid became, very quickly, a DREAMer.\n  One of the letters I remember so well. She said in the letter words \nto this effect: I have never, ever as much as stolen even a piece of \ngum, but I feel like a criminal even though I am not a criminal. I \nappreciate every one of those letters she sent me because each was a \nreminder of what is at stake in this debate--a debate that involves our \nneighbors, friends, and, yes, relatives. Each note, each letter \nindicates that to me.\n\n  This bipartisan legislation the Senate is poised to pass in just a \nfew minutes does not just secure our borders or just mend our broken \nlegal immigration system; this legislation is what\n\n[[Page S5356]]\n\nAstrid has advocated, what the DREAMers and others have advocated. This \nlegislation is what she and millions have hoped for and, yes, prayed \nfor. The bill paves the way for people just like Astrid--people who are \nAmerican in all but paperwork--to become full participants in our great \nsociety. It acknowledges the contributions of generations of immigrants \nwho founded this country and built it into the superpower it is today, \nimmigrants such as a man named Israel Goldfarb. He left Russia. He was \nJewish, and he was being persecuted, he and his family, so he came to \nAmerica as a boy. This man was my wife's dad.\n  I often think of him for a lot of reasons. He died as a real young \nman. Perhaps a lot of people think he didn't contribute much to our \nsociety, but he had one child, my wonderful wife, and now we have 16 \ngrandchildren. So he contributed that--5 children, 16 grandchildren. On \nhis deathbed--as I said as a young man--he gave me his ring. I have \nworn this ring for those many years. I take it off at night and put it \non every day. This watch I have--it stopped running a couple of months \nago and the jeweler said: It is broken. It is worn out. It is 50 years \nold. It is an old-fashioned watch. I have to wind it every morning, but \nthey fixed it. I got the watch back and it is good for another 50 \nyears. I could buy a different watch, but I am not one to buy a \ndifferent watch. These are who I am and they remind me every day of \nthis man who came to America as Israel Goldfarb and, similar to all of \nhis family, changed his name to Earl Gould. My wife, when I met her as \na sophomore in high school, was Landra Gould.\n  So this bipartisan legislation we are poised to pass in just a little \nwhile does not just secure our borders or just mend our broken legal \nsystem; this legislation that has been advocated paves the way for \npeople such as Astrid and, frankly, people such as my father-in-law, \nmay he rest in peace. It acknowledges the contributions of generations \nof immigrants who founded this country.\n  This historic legislation recognizes that today's immigrants came for \nthe right reason--the same reason generations before them, the same as \nIsrael Goldfarb--to achieve a dream we take for granted, a right to \nlive in a land that is free.\n  Ted Kennedy said it best:\n\n       From Jamestown, to the pilgrims, to the Irish, to today's \n     workers, people have come to this country in search of \n     opportunity. They have sought nothing more than a chance to \n     work hard and bring a better life to themselves and their \n     families. They came to our country with their hearts and \n     minds full of hope.\n\n  That is what Ted Kennedy said, and the bipartisan legislation before \nthe Senate respects and fulfills that hope--the hope and the prayers of \nAstrid and millions just like her. It will help 11 million people who \nare tired of looking over their shoulders and fearing deportation to \nget right with the law and start down a pathway to citizenship.\n  That path is going to be very hard, with penalties, fines, work, \npaying taxes, staying out of trouble, and learning English, but they \nare willing to do that, every one of them. It will mean going to the \nback of the line. It is tough, I repeat, but it is fair.\n  Above all, this legislation is very practical. It makes unprecedented \ninvestments in our borders. It cracks down on crooked employers, such \nas those Senator McCain talked about earlier today, that exploit and \nabuse immigrant workers, and it reforms our legal immigration system.\n  This legislation will be good for America's national security as well \nas its economic security. This will reduce the deficit by $1 trillion. \nHow is that for economic security.\n  Six years ago, the last time we considered a sweeping immigration \noverhaul--led by Senator McCain and, yes, that good man who became \nSecretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar--it didn't work. The prospects \nfor a bipartisan solution were very dim. On the last day, the \nimmigration bill fell because of a procedural roadblock. But Ted \nKennedy urged those of us who believed deeply in its cause to keep the \nfaith. Here is what he said.\n\n       We will be back and we will prevail. . . . America always \n     finds a way to solve its problems, expand its frontiers, and \n     move closer to its ideals. It is not always easy, but it is \n     the American way.\n\n  That is what Ted Kennedy said.\n  Because of the Gang of 8--these courageous Senators, four Democrats \nand four Republicans; Schumer, Durbin, Menendez and, of course, the \nquiet one who did so much, Senator Bennet, and John McCain, whom I \nadmire so much. He and I came to the Congress together more than 31 \nyears ago. We came to the Senate together. Have we fought with each \nother? Oh, yes. But we care a great deal about each other. John McCain, \nno matter what happens, I will be his friend and he will be my friend. \nI admire what he has done. He was truly a leader, as he has been for so \nlong in this country.\n  Lindsey Graham. He is up for reelection. Is this a badge of courage? \nIt sure is. Marco Rubio, Jeff Flake, I admire every one of them. I am \nnot going to forget about Bob Corker. I am not going to forget about \nmentioning Governor Hoeven. They allowed us to get votes. I will always \nadmire these two, again, courageous men who stepped forward, stepped \nout of the crowd and did something that was right.\n  They are wonderful, all of them. Senator Kennedy knew the day would \ncome when a group of Senators, divided by party but united by a love of \ncountry, would see the fight to the finish, and that is what we did. \nThat is what these 10 men allowed us to do.\n  I am not going to ever forget about the man seated right behind me, \nSenator Leahy. His markup will go down in history. It was why we are \nhere today. He is my friend. As always, I will always admire how he \nhandles everything he does but especially what he did on this bill.\n  So today is the day. While I am sad Senator Kennedy isn't here to see \nhistory made, I know he is looking at us proudly and loudly. Remember \nthat voice? And he is not alone. I have no doubt my father-in-law is \nhere in spirit. Astrid Silva is here today. I am sure she is in the \ngallery someplace, and she will be looking down from where she is \nseated when the Senate votes to expand this country's frontiers and \nmove closer to its ideals.\n  But she is not here alone. She is here representing millions of \nothers just like her--people who have hoped and prayed for this day. \nTheir prayers have been answered. But these prayers--their hopes and \nprayers--have not gotten us to the finish line yet. The finish line is \nvery close to here, down this very long hallway to the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  In closing, I am reminded of a poem, a song. Here is what it says:\n\n       I can see a new day, a new day soon to be, when the storm \n     clouds are all past and the sun shines on a world that is \n     free. I can see a new man, a new man standing tall, with his \n     head high and his heart proud and afraid of nothing at all. I \n     can see a new day, a new day soon to be, when the storm \n     clouds are all past and the sun shines on a world that is \n     free.\n\n  Colleagues, I am confident the House of Representatives will pass \nthis legislation because I can see a new man, a new man standing tall \nwith his head high, his heart proud, and afraid of nothing at all.\n  The bill (S. 744), as amended, was ordered to a third reading and was \nread the third time.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.\n  Before the Chair announces the vote, expressions of approval or \ndisapproval are not permitted in the Senate.\n  The result was announced--yeas 68, nays 32, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 168 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--68\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Baldwin\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Blumenthal\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chiesa\n     Collins\n     Coons\n     Corker\n     Cowan\n     Donnelly\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Flake\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Graham\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Heinrich\n     Heitkamp\n     Heller\n     Hirono\n     Hoeven\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kaine\n     King\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Manchin\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murphy\n     Murray\n     Nelson\n\n[[Page S5357]]\n\n\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Rubio\n     Sanders\n     Schatz\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Warren\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--32\n\n     Barrasso\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Cruz\n     Enzi\n     Fischer\n     Grassley\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Lee\n     McConnell\n     Moran\n     Paul\n     Portman\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Scott\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n  The bill (S. 744), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 744\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

STATEMENT OF CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The passage of this Act recognizes that the primary \n     tenets of its success depend on securing the sovereignty of \n     the United States of America and establishing a coherent and \n     just system for integrating those who seek to join American \n     society.\n       (2) We have a right, and duty, to maintain and secure our \n     borders, and to keep our country safe and prosperous. As a \n     Nation founded, built and sustained by immigrants we also \n     have a responsibility to harness the power of that tradition \n     in a balanced way that secures a more prosperous future for \n     America.\n       (3) We have always welcomed newcomers to the United States \n     and will continue to do so. But in order to qualify for the \n     honor and privilege of eventual citizenship, our laws must be \n     followed. The world depends on America to be strong--\n     economically, militarily and ethically. The establishment of \n     a stable, just, and efficient immigration system only \n     supports those goals. As a Nation, we have the right and \n     responsibility to make our borders safe, to establish clear \n     and just rules for seeking citizenship, to control the flow \n     of legal immigration, and to eliminate illegal immigration, \n     which in some cases has become a threat to our national \n     security.\n       (4) All parts of this Act are premised on the right and \n     need of the United States to achieve these goals, and to \n     protect its borders and maintain its sovereignty.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, let me thank the Republican leader for \ncooperating. We are attempting to move forward legislation with respect \nto student loans. We will shortly reach July 1. At that point, the \nstudent loan rate for subsidized Stafford loans doubles from 3.4 \npercent to 6.8 percent. The legislation I propose would be a 1-year \nextension of the 3.4-percent rate, allowing students, low- and middle-\nincome students to continue to benefit from a low interest rate.\n  Our core principles in advancing this 1-year extension of present law \nare that we believe--and I think this is shared by all of my \ncolleagues--that talented students deserve access to a college \neducation. They need affordable loans and Pell grants and other \nfinancial aid. We also believe interest rates should not be set any \nhigher than necessary to protect the taxpayer and break even on the \nprogram; that it should not be a profit center for the Federal \nGovernment as it is today.\n  We also believe very strongly that when students take these loans \nout, particularly the subsidized loans, they deserve predictability. \nThey should know how much they will have to repay. So if you are going \nto go for an adjustable rate, there has to be a reasonable cap. In \nfact, my understanding is in the history of the Federal Student Loan \nProgram there has either been an adjustable rate with a cap or a fixed \nrate. We have never left students solely at the mercy of the market.\n  We provide subsidized loans to students because we believe we have to \ninvest in Americans, in their talent, in their ability not only to \nadvance their own lives but also to contribute to the greater life of \nAmerica. It should not be a program that is designed to generate \nrevenue. The reality is today, wittingly or unwittingly, this program, \nand indeed as would be true for the proposals that have been put on the \ntable, is generating huge amounts of profits to the Federal \nGovernment--it has been estimated more than $50 billion this year. We \nshould be investing in the potential of young Americans, not looking at \nthem as profit centers to help us reduce the deficit.\n  I know there have been great efforts on the part of my colleagues, \nsincere efforts, thoughtful efforts by many--my colleagues Senator \nAlexander, Senator Manchin, Senator King, Senator Harkin--chairman of \nthe committee--Senator Warren, Senator Hagan, Senator Franken, Senator \nStabenow--to come to a long-term solution. There has been a great \neffort, but we are not there yet.\n  I think we need, frankly, at least one more year so we can sit down \nand do this correctly. If you look at the proposals that are out there, \nthere is a short-run attractiveness because the rates have been \nconfigured so they look pretty low. But if you follow the rates out, \nwithin 3 or 4 years they are above the statute, the law that goes into \neffect on July 1. They are above the 6.8-percent rate. It is almost as \nif we are looking back a few years ago--not about student loans but \nabout mortgages. There were a lot of people sitting on 5-percent fixed-\nrate mortgages and someone walked in and said: Have I got a deal for \nyou. I can give you 2 years at 3 percent. It goes up, but don't worry \nbecause you can readjust it down the road and refinance it.\n  We found out because of many circumstances, come 2008-2009, there was \nno getting out. In fact, a lot of people discovered they would have \nbeen better off sticking with the fixed loan.\n  That is an analogy. That is not exactly on point. But if you look at \nall of these proposals, the arc of the increase in interest rates is \ngoing up. And, by the way, it has not fully incorporated what the \nFederal Reserve has already said publicly. Chairman Bernanke said it \nvery clearly, that they are ending quantitative easing. That means one \nthing: Interest rates go up, and they might go up a lot faster than we \neven expect right now.\n  I think another important point which is critical is that the \nproposals we have seen so far have not had a cap on them, an adequate \ncap. There has been some discussion we do not need a cap because if you \nconsolidate a loan there is a cap built into the consolidation program. \nFirst of all, there is a problem with that in that except for the \nsubsidized Stafford loans, the other federally supported loans start \naccruing interest even while you are still in school so you are \nbuilding up a big mountain of debt. When you consolidate, what you are \ndoing, essentially, is stretching out the payments, making a longer \nterm which adds more interest. It is like the difference between a \nshort-term loan and a long-term loan. You end up paying a lot more \ninterest on your house than you do on a 2- or 3-year loan on your car.\n  For many reasons, both technical and otherwise, we believe, \nparticularly as we are several days from July 1, we need to go ahead \nand give this body the time to deliberate. Frankly, we just passed a \nhistoric piece of legislation. That was not done in the waning hours of \nthe session. It was not done without hearings. It was not done without \na lot of back and forth. It was not done without a lot of tension on \nthe floor. Yet we are proposing fundamental changes to our Federal \nStudent Loan Program in the waning hours before a recess.\n  Mr. President, 36 Democrats and counting have joined me and Senator \nHagan to extend this lending rate for 1 more year.\n  We have in the past been able to come together. In fact, we adopted \nthe 3.4-percent interest rate, fixed rate, in 2007. The vote in this \nSenate was 79 to 12, Republicans and Democrats saying: A good deal for \nstudents, a low interest rate.\n\n  I think we still have to look for a much better deal than has been \nsuggested by some of the proposals. Our proposal for a one-year \nextension is also fiscally responsible because we are offsetting the \ncost of roughly about $4.2 billion by closing a tax loophole--which I \nthink should be closed on its own face, but it would allow us to pay \nfor this extension for 1 year. I will remind my colleagues that a year \nago we did precisely the same kind of thing.\n  Some would say we have not used the year well enough. But if you \nthink about the debate we had on background checks and firearms; if you \nthink about this historic debate on immigration; if you think about \nmany of the other serious debates we have had, I think we have been \nengaged on this floor decisively. But now it is time, again, to move to \nthis education issue and give it the full consideration students and \nfamilies deserve.\n  I am disappointed. I am sure my colleagues who are suggesting \nalternative proposals are disappointed. But I am most disappointed we \ncannot at least tell students today: We have your back. You are going \nto be safe for another year, with your loans at 3.4-percent interest. \nAnd during that time, we have to fix this--and not just simply changing \naround interest rates but addressing how to help borrowers pay down the \ndebt that is outstanding. It is a huge problem, a trillion dollar \nproblem. What about the incentives for lowering the costs of college? \nWhat about other structural changes we have to make? They will unlikely \nbe made if we somehow sort of leave here with a ``fix'' that \nultimately, in a very short period of time, raises rates beyond the 6.8 \npercent and also takes off the pressure, legitimate pressure for us not \njust to treat one part of the problem but comprehensively deal with the \nissue of the cost of higher education for families.\n  With that, I have been asked to propose a unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/27/senate-section/article/S5476-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5476-S5477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REED.

Mr. President, if I may respond to my dear friend from \nRhode Island for whom I have the utmost respect. We have a respectful \ndifference as far as how to approach this problem and we are working \nthrough it. We really, truly, are working and we will work through it.\n  We had a charge a year ago to fix it, so we started working on that. \nThe President in a timely fashion gave us a piece of legislation that \nhad a longer term fix, 10 years. We took that and worked off that \noriginal proposal given to us by the administration, by the President, \nand we started working in a bipartisan manner to make this work.\n  With that being said, we looked at the 3.4 percent and I would say a \nmajority of our Senate colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, did \nnot understand that the 3.4 percent only affected those that were \nsubsidized loans. That is the smallest amount of loans we have out \nthere. I think the majority of our colleagues, the majority of the \npeople, the majority of the press thought we fixed it at 3.4 percent \nfor everybody who had a student loan. That was not the case.\n  We wanted to go back and make sure if we do something we do it for \neverybody, because the person who has income limits and qualified for \nthe subsidized loan, the first year they get that loan it is $2,500; \nthe second year it is $3,500; the third year it is $4,500; and the \nfourth year it is $5,500. That is the maximum they can borrow. So you \nknow what. They borrow the nonsubsidized. Guess what they have been \npaying for the nonsubsidized: 6.8. Guess what students have been paying \nfor what we call the PLUS loans. They have been paying 7.9. But we are \nnot hearing anything about that.\n  Put it in perspective as dollars. If we have a 1-year extension, as \nmy dear colleagues have suggested, to try to fix the problem again, \nthat will be about a $2 billion savings of interest payments that would \nbe put on the backs of students. That is a tremendous amount of money.\n\n  Guess what happens if we pass our bipartisan proposal. It saves $8.8 \nbillion, and everybody participates. Even the subsidized loan for the \nstudent who struggled the hardest and needs most of the help, they get \nmost of the help. Not only do they get help on their subsidized loan, \nbut they get help on their unsubsidized loan. We have looked at \neverything possible. We have a piece of legislation which we think not \nonly fixes but basically repairs a broken system.\n  When we look at where we are today and we look at sequestering--and I \nhave been here not quite 3 years--I have watched us kick the can down \nthe street to where my toe is hurting. We kicked this can so much, my \ntoe is hurting, and it is starting to kick back.\n  We need to start giving the people of this great country the \nconfidence that we can work in a functional and respectful way. \nDemocrats, Republicans, and Independents need to come together and put \nour country first, put our students first, and stop playing politics.\n  We agreed--Democrats and Republicans--on this bipartisan bill that \nnot $1 should go to debt reduction. We do not believe the students \ntrying to get an education to better and improve their quality of life, \ntheir economic condition, and the economic condition of our great \ncountry should have to be burdened with reducing the debt of this \nNation. They can do that by being productive citizens. We agreed on \nthat. That was something that was not agreed on before because there \nwere people who wanted the surpluses to go to debt reduction.\n  We took out the surpluses and reduced the rate as low as humanly \npossible. It has been scored. We are bringing rates down. If we look at \na top rate of 7.9 percent, that is going to come to 6.21 percent if \nthey have a PLUS loan. If a student has a graduate Stafford loan, that \nis going to go from 6.8 percent to 5.21 percent. All the \nundergraduates--if it is a subsidized loan or a nonsubsidized loan--\nwill go to 3.6 percent, and that is a tremendous savings. That is the \n$8.8 billion, and that is what we are asking for.\n  I respectfully--and I mean that--disagree with my colleagues who have \nsigned on to a 1-year extension believing we are going to be able to \ncome up with an agreement or a compromise that is better than what we \nhave before us. We have worked this out with Senator Carper from \nDelaware, Senator King from Maine, myself from West Virginia, and \nSenator Alexander from Tennessee. Those are four former Governors. We \nknew we had to work together because we had to make things happen \nimmediately. At the end of the year, everything had to balance out. \nSenator Burr and Senator Coburn also contributed, and they understand \nfinancing as well as anybody in this body.\n  I say to all the students who have loans right now: Don't worry. July \n1 will come. We will come back on July 9 or 10, and it will be the \nfirst order of business we will ask to bring up. Both of our bills will \nbe our first order of business.\n  I assure everyone that we will come up with a compromise we can work \nout that will give the relief the students--those who desire an \neducation and want to better their lives will have that opportunity and \nbe able to have stability and not have the increased rate passed on \nbecause we will make this retroactive.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cowan). The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I don't have a great deal to add to Senator \nManchin's comments except to point out that everyone in this body wants \nto do best by our students. Everyone understands the importance of \neducation, everyone understands how expensive it is, and everyone \nunderstands the problem of the debt burden on our students. We are all \ntrying to search for a solution that can garner bipartisan support and \npass the Senate, the House, and go to the President.\n  The proposal we have put forward before the body today is based upon, \nin many ways, the proposal made by the President in his budget. It is \nsimilar to a provision that has already passed the House. I think a \ncouple of points should be made. One point that should be made is there \nis a lot of talk about a floating rate. I think people think of \nmortgages and adjustable rate mortgages where the rate changes from \nyear to year.\n  Under our proposal, once a student takes out a loan in a given year, \nat whatever the rate is that year, that rate is fixed for the life of \nthe loan. The following year, if interest rates--and we are talking \nabout the 10-year Treasury bill of the U.S. Government, one of the \nlowest interest rates there is--go up, then it would go up. That is for \nnext year's loan, not for the loan that has already been taken out.\n  I think we have learned from our current circumstance the folly of \nCongress trying to set interest rates. Setting 6.8 percent and 3.4 \npercent interest rates 5 or 6 years ago looked like a great deal. Today \nit is generating billions of dollars to the Treasury on the backs of \nour students.\n  So I think our solution is a commonsense solution, and that is to \nbase the interest rate for the students at the lowest available rate to \nvirtually anybody in our society, which would be the 10-year Treasury \nbill, plus 1.85 percent, which protects the Treasury from the costs of \nadministering the program and the risks inherent in the program. If we \ndo that, we will have certainty in the program and the lowest interest \nrate that would generally be available in this society.\n  If we started with a blank sheet of paper and said: We want the \nFederal Government to provide loans to students, I believe we would end \nup where this plan has ended up. It is where the President ended up, it \nis where the House has ended up, and I think we have an opportunity. \nThe question is, Should we extend this for 1 year and take more time? I \nam new, but I stood here during the debates on the sequester, where \nboth parties put forward their proposals, neither party got the votes, \nand we ended up with a sequester.\n  We said the exact same thing with student loans about 1 month ago. \nEach party put forward their proposal, neither party got their votes, \nand here we are just about at the deadline and the rates are going to \ndouble for those subsidized Stafford loans.\n  I don't know what we are going to know 1 year from now that we don't\n\n[[Page S5478]]\n\nknow now. I believe the time is now to try to come to a resolution that \nmeets everybody's requirements, and we are not that far apart. The \ndifferences separating us in this body are not that far apart. I \nbelieve we have an opportunity not only to solve this problem fairly to \nour students but to demonstrate to the country that we are able to make \ndecisions and not simply delay them for another 1 or 2 years.\n  That is why I rise to support the bill that Senator Manchin and I, as \nwell as others, including Senator Burr, Senator Alexander--who I think \nis one of the most respected Members of this body, particularly on \neducation matters--and Senator Coburn. We have a strong bill. I think \nas people see the details, understand it better, understand the terms, \nand understand the effects, we will save students in America over the \nnext 3 or 4 years something like $50 billion. If we don't resolve this \nproblem, it will come into the Treasury on the backs of our students. I \ndon't think that is a result we want.\n\n  I think we have a responsible proposal. It is a bipartisan one, and I \nbelieve it deserves full and fair consideration. I am sure all of these \nproposals will have a lot of discussion once we are back in session a \nweek and a half from now, and I hope we can come to a resolution \nbecause the students of America deserve to know two things: that \nCongress has their back on student loans and that their Congress is, in \nfact, able to make decisions, handle issues, and move forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I see that the Senator from New York \nand the Senator from Colorado are on the floor. I don't know if they \nseek recognition. I know this has been a terrific day for them as two \nof the principal architects of the immigration bill we just passed. It \nhas been a landmark achievement.\n  I am prepared to speak for about 15 minutes on my climate bill, so I \nam going to be here for a while. If the Senator from New York would \nprefer to proceed, then I will allow him to proceed. That will also \nallow me to relieve the Presiding Officer who I understand needs to go \nupstairs for a moment.\n  I will yield to Senator Schumer with the hope that upon the \nconclusion of his remarks, I will be recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/27/senate-section/article/S5478-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5478-S5480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from Rhode \nIsland. As usual, he is graceful and thoughtful as well as being an \noutstanding legislator with a great deal of passion. I know he wants to \nspeak on the issue he is ready to speak about, but, again, his grace \nand kindness are always present and I appreciate it.\n  I return to the floor to just say some words of thanks. We had \nlimited time before, so I wanted to speak to the issue. I wish to thank \nsome people.\n  First I thought I would mention how much a dream this comprehensive \nbill has been to so many people. At the top of the list, of course, is \nTed Kennedy, who was one of the greatest human beings I ever met in my \nlife. He had the immigration subcommittee before me. This wouldn't have \nhappened without his guidance and leadership.\n  Did we make changes from what he did? Obviously. But did his basic \nfeeling, structure, and knowledge that it had to be bipartisan all \ncarry forward on this bill? Absolutely. We know Ted is smiling as he is \nlooking down on us today. We know he will continue to inspire not only \nthose of us in the Senate but also the country as we move forward.\n  I wanted to spend a few minutes--and I very much appreciate my \ncolleague from Rhode Island for yielding--to thank my staff. We are \nlucky to have the leadership of Mike Lynch, our chief of staff. We are \na team, and it is an amazing team. Everyone covers each other and \neveryone looks out for each other.\n  Sometimes when I am upset and I say: Who did what, nobody did \nanything wrong. They are all watching each other's back. That is the \nlesson Lynch has taught all of them, and it is a great lesson. We are \nclose-knit. We socialize. We have fun. They truly like each other. This \ncertainly would not have happened without them.\n  Before I talk about my staff, I wish to praise each of my colleagues. \nI have done that repeatedly on the Gang of 8. I mentioned this outside, \nbut I want to mention it on the floor. I can say exactly the same thing \nfor each of the eight in the gang: It would not have happened without \ntheir presence. It was an amazing team. Each contributed something in \nhis own way. Each contributed a great deal in his own way, and at \nimpasses different people rose to the floor and lifted us out of those \nimpasses. It was an amazing group.\n  I am not going to get into each individual right now, but I do want \nto thank the Gang of 8. We have bonded, we have become friends, and we \nhave accomplished something that will hopefully carry forward and \nbecome law.\n  Now I wish to thank my staff. My staff, similar to all Americans, are \nthe children or great-grandchildren or great-great-great-great-great-\ngrandchildren of immigrants. They have shared their stories through \nthis process. I know this was deeply personal for each of them. Every \nweek just about the entire staff got together for an immigration \nmeeting, and everybody contributed.\n  So I wish to take some time to thank them all. They worked so hard to \nfix this system. It was not only a dream of so many in this Senate, it \nwas a dream of theirs. One thing is for sure, without them, we wouldn't \nbe here.\n  In fact, I think everyone in the Gang of 8 grew to respect our staff \njust as we respected their staffs. That is another great thing that \nhappened, the bonding.\n  I want to mention some of the individuals. First, my chief counsel, \nStephanie Martz. She poured her whole heart and soul into the bill. She \nhas young kids who have soccer games. She has a very busy schedule, but \nfor this bill she missed bedtimes due to late-night meetings or \nconference calls. How many times on a Saturday did I talk to her when \nshe was at some athletic event for one of her kids. I could hear the \ncheering and the running up and down in the background.\n  But Stephanie has a unique ability to help build coalitions. When one \ngroup or another was upset--and believe me, that probably happened \nevery 5 minutes in this legislation--there was Stephanie, soothing \nthem, calming them but telling them the truth, so they trusted her. She \nwas an indispensable part of our ability to get this done.\n  Through the rough patches, she never gave up on our team. I know that \nKyle, Nora, and Pip are going to be happy to have mommy back, and maybe \nthere will be another ice hockey tournament in Rochester next year when \nwhatever legislation we are working on then rises to the fore. To the \ngreat genius--and I started referring to him at our meetings as my \nimmigration genius--and he was. The intellectual force, the creative \nforce who propelled this effort was one Leon Fresco, the son of Cuban \nimmigrants from Miami. I think it was about 5 years ago he took this \njob. He was a very successful immigration lawyer, but he took this job \nbecause he wanted to do immigration reform. He has worked on many other \nthings. His creativity has shown its mark in ``Schumerland'' on so many \ndifferent issues, but this was his dream, and he put every atom of his \nbody into this.\n\n  Like me, he is voluble. During our staff meetings we would yell at \neach other, and it became a joke because I once said: Shut up, Leon. So \nJohn McCain greeted him at each meeting: Shut up, Leon. And we all \nloved it. But Leon, your fierce determination, your innate \nintelligence, your deep love of this country, is great. And thanks to \nMama Fresco, Leon's mom, who is so proud of her son. It was great to \nmeet your parents who are immigrants, who are the American dream.\n  The people I spoke about on the floor a few minutes ago are embodied \nin the Frescos. How about Sofie, Leon's wife. Sofie got pregnant during \nall of this, so he wasn't devoting 100 percent of his time to \nimmigration reform, but close to it. And there she was, Sofie, \nindomitable and quiet, doing the job.\n  Our legislative team is a great team--and everyone pitched in to do \nimmigration--led by Heather McHugh. Heather's advice and counsel were \ninvaluable. She communicated with our colleagues. Each one of our staff \nhas great attributes. Heather is always wary of me going a little too \nfar, a little too fast, or a little too quick, and\n\n[[Page S5479]]\n\nshe will come into the office and say: You know, you better think about \nthis. Then I know I have trouble. But, again, she is incredible.\n  Because immigration is so multifaceted, all of our staff contributed, \nincluding Meghan Taira, whom I consider--no offense to all my \ncolleagues--the best health L.A. on the Hill. She helped create the \nACA. But, of course, there were many benefit issues that occurred, and \nthere was Meghan.\n  Anna Taylor, the only person on our staff with a deep southern \nArkansas accent, came from Blanche Lincoln's staff. There were tax \nissues and there she was, solving them all.\n  John Jones was incredible. He stepped up and handled many issues. Dan \nRudofsky and Veronica Duron drafted summaries and talking points and \nspreadsheets.\n  When things got tough, Becca Kelly and Erin Vaughn, each the mother \nof children less than 1, let nothing get in the way of doing this while \nat the same time maintaining focus on their kids and the bill.\n  It might surprise the Presiding Officer to know that I have a very \ngood press team. Brian Fallon, Matt House, Max Young, Meredith Kelly, \nLindsay Dryzak, Marisa Kaufman, and Josh Molofsky learned the substance \nof immigration and spun it into a beautiful web the public could \nunderstand.\n  Our DPCC team, led by Ryan McConaghy, kept policy and press teams \nsinging off the same praise sheet, keeping our caucus up to date.\n  Then, of course, as every one of us, we have great administrative \nstaffers. Al Victor, who came to the office as a young kid from Long \nIsland, as a young helper in the Long Island office, is now my \nunflappable executive assistant. No matter how tough and tense things \nget in our office--and they do--she is just as steady as a rock, \ngetting things done. She and her colleagues, Megan Runyan, Alice James, \nJessica Bonfiglio, Kristin Mollet, Rob Kelly, Ellen Cahill, Claire \nReuschel all kept us administratively going.\n  I mentioned the Members. They are great. I have so much to say about \neach of them. I want to thank Chairman Leahy, who is probably on his \nway back to his beautiful farm in Vermont, for shepherding this bill \nthrough the Judiciary Committee. Everyone has praised his open and \ninclusive process. It is well known.\n  I want to thank Bruce Cohen. This is the capstone of his career. We \nall know how important he is to the Judiciary Committee. His big shoes \nwere ably and elegantly filled by Kristine Lucius as chief council. But \nJ.P. Dowd and Matt Virkstis, John Amaya, Lara Flint, Alex Givens, Chris \nLeopold, and Anya McMurray all did a great job.\n  As most people know around here, Harry Reid is one of my best friends \nin the world, and his unwavering support and confidence that we could \nget this done was essential. He had the great staff who lent constant \nhelp to us: David Krone, Bill Dauster, Serena Hoy, Kate Leone, Bruce \nKing, and Angela Arboleda all did a great job.\n  The staffs of the other Members, I wish to mention a few of them \nalso. I hope they are listening: Kerri Talbot, Darissa Wilhite, and \nMolly Groom of Senator Menendez's staff; Joe Zogby, Mara Silver, and \nVaishalee Yeldandi with Senator Durbin; Jonathon Davidson and Sergio \nGonzales who work with Senator Bennet. So many staffers.\n  As I said, we got to know each other very well, through all the \nmeetings. We had a lot of disagreements and tough arguments. We all \nstuck together. And Senator Feinstein's team--Senator Feinstein put \nthat agriculture section together. Amazing. The growers and the farm \nworkers are for this bill. That is because of the great leadership of \nSenator Feinstein. Chris Thompson, Neil Quinter, and Kim Alton all did \na great job there.\n  We worked as closely in this endeavor with the Republican staffs as \nwell as the Democratic staffs, and I owe them a great deal of thanks: \nCesar Conda, Sally Canfield, Enrique Gonzalez--let me pay him a \ncompliment. He was sort of the equivalent--not quite, in my opinion, \nbut close to the equivalent--of Leon Fresco on the Republican side. \nAlso, John Baselice, Senator Rubio's staff; Mark Delich and Katherine \nZill with Senator McCain; Matt Rimkunas, Sergio Sarkany, and David \nGlaccum with Senator Graham.\n  When we had our meetings, all of these staffers were there.\n  Chandler Morse, at first he was giving Senator Flake some tough \nadvice, and just as Senator McCain would talk about Leon, I would talk \nabout Chandler. I now owe him a dinner.\n  I said: Chandler, I am taking you out to dinner if this bill passes \nthe Senate. Pick your restaurant. Don't make it too expensive.\n  And Elizabeth Taylor, who also works with Senator Flake. Then the \ngreat floor staff: Gary Myrick and Tim and Trish and Meredith and \nTequia, Dan, Brad, Stephanie--they run the place like clockwork, as \nrecently as today when there were more requests for time and people had \nto go home at 4 o'clock.\n  Emma Fulkerson of Senator Murray's staff; Reema and MJ on Senator \nDurbin's staff who did a great job, and, frankly, Dave Schiappa and the \nRepublican floor staff as well.\n  We got a lot of help from the Senate appropriations, finance, and \nbudget committees, and I thank them.\n  I also want to thank the rest of my staff in New York and in DC. They \nare the wind beneath our wings. If we didn't feel good and safe in New \nYork, we couldn't take the risks we do here Washington, and they make \nthat possible. So I thank them all.\n\n  Finally, Leon, always making sure everything goes exactly right. So I \nwant to thank the legislative counsel staff who worked 24/7 to turn \nthese legislative ideas into the 1,000-page bill, as has been remarked \nabout over and over, and it needed that many pages because it was so \ncomplicated. But they did a great job as well.\n  So, once again, to my staff, from Mike Lynch all the way through, I \nthink, as every Member probably thinks, I have the best staff on the \nHill. It is certainly the best staff I have ever had in 39 years as a \nlegislator. Without them, we couldn't do it.\n  So tonight we are going to celebrate the going away and the ascension \nof one of our old-time staffers, and we will all have a great time \ntogether. But I am blessed. I am blessed to have a family, my wife and \ndaughters who put up with me through thick and thin. I am blessed to \nhave two other families, my Senate colleagues, who I do regard as my \nfamily, and my staff, who I also regard as my family. So though I am \nnot Irish, I have a big, big, big family, and they are the greatest, \nall three.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. I thank the Senator from \nRhode Island for his graciousness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I believe under the pending order I \nhave the floor, but I wish to yield to the Senator from Illinois for a \nfew minutes. Then I ask to be recognized at the conclusion of his \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island, and \nI thank the Presiding Officer. I wish to join my colleague, Senator \nSchumer, first thanking him for his leadership and bringing us \ntogether. With Senator McCain, they led the eight-Senator effort to put \ntogether this comprehensive immigration bill which was enacted by the \nSenate today by a vote of 68 to 32. Many thanks go around.\n  I have acknowledged the other Senators who are part of that gang, but \nI wanted to give special recognition to four of my staffers who worked \novertime and did an extraordinary effort to put this bill together: \nFirst and foremost, Joe Zogby, my chief counsel on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. He was there at the creation of the DREAM Act, and he has \nbeen with me ever since, some 12 years of dedicated effort to pass this \nlegislation on the floor of the Senate, and we did it today. It never \nwould have happened if Joe hadn't devoted so much energy and talent \ninto making this day possible. I also will tell my colleagues that his \nname is well known among those who are DREAMers. So many times Joe has \nsaved them from deportation when they were just minutes or days away \nfrom that happening. He has a heart of gold and a great mind, and I am \nlucky to have him.\n  Mara Silver, an extraordinary lawyer who took on aspects of this bill \nthat were tough, including refugee and asylee sections that have \nvirtually no constituency. There are sections of the\n\n[[Page S5480]]\n\nlaw that affect some of the most downtrodden people on Earth who face \noppression in other countries. She came to it with the heart of a lion \nand came through with some provisions that will give many of these \nasylees and refugees their chance to prove they need help and deserve \nhelp in the United States.\n  And Vaishalee Yeldandi and Stephanie Trifone, who sat through meeting \nafter weary meeting putting together the provisions we needed to work \nout. I can't say enough for the staff people when they do this type of \nOlympic and heroic effort, as under this comprehensive immigration \nreform. I am fortunate to have an exceptional staff both in the State \nand back in Washington.\n  Those four deserve special recognition today for the extraordinary \njob they did.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I hate to interrupt the Senator. Would the \nSenator be willing to yield for 2 minutes so I can thank some people on \nthe immigration bill? I promise I will take no more than 2 minutes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, let me respond to the distinguished \nSenator. The answer is yes. I also see our distinguished chairman of \nthe Finance Committee and his ranking member on the floor. I understand \nthey have a colloquy they wish to engage in. Do they have an estimate \nas to how long they wish to engage in that colloquy?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, might I ask the Senator from Rhode Island \nhow much time he wishes to speak?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I have about 15 minutes. What I propose to do--I do \nnot know how long the Senators wish to take. What I propose to do is \nyield to Senator Graham for such time as he may need.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Two minutes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. And then----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am fine. I think we should wait, let the \nSenator from Rhode Island proceed with his statement, and if the \nSenator from South Carolina wants to go ahead----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. OK. That is fine.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Whatever the two Senators work out, great.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I yield the floor to Senator Graham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/27/senate-section/article/S5480-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, to all my Senate colleagues, today was a \ngood day, a historic day for the Senate. Thank you all, whether you \nopposed or supported the bill. It was a great debate.\n  To the staff, this bill could have died a thousand times. You would \nnot let it.\n  To Matt Rimkunas, you are awesome. Sergio Sarkany and David Glaccum \nof my staff, thank you for endless hours of work below minimum wage.\n  Mark Delich, in Senator McCain's office, thank you for working for \nSenator McCain. Your reward will be in Heaven.\n  Chandler Morse, you are awesome working for Senator Jeff Flake.\n  Enrique Gonzalez, you are one of the smartest people I have ever met. \nJon Baselice, Senator Marco Rubio was a game changer.\n  Leon Fresco was the star of the show. Stephanie Martz, you kept Leon \nand Senator Schumer from killing each other. Well done.\n  Joe Zogby, thank you for being a strong voice.\n  Kerri Talbot, for Senator Bob Menendez, you always reminded us we are \ndealing with people.\n  And to Sergio Gonzalez, in Senator Michael Bennet's office, you all \nwere an incredible calming force.\n  To Senator Hatch, you came into the debate at a time when we needed a \nlift. Orrin Hatch, I want to thank you profusely for jumping into the \ndebate, adding to the momentum that was created by the so-called Gang \nof 8. You provided momentum in committee. It meant a lot.\n  To Kelly Ayotte, you jumped on board at a time when people were \ntalking about what was bad with the bill. You came out to give us a No. \n5, along with Senator Hatch, to give it momentum. That was an act of \ntremendous political courage and you did the country a service by \nstanding up and standing out at a time when it was tough.\n  To Senators Hoeven and Corker, you put us over the top. I have never \nenjoyed working with two people more. But Senator Bob Corker and \nSenator John Hoeven, your efforts to come up with a new amendment, \nalong with Senator Hatch and Senator Ayotte, really made the \ndifference.\n  I wanted to recognize these people--that they came along at a time \nwhen America needed them--and this bill is the result of the hard work \nof many people at the staff level, but key Senators who were not in the \noriginal bipartisan group came to the aid of the cause at a time we \nneeded it.\n  I will yield.\n  Thank you very much for allowing me to say these words.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it has been an extraordinary day in \nthe Senate. It shows the kind of progress that can be made even on \nbedeviling issues when persistence and optimism are brought to bear. I \nhope my continued efforts on climate change will ultimately produce, \nwith the same persistence and optimism, the same success we have seen \ntoday on immigration.\n  This is the 37th time that I will have come to the floor to urge my \ncolleagues to wake up to the threats we face from climate change, to \nwake up and stop hiding behind the distortions that are spread by the \nfossil fuel interests, and to start heeding the warnings of scientists, \nof economists, of insurers, of businesses, of national security \nofficials, of religious leaders. They all say something needs to be \ndone, and fast, to stave off the harm of carbon pollution.\n  For the first time in this speech, I can say that something at last \nis being done. This Tuesday President Obama laid out a national plan to \nreduce carbon pollution and to prepare our country for the effects of \nclimate change. His plan is a bold one, and it is going to challenge \nthe status quo. Most importantly, the administration will regulate \ngreenhouse gas emissions from new and existing powerplants. If we are \ngoing to be serious, we need to strike at the heart of the problem, and \nregulating these big powerplants is the best first step.\n  And let's face it, until now these big polluters were getting a free \nride. They were harming all of us with their emissions and paying no \nprice for it.\n  Carbon-driven climate change hurts our economy, damages our \ninfrastructure, and harms our public health. Economists call this price \nwe all pay the ``social cost of carbon'' because it represents the cost \nthat polluting corporations offload onto the rest of us, onto the rest \nof society.\n  Earlier this month the Obama administration revised its estimate of \nthe social cost of carbon to $36 per ton of carbon dioxide emitted. \nThis new estimate better captures the true harm of carbon pollution to \nour oceans, to our farmland, to ourselves, and I commend the President \nfor strengthening our economic assessment of climate change.\n  The administration's measure still falls short of some experts' \ncalculations, however, such as the comprehensive review that prompted \nfar-reaching climate change legislation in the United Kingdom. I think \nour estimate should be still higher to accurately reflect the costs of \nclimate change, and I think the best way to address the mounting social \ncost of carbon is a carbon fee.\n  If we start charging these corporations a fee, based on the social \ncost of their carbon pollution, that will factor those costs into their \nbusiness models, and that is economics 101.\n  A carbon fee, in other words, makes the market work properly by \nputting the costs of carbon pollution into the price of the product, \ninstead of letting\n\n[[Page S5481]]\n\nthe big polluters freeload on the general public.\n  It is a simple choice. Do we want the American people--children and \nseniors, small business owners and homeowners--to pay the price of \ncarbon pollution or do we want to have the corporations behind that \npollution take responsibility for the harm, to balance the energy \nmarkets, and to encourage American clean energy technologies?\n  We are already hearing the familiar refrains of the deniers, the \nskeptics, and the big polluters, trying to scare us into protecting the \nstatus quo. A carbon fee ``slows down our ability to compete,'' claimed \none of my Republican colleagues. ``The cost of nearly everything built \nin America would go up,'' declared another.\n  The Speaker of the House warned that if we put a price on carbon--and \nI quote--``the United States economy would suffer, millions of family-\nwage jobs would be lost, and American consumers would incur \ndramatically-higher prices for energy and consumer goods--all without \nany significant environmental benefit whatsoever.''\n  These are scary predictions, but are they true?\n  Actually, the World Wildlife Fund and the Carbon Disclosure Project \nfound that investments to reduce carbon pollution yield greater \nfinancial returns for companies than do their overall capital \ninvestments.\n  So never mind the huge environmental benefits. Cutting back on \ngreenhouse gas emissions by 3 percent each year would save U.S. \nbusinesses up to $190 billion a year by 2020 or $780 billion over 10 \nyears. That supports American leadership in new clean energy \ntechnologies, powering our economy. So it should overall be good for \nbusiness.\n  What about American families? The nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates a carbon fee starting at around $28 per ton of carbon \ndioxide emitted--which is within the price range recommended by \neconomists--would result in a 2.5-percent increase in costs for the \nlowest income households, and a 0.7-percent increase for the richest \nones. It is higher for low-income families because they are likely to \nspend more of their budget on home heating, on gas, and on other \nenergy.\n  What the carbon fee fearmongers overlook is the substantial revenue \ngenerated by a carbon fee. According to CBO, a fee starting at $20 per \nton would raise $1.2 trillion over the first 10 years. That revenue \ndoes not just disappear.\n  When Senator Schatz, Congressman Waxman, Congressman Blumenauer, and \nI put forward a carbon fee discussion draft earlier this year, we left \nthe use of the proceeds from the fee open for discussion. We want to \nwork with other Members--particularly with those on the Finance \nCommittee, whose leadership I see here--to find a use for the revenue \nto put that revenue to work for the American people and to propel the \neconomy. Every penny of that carbon fee revenue could go back to the \nAmerican people.\n  There are a lot of ways to do this, so let's consider a few examples. \nWe should start by setting aside about $140 billion--or 12 percent of \nthe total--to help lower income households pay for their 2.5-percent \ncost increase. That would leave us with more than $1 trillion to send \nback to people in other ways. That is a lot of money, even by \nWashington standards, and it can do big things.\n  For starters, $1 trillion every 10 years would go a long way toward \nreducing the national debt. Listening to some of the apocalyptic \nlanguage used by Republicans about our national debt, you would think \nthey might be interested in this.\n  What are some of the other ways we could return those carbon \nrevenues? Well, you could send out checks directly to the American \npeople for about $900 per household or $360 per citizen every year. I \nknow there are plenty of families in Rhode Island who could use an \nextra $900 a year, and these dividends would go right back into the \neconomy because those families would spend it quickly. Or we could give \nseniors a raise. According to the Census Bureau, as many as one in \nseven Americans over 65 lives in poverty. In 2010 and 2011, seniors saw \nno Social Security cost-of-living adjustments, even though their costs \nfor food and medicine and heating oil continued to rise. With the \nrevenues from a carbon fee, we could raise the average benefit by \n$1,600 a year or $130 a month. Last year that would have been an 11-\npercent raise for every senior. Imagine that. And seniors living on \nfixed incomes tend to spend every dollar they get, so this money too \nwould come right back into the economy.\n  What about students? The outstanding government-backed student loan \ndebt in the country rose to a record $958 billion last year. With $1 \ntrillion in carbon fee revenues, we could forgive all the Federal \nstudent loan debt American families are now carrying--boom, done, gone. \nOr we could cut every student's and graduate's debt in half, saving \nAmericans $45 billion a year in loan payments next year alone, and \ndouble the maximum Pell grant from $5,500 to a little over $11,000, and \nstill have money left over to permanently set the rate on subsidized \ngovernment loans for undergraduates at 3.4 percent. That is the rate \ncurrently set to double next month if Congress does not act.\n  Or we could use the $1 trillion to lower the top corporate tax rate \nfrom 35 percent to 28 percent. That reduction was Mitt Romney's \ncorporate tax goal, and we could do it, without adding a dime to the \ndeficit. That is why Republicans such as George Schultz, Art Laffer, \none of the architects of President Reagan's economic plan, and others \nhave expressed support for a revenue-neutral carbon fee.\n  I have highlighted these four proposals to show we could do big \nthings with a carbon fee. These proposals, or some combination of them, \nor other ideas, are all possibilities opened by carbon fee legislation. \nShouldn't we have that discussion? Wouldn't that be better and more \nhonest and more productive than trotting out the tired tall tales of \nclimate denial, better than pretending it is a hoax?\n  President Obama has defined the growing menace of climate change as \n``the global threat of our time.'' It is. It is this challenge by which \nour generation will be judged. The grownups know it, NASA and NOAA and \nall the major American scientific organizations, the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff and our military leaders, a who's who of America's top corporate \nleadership, the property casualty and insurance industry, the \nConference of Catholic Bishops--the list goes on.\n  It is time for us to wake up and meet our solemn responsibility to \nour country and to its leadership role in the world, and we can do so \nin a way that allows us to do big things that will help the American \npeople.\n  As the President said, that is our job. That is our task. We have to \nget to work.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee and his \nranking member for their courtesy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The philosopher Bertrand Russell said, ``The greatest \nchallenge to any thinker is stating a problem in a way that will allow \na solution.''\n\n[[Page S5482]]\n\n  I come to the floor today with my good friend Senator Orrin Hatch to \nstate our concerns about a national problem that is holding back our \neconomy. We are here to call on our colleagues to provide ideas that \nwill allow a solution.\n  First, the problem. America's Tax Code is complex, it is inefficient, \nand it is acting as a brake on our economy. Senator Hatch and I believe \nit is in need of a serious overhaul. It has been close to three decades \nsince the last major revision to the Tax Code. In that time Congress \nhas made about 15,000 changes to the Tax Code. The Code now contains \nnearly 4 million words. Here it is, right here. The Tax Code. This is \nAmerica's Tax Code, all 24 pounds of it. Paperback. Think how heavy it \nwould be for hard cover. It would take more than 18 days nonstop to \nread the Tax Code. In fact, it takes the average taxpayer 13 hours to \ngather and compile the receipts and forms to comply with the code. It \ncosts Americans $160 billion a year to comply with the code, let alone \nthe taxes Americans pay. This complexity in the code is eroding \nconfidence in our economy and creating uncertainty for America's \nfamilies and businesses.\n  Clearly, the Tax Code is broken. That is the problem. It is a serious \none. The solution calls for a more simple, more fair Tax Code, one that \nwill allow the economy to grow and to create jobs. For the past few \nyears, Senator Hatch and I have been working closely with all of the \nmembers of the Senate Finance Committee to reach that goal of \ncomprehensive tax reform. We have held more than 30 hearings. We have \nheard from hundreds of experts about how tax reform can simplify the \nsystem for families, help businesses innovate, and make the United \nStates more competitive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to thank my friend from Montana for \nall the hard work he has done with regard to the Senate Finance \nCommittee and of course the tax problems we have in this country. He \nhas been truly dedicated to reforming our Nation's Tax Code and truly \ndedicated to doing it in a bipartisan manner, which is something I very \nmuch appreciate.\n  Our work together is starting to pay off. Tax reform is building \nmomentum. Over the past 3 months we have issued 10 bipartisan options \npapers that detail reform proposals in every area of the Tax Code. The \nfull committee has met on a weekly basis to discuss these options. We \nhave made tremendous progress. We are now entering the home stretch, \nall of this under the leadership of Senator Baucus.\n  Senator Baucus and I are here today to call on all of our \ncolleagues--all of our colleagues--in the Senate to now provide their \ninput to help us get tax reform over the finish line. We have a \nhistoric opportunity to do tax reform this Congress, to make the code \nsimpler and fairer for the people we serve.\n  We are determined to make it happen, but we need every Member's \nparticipation. In order to make sure we end up with a simpler, more \nefficient, and fairer Tax Code, we believe it is important to start \nwith a blank slate, a Tax Code without all of the special provisions in \nthe form of exclusions, deductions, credits, and other tax preferences \nthat some refer to as tax expenditures.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I might say this blank slate is not, of \ncourse, the end of the discussion. You do not clear the decks and stop. \nSome of the provisions in the code obviously serve very important \nobjectives. That is why they made it there in the first place. Some we \nwill need to keep, clearly. Why? To make sure the Tax Code is at least \nas progressive after tax reform as it is today.\n  I want to emphasize this approach is just a starting point. It is not \na proposal. This is a good, fair, balanced way, a good-faith way, of \nincluding all Members of the Senate to get started. We believe it is \ngoing to lead to a solution, kind of the way Bertrand Russell \nsuggested: You have to state the problem the way that it is going to \nlead to a solution. We think this is a good way to get to that \nsolution.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we both believe some existing tax \nexpenditures should be preserved in some form, but the Tax Code is also \nlittered with preferences for special interests. To make sure we clear \nout all of the unproductive provisions and simplify the Tax Code, we \nplan to operate from an assumption that all special provisions are out \nunless there is clear evidence that they, No. 1, help grow the economy; \nNo. 2, help make the Tax Code fairer; and, No. 3, effectively promote \nother important policy objectives.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Now that we have a blank slate, we are asking all \nSenators; that is, all Senators, Senators on the committee, Senators \noff the committee--to submit detailed legislative proposals; that is \ntax expenditures, the credits, the deductions, exclusions, which they \nthink should be added back that meet the test for growth and for jobs, \nas well as any other provisions Senators might have in mind that they \nthink should be added or repealed, that they think make sense or other \nreforms they think make sense.\n  In order to help guide our colleagues' submissions, we have released \nsome rough estimates the Joint Committee on Taxation and our staffs \nhave been working on. These estimates show how much the rates would \nrise, for example, if we add back tax expenditures and keep the current \nlevel of progressivity compared to a blank slate.\n\n  We put this out today. Why? Because we wanted everybody to know there \nis a tradeoff involved; that is, when you keep tax expenditures, there \nis going to be an increase in rates, certainly compared with what \notherwise we start with. The more tax expenditures there are, the less \nrevenue there is for a rate reduction and deficit reduction, and the \nmore complicated our Tax Code will end up being.\n  Mr. HATCH. We are giving Senators 1 month to send us their \nsubmissions. We will give preference to bipartisan proposals. This \ninput will make up the foundation of the committee's tax reform \nproposal. We want to ensure the bipartisan bill we introduce has broad \ninput and buy-in from across the Senate. We cannot let comprehensive \ntax reform get bogged down in politics. Only a bipartisan bill can \nbecome law.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. We also need to remember, this is not just about tax \nexpenditures. There is much more to it than confining our discussion to \ntax expenditures, because at its core tax reform means making the Tax \nCode more fair, easier to deal with for families all across our \ncountry. There are a lot of loopholes, on the other hand, in the code \nwe should get rid of. People who can afford fancy tax advisers should \nnot be able to take advantage of loopholes regular Americans do not \nhave available to them. As chairman and ranking member of the \ncommittee, we are determined to complete tax reform this Congress. We \ncannot afford to be complacent. Improving the Tax Code provides a great \nopportunity to spark economic growth, to create jobs, and make U.S. \nbusinesses more competitive.\n  I might add at this point, other countries are modernizing their \ncodes. We are going to be left in the dust if we do not modernize ours. \nWe need to hear from our colleagues as to what provisions they think \nwill help us reach those goals.\n  I have a great partner in this mission, my good friend Senator Hatch. \nI will keep communicating and working with the administration and the \nSenate leadership as we move forward.\n  Working together we can get this done. I believe strongly that \nnothing of consequence ever happens around here if one person tries to \naccomplish something alone on his or her behalf; rather, matters of \nconsequence are accomplished when people work together. We clearly want \na matter of consequence to pass here. We will do so by working \ntogether.\n  Mr. HATCH. It is a privilege to work with Senator Baucus, our \nchairman, on improving the Tax Code, on updating it for the 21st \ncentury. This provides a great opportunity to give families certainty, \nspark economic growth, create jobs, and make U.S. businesses more \ncompetitive. If it is done right, it can provide America with a real \nshot in the arm.\n  My friend from Montana began this discussion with a quote. I feel it \nonly appropriate to conclude with one as well. Abraham Lincoln said, \n``Determine the thing that can and shall be done, and then we shall \nfind the way.''\n  We are determined to craft a fairer and simpler Tax Code. Working \ntogether, I think we can find a way.\n  I want to compliment the distinguished Senator from Montana for the\n\n[[Page S5483]]\n\nwork he has already done, for the work the committee has already done, \nthe hearings we have held, the meetings we have held on these options \npapers, and for his general zeal in leading the charge here on this \nquestion of shall we or shall we not reform our Tax Code.\n  If you look at that stack of Tax Code books that stood this high, you \nrealize it is time to simplify this doggone mess. I think we can do it, \nbut it is going to take a bipartisan effort. It is going to take all of \nus working closely. It is going to take everybody on the Finance \nCommittee doing what it takes to bring tax reform alive.\n  In 1986, it took 3 years to get the 1986 bill done. I do not think we \nhave 3 years. I think we are going to have to do it now or it will not \nbe done.\n  I want to personally express my admiration and friendship to the \ndistinguished Senator from Montana. I intend to help him every step of \nthe way.\n  I believe we have a tremendous contingent of Senators on the Finance \nCommittee, as good as any time that committee has been staffed in the \nhistory of the Finance Committee. The Senators we have there are all \nsolid. They are all fully embracing this in the sense of trying to come \nup with the very best reform we can.\n  I have to say we have the best staff that committee has ever had as \nwell. That is saying something, because it has always had great staff. \nThe Finance Committee has always been one of the greatest committees in \nthe Congress, as it should be. I have to say, under the leadership of \nthe distinguished Senator from Montana, it is no exception this time. \nWe have great people on the staff. We intend to see if we can get this \ndone.\n  I want to thank my colleague for his great work.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank Senator Hatch. It is mutual.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/27/senate-section/article/S5483-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5483-S5484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      STUDENT LOAN INTEREST RATES\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I rise to congratulate all of these people who worked \nso hard on immigration reform. I think it was a tremendous success for \nthis Senate to address an issue that has long been outstanding in this \ncountry and to come to a resolution that received such strong \nbipartisan support.\n  Despite that success one of the things we were not able to do is \naddress what is going to happen with student loans which, without any \naction by Congress, we know that subsidized direct student loans will \nincrease on July 1 from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent.\n  There are a number of proposals currently on the table. There are \nnegotiations underway, and I think all of that is positive.\n  As we think about the challenge our young people face, it is \nimportant we think about getting rid of obstacles that prevent them \nfrom going on to college and from getting degrees in higher education.\n  Last month I had the privilege to speak at the commencement ceremony \nat Keene State College, one of New Hampshire's great public colleges. \nThe students were celebrating their graduation. They were eager to put \ntheir education to work and find meaningful employment. Their optimism, \ntheir sense of hope, and their enthusiasm to make a difference was \npalpable.\n  As I looked out across the audience that afternoon, I knew that a \nnumber of those students, probably up to 66 percent, according to \nnational statistics, had borrowed money to get their degree. These \nstudents and their families viewed higher education as so important \nthat they were willing to take on significant loans to get that degree. \nIt made sense for these students, particularly since recent studies \nhave shown that higher education is one of the key factors driving \nupward mobility in the United States.\n  Earlier this year the Pew Foundation's Economic Mobility Project \nshowed that even during the most recent economic downturn, a 4-year \ncollege degree provided protection in the labor market for recent \ncollege graduates.\n  Making college affordable for our students is essential to growing \nthis country's economy, it is essential to creating jobs, it is \nessential to protecting the middle class, and it is essential to \nproviding those future opportunities for our young people.\n  On the one hand we know we have to make higher education more \naffordable and available to our young people. Yet on the other hand, \nover the last 30 years, tuition and fees have increased 167 percent at \nprivate 4-year colleges and 257 percent at public 4-year colleges. If \nwe adjust that for inflation, that means tuition has increased faster \nthan the cost of gasoline, health care, and other consumer items.\n  As we are thinking about how to deal with these student loan interest \nrates, it is important that we provide some protection for our \nstudents. If we don't, we are going to price middle-class families out \nof a higher education.\n  In my State of New Hampshire the student loan debate is especially \ncritical. Last year, and for several years before that, New Hampshire \nhad the highest average student loan college debt in the country at a \nlittle over $31,000 per student. Not only do we have the highest \naverage loan debt, we also have the second highest percentage of \nstudents with debt in the country.\n  As I listen to these young people, I know the high cost of student \nloans is financially crippling. We have heard from some of those \nstudents who talk about the challenge they face as the result of the \ncost of their student loans.\n  Julianne from Gilmanton wrote ``her education is crushing her.'' She \nearned a master's degree, she works for a New Hampshire State agency, \nand is an adjunct faculty member at two local colleges. To finance her \neducation, one that she thought and people told her would guarantee a \njob after graduation, Julianne took out more than $220,000 in loans. \nLast year alone she paid over $13,000 on those student loans. She can't \nbuy a house. She can't secure credit. Even though she makes a \nrespectable income, she says she can't pursue being an active member of \nthe community because she has those student loans hanging over her \nhead.\n  Lauren Beaudin is another young person we have heard from. She \ngraduated from West High School in Manchester a couple of years ago, \nand she received an undergraduate degree in biology. Her degree is in \none of the STEM subjects, one of the things that is so important to \nthis country. When she graduated she looked at her job options. After \nconsidering some entry-level jobs that paid $25,000 to $30,000, she \ndecided she needed to go on and get a master's degree, which would \nprovide her better opportunities.\n  She is now 22, enrolled in a master's of biology program, and has \naccumulated already over $100,000 in loans. She is concerned about \nstruggling to find a job.\n  She writes:\n\n       I am not alone. This an entire generation of my peers in \n     this country who did the same. We followed our dreams and \n     earned our degrees because this is America, and you can be \n     what you want to be, as long as you work hard. We have worked \n     so hard. We will keep working hard. But will it be enough? \n     What will it be like for our kids when we are still burdened \n     by our loans after we start families and they [our kids] want \n     to go to colleges with even higher tuition and borrowing \n     rates?\n\n  Recently, I had a chance to speak with Barbara Ruth Layne, who is the \nexecutive director of Financial Aid at Granite State College, one of \nour other public colleges in New Hampshire.\n  Last year alone Barbara and her colleagues helped students access $9 \nmillion in Federal loans, significant help for students who want to get \nthat advanced degree and need financial help to do that. Barbara is \nquick to point out that the number of students helped and the amount of \nfinancial aid they have received doesn't illustrate the human cost \nthose loans take on a student.\n  To illustrate the point, she told me the story of a student who lives \nin the North Country of New Hampshire. The student is 35, and she has \ntwo young children. She struggles to make ends meet. She gets child \nsupport sometimes, and she supplements that income with food stamps. \nShe visits the local food pantry. Her children get clothing from the \nlocal church. In the winter she gets some fuel assistance, not enough, \nbecause we have had to cut the fuel assistance program, so she borrows \nmoney from her family to use a kerosene heater on cold nights to heat \nher home.\n\n  This student understands that education is her only way out, the only\n\n[[Page S5484]]\n\nway she can break the cycle of poverty. She met with counselors at \nGranite State College and developed an educational plan. Although she \nis being careful in borrowing, the debt she is going to graduate with \nis more than she has ever earned in her working years in 1 year. While \nher education is going to prepare her for the job market, she knows the \npayoff isn't immediate. She will continue to struggle to make the \npayments on those student loans and to care for her family.\n  With a budget such as she is dealing with, any additional cost of \nthose student loans is going to impact this woman and her family.\n  Similar to so many of us I have been moved by these students who have \nworked so hard to achieve their education goals and the jobs of their \ndreams. They recognize education is an investment and higher education \nis the path to middle-class success and economic opportunity.\n  I think higher education is one of the best investments we can make \nin our country. It is important not just to those young people who are \ngetting those degrees to give them the jobs that make them prosperous \nin the future that they are going to be able to support families on, \nbut it is critical for America to compete in the global economy. We \nshould be doing everything we can to make America a magnet for jobs, to \nensure our workers have the skills they need to compete, and to help \nAmericans get ahead.\n  We have to do everything we can to make sure we keep higher education \naffordable for our young people. We must address those costs and not \ntry to balance the costs of higher education on the backs of our \nstudents.\n  I am hopeful we will continue to work on how we address the student \nloan interest rate, that we will be able to come to some agreement on \nhow to do that in a way that is not going to cost our young people \ntheir futures, is not going to cost America its future, and is not \ngoing to price families out of the cost of higher education.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNET. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/27/senate-section/article/S5484-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THANKING SENATOR COWAN\n\n  Mr. BENNET.

In the vein of thank-yous, I wanted to come down after \nthis historic day, passing this historic bill, to say some thank-yous. \nI have already thanked my colleagues in the Gang of 8 and the other \nSenators who worked so hard on this bill, and there will be a time to \ndo that on another occasion.\n  Sometimes people have asked me during the course of my checkered \ncareer: How did you get to do this? Why did they let you do this? How \ndid somebody with no apparent skill or aptitude for public education, \nfor example, get to run the Denver Public Schools, one of the most \ncherished things I have ever done.\n  My answer has always been the same, which is the key is to find a \nbunch of people who are better at doing their job than you would ever \nbe at doing their job. Assemble them, organize them around a project, a \nchallenge or an obstacle and let them do their thing.\n  The Presiding Officer spoke eloquently about this yesterday when he \nthanked his personal staff and the Senate staff on his way back to \nMassachusetts.\n  I ask unanimous consent to submit the list of staff for the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record , as follows:\n\n       Staff Thank Yous:\n       Senator McCain: Mark Delich;\n       Senator Durbin: Joe Zogby, and Mara Silver;\n       Senator Graham: Matt Rimkunas;\n       Senator Menendez: Kerri Talbot, and Molly Groom;\n       Senator Flake: Chandler Morse\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Of all the staff in the Senators' offices who worked on \nthis bill, I will take further time tonight to mention a few names. \nFirst, I thank people on my staff, Rachel Velasquez and Stefanie \nAarthun, who did amazing work, both of them, over many months on this \nbill and not only here. Also, we worked on the Colorado Compact in the \nState of Colorado. This was what enabled us to be part of this \nconversation.\n  I have thought throughout this process how important the work was \nthat we did in Colorado in preparation for this moment, to get to this \nmoment. It simply would have been impossible to succeed at producing \nwhat we call the Colorado Compact, composed of six principles. They \nwere so bipartisan that when we had the press conference, the person \nwho came to read the first of these principles was actually my \nRepublican opponent in the 2010 Senate race, Ken Buck. I want to thank \nhim for that and the others who were part of the compact.\n\n  I especially thank my deputy chief of staff, Sarah Hughes, who did an \namazing job of pulling everybody together. She has been with me longer \nthan anybody on my staff. Nothing I could have accomplished in the jobs \nI have had before and certainly not in this instance could I have done \nwithout Sarah Hughes.\n  The same goes for Jon Davidson, who is my chief of staff and who is a \nmodel for what a chief of staff in the Senate should be--or anywhere \nelse, for that matter, but particularly here, where the pressures can \nbe so extraordinary. His ability to attract an incredibly talented team \nof people who work on all kinds of issues, from immigration, to health \ncare, to education, is incredibly important in the constituent service \nwe do both here and in Colorado. Simply none of it would have happened \nif somehow I hadn't been lucky enough to hire Jonathan Davidson, who \nhas been around this place, actually, as a young person, for a very \nlong time, having been, among other things, Paul Sarbanes' chief of \nstaff when he was the chair of the Banking Committee.\n  By my side both before I came to the Senate and in the Senate on this \nissue has been Sergio Gonzales, who has worked tirelessly. \n``Tirelessly'' doesn't even capture it--24 hours a day, 7 days a week, \nit has felt like. He certainly looks that way. He won't appreciate my \nsaying that, but it is true, and people who know Sergio will know what \nI am talking about. He has done an amazing job with a sense of humor \nand has served not just me during this but the entire Gang of 8, and we \nwill be forever grateful.\n  There were many times during this process that I have thought about \nSergio's grandfather and his grandmother. His grandfather, Corky \nGonzales--Rodolfo ``Corky'' Gonzales--played such an important role in \nColorado's history and the history of the West, and a library was just \nnamed for him last week. I have wondered what he would think about \nknowing we live in a country where his grandson has helped to shepherd \nacross the line the most important immigration reform in this country's \nhistory. So I thank Sergio Gonzales for his leadership as well.\n  None of this would have been possible without Chuck Schumer, whom I \ntalked about earlier. None of it would have been possible without his \nincredible staff: Leon Fresco, Stephanie Martz, Mike Lynch, his chief \nof staff--all of whom did an extraordinary job of keeping us on track \nand keeping Chuck on track, and I deeply appreciate that.\n  The others I wanted to mention while on the floor today are the \nstaffs of the people with whom we negotiated the agriculture provisions \nof this bill. Dianne Feinstein did a great job leading that effort, \nwith Chris Thompson, Neil Quinter, and Kim Alton, who all work for her. \nI deeply appreciate their work.\n  From Orrin Hatch's office, Matt Sandgren did an excellent job all the \nway through.\n  I particularly want to say thank you to Marco Rubio's staff and their \nefforts to bring Democrats and Republicans together on this issue. This \nis the first time we have had an immigration bill where the agriculture \nprovisions in the bill are endorsed by both the growers and the farm \nworkers union. That has\n\n[[Page S5485]]\n\nnever happened before. I thank all of them for doing that. We would not \nhave accomplished that without some very late night meetings, and \nEnrique Gonzalez was always there along with John Baselice. He will \nnever forgive me for that, and Enrique will never let me forget it, but \nthey did extraordinary work on that part of the bill and other parts of \nthe bill as well.\n  I thank the leader's staff--Serena Hoy--the Judiciary Committee \nstaff, and the floor staff.\n  As I say, I have submitted names for the Record, but there are names \nhere that are too often not mentioned on the floor of the Senate, so I \nwant to read these names. These are the schedulers for the eight \nSenators who worked on this bill so hard for so many months.\n  The day I knew we were actually going to get this done was the day \nJohn McCain said in his office some months ago that unless we begin to \nmeet three times a week, we are never going to get this done. As the \nPresiding Officer knows, that is an enormous commitment of time, to \nmeet three times a week, and we did it week in and week out. Sometimes \nwe weren't even in Washington but back home on the telephone, but we \ncarved out the time to do it, and that could not have happened without \nthe schedulers in our offices--from my perspective, certainly not \nwithout Kristin Mollet, who is my extraordinary scheduler. I told her \nat our first meeting--I don't know if I was interviewing her or she was \ninterviewing me; it was probably a little bit of both--that the \nscheduler is the heart of the operation. If the schedule doesn't work, \nthe wheels come off and nothing else works. Kristin Mollet has done an \nextraordinary job getting us through this process.\n  In no particular order, let me please say thank you to Alice James, \nwith Senator Graham; Megan Runyan, with Senator Flake; Rob Kelly, with \nSenator Menendez; Claire Reuschel, with Senator Durbin; Jessica \nBonfiglio, in Senator Rubio's office; and a very special thanks to Alex \nVictor, with Senator Schumer, and Ellen Cahill in Senator McCain's \noffice. We could not have done this without them.\n  In the story I told before about when I was a superintendent and \nworking in business, not in politics--I had never run for office before \nwhen I took this job--I mentioned that the key is finding people a lot \nbetter at doing their job than you would ever be at doing their job. \nWell, that has never been more true than it has been in the Senate, \nwhere the quality of the work we do depends entirely on the quality of \nthe staff we have. So I want to say thank you to all the Senate staff \nfor their efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/27/senate-section/article/S5485-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this Independence Day will mark the 47th \nanniversary of the enactment of the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA. \nFor more than four decades, FOIA has translated our great American \nvalues of openness and accountability into practice, by guaranteeing \naccess to government information. In so doing, this premier open \ngovernment law has helped to guarantee the public's ``right to know'' \nfor generations of Americans.\n  The anniversary of the enactment of FOIA is a timely opportunity to \ntake stock of the progress we have made in improving transparency in \ngovernment, as well as the challenges that remain when citizens seek \ninformation from the Federal Government. Today, we are witnessing an \nerosion of the public's trust in the institutions of government. \nAccording to a recent study by the Pew Research Center, trust in the \nFederal Government is at an historic low. In addition, a majority of \nAmericans believe that the Federal Government threatens their personal \nrights and freedoms, according to the study.\n  To be sure, there are many reasons for the decline in the public's \ntrust in the Federal Government. But more importantly, there is a time-\nproven cure for this troubling trend--an increase in government \ntransparency.\n  To accomplish this, our Federal agencies must commit to the spirit, \nas well as the letter, of the President's pledge to keep the Federal \nGovernment open and accessible to the American people. While the Obama \nadministration has made significant progress in improving the FOIA \nprocess, too many of our Federal agencies are not keeping up with the \nFOIA reforms that Congress enacted in the OPEN Government Act. A recent \naudit conducted by the National Security Archive found that more than \nhalf of all Federal agencies have not updated their Freedom of \nInformation Act regulations to comply with this law.\n  Our Federal Government must also do a better job of balancing the \nneed to protect sensitive government information with the equally \nimportant need to ensure public confidence in our national security \npolicies. According to the Associated Press, during the past year, the \nObama administration withheld more information for national security \nreasons in response to FOIA requests than at any other time since the \nPresident took office. Of course no one would quibble with the notion \nthat some government information must be kept confidential. But as we \nhave seen in the unfolding events surrounding the unauthorized \ndisclosure of information about the NSA's secret electronic \nsurveillance programs, excessive government secrecy can harm both the \npublic's trust and our own national interests. That is why I have \nproposed and cosponsored legislation that will provide for greater \nopenness and public reporting with regard to these broad surveillance \nauthorities, as well as the legal opinions that interpret those \nstatutes.\n  As we mark another FOIA anniversary, I join Americans from across the \npolitical spectrum in celebrating all that this law has come to \nsymbolize about our vibrant democracy. After four decades, we have much \nto celebrate about this open government law. We in Congress also have \nmuch more work to do to help ensure that FOIA's values of openness and \naccountability remain in place for future generations of Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/27/senate-section/article/S5485-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5485-S5486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              AFRICA VISIT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss President Obama's trip \nto Africa that began yesterday. There is no shortage of important \nissues to address on the continent, from continued instability in \neastern Congo, Mali, and Somalia, to autocratic government in Zimbabwe, \nSudan, and the Gambia.\n  Yet there is also another story to tell in Africa--that of a growing \nand more prosperous middle class. In fact, in the past 10 years, 6 of \nthe world's fastest growing economies were located in Sub-Saharan \nAfrica and in the next decade, 7 of the top 10 will also be in Africa. \nA growing middle class is important not only for political stability \nand economic well-being, but also for American businesses that export--\nor want to export--to Africa.\n  It is an issue I have been trying to draw attention to for some time \nand one I am glad that the President has on his trip agenda, including \nby having U.S. Export Import Bank President Fred Hochberg along on his \ntrip.\n  You see, every time I visit Africa I am struck by the presence of \nChina--Chinese companies, Chinese products, Chinese workers, Chinese \nroads and bridges. It is not a coincidence.\n  China has a ravenous appetite for natural resources and also sees the \ngreat potential to sell Chinese goods to the burgeoning African market. \nAnd China has a strategy. It is aggressively investing resources and \nenergy on the continent. It is offering low interest loans that cannot \nbe refused.\n  I can remember a meeting a few years ago with the late Ethiopian \nPrime Minister Meles. Our meeting was almost over and then I asked \nabout China. Meles went on for at least another 30 minutes. He told me \nwhat so many others have told me. Africa wants American products and \ninvestment--and the business, labor, and environmental standards that \ncome with them--but America doesn't seem to have a plan. China, India \nand others do. The loss is ours in American jobs and influence in \nAfrica. And the African people lose by not having access to high \nquality American goods and services.\n  I can also tell you American companies are eager to get into the \nAfrican market, but often face a private finance system that is stuck \nthinking about Africa through the prism of its past--wars, famine, \nstrongmen dictators. I have met with them--American companies big and \nsmall--and\n\n[[Page S5486]]\n\nthey all tell me the same thing--the United States doesn't have a \nsufficiently coordinated export strategy for Africa while our global \ncompetitors do. The U.S. system of export promotion and finance is a \npoorly coordinated patchwork of more than a dozen government agencies \nthat American businesses find too difficult to navigate and does not \nprovide focused or aggressive support.\n  That is why earlier this year, Senators Boozman, Coons, Cardin, \nLandrieu, Kirk, Brown, Leahy and I introduced the Increasing American \nJobs through Greater Exports to Africa Act of 2013. It is a \nstraightforward and commonsense piece of legislation. At its simplest, \nthis bill is about creating jobs--American jobs. It would require a \ncoordinated government strategy to help increase United States exports \nto Africa.\n  Responsibility for overseeing the implementation of that strategy \nwould be vested in a single position--no more agencies tripping over \nthemselves, no more competing priorities, no more wasting time. It is \nsupported by the Chamber of Commerce, the AFL-CIO, the Corporate \nCouncil on Africa, and the National Small Business Association.\n  President Obama understands the urgency of this issue. Every day we \ndelay, China, India, and others fill the void created by a lack of \nAmerican commercial leadership on the continent. The President \nunderstands that every $1 billion in American exports supports over \n5,000 jobs here at home, which is why he has advanced his National \nExport Initiative. Our legislation would build on this effort and seek \nto expand U.S. exports to Africa by 200 percent in real dollar value \nover the next 10 years.\n  Mr. President, yesterday on the cusp of President Obama's trip to \nAfrica, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed this legislation. \nThe timing could not be better. It is good for the American economy by \nhelping U.S. businesses create jobs here at home by tapping into a \nburgeoning overseas market hungry for our products. It is good for U.S. \nforeign policy by keeping America in a position to maintain our global \nleadership in a shifting geopolitical landscape. And it is good for the \npeople of the African continent by making superior American products \nand business practices more competitive and financially accessible.\n  I urge my colleagues to sign on to support this critical effort. \nWhile we wait, the Chinese are acting and America is falling further \nand further behind in Africa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/27/senate-section/article/S5486-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TREATMENT OF GRAMEEN BANK\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to once again voice publicly \nmy concern with actions the Government of Bangladesh has taken and is \npoised to take with respect to Grameen Bank and the Grameen family of \ncompanies.\n  Grameen Bank has for decades been the pride of Bangladesh and the \nenvy of the world. The brainchild of Professor Muhammad Yunus, the Bank \npioneered a concept of lending that helped the very poor help \nthemselves. Uniquely, the Bank was owned and governed by those very \nborrowers, giving them both an opportunity to succeed individually and \na stake in the success of others.\n  For this, both the Bank and Professor Yunus have been recognized \nacross the globe with awards and honors. Both were jointly awarded the \nNobel Peace Prize in 2006. The United States has recognized Professor \nYunus with its two highest civilian honors--the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom and, most recently just this April, with the Congressional Gold \nMedal.\n  Sadly, since 2010, instead of showcasing Grameen's efforts to lift \ncountless Bangladeshis out of poverty, the Government of Bangladesh has \ninstead engaged in what seems to amount to nothing more than carrying \nout a political vendetta against Grameen and Professor Yunus. This has \nresulted in Professor Yunus' forced removal from his position as \nManaging Director and changes to the governance of the Bank. I and many \nof my colleagues in the House and Senate, as well as the Obama \nadministration, have repeatedly raised concerns at all levels of the \nBangladesh Government over these moves.\n  We now understand that in the face of our continued objections and \nthose from a wide swath of the international community, the Government \nof Bangladesh plans to hold a meeting on July 2 at which it is reported \nthat they will finalize plans to take control of Grameen Bank.\n  Such a troubling move could jeopardize the stability of the Bank and \nput millions of borrowers, mostly women, who depend on it at risk of \nsliding back into poverty. It would likely gut the self-government that \nhas been such a critical part of the great success of the Grameen \nexperiment.\n  The Government of Bangladesh should think twice before taking such \naction.\n  Today, the U.S. Government took action against Bangladesh over \nanother issue that has caused great concern--safety of the garment \nindustry in Bangladesh. In response to several high profile garment \nfactory accidents, the administration announced today that it will \nsuspend Bangladesh's trade privileges with the United States.\n  I am certain this is not the image of Bangladesh that Prime Minister \nHasina wants the world to see. In the last few years, Bangladesh has \nmade great strides to rude poverty and to develop a vibrant civil \nsociety. The country has been contributed significantly to important \ninternational peacekeeping missions around the world.\n  It is a shame that the government's campaign against Grameen and its \nslow response to critical labor safety issues overshadow such \nachievements.\n  I urge the Government of Bangladesh to end this campaign against \nGrameen Bank and the Grameen family companies. The United States and, \ntruly, the world are watching.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/27/senate-section/article/S5486-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5486-S5487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VOTING RIGHTS ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last week, the Senate unanimously adopted \na resolution honoring the 50th Anniversary of Congressman John Lewis's \nleadership of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee at the \nheight of the Civil Rights Movement.\n  In the early 1960s, America's promise of equality at the ballot box \nwent unfulfilled for African Americans. Literacy tests, poll taxes, and \nsometimes, angry mobs stood in the way of many African Americans trying \nto register to vote and cast ballots.\n  The members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee--or \nSNICK as it was called at the time--were inspired by and dedicated to \nAmerica's promise of equality and democracy for all citizens, \nregardless of the color of their skin.\n  These high school and college-aged students led sit-ins. They \neducated communities about the right to vote. They conducted voter \nregistration drives.\n  And many of these students marched for civil rights and voting rights \nwith Congressman Lewis and 600 others in Selma, AL on Sunday, March 7, \n1965.\n  As television cameras rolled and the Nation looked on in horror, \nthese nonviolent marchers were chased down by State troopers, beaten, \nand bruised so badly by police batons that the day was coined ``Bloody \nSunday.''\n  A few days after ``Bloody Sunday,'' President Johnson addressed the \nNation and called on the House and the Senate to pass the Voting Rights \nAct.\n  Shortly thereafter, in a moment of bipartisan courage, Congress \npassed the Voting Rights Act, guaranteeing that the fundamental right \nto vote would never again be canceled out by clever schemes devised to \nkeep African Americans from voting.\n  Last week, the Senate honored these heroes of the Civil Rights \nMovement. On Tuesday, five Supreme Court Justices gutted a key \nprovision of the law for which all of these heroes fought and some of \nthem bled and died.\n  The Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County v Holder strikes down \nSection 4 of the Voting Rights Act, which established the formula for \nthose jurisdictions that are covered by the Act's preclearance \nprovisions in Section 5.\n  This has the effect of gutting Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. \nSection 5 required jurisdictions in all or part of 16 States with a \nhistory of discrimination to get approval from the Department of \nJustice or a Federal court before making any changes to congressional \ndistricts or voting procedures.\n  Tuesday was not the first time that the Supreme Court ruled on a \nchallenge to the Voting Rights Act.\n\n[[Page S5487]]\n\n  Though it has been subject to legal challenges previously, the Voting \nRights Act has always emerged intact and on sound legal ground until . \n. . yesterday.\n  For almost 50 years, the Voting Rights Act has always received \noverwhelming, bipartisan support in the Halls of Congress and in the \nExecutive Branch.\n  Each of the four times that the Voting Rights Act has been \nreauthorized in 1970, 1975, 1982, and most recently in 2006--Congress \nhas done so with the broad bipartisan super majorities that are all too \nrare these days.\n  That is because protecting the right to vote should not be a partisan \nprerogative. It is not a Democratic or Republican issue. It is a \nfundamental right for every eligible voter and it is a core value of \nour American democracy.\n  In 2006, the House of Representatives voted 390 to 33 in favor of \nreauthorizing the Voting Rights Act. The Senate voted unanimously, 98 \nto 0, to reauthorize the law. And the final bill was signed into law by \nPresident George W. Bush.\n  There was good reason for this bipartisan support for reauthorizing \nthe Voting Rights Act. Congress developed an extensive record, holding \n21 hearings, reviewing more than 15,000 pages in the Congressional \nRecord, and hearing from more than 90 witnesses about the need to \nreauthorize the law.\n  On Tuesday, five activist Justices on the Supreme Court decided to \ncompletely ignore the extensive record of current and ongoing \ndiscrimination that Congress meticulously assembled just 7 years ago.\n  And you don't have to take my word for it.\n  Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican who was Chair of the \nHouse Judiciary Committee in 2006 and helped secure reauthorization of \nthe Voting Rights Act, had this to say:\n\n       [t]he legislative record accompanying consideration of the \n     Voting Rights Act is among the most extensive in \n     congressional history.\n\n  I am disappointed that the Supreme Court ignored the Congressional \nfindings in issuing this decision.\n  We all acknowledge the progress that our great country has made on \ncivil rights and voting rights issues. Over time, our Nation has indeed \ngrown to be more perfect--and more inclusive in some ways--than just a \nfew generations ago.\n  But we are not yet a perfect union. And the jurisdictions covered by \nthe Voting Rights Act have both a demonstrated history and a \ncontemporary record of implementing discriminatory restrictions on \nvoting.\n  The Supreme Court's decision acknowledges the progress our country \nhas made in expanding the franchise. The Court also acknowledges that \ndiscrimination remains in our society today.\n  Nevertheless, five Justices on the Court have taken the extreme \nposition of gutting the very law that has enabled that progress on \nvoting rights and stands guard to ensure that that progress isn't \nrolled back.\n  As my Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and \nHuman Rights found during a series of hearings I chaired last Congress, \nthe Voting Rights Act remains a critical tool in protecting the right \nto vote.\n  All one needs to do is look to the last election cycle to understand \nthe ongoing need for the Voting Rights Act.\n  After a careful analysis of new voter ID laws in Texas and South \nCarolina, the Department of Justice used its authority under Section 5 \nof the Voting Rights Act to object to the implementation of new photo \nidentification requirements.\n  In Texas, according to the State's own data, more than 790,000 \nregistered voters did not have the ID required to vote under the new \nTexas law.\n  That law would have had a disproportionate impact on Latino voters \nbecause 38.2 percent of registered Hispanic voters did not have the \ntype of ID required by the law.\n  In South Carolina, the State's own data indicated that almost 240,000 \nregistered voters did not have the identification required to vote \nunder the State's new law.\n  That included 10 percent of all registered minorities in South \nCarolina who would not be able to vote under the new law.\n  That is more than 1 million registered voters who would have been \nturned away from the polls in Texas and South Carolina last year, if \nthe Department of Justice did not have the authority under the Voting \nRights Act to object to those photo identification laws.\n  Why did the Court neuter the Voting Rights Act?\n  Chief Justice Robert's opinion claims that the formula used to \ndetermine which States should be covered by the Voting Rights Act is \nnot justified by ``current conditions'' of discrimination at the ballot \nbox.\n  Had they not completely disregarded the 15,000 page Congressional \nRecord, perhaps the Chief Justice and his four colleagues would \nunderstand the unfortunate fact that literacy tests and poll taxes may \nhave died in the 1960s, but current, more sophisticated means of \ndiluting minority voting strength are alive and well.\n  In 2001, for example, the city of Kilmichael, MS canceled an election \nbecause ``an unprecedented number'' of African American candidates \ndecided to run for office. After the Department of Justice used the \nVoting Rights Act to require that the election move forward, the town \nelected its first black mayor and its first majority black City \nCouncil.\n  In 2004, officials in Walker County, TX threatened to prosecute two \nblack students after they announced their candidacies for county \noffice. When that threat didn't keep the students off the ballot, \ncounty officials tried to limit black turnout by reducing early voting \nonly at polling places near a historically black college.\n  Not to be outdone, the State of Mississippi, in 1995, tried to \nreenact a dual voter registration system ``which was initially enacted \nin 1892 to disenfranchise black voters.''\n  As Justice Ginsburg noted in her dissent, ``[t]hese examples, and \nscores like them, fill the pages of the legislative record.''\n  Unfortunately, a majority of the Supreme Court chose to ignore both \nthe extensive legislative record of ongoing discrimination in voting \nand the critical role of the Voting Rights Act in protecting the right \nto vote.\n  If there is any question about the major impact of this decision, \njust look at the statement released by the Texas Attorney General just \nhours after the Court's decision. He wasted no time announcing that the \nState would immediately implement its restrictive voter identification \nlaw.\n  Now that the Supreme Court has gutted the most effective Civil Rights \nlaw in our Nation's history, hundreds of thousands of voters in Texas \nmay not be able to cast a ballot in the next election.\n  After the Court's decision, these 790,000 minority, low income, \nyoung, rural and other voters in Texas can no longer depend on the \nVoting Rights Act to protect their access to the ballot.\n  The Voting Rights Act has never been about who wins an election.\n  It has never been about political advantage.\n  It has about ensuring every eligible American can vote and have their \nvote counted.\n  The Voting Rights Act has done the important work of protecting the \nright to vote for almost 50 years. Tuesday's Supreme Court decision is \na disappointing one that threatens to undermine our democracy.\n  There is ample evidence today that some people are still being denied \nthe right to vote, so Congress has a moral and Constitutional \nobligation to remedy that problem.\n  Congress must act to restore the key provisions of the Voting Rights \nAct that protect the right to vote for all Americans--regardless of the \ncolor of their skin, their net worth, the language they speak, or the \ncommunity in which they live.\n  As Chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil \nRights & Human Rights, I will hold hearings to address this troubling \ndecision, so that we can promptly begin the process of correcting the \nmistake the Supreme Court made.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/27/senate-section/article/S5487-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5487-S5488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      OBSERVING PTSD AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, on this important day, Post Traumatic \nStress Disorder--PTSD--Awareness Day, we must pause to reflect on the\n\n[[Page S5488]]\n\ncontributions of our Nation's veterans and recommit ourselves to a \nsacred promise that should never be forgotten: that they served this \ncountry, and this country will always care for them no matter the \nchallenge.\n  This year, for the first time, based on a resolution that I \ncosponsored, the Senate has recognized June as PTSD awareness month. \nThis is a good step in our effort to raise awareness of the invisible \nwounds our returning servicemembers far too often face. But today in \nparticular, we must recognize that there is so much more to be done to \nfully heal those wounds, support families, and truly save lives.\n  I recently had a meeting, one I will never forget, with a number of \nimmensely brave West Virginia veterans and their families who were \nwilling to publicly share the struggles they face every day as a result \nof PTSD.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense were \nthere for our discussion in West Virginia, and I am glad they were.\n  We heard from wives who stand firmly by their husbands' sides as the \nhorrors of war manifest at home in frightening ways. We heard from a \nfather who hurts every day knowing the inner turmoil his son faces. And \nwe heard from veterans who served their country without question, \nthrough multiple tours of duty, but have encountered nothing but stress \nand resistance when seeking the care they unquestionably earned.\n  They have faced stigma and a lack of understanding about their \nprivate struggles. And they have faced untenable--and, truthfully, \nlife-threatening--delays in getting the strong mental health care they \nneed.\n  This has been the case for two of the veterans who courageously \njoined our discussion--both of whom had been fighting for the benefits \nwe owe them. I vowed to do everything I could for them, and I celebrate \ntoday knowing that with our help their benefits have been approved, and \nthey now have some measure of peace.\n  But I do not rest--because there are thousands more veterans out \nthere fighting and waiting for that good news.\n  Without the right care at the right time, things can start to spiral \nout of control for veterans with PTSD--financial hardship, marital \nstress, feelings of hopelessness. It is our job to deliver that care.\n  With the end of the Iraq war, and with tens of thousands of veterans \ncoming home from Afghanistan, the VA and the DOD know the complexities \nof caring for returning servicemembers with conditions like PTSD and \nTraumatic Brain Injury--TBI. But as the demand for mental health care \nincreases, we must be prepared to swiftly and strongly answer the call \nfor our newest veterans and those from every generation.\n  The VA recently announced that it has filled 1,600 mental health \npositions and the vacancies of more than 2,000 mental health clinical \nproviders. This is an important step, and something I pushed for. But I \nbelieve we must do more to deliver the timely, consistent, \nindividualized care our veterans need, including providing highly-\nskilled doctors and therapists and making sure that care is always \navailable.\n  We must end the months-long delay that places veterans in limbo when \ntransitioning their paperwork from active duty status at the DOD to the \nVA. And we can no longer expect veterans tormented by mental health \nissues to twist and turn through multiple levels of bureaucracy to get \nthe care we owe them.\n  This is a difficult issue. But we can not let the complexity be an \nexcuse for not delivering care for our veterans. No one is more \ndeserving.\n  We know the system can work for our veterans when the VA, DOD, vet \ncenters, counselors and support networks get it right. And we know the \nright kind of care when it is most needed can keep families together. \nIt can also transform and save lives.\n  Near the end of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln made a solemn \ncommitment to, ``bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall \nhave borne the battle . . .'' We should be relentless in our efforts to \nuphold that pledge for each and every veteran and their loved ones--\ntoday and every day\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/27/senate-section/article/S5488-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5488-S5489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NUCLEAR ARSENAL\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a copy of the following op-ed from POLITICO.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From POLITICO, June 26, 2013]\n\n              Modernize, Don't Abandon Our Nuclear Arsenal\n\n                       (By: Senator Deb Fischer)\n\n       The Brandenburg Gate served as an iconic backdrop for the \n     20th-century struggle between freedom and oppression. \n     Standing before the gate in the long shadow of Presidents \n     John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, President Barack Obama \n     made a remarkable--and indeed a historic--announcement last \n     week that could drastically alter the course of the 21st \n     century for the United States and our allies.\n       Before thousands of German citizens, the president \n     announced our nation was effectively abandoning the long-\n     standing policy of ``peace through strength.'' Instead, Obama \n     pledged to pursue a policy of ``peace with justice.'' ``Peace \n     with justice means pursuing the security of a world without \n     nuclear weapons, no matter how distant that dream might be,'' \n     Obama explained. Reducing our nuclear arsenal by one-third, \n     he argued, brought us closer to this lofty goal.\n       Following the president's speech, the Pentagon quickly \n     released a report on the new nuclear strategy, which \n     succeeded in making one thing clear: The world is \n     increasingly unstable. It states, ``the risk of nuclear \n     attack has increased''; it cites nuclear terrorism and \n     nuclear proliferation as key threats; and it expresses \n     concern with Russian and Chinese nuclear modernization and \n     the ``growth of China's nuclear arsenal.''\n       In an age of persistent nuclear proliferation, it is \n     puzzling as to why the commander in chief would endorse \n     shedding a third of our deterrent power. Responsible national \n     security policy requires a realistic recognition of the world \n     as it is, not as we hope it to be.\n       It is naive to believe terrorists and rogue nations will be \n     swayed by the philosophical righteousness some may attach to \n     the president's new policy. And count me among the skeptics \n     in believing that China or Russia will abandon its own \n     nuclear modernization plans.\n       Moreover, deep reductions in strategic weapons could \n     actually undermine the stability that characterizes current \n     force levels. Russia is estimated to maintain several \n     thousand tactical nuclear weapons, which are exempted from \n     current arms reduction agreements, compared with a few \n     hundred such devices in U.S. inventories.\n       The Department of Defense report notes, ``large disparities \n     in nuclear capabilities could raise concerns . . . and may \n     not be conducive to maintaining a stable, long-term strategic \n     relationship, especially as nuclear forces are significantly \n     reduced.'' In short, as the number of strategic weapons \n     diminishes, other nuclear weapons become more important. When \n     potential adversaries hold greater numbers of these weapons, \n     the U.S. and our allies are less secure.\n       Perhaps the president is motivated by cost reductions--a \n     pitch to fiscal conservatives like me--reasoning that fewer \n     weapons could save us tax dollars. This, too, is \n     unconvincing. Testifying earlier this year before the House \n     Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Energy and Water, \n     Don Cook, the deputy administrator for Defense Programs at \n     the National Nuclear Security Administration, stated that \n     ``not much savings will be achieved'' by nuclear reductions. \n     I received similar assessments from the directors of our \n     national weapons labs.\n       Some argue deep cuts are necessary because nuclear weapons \n     pose a threat to humanity. Lesser is better, they insist. The \n     president suggested a similar view in his Berlin speech: ``So \n     long as nuclear weapons exist, we are not truly safe.'' I \n     disagree.\n       Our freedom, security and prosperity are all contingent \n     upon the United States maintaining a position of unquestioned \n     strength. Since World War II, nuclear weapons have provided \n     the bulwark of American national security. Nuclear deterrence \n     is not academic; it is real. For example, the \n     administration's recent decision to order a nuclear-capable \n     aircraft to the Korean region earlier this year clearly \n     reaffirmed the power and relevance of our nuclear deterrent.\n       The president also failed to acknowledge his previous \n     commitments to nuclear modernization. When the Senate \n     ratified New START in 2010, the president pledged to provide \n     critical funding to modernize our aging nuclear forces (some \n     still have 1960s vacuum tubes) and supporting laboratories. \n     The reasoning was clear: As we retain fewer weapons, we must \n     exponentially increase our confidence in their ability to \n     fully function deterrence depends on it. This promised \n     funding has not materialized.\n       The Senate should not consider additional arms reductions \n     when we have not achieved the modernization guaranteed in \n     exchange for the last round of cuts to the arsenal.\n       Despite the president's pledge to pursue the ``dream'' of a \n     world without nuclear weapons, the truth is that dreams don't \n     always match reality. The frigid reception from Kremlin \n     officials to Obama's call for further Russian nuclear \n     reductions was telling. Moreover, history has proved the \n     current Russian president isn't exactly a good-faith \n     negotiator.\n\n[[Page S5489]]\n\n       It's no secret that we live in a dangerous world and \n     national security decisions must be made to bolster--not \n     weaken--our ability to counter a growing array of threats. A \n     strong, safe America requires a nuclear deterrent that is \n     modern and effective, not aging and depleted. As former \n     British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously warned, \n     ``This is no time to go wobbly.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/27/senate-section/article/S5489-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMMEMORATING THE 4TH OF JULY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, one week from today--July 4th--we will \ncelebrate our Nation's 237th birthday. In 1776, our forefathers issued \nthe Declaration of Independence announcing that the 13 Colonies were \nfree from British rule, initiating the most successful experiment in \nhuman history. Our forefathers had the revolutionary idea that ``all \nmen are created equal'' and ``are endowed by their Creator with certain \nunalienable Rights''. On July 4th, we gather together, at parades on \nMain Streets across America and at barbeques with family members and \nfriends, to reflect on just how much we have to be thankful for as \nAmericans.\n  No other country in the world has such a rich past, diverse \npopulation, and bright future. Regardless of our fellow citizens' race, \nreligion or background, we should remember that as Americans we are all \neternally bound as countrymen. The novel experiment in democracy our \nforefathers began more than two centuries ago continues. It continues \nbecause we actively strive--in the words of our other foundational \ndocument, the Constitution--to ``form a more perfect Union, establish \nJustice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, \npromote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to \nourselves and our Posterity''. For 237 years, we have been working to \ndefend and advance the foundations of freedom and equality that this \ncountry was built upon, and to promote them abroad.\n  Our history is not pristine; slavery and Jim Crow stain it. Our \nhistory has been about expanding the franchise and making it possible \nfor more and more people to participate fully in American society, to \nenjoy the blessings of peace and prosperity and to share in our mutual \ncivic responsibilities. We have endured difficult periods, but every \ntime we quarrel amongst ourselves or are attacked from the outside we \nregroup stronger and more resolute. History has taught us and the \nfuture will show that we are at our best when we work together. On a \nbattlefield, factory line, classroom or Congress, nothing can stop \nAmericans when we are determined to move the country forward.\n  This 4th of July, let us redouble our resolve to continue our great \ndemocratic experiment. Not just for ourselves and our posterity, but \nfor all humankind. As the poet Archibald MacLeish wrote:\n\n       There are those who will say that the liberation of \n     humanity, the freedom of man and mind, is nothing but a \n     dream. They are right.

Members of the LGBT community have helped this country \nbecome a leader in so many fields.\n  And today I also rise in celebration as a result of yesterday's \ndecisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. Loving families \nacross our great Nation have now been made whole, as the Supreme Court \nupheld the core principle that all persons must be treated equally \nunder the law.\n  By striking down as unconstitutional the provision of the Defense of \nMarriage Act, DOMA, that limited federal marriage benefits to opposite \nsex couples, the Supreme Court has affirmed that there is no place for \ndiscrimination in America based on sexual orientation. Government \nshould not interfere in the ability of men and women to marry the \nperson they love, and they should be entitled to the same benefits as \nheterosexual couples, including tax benefits, rights of inheritance, \nhealth insurance, and legal marriage. The Federal Government--\nespecially Congress and the executive branch--should act quickly to \ncomply with and fully implement this Supreme Court ruling, following \nthe lead of a growing number of States including Maryland that give \nfull recognition and equality to legal marriages of same-sex couples.\n  Alongside their neighbors, LGBT individuals have been integral in \nforging this Nation into what it is today. Sadly, many members of the \nLBGT community encounter prejudice and discrimination on a daily basis. \nWe cannot forget the events at the Stonewall Inn in June of 1969. \nShortly thereafter the modern day gay rights movement began to take \nshape.\n  In the years since Stonewall, we have made progress in making ours a \nmore just society. I am proud that 13 States--including Maryland by \nboth legislative action and popular referendum--and the District of \nColumbia have voted to allow two consenting same-sex adults to enjoy \nall the happiness and privileges that come with marriage. I am proud \nthat our men and women in uniform can no longer be told they cannot \nserve the country they love because of who they are in love with.\n  I am proud that we passed legislation, the Matthew Shepard and James \nByrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, to expand the federal hate crimes \nlaw to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived \ngender, sexual orientation, or gender identity. I am proud that \neveryday more and more people support equal rights for all Americans.\n  Despite all the progress we have made, we must always work harder to \nmaintain the foundation of human rights on which this country is built. \nI believe that every American should have the opportunity to fulfill \ntheir American Dream. This is only possible when the government can \nprovide robust civil rights for all citizens. There is still much that \nonly we in Congress can do to make sure that every American enjoys the \nright of equal protection under the law.\n  Right now in a majority of States, an individual can be fired for \ntheir sexual orientation or gender identity and have no legal recourse. \nThe fact that someone can be fired for simply being who they are in the \nyear 2013 cannot be accepted. I chair the U.S Helsinki Commission and \nsit on the Foreign Relations Committee, and I can tell you that human \nrights are directly linked to governmental guarantees and enforcement \nof equal protection.\n  This June we should recognize the remarkable contributions LGBT \nAmericans have made to this Nation. We should also take a moment to \nvalue all the hard work, sacrifice and determination that has defined \nthe LGBT movement.\n  The issues facing the LGBT community are important to all Americans. \nWe are all harmed when homophobia trumps civility, and similarly we all \nsucceed when we find strength in our diversity.\n  We have work to do. Members of the LGBT community should feel free \nand safe to be who they are. Now is the time for all Americans \nregardless of sexual orientation or gender identity to come together in \nthe spirit of moving the country forward. The LGBT community has been \npart of America's storied past, and will continue to be central to our \nperpetual goal of building a brighter future.\n  Fifty years ago this month President Kennedy asked the Nation a \nsimple question as the fight for civil rights raged across the country:\n  ``The heart of the question is whether all Americans are to be \nafforded equal rights and equal opportunities, whether we are going to \ntreat our fellow Americans as we want to be treated.''\n  The answer then, as it is now, should be a resounding yes.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, last week I was honored to celebrate the \n10th anniversary of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, \nPEPFAR, along with Secretary of State John Kerry; Global Aids \nCoordinator, Ambassador Eric Goosby; Senator Mike Enzi; Namibian Health \nMinister D. Richard Kamwi, and Tatu Msangi, a PEPFAR beneficiary and \nnurse from Tanzania.\n  Ten years ago, AIDS threatened the very foundation of societies in \nAfrica--creating millions of orphans, stalling economic development, \nand leaving countries stuck in poverty. Before\n\n[[Page S5490]]\n\nPEPFAR started in Namibia in 2004, Minister Kamwi explained, nearly one \nin four pregnant women in Namibia were infected with HIV, yet only a \nhandful of them could access treatment. The circumstances were dire, \nand it was clear something needed to be done. The visionary leadership \nof President George W. Bush and the Congressional Black Caucus, \nespecially the late Congressman Donald Payne Sr. and Congresswoman \nBarbara Lee, led to the establishment of the program in 2003 with an \ninitial $15 billion to fight HIV and AIDS worldwide.\n  Today, thanks to the ongoing, bipartisan U.S. commitment to PEPFAR, \nhope has replaced despair, life has replaced death, and productivity \nhas replaced illness and disability. PEPFAR is the largest commitment \nby any nation to combat a single disease internationally, and it has \nsaved and improved millions of lives. Today Namibia's mother-to-child \nHIV transmission rate at 6 weeks is less than 3 percent. Thanks to \nPEPFAR, Ms. Msangi, is healthy enough to help treat and counsel HIV \npatients, and her daughter Faith was born HIV-free, representing the \nbest of what this remarkable program has to offer.\n  This bipartisan program is a tremendous success, having exceeded \nevery one of its initial goals. PEPFAR directly supports nearly 5.1 \nmillion people on antiretroviral treatment, and has contributed to a \n20-percent reduction in new HIV infections globally. This month, the \nprogram reached a remarkable milestone when the one-millionth infant \nwas born HIV-free, thanks to PEPFAR. Thirteen countries have reached a \ncrucial tipping point--where annual new adult HIV infections are below \nthe annual increase in adults on antiretroviral drug treatment. And we \nare building capacity for recipient nations to address the problem. We \nhave helped improve host country health care delivery systems, and \ncountries are now taking ownership in their responsibility to care for \ntheir people.\n  I authored an amendment to PEPFAR's 2008 reauthorization bill that \nsupports in-country health worker training for people like Ms. Msangi, \nwhich U.S. universities and NGOs support along with other elements of \nthe program. Research being done by Maryland institutions--including \nthe National Institutes of Health, Johns Hopkins University, and the \nUniversity of Maryland--is making a difference globally; and Maryland \nNGO's like Catholic Relief Services of Baltimore are partnering with us \nin this global fight.\n  Yet despite the remarkable progress that these partnerships have \nproduced, we still have challenges ahead of us. According to UNAIDS, an \nestimated 1.7 million people are dying annually from AIDS-related \ncauses. Global health and development resources are being squeezed due \nto difficult economic times. And issues of stigma and discrimination \ncontinue to limit access to treatment and care to those in need.\n  The U.S. will continue to lead this global fight, but we need the \ncommitment and leadership of partner countries--reinforced with support \nfrom donor nations, civil society, people living with HIV, faith-based \norganizations, the private sector, foundations, and the Global Fund--in \norder to see an HIV-free generation in our lifetime.\n  PEPFAR represents the best of what our government can do when we put \naside partisanship for the good of humanity. It represents the very \nbest of America and our commitment to global humanitarian values. It is \na testament to the power of thinking big and of dreaming big, and we \nmust continue to do just that to conquer this disease once and for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/27/senate-section/article/S5490-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SAFE ACT\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, from the beaches of Rhode Island to \nthe glaciers of Montana, natural ecosystems provide us with life's \nessentials: clean air and water, crops and timber, recreation and lots \nof local pride.\n  Rhode Island's oceans and coasts, for example, are spawning grounds, \nnurseries, and shelters for nutritious and profitable fish and \nshellfish. Their natural buffers protect our coastal communities from \nstorms and filter our water. They even provide clean, renewable energy. \nAnd, of course, the coastline of the Ocean State boasts world-class \nbeaches.\n  But climate change threatens to rob us of these essentials. The \nGovernment Accountability Office confirms what Americans see with their \nown eyes: our Nation's ecosystems are at risk from ongoing changes, \nincluding--and I will quote GAO: ``increases in air and water \ntemperatures, wildfires, and drought; forests stressed by drought \nbecoming more vulnerable to insect infestations; rising sea levels; and \nreduced snow cover and retreating glaciers.''\n  This warning comes from a report released last week on climate change \nadaptation efforts in Federal agencies. Senator Baucus and I requested \nthis report because of the risk climate change poses to our natural \nresources and our national economy.\n  Climate change is not something we can fix later, and it is not \nsomething that only will happen to future generations, although our \nchildren and grandchildren will surely pay a heavier price.\n  Scientists tell us that the carbon pollution we have already emitted \nhas locked in changes in the coming decades to our atmosphere, oceans, \nand weather. So while we must take up the challenge to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions, we must also begin to adapt, and secure our \nnatural resources against the changes we can no longer avoid.\n  In this report, GAO examined the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service, the National Park Service, the National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration, and the Bureau of Land Management.\n  It found that while planning for changes in resource conditions is a \nmain part of the mission of these agencies, addressing the effects of \nclimate change is not. In fact, BLM, which manages 245 million acres of \nland, has not yet established a climate change adaptation strategy.\n  That is why Senator Baucus and I introduced the Safeguarding \nAmerica's Future and the Environment Act, or SAFE Act.\n  The Federal agencies that manage our natural resources are \nresponsible for protecting, restoring, and conserving the natural \nresources that underpin our economy. The SAFE Act would require those \nagencies to adopt climate change adaptation plans that are consistent \nwith the National Fish, Wildlife, and Plants Climate Adaptation \nStrategy released this year by the, administration.\n  Adaptation--to shifting conditions, to catastrophic events, even to \nfull ecosystem shifts--is not easy work, and resource managers are \noften constrained by existing laws and regulations. The SAFE Act puts \nall climate adaptation tools and approaches on the table, and includes \nState, local, and stakeholder participation.\n  I want to thank Senator Baucus for working so hard to protect \nMontanans, Rhode Islanders, and all Americans.\n  The SAFE Act has garnered broad support from sportsmen, the outdoor \nindustry, and conservation groups, including American Forests, the \nAssociation of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, Defenders of Wildlife, Earth \nJustice, the National Parks Conservation Association, Natural Resources \nDefense Council, the National Wildlife Federation, the Outdoor \nAlliance, Trout Unlimited, and The Wildlife Society.\n  Noah Matson of Defenders of Wildlife said, ``This bill recognizes \nthat responding to climate change isn't just about cutting carbon \nemissions. It also means ensuring our wildlife and ecosystems are \nresilient and can withstand the extreme weather and other climate \nchange impacts we are already experiencing. The two go hand in hand for \na safe, healthy environment for wildlife, people and future \ngenerations.''\n  I hope the SAFE Act will also garner the support of our colleagues in \nCongress, and I look forward to working with Democrats and Republicans \nto pass this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/27/senate-section/article/S5490-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5490-S5491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FREEDOM, MAINE\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to wish the town of Freedom, \nME, a very happy 200th birthday. The people of Freedom are proud of \ntheir hometown and the generations of hard-working and caring people \nwho have made it such a wonderful place to live, work, and raise \nfamilies.\n  The name of this town is more than a word; it describes its history. \nOriginally part of the Plymouth Patent,\n\n[[Page S5491]]\n\nthis community can trace its roots to the brave Pilgrims who came to \nthe New World to secure freedom. Its first permanent settler was \nStephen Smith, a soldier of the American Revolution who fought for \nfreedom. When the town was incorporated in 1813, American independence \nwas again under attack, and the town's name--first Smithtown, then \nBeaverhill Plantation--became Freedom.\n  Decades later, when the Civil War threatened to divide our Nation and \ncondemn millions to continued slavery, many young men from the town \nenlisted in the Union Army to fight for the freedom of all. One of \nthem, Daniel Franklin Davis, became the 37th governor of our great \nState of Maine.\n  And when the town's oldest citizen, Roy Ward, is recognized at the \nbicentennial celebration on July 5th, his friends and neighbors will \nhonor his courageous Navy service during World War II in freedom's \ncause.\n  Through the years, the people who built this community demonstrated \nthe qualities that make freedom possible--determination, energy, and \nself-reliance. They harnessed the waters of Sandy Stream to power mills \nfor grain, lumber, and textiles. They turned the untilled soil into \nproductive farms. In 1836, they established Freedom Academy, the first \nsecondary school in their region and a milestone in the history of \npublic education in Maine.\n  The energy that so many have devoted to this year's exciting \nbicentennial celebration is but one example of the spirit that has been \nnurtured there for two centuries. The restoration of such landmarks as \nthe Stephen Smith gravesite and the Mill at Freedom Falls, and the \ndedication of the gazebo at Freedom Academy all demonstrate widespread \ncommitment by the people of Freedom.\n  Thanks to those who came before, Freedom has a wonderful history. \nThanks to those who are there today, it has a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/27/senate-section/article/S5491-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               RECOGNIZING THE WESTERN RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\n Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today I wish to offer my sincere \ncongratulations to the Western Research Institute in Laramie, WY. On \nJuly 15 to 17, 2013, the Western Research Institute will be hosting the \n50th Annual Petersen Asphalt Research Conference. This highly acclaimed \ninternational forum promotes understanding of how asphalt chemistry, \nphysical properties and interactions affect the performance of asphalt \napplications throughout their life cycle.\n  In 1963, Dr. J. Claine Petersen organized the first asphalt research \nconference, emphasizing how the chemical and physical properties of \nasphalt affect its performance as pavement over time. In 1990, the name \nof the conference was changed to honor Dr. Petersen's efforts. Dr. \nPetersen remains an active and vital participant in this event each \nyear.\n  Partnering with a pavement performance prediction--P3--Symposium has \nenhanced the ability of the conference to ``dive deep'' on key topics. \nThis year, the topic for the symposium is ``Innovations and Issues in \nPavement Preservation and Durability.'' The symposium links \nresearchers, highway officials, producers, and others with a need to \nunderstand how asphalts may perform in a given application over time.\n  The Federal Government typically provides between 75 and 90 percent \nof the costs of federally supported highway projects. Federally \nsupported asphalt research has been proven to yield substantial cost \nsavings and return on investment. The Petersen Asphalt Research \nConference continues to enhance this Federal investment by advancing \nthe understanding and production of state-of-the-art materials, which \nimprove pavement performance, durability, and safety.\n  The Western Research Institute is a nationally recognized research \ncenter for transportation and energy projects. The annual Petersen \nAsphalt Research Conference is one more example of the institute's \nleadership in transportation and energy research. Congratulations, \nagain, Western Research Institute, and Wyoming is looking forward to \nhosting many more in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/27/senate-section/article/S5491-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CONGRATULATING CLARK HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE OLYMPIAD TEAM\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Las \nVegas' Ed W. Clark High School Science Olympiad Team. This group of \noutstanding high school students from my home State of Nevada recently \naccomplished something truly extraordinary in the area of environmental \nscience by earning a first-place gold medal in the Science Olympiad \nNational Tournament.\n  The National Science Olympiad Tournament brings together students \nfrom all over the country to test their skills in a variety of \nscientific disciplines. This year, the competition included nearly \n6,000 top science students from across the United States, including 42 \nstudents from Clark High School in Las Vegas. Clark High School's \nScience Olympiad Team, led by students Michael Zhou and Zachary \nShattler, and coaches Sidney Lupu, James Miller and Jeffrey Viggato, \ntook first place in the water quality event of the competition, marking \nthe first time any Nevada team has won a gold medal at this national \nevent. It is especially noteworthy that this award was given in an area \nof science that is of particular interest to my home State of Nevada, \nnamely water quality.\n  Without a doubt, this scholastic achievement was earned through \nsignificant effort and teamwork on the part of these exceptional \nstudents and educators, and they have made the State of Nevada \nimmensely proud. I congratulate Clark High School's Science Olympiad \nTeam, and Principal Jillyn Pendleton and Assistant Principal Joseph \nWinfield, on earning this well-deserved recognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/27/senate-section/article/S5491-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BOB BOWLES\n\n Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today I wish to commend a \ndistinguished Virginian, Bob Bowles, for his extensive contributions to \nthe success of the Senate Productivity and Quality Award, SPQA, Program \nand many Virginia governmental, business, and nonprofit organizations.\n  In 1982, the Senate passed resolution 502 to promote the creation of \nState-sponsored programs to improve quality in industry. As part of an \neffort to fulfill resolution 502's vision, the U.S. Senate Productivity \nand Quality Award Program, or SPQA, was established to promote quality \nin Virginia organizations. SPQA is an all-volunteer organization with a \nmission to promote and recognize high-performance organizations in \nVirginia. Since its founding 30 years ago, SPQA has recognized more \nthan 200 Virginia city and county organizations, businesses, and \nnonprofits for their pursuit of organizational excellence. Today, SPQA \ncontinues to provide training and an award challenge to thousands of \nindividuals and organizations in the Commonwealth. I am proud to say it \nis the oldest continuously operating productivity and quality awards \nprogram in the United States.\n  Bob Bowles has served as director and executive director of SPQA \nsince 1994.

On behalf of the Senate and the \npeople of Virginia, I thank Bob for his invaluable service to SPQA and \nthe Commonwealth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/27/senate-section/article/S5491-4", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5491-S5492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CLAIRE CITY, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to \npay tribute to the 100th anniversary of the founding of Claire City, \nSD. The charming town of Claire City can be found in the northeastern \ncorner of South Dakota, in Roberts County.\n  In 1913, a group of local farmers donated their land to establish the \ntown site of Claire City. The town was named for one of the early \norganizer's wives, Edith Claire Feeney.\n  Before construction of the railroad, farmers in the area had to haul \ntheir grain greater distances, to Sisseton or Ligerwood. The railroad \nin Claire City became essential to the growth of the town. Securing the \nfunding and the labor necessary to complete the railroad was a true \ncollective effort. Much of the money came from local farmers and \nbusinessmen who bought stock. Early residents labored tirelessly with\n\n[[Page S5492]]\n\nthe aid of horses to build the track. During this time, many of the \nwomen of Claire City would sell meals from their homes to help feed \nweary railroad workers.\n  After the railroad was completed in the fall of 1913, the town \nflourished, and many small businesses opened. By the 1930s, Claire City \nhad a grocery store, meat market, drug and general store, a live \nstable, barbershop, bank, pool hall, and a hardware store. On weekend \nnights in the summers of the 1930s and 1940s, residents could catch a \nfree movie and businesses stayed open until midnight. When the weather \nstarted to get colder, residents could watch a movie at the town hall \nfor only ten cents.\n  Residents of Claire City plan to celebrate their centennial this \nweekend with a full schedule of fun activities that engage the \ncommunity. Friday night there will be a large supper at the community \ncenter, accompanied by dancing and live music. Saturday there will a \nnumber of outdoor activities, including a tractor pull, parade, and \nrides for children and adults alike. Sunday finishes up the celebration \nwith a church service and brunch served at Deano's.\n  Claire City embodies the values that make South Dakota a great State. \nThe hard work and determination of its residents, past and present, \nhave made it possible for Claire City to reach its centennial \nanniversary. I congratulate Claire City on reaching this milestone, and \nI wish the residents the best in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/27/senate-section/article/S5492-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WHITEWOOD, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to \npay tribute to the 125th anniversary of the founding of Whitewood, SD. \nLocated in Lawrence County, Whitewood is a tightly knit community, \nknown for its rich history and hardworking people.\n  In 1877, the Pioneer Townsite Company bought an orchard from William \nSelbie, one of the early settlers of the Black Hills. This land would \nbecome the town of Whitewood, and was incorporated in 1888. The new \ntown enjoyed trade from settlers to the north, as it was one of the few \ntowns in existence at the time. Settlers came into town for machinery, \nfeed, food, mail, as well as to ship their wool and livestock. In the \nearly years, Whitewood was a hub of agricultural trade, particularly \nfor wheat.\n  A railroad terminal opened in 1905 to accommodate the increase in \ncommercial activity. Along with the railroad terminal, a water tank, \ncoal chute, roundhouse, and a section house offered many jobs to town \nresidents.\n  Whitewood is looking forward to celebrating its quasquicentennial \nanniversary. The last weekend of June will be packed with many \nactivities that will bring the community together as they celebrate \ntheir humble beginnings. Festivities include children's games at \nMemorial Park, a 5 kilometer run, a roast pig barbeque, and a \nhistorically themed parade though the town.\n  Whitewood was founded by a group of pioneers with an enterprising \nspirit. One hundred and twenty-five years after its founding, Whitewood \ncontinues to be a vibrant community and a great asset to the State of \nSouth Dakota. I am proud to honor the achievements of Whitewood on this \nmemorable occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/27/senate-section/article/S5492-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING THE SOUTH DAKOTA WHEAT GROWERS\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the South \nDakota Wheat Growers as it celebrates its 90th anniversary. Over the \nyears, the Wheat Growers has faithfully served member-owners by \npromoting integrity through business transactions, providing customers \nwith reliable markets, and practicing sustainability through the best \napplications of science and technology. The Wheat Growers aims to meet \nthe food challenges our world faces by coupling the expertise of \nfarmers in the Dakotas with state-of-the-art technology and facilities \nto improve production agriculture capabilities.\n  The Wheat Growers was established in 1923 as a response to widespread \nfarm bankruptcies caused by depressed wheat prices. Through their \ncollaboration and commitment to serving South Dakota farmers, the Wheat \nGrowers endured the Great Depression and has since expanded its grain \nstorage capacity and farming supply services.

Perry (Texas) and ACLU v. McCreary County (Kentucky) \n     concluded that it is consistent with the First Amendment to \n     display the Ten Commandments in an outdoor public square in \n     Texas but not on the courthouse walls of two counties in \n     Kentucky; and\n       Whereas, American citizens are concerned that the court has \n     produced two opposite results involving the same Ten \n     Commandments, leading to the conclusion that, based on the \n     Kentucky decision, the Ten Commandments may be displayed in a \n     county courthouse provided it is not backed by a belief in \n     God; and\n       Whereas, Supreme Justice Scalia emphasized the importance \n     of the Ten Commandments when he stated in the Kentucky case, \n     ``The three most popular religions in the United States, \n     Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, which combined account for \n     97.7% of all believers, are monotheistic. All of them, \n     moreover, believe that the Ten Commandments were given by God \n     to Moses and are divine prescriptions for a virtuous life''; \n     and\n       Whereas, Chief Justice Rehnquist in the Texas case referred \n     to the duplicity of the United States Supreme Court in \n     telling local governments in America that they may not \n     display the Ten Commandments in public buildings in their \n     communities while at the same time allowing these same Ten \n     Commandments to be presented on these specific places on the \n     building housing the United States Supreme Court stating, \n     ``Since 1935, Moses has stood holding two tablets that reveal \n     portions of the Ten Commandments written in Hebrew, among \n     other lawgivers in the south frieze. Representations of the \n     Ten Commandments adorn the metal gates lining the north and \n     south sides of the courtroom as well as the doors leading \n     into the courtroom. Moses also sits on the exterior east \n     facade of the building holding the Ten Commandments \n     tablets''; and\n       Whereas, a recent poll by the First Amendment Center \n     revealed that seventy percent of Americans would have no \n     objection to posting the Ten Commandments in government \n     buildings and eighty-five percent would approve if the Ten \n     Commandments were included as one document among many \n     historical documents when displayed in public buildings; and\n       Whereas, the First Amendment of the United States \n     Constitution, which provides in part that ``Congress shall \n     make no law respecting an establishment of religion'', is a \n     specific and unequivocal instruction to only the United \n     States Congress, and the United States Constitution makes no \n     restriction on the ability of states to acknowledge God, the \n     Supreme Ruler of the Universe; and\n       Whereas, the United States District Court Southern District \n     of Indiana on November 30, 2005, entered a final judgment and \n     permanent injunction ordering the speaker of the Indiana \n     House of Representatives not to permit sectarian prayers as \n     part of the official proceedings of the House; and\n       Whereas, the federal judiciary has violated one of the most \n     sacred provisions of the United States Constitution providing \n     for three branches of government and the separation of powers \n     of those branches by overstepping its authority and dictating \n     the activities of the inner workings of the legislative \n     branch of government; and\n       Whereas, the federal judiciary has overstepped its \n     constitutional boundaries and ruled against the \n     acknowledgment of God as the sovereign source of law, \n     liberty, and government by local and state officers and other \n     state institutions, including state schools; and\n       Whereas, there is concern that recent decisions of the \n     court will be used by litigants in an effort to remove God \n     from the public square in America, including public buildings \n     and public parks; and\n       Whereas, there is concern that the federal judiciary will \n     continue to attempt to micromanage the internal workings of \n     the legislative as well as executive branches of government; \n     and\n       Whereas, Congress has previously filed, but has failed to \n     adopt, the Constitution Restoration Act, which will limit the \n     jurisdiction of the federal courts and preserve the right to \n     acknowledge God to the states and to the people and resolve \n     the issue of improper judicial intervention in matters \n     relating to the acknowledgment of God: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana hereby \n     memorializes the Congress of the United States to adopt the \n     Constitution Restoration Act and, in doing so, continue to \n     protect the ability of the people of the United States to \n     display the Ten Commandments in public places, to express \n     their faith in public, to retain God in the Pledge of \n     Allegiance, and to retain ``In God We Trust'' as our national \n     motto, and to use Article III, Section 2.2 of the United \n     States Constitution to except these areas from the \n     jurisdiction of the United States Supreme Court; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n       POM-42. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of Louisiana establishing a task force to study and \n     make recommendations relative to implementation of the \n     federal REAL ID Act of 2005 in Louisiana; to the Committee on \n     the Judiciary.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 119\n\n       Whereas, Act No. 807 of the 2008 Regular Session of the \n     Legislature directs the Department of Public Safety and \n     Corrections to not implement the provisions of the federal \n     REAL ID Act of 2005; and\n       Whereas, Act No. 151 of the 2010 Regular Session of the \n     Legislature directs the Department of Public Safety and \n     Corrections to not implement the provisions of the federal \n     PASS ID Act of 2009; and\n       Whereas, House Bill No. 395 by Representative Guinn of the \n     2013 Regular Session of the Legislature, as amended, proposes \n     to enact R.S. 32:412(M) and R.S. 40:1321(M) to require the \n     Department of Public Safety and Corrections, office of motor \n     vehicles, to issue a driver's license or special \n     identification card that bears a United States Department of \n     Homeland Security approved security marking that reflects \n     such credential, meets the standards of the REAL ID Act of \n     2005 upon request of any individual who is otherwise eligible \n     to be issued a driver's license or special identification \n     card as provided by law and who meets all the requirements of \n     the United States Department of Homeland Security for a REAL \n     ID Act compliant credential; and\n       Whereas, House Bill No. 395, as amended, further proposes \n     to enact R.S. 32:412(M) and R.S. 40:1321(M) to provide that \n     if a Louisiana resident elects not to be issued a REAL ID Act \n     compliant driver's license or special identification card, \n     the Department of Public Safety and Corrections, office of \n     motor vehicles, shall issue a driver's license or special \n     identification card to any individual who is otherwise \n     eligible to be issued a driver's license or special \n     identification card as provided by law that indicates such \n     driver's license or special identification card is not \n     accepted by federal agencies for official purposes in \n     compliance with the United States Department of Homeland \n     Security rules and the words ``Not for federal \n     identification'' shall be printed on the driver's license or \n     special identification card: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana establishes the \n     Louisiana REAL ID Act of 2005 Task Force to study all issues \n     and disputes related to implementation of the federal REAL ID \n     Act of 2005, and to report its findings and recommendations \n     on whether or not Louisiana should implement the federal REAL \n     ID Act of 2005; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Louisiana REAL ID Act of 2005 Task Force \n     shall be comprised of the following members:\n       (1) The president of the Senate, or his designee.\n       (2) The speaker of the House of Representatives, or his \n     designee.\n       (3) The chair of the Senate Committee on Transportation, \n     Highways, and Public Works, or his designee.\n       (4) The chair of the House Committee on Transportation, \n     Highways, and Public Works, or his designee.\n       (5) The deputy secretary of public safety services of the \n     Department of Public Safety and Corrections, or his designee.\n\n[[Page S5497]]\n\n       (6) The commissioner of the office of motor vehicles of the \n     Department of Public Safety and Corrections, or his designee.\n       (7) Each member of the Louisiana congressional delegation \n     or the member's designee; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the members of this task force shall serve \n     without compensation, except per diem or expenses \n     reimbursement to which they may be individually entitled as \n     members of the organizations they represent;

and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the deputy secretary of public safety services \n     of the Department of Public Safety and Corrections, the \n     commissioner of the office of motor vehicles of the \n     Department of Public Safety and Corrections, and each member \n     of Louisiana's congressional delegation.\n       POM-43. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Louisiana urging and requesting the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation to review the basis for the discontinuance of \n     funding of the Bossier Sheriff's Young Marines Program \n     through a Juvenile Accountability Block Grant with the United \n     States Department of Justice, Office of Civil Rights; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 192\n\n       Whereas, since 2002, the Bossier Parish Sheriff's Office \n     has successfully administered the Bossier Sheriff's Young \n     Marines Program, a program sanctioned by the United States \n     Marine Corps which provides community-based physical \n     education programs that are designed to teach young men and \n     women, ages 8 to 18, respect for their bodies through \n     physical fitness, which in return will instill resistance to \n     the temptations of illegal drugs, alcohol and tobacco use; \n     and\n       Whereas, the focus of the program is character-building, \n     along with core values of discipline, leadership, teamwork \n     and commitment and instills into the participants the ideals \n     of honesty, integrity and respect and at-risk youth \n     developing goals for academic success; and\n       Whereas, the program has been partially funded by the \n     Juvenile Accountability Block Grant (JABG) provided by the \n     Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement (LCLE); and\n       Whereas, because of the success of the program, local \n     judges started sentencing court-ordered juveniles to the \n     program as a diversion from jail time; however, the Young \n     Marines Program was never intended to be a ``diversion'' \n     program and the LCLE staff has recommended that the Bossier \n     Parish Sheriff's Office create a new separate program, \n     specifically for court-ordered juveniles; and\n       Whereas, in December 2012, the Sheriff's Office submitted a \n     JABG application for the Bossier Youth Diversion Program \n     which was created similar to the Bossier Sheriff's Young \n     Marines Program, while also incorporating ``Character \n     Counts'' and ``The Great Body Shop'', as recommended by LCLE \n     staff, for court-ordered juveniles only; and\n       Whereas, the Sheriff's Office was advised by the LCLE that \n     pursuant to the direction of the United States Department of \n     Justice, Office for Civil Rights, the program can ``NOT \n     include prayer as part of the Diversion program. Any prayer, \n     even if voluntary, needs to be separate in time or location \n     from the Diversion Program activities.''; and\n       Whereas, on February 22, 2013, the Sheriff's Office \n     responded by email to the LCLE, ``In response to the prayer \n     issue, the time that was offered for prayer was optional for \n     all of the kids. It was led by any child that wanted to \n     volunteer and if there wasn't a volunteer, it became a few \n     moments of silence.''; and\n       Whereas, on March 7, 2013, LCLE responded, at the direction \n     of the United States Department of Justice, requesting an \n     official letter, ``. . . signed by the Sheriff, which states \n     that there will be no prayer activities conducted during the \n     Diversion program . . .'' and that the LCLE ``. . . will not \n     be able to issue an award until this letter is received.''; \n     and\n       Whereas, at that time, the Sheriff withdrew the grant \n     request; and\n       Whereas, on February 6, 2013, the Bossier Parish Sheriff's \n     Office submitted a Program Plan Worksheet requesting the one-\n     time Juvenile Justice Delinquency Prevention funds available \n     for the Bossier Sheriff's Young Marines Program and was \n     denied upon the same grounds involving prayer activities; and\n       Whereas, at this time, the Sheriff's Office has been \n     divested of funding by the LCLE for both the Bossier \n     Sheriff's Young Marines Program and the Bossier Youth \n     Diversion Program due to prayer and the mention of God in the \n     programs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the members of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation are hereby urged and requested to review with the \n     United States Department of Justice, Office of Civil Rights, \n     the basis for the discontinuance of funding of the Bossier \n     Sheriff's Young Marines Program with a Juvenile \n     Accountability Block Grant; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     each member of the Louisiana congressional delegation, the \n     governor, the Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement, and \n     the Bossier Parish Sheriff.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/27/senate-section/article/S5497-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5497-S5498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mrs. MURRAY, from the Committee on Appropriations, \n     without amendment:\n       S. 1243.

A bill to establish a new organization to manage nuclear \nwaste, provide a consensual process for siting nuclear waste \nfacilities, ensure adequate funding for managing nuclear waste, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nintroducing the Nuclear Waste Administration Act.\n  This bipartisan legislation, which has been years in the making, is \nalso cosponsored by Senators Ron Wyden, Lisa Murkowski, and Lamar \nAlexander.\n  This legislation represents our best attempt to establish a workable, \nlong term nuclear waste policy for the United States, something our \nNation lacks today, by implementing the unanimous recommendations of \nthe Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future.\n  First, the bill would create an independent entity, the Nuclear Waste \nAdministration, with the sole purpose of managing nuclear waste.\n  Second, the bill would authorize the siting and construction of three \ntypes of waste facilities: a ``pilot'' waste storage facility for waste \nfrom shut down reactors, additional storage facilities for waste from \nother facilities, and permanent repositories to dispose of nuclear \nwaste.\n  Third, the bill creates a consent-based siting process for both \nstorage facilities and repositories, based on the successful efforts to \nbuild waste facilities in other countries.\n  The legislation requires that local, tribal, and State governments \nmust consent to host waste facilities by signing incentive agreements, \nassuring that waste is only stored in the States and communities that \nwant and welcome it.\n  Fourth, the bill would direct the fees currently collected from \nnuclear power ratepayers to fund nuclear waste management, currently \nabout $750 M annually, into a new Working Capital Fund available to the \nNuclear Waste Administration to fund construction of waste facilities.\n  Finally, the legislation ensures that the new Nuclear Waste \nAdministration will be held accountable for meeting Federal \nresponsibilities and stewarding Federal dollars.\n  The Nuclear Waste Administrator will be appointed by the President \nand confirmed by the Senate. The Administration will be overseen by a \nfive-member Nuclear Waste Oversight Board, modeled on the Defense \nNuclear Facilities Board. The administration will have an Inspector \nGeneral. The administration will not be able to access the corpus of \nthe Nuclear Waste Trust Fund until it reaches agreement with a host \ncommunity. Appropriators may limit the administration's spending, if \nnecessary. Finally, if the agency fails to open a nuclear waste \nfacility by 2025, additional funding will cease.\n\n[[Page S5502]]\n\n  The United States has 104 operating commercial nuclear power reactors \nthat supply \\1/5\\ of our electricity and nearly 75 percent of our \nemissions-free power.\n  However, production of this nuclear power has a significant downside: \nit produces nuclear waste that will take hundreds of thousands of years \nto decay. Unlike most nuclear nations, the United States has no program \nto consolidate waste in centralized facilities.\n  Instead, we leave the waste next to operating and shut down reactors \nsitting in pools of water or in cement and steel dry casks. Today, \napproximately 70,000 metric tons of nuclear waste is stored at \ncommercial reactor sites. This total grows by 2,000 metric tons each \nyear.\n  In addition to commercial nuclear waste, we must also address waste \ngenerated from creating our nuclear weapons stockpile and powering our \nNavy.\n  The byproducts of nuclear energy represent some of the nation's most \nhazardous materials, but for decades we have failed to find a solution \nfor their safe storage and permanent disposal. Most experts agree that \nthis failure is not a scientific problem or an engineering \nimpossibility; it is a failure of government.\n  Although the Federal Government signed contracts committing to pick \nup commercial waste beginning in 1998, the Federal government's waste \nprogram has failed to take possession of a single fuel assembly.\n  Our government has not honored its contractual obligations. We have \nbeen sued, and we have lost. So today, the Federal taxpayer is paying \npower plants to store the waste at reactor sites all over the nation. \nThe cost of this liability is forecast to reach $20 billion by 2020.\n  As we try to manage our growing national debt, we simply cannot \ntolerate continued inaction.\n  In January 2012, the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear \nFuture completed a two-year comprehensive study and published unanimous \nrecommendations for fixing our Nation's broken nuclear waste management \nprogram.\n  The commission found that the only long-term, technically feasible \nsolution for this waste is to dispose of it in a permanent underground \nrepository. Until such a facility is opened, which will take many \ndecades, spent nuclear fuel will continue to be an expensive, dangerous \nburden.\n  That is why the commission also recommended that we establish an \ninterim storage facility program to begin consolidating this dangerous \nwaste, in addition to working on a permanent repository.\n  Finally, after studying the experience of all nuclear nations, the \ncommission found that siting these facilities is most likely to succeed \nif the host states and communities are welcome and willing partners, \nnot adversaries. The commission recommended that we adopt a consent \nbased nuclear facility siting process.\n  Senators Wyden, Murkowski, Alexander, and I introduce this \nlegislation in order to begin implementing those recommendations, \nputting us on a dual track toward interim and permanent storage \nfacilities. The bill also reflects much work by former Senator \nBingaman, who put forward a similar proposal as one of the last bills \nhe wrote.\n  In my view, one of the most important provisions in this legislation \nis the pilot program to begin consolidating nuclear waste at safer, \nmore cost-efficient centralized facilities on an interim basis. The \nlegislation will facilitate interim storage of nuclear waste in above-\nground canisters called dry casks. These facilities would be located in \nwilling communities, away from population centers, and on thoroughly \nassessed sites.\n  Some members of Congress argue that we should ignore the need to \ninterim storage sites and instead push forward with a plan to open \nYucca Mountain as a permanent storage site.\n  Others argue that we should push forward only with repository plans \nin new locations.\n  But the debate over Yucca Mountain, a controversial waste repository \nproposed in the Nevada desert, which lacks State approval, is unlikely \nto be settled any time soon.\n  I believe the debate over a permanent repository does not need to be \nsettled in order to recognize the need for interim storage. Even if \nCongress and a future president reverse course and move forward with \nYucca Mountain, interim storage facilities would still be an essential \ncomponent of a badly needed national nuclear waste strategy.\n  By creating interim storage sites, a top recommendation of the Blue \nRibbon Commission, we would begin reducing Federal liability while \nproviding breathing room to site and build a permanent repository.\n  Interim storage facilities could also provide alternative storage \nlocations in emergency situations requiring spent nuclear fuel to be \nmoved quickly from a reactor site.\n  Both short- and long-term storage programs are vital. Permanently \ndisposing of our current inventory of nuclear waste will take several \ndecades.\n  Because of that long timeline, interim storage facilities allow us to \nachieve significant cost savings for taxpayers and utility ratepayers \nby shuttering a number of nuclear plants.\n  One thing is certain: inaction is the most costly and least safe \noption.\n  Our longstanding stalemate is costly to taxpayers, utility ratepayers \nand communities that are involuntarily saddled with waste after local \nnuclear power plants have shut down.\n  It leaves nuclear waste all over the country, stored in all different \nways.\n  It is long overdue for the government to honor its obligation to \nsafely dispose of the Nation's nuclear waste.\n  This will be a long journey, but we must take the first step.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mrs. Fischer, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Casey, \n        Mr. Franken, and Ms. Klobuchar):\n  S. 1251. A bill to establish programs with respect to childhood, \nadolescent, and young adult cancer; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nFischer, Menendez, Casey, Klobuchar and Franken in the introduction of \nthe Caroline Pryce Walker Conquer Childhood Cancer Reauthorization Act. \nThis legislation is an extension of ongoing bipartisan efforts in the \nSenate over the past decade to hopefully one day cure cancers in \nchildren, adolescents, and young adults.\n  I first started working on this issue after meeting the Haight family \nfrom Warwick, Rhode Island in June of 2004. Nancy and Vincent lost \ntheir son, Ben, when he was just 9 years old to neuroblastoma, a very \naggressive tumor in the brain. With the strong support of families like \nthe Haights for increased research into the causes of childhood cancers \nand improved treatment options, I introduced legislation that \neventually was signed into law in 2008 as the Caroline Pryce Walker \nConquer Childhood Cancer Act.\n  Since then, I have worked to secure funding for these efforts, \nincluding $6 million for the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, CDC, to improve the ability of state cancer registries to \nrapidly collect information on the diagnosis and treatment information \nof children with cancer, and $1 million for the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, HHS, to help educate families about treatment options \nand follow-up care.\n  Then, last year, I met Grace. Grace, from Providence, RI, is now 10 \nyears old and is a survivor of medulloblastoma, another type of tumor \nthat forms in the brain. Grace and her family reminded me that we must \ndo more to ensure biomedical advances can continue so that better \ntreatments will become available.\n  With Ben and Grace, and their families, in mind, I have been working \nto update the original Caroline Pryce Walker Conquer Childhood Cancer \nAct.\n  As such, the reauthorization we are introducing today would help \ncreate a comprehensive children's cancer biorepository for researchers \nto use in searching for biospecimens to study, would improve \nsurveillance of childhood cancer cases, and would require a study of \nways to encourage the development of novel treatments.\n  I am also pleased to be reintroducing the Pediatric, Adolescent, and \nYoung Adult Cancer Survivorship Act. Through increased research and \nadvances in medical innovation, the population of survivors of \nchildhood cancer has grown from just four percent\n\n[[Page S5503]]\n\nsurviving more than five years in 1960 to nearly eighty percent today.\n  Unfortunately, even after beating cancer, as many as \\2/3\\ of \nsurvivors suffer from late effects of their disease or treatment, \nincluding second cancers and organ damage. This legislation would \nenhance research on the late effects of childhood cancers, improve \ncollaboration among providers so that doctors are better able to care \nfor this population as they age, and establish a new pilot program to \nbegin to explore models of care for childhood cancer survivors.\n  We must do more to ensure that children survive cancer and any late \neffects so they can live a long, healthy, and productive life. I look \nforward to working with Senator Fischer, and our colleagues, to see \nthese bills enacted.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANDERS (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1252. A bill to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate \nsegments of the Missisquoi River and the Trout River in the State of \nVermont, as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my Vermont \ncolleague Senator Sanders to introduce the Upper Missisquoi and Trout \nRivers Wild and Scenic River Designation Act.\n  The Upper Missisquoi River gathers itself from snowmelt and from \npristine springs and cedar bogs in the forests of Vermont's Northeast \nKingdom. As it flows from the town of Lowell to the town of Westfield, \nthis lovely mountain brook grows large enough to float a small canoe \nduring its winding journey through Vermont's forests and meadows. A \npaddler on this section is treated to a stream that runs crystal clear \nand abounds with trout and other fish as it winds through pine forest \nand silver maple flood plains, to meadows dotted with grazing Holstein \ncows.\n  The beauty and wildness of the river is undiminished as it swells on \nits journey north through the towns of Westfield, North Troy, and Troy, \nand crosses into the Canadian Province of Quebec. Not far downstream \nthe river reenters the United States and winds its way across more \nmiles of pastoral countryside in Northern Vermont through Richford, \nBerkshire, and Enosburg. Along the way it gathers the ice-cold, \npristine flow of the Trout River in the town of Montgomery.\n  The scenery along the Upper Missisquoi and Trout Rivers in these \ntowns is spectacularly beautiful, the water quality is superb, public \naccess is unlimited, and Vermonters along the shores are eager to share \nthese treasures with visitors from near and far. The Upper Missisquoi \nand Trout Rivers epitomize Wild and Scenic Recreational Rivers of \nnational significance, and I am proud to join Senator Sanders in \nintroducing this legislation.\n  A Federal Wild and Scenic Recreational River designation should only \nbe considered after the resource has been closely studied and if this \ndesignation is actively sought by people living in the area. We can \nreport to the Senate that both of these tests are met for the Upper \nMissisquoi and Trout Rivers.\n  Seven years ago a group of people living along the rivers asked \nVermont's delegation to the Congress to request a Wild and Scenic River \nStudy, and for more than 5 years these Vermonters--with tremendous \nsupport from their neighbors, the neighboring towns, and the National \nPark Service--have assessed the river, turn by turn, mile by mile, and \nthey have worked hard to plan for its protection and recreational use. \nThe study committee kept their neighbors along the rivers and local \nelected leaders fully engaged at every step. Their hard work paid off \nthis past March when the citizens of each of the affected, towns, at \nVermont town meetings--those revered democratic institutions of self-\ngovernment in our State--voted in favor of seeking the Wild and Scenic \nRiver designation.\n  This has been one of the most locally driven and strongly supported \nresource conservation initiatives to come before the Congress, and I \ncommend the study committee and all of Vermonters in these towns for \ntheir hard work and cooperation.\n  A National Wild and Scenic River designation will help these two \nrivers reach their full potential as major engines of the Northeast \nKingdom's tourism economy and at the same time help to ensure that the \necosystem is protected and enhanced for future generations.\n  The Upper Missisquoi River and the Trout River meet each of the \ncriteria for a National Wild and Scenic River designation. The \nmanagement of the rivers has been carefully planned, and the \ndesignation is actively sought by Vermonters living in communities \nalong the rivers. I am proud to join Senator Sanders and Peter Welch, \nVermont's Representative in the other body, in introducing this bill \nand taking this commendable effort to the next level.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Reed, Ms. \n        Cantwell, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1256. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \npreserve the effectiveness of medically important antimicrobials used \nin the treatment of human and animal diseases; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nPreventing Antibiotic Resistance Act.\n  This legislation puts in place reasonable safeguards on when and how \nantibiotics can be used in agriculture.\n  Few people realize that antibiotics are used in animal agriculture; \neven fewer realize the scope of the problem.\n  Last year 29.9 million pounds of antibiotics were sold in the U.S. \nfor meat and poultry production. That is four times what was used in \nall forms of human medicine.\n  But there is more to be concerned about. The vast majority of these \ndrugs are fed to healthy livestock and poultry, with little or no \nveterinary oversight. The drugs are used for growth promotion, to \nfatten up animals before slaughter.\n  At these low levels, the doses are not large enough, or powerful \nenough, to eliminate all the bacteria inside the animal's body. The \nsmall dose only kills off the weakest bacteria, leaving the strongest, \nmost resistant bacteria behind to reproduce.\n  It creates a perfect storm for antibiotic resistance.\n  This isn't just a problem for the animals. These antibiotic resistant \npathogens make their way into our food, our water, and our communities.\n  A recent study published in the medical journal Clinical Infectious \nDiseases found that nearly 50 percent of grocery store meat was \ncontaminated with antibiotic resistant pathogens. Even more concerning, \n25 percent of the meat was contaminated with pathogens that were \nresistant to three or more type of antibiotics.\n  Antibiotics are the closest thing to a ``silver bullet'' in human \nmedicine. They are capable of wiping out a wide variety of bacterial \ninfections. But we are in danger of losing this weapon in the fight \nagainst infectious diseases.\n  Tens of thousands of people in the U.S. die each year from antibiotic \nresistant infections. Unfortunately, we are learning the hard way that \nthese precious, lifesaving drugs no longer work as well as they once \ndid.\n  That is why I am so committed to this bill, to preserve the efficacy \nof these drugs that save lives every day.\n  The Preventing Antibiotic Resistance Act directs the Food and Drug \nAdministration to prohibit the use of antibiotics in ways that \naccelerate antibiotic resistance.\n  The bill requires drug companies and producers to demonstrate that \nthey are using antibiotics to treat clinically diagnosable diseases, \nnot just to fatten their livestock.\n  But the bill takes a nuanced approach; the restrictions only apply to \nthe limited number of antibiotics that are critical to human health. \nAny drug not used in human medicine is left untouched by this \nlegislation.\n  The Preventing Antibiotic Resistance Act also preserves the ability \nof farmers to use all available antibiotics to treat sick animals. If a \nveterinarian identifies a sick animal, or a herd of animals that are \nlikely to become sick, there are no restrictions on what drugs can be \nused.\n  This legislation is not revolutionary. Fifteen years ago Denmark \nbecame the first country to ban the routine use of antibiotics in the \nfood and water of livestock. The entire European Union\n\n[[Page S5504]]\n\nfollowed suit in 2006. Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Korea, Thailand, \nthe Philippines and Japan have also implemented full or partial bans on \nnon-therapeutic uses of antibiotics.\n  But the majority of producers in the U.S. have not followed suit; and \nit is time for a wakeup call.\n  Put simply--irresponsible use of antibiotics endangers us all. And if \nthe drugs can't be used safely, they shouldn't be used at all.\n  Some still refuse to accept the facts; they say that there is no \nevidence that antibiotic use in agriculture leads to infections in \nhumans.\n  They are wrong.\n  Rear Admiral Ali S. Khan, MD, MPH, Assistant Surgeon General and \nDirector of the Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response at \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, testified in the House \nEnergy Committee that ``studies related to Salmonella as both a human \nand animal pathogen, including many studies in the United States, have \ndemonstrated that use of antibiotic agents in food animals results in \nantibiotic resistant bacteria in food animals, resistant bacteria are \npresent in the food supply and are transmitted to humans, and resistant \nbacterial infections result in adverse human health consequences, e.g., \nincreased hospitalization.''\n  Doctor Joshua Sharfstein, Principal Deputy Commissioner of the Food \nand Drug Administration, also testified at the hearing and agreed with \nRear Admiral Khan. The FDA, he said, ``supports the conclusion that \nusing medically important antimicrobial drugs for production purposes \nis not in the interest of protecting and promoting the public health.''\n  Quantitative evidence from the EU and Canada also support this \nconclusion. In response to public health concerns about the rise of \nresistance to the antibiotic cephalosporin in Salmonella and E. coli, \nchicken hatcheries in Quebec voluntarily stopped using the drug in \nFebruary 2005. Following the ban, the public health agency of Canada \nreported a dramatic 89 percent decrease in the incidence of resistant \nsalmonella in chicken meat and 77 percent decrease in related human \ninfections. Once the drug was partially reintroduced in 2007, \nantibiotic resistant infections in people jumped back up 50 percent.\n  Unfortunately we are fighting an uphill battle with antibiotic \nresistant infections. Our tools and resources are diminishing even \nwhile the number and severity of these infections are increasing.\n  One example is Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA. \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, MRSA \ninfections in 1974 accounted for only two percent of the total number \nof staph infections; in 1995 it was 22 percent; and by 2004 it was 63 \npercent.\n  CDC estimates that by 2005, there were 94,360 MRSA infections in the \nUnited States. Tragically, about 19,000 of them, 20 percent, were \nfatal. The primary reason is that MRSA is virtually immune to almost \nevery antibiotic used in modern medicine.\n  By comparison, during the same year there were 17,011 deaths due to \nAIDS; so the scope and consequence of this problem is stunning.\n  Of course not all MRSA is derived from the overuse of antibiotics on \nthe farm. Many infections are acquired in the hospital, and it is \nbelieved that these bacteria became resistant to antibiotics due to the \nmisuse of drugs in human medicine.\n  But MRSA is infecting individuals who have not been in a hospital \nsetting.\n  There is strong evidence that at least one strain of MRSA infecting \npeople is coming directly from livestock. This strain, known as ST398, \nhas been shown to disproportionately infect farmers and their families. \nLike all MRSA, ST398 is resistant to the antibiotics methicillin and \noxacillin. But resistance to other antibiotics is also common among \nST398 strains which make treatment especially challenging.\n  A study by the CDC in December 2009 showed that hospital-acquired \nMRSA strains and community-acquired MRSA strains such as ST398 are \ntrending in opposite directions.\n  The study found that community-acquired MRSA, a type of MRSA that did \nnot emerge in the hospital setting and is not contracted there, \nincreased 700 percent between 1999 and 2006.\n  By contrast, hospital-acquired MRSA cases declined roughly 10 percent \nover this same time period.\n  Over the past decade, it has become clear that MRSA is not just a \nproblem for hospital administrators. More and more individuals are \nacquiring this devastating infection in their homes, at their gyms or \nin restaurants.\n  While it is exceedingly difficult to determine the exact extent that \nantibiotic use in agriculture influences individual MRSA cases, we know \nfor certain that statistical evidence overwhelmingly suggests that a \nreduction of antibiotic use in agriculture will result in a reduction \nof highly resistant MRSA cases.\n  Since the recent data released by the FDA confirm that more than 80 \npercent of all antibiotics sold in this country are for meat and \npoultry producing animals, one can reasonably conclude that a reduction \nof antibiotic use in agriculture will result in a reduction of highly \nresistant MRSA cases.\n  This legislation will very likely reduce the number of resistant \ninfections and will very likely save lives.\n  But some still claim that this legislation may make our food supply \nless safe. They argue that antibiotics keep our animals healthy, and \nhealthy animals make for healthy food.\n  But research shows us that these concerns are misguided. More than \n375 public, consumer and environmental health groups, including the \nAmerican Medical Association, the American Public Health Association, \nand the Infectious Diseases Society of America, support the \nlegislation.\n  This bill makes incremental changes to ensure that our actions on the \nfarm do not negatively impact the health and well being of our farmers, \ntheir families, and every one of us who consume the food they produce.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass these critical \nreforms.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (by request):\n  S. 1268. A bill to approve an agreement between the United States and \nthe Republic of Palau; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to \nstrengthen the relationship between the United States and the Republic \nof Palau, one of our closest and most reliable allies. This \nlegislation, if enacted, would implement the recommendations of the 15-\nyear review called for under the Compact of Free Association between \nour two nations.\n  The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources will be holding a \nhearing on insular issues on Thursday, July 11, and it is my intention \nto add this bill to the agenda for that hearing.\n  Palau is located in the western Pacific about 800 miles south of Guam \nand 500 miles east of the Philippines. The close ties between the U.S. \nand Palau date from World War II, when Japanese forces were defeated in \nthe Battle of Peleliu with a loss of nearly 2,000 U.S. marines. In \n1947, the islands became a District in the United Nations Trust \nTerritory of the Pacific Islands. The United States was appointed \nAdministrating Authority of the Trust Territory with the responsibility \nto promote economic and political development. Because of the United \nStates' strategic interest in this region, the Trust Territory was \nestablished as the only U.N. ``Strategic'' Trust under the authority of \nthe U.N. Security Council, as opposed to the U.N. General Assembly.\n  In 1982, Palau signed a 50-year Compact of Free Association that was \napproved by the U.S. in 1986, P.L. 99-658. The Compact went into effect \non October 1, 1994, and the U.N. Trusteeship was subsequently \nterminated, making Palau a sovereign, self-governing state in free \nassociation with the United States. The Compact provides the U.S. with \nthe ability to deny the use of Palauan territory to the military forces \nof other nations, and to establish military bases in Palau, should the \nneed arise. These security provisions are described by the \nadministration as ``vital'' to U.S. regional security and diplomatic \ninterests.\n  The U.S. and Palau completed a formal review of the Compact in 2010 \nand, on September 10, 2010, signed an agreement with amendments to the \nCompact based on the conclusions and recommendation of the review. The \nbill\n\n[[Page S5505]]\n\nbeing introduced today would approve this agreement and its appendices \nand incorporate them into the law which established the Compact.\n  First, the legislation would extend and phase-out annual financial \nassistance over 11 years, through 2024, for operations, construction, \nmaintenance and trust fund contributions totaling $165 million, or an \naverage of $15 million annually. Second, the legislation significantly \nenhances accountability of U.S. financial assistance by requiring Palau \nto undertake financial and management reforms. Third, the bill would \nrequire any Palauan entering the U.S. to have a Palau passport. This \nwould be the same requirement that was imposed on citizens of \nMicronesia and the Marshall Islands when their Compacts were reviewed \nand amended in 2003.\n  This agreement and legislation reaffirms and strengthens the special \nties between the U.S. and Palau. Together we will continue our \ncommitment to regional security. The United States will continue to be \nresponsible for the security and defense of Palau, and the U.S. is \nhonored to have the continued service of the men and women of Palau in \nthe U.S. armed services. Strategic denial and the associated base \nrights provided for under the Compact were originally designed to \ncounter the Cold War threat in the Pacific. While the Cold War has \nended, the U.S. continues to face new challenges in the region.\n  I look forward to working with officials in the administration and in \nPalau who conducted the Compact Review and concluded this important \nagreement. I urge my colleagues to join with me in approving this \nagreement and assuring the continued strength of this historic \npartnership.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1268\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 190\n\n       Whereas, as of 2013, there are at least 153,000,000 \n     children in the world who have lost at least 1 parent, and of \n     those children, approximately 17,800,000 have lost both \n     parents;\n       Whereas more than 400,000,000 children in developing \n     countries are living in extreme poverty;\n       Whereas more than 115,000,000 children are engaged in \n     hazardous work and more than 5,500,000 children are in \n     situations of forced labor;\n       Whereas 36 percent of girls and 29 percent of boys around \n     the world have been sexually abused;\n       Whereas at least 2,000,000, and probably many more, \n     children are raised in institutional care;\n       Whereas millions of children throughout the world live \n     under conditions of serious deprivation or danger, and \n     children who experience violence or are exploited, abandoned, \n     abused, or severely neglected also face significant threats \n     to their survival and well-being, as well as profound risks \n     that have an impact on their human, social, and economic \n     development;\n       Whereas children in the most dire circumstances, including \n     children without protective family care, or who are living in \n     abusive households, on the streets, or in institutions, \n     trafficked, participating in armed groups, or exploited for \n     their labor, face a multitude of risks posed by extreme \n     poverty, disease, disability, conflict, and disaster;\n       Whereas family reunification, kinship care, and domestic \n     and intercountry adoption promote permanency and stability to \n     a far greater degree than long-term institutionalization;\n       Whereas permanent family care, transitioning children from \n     institutions into protective family care, and preventing \n     violence within households and in schools are associated with \n     reduced infant and child mortality, decreased grade \n     repetition, decreased future criminal activity, decreased \n     drug use and abuse, fewer teen pregnancies, and higher \n     economic earning potential;\n       Whereas past efforts by the United States to assist \n     vulnerable children in low- and middle-income countries have \n     not always been coordinated among the Federal agencies \n     responsible for foreign assistance, and that lack of \n     coordination has sometimes resulted in a fragmented response;\n       Whereas, with the increasing number of children in need, \n     limitations on Federal funding, and multiple Federal agencies \n     involved in efforts to assist children in need, it is more \n     important than ever to improve the coordination and coherence \n     of those efforts in order to maximize the effect on children;\n       Whereas the Assistance for Orphans and Other Vulnerable \n     Children in Developing Countries Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-\n     95; 119 Stat. 2111), which passed the House of \n     Representatives by a vote of 415 to 9 and passed the Senate \n     by unanimous consent, called for a comprehensive, \n     coordinated, and effective response on the part of the \n     Government of the United States to assist the most vulnerable \n     children in the world;\n       Whereas the Special Advisor for Assistance for Orphans and \n     Vulnerable Children appointed under section 135(e) of the \n     Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2152f(e), in \n     coordination with 7 Federal agencies, released the United \n     States Government Action Plan on Children in Adversity as the \n     first-ever whole-of-government strategic guidance for foreign \n     assistance for children provided by the United States; and\n       Whereas the United States Government Action Plan on \n     Children in Adversity seeks to ensure that all activities of \n     the Government of the United States are coordinated among \n     appropriate Federal agencies and integrated into relevant \n     foreign policy initiatives of the United States, with the \n     goal of promoting permanent family care and integrating \n     evidence-based practices that are in the best interest of \n     children: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) a comprehensive action plan for addressing the needs of \n     children living in adversity should be sanctioned by the \n     highest level of the Government of the United States;\n       (2) Federal funding that currently goes toward projects and \n     research benefitting children in low- and middle-income \n     countries should be coordinated among the Federal agencies \n     that receive it with the goals of--\n       (A) promoting permanent family care for the most vulnerable \n     children in the world;\n       (B) reducing the number of children who experience \n     violence, exploitation, or abuse; and\n       (C) eliminating unnecessary duplication and contradictory \n     approaches within the Government of the United States; and\n       (3) the United States Government Action Plan on Children in \n     Adversity has the potential to realize those goals and create \n     a more effective and efficient response by the Government of \n     the United States to assisting the most vulnerable children \n     in the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/27/senate-section/article/S5506-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5506-S5507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 191--DESIGNATING JULY 27, 2013, AS ``NATIONAL DAY OF \n                         THE AMERICAN COWBOY''\n\n  Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Crapo, Mr. \nInhofe, Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, Mr. Johanns, Ms. Heitkamp, Mr. \nMerkley, Mr. Reid, Mr. Risch, and Mr. Tester) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 191\n\n       Whereas pioneering men and women, recognized as \n     ``cowboys'', helped establish the American West;\n       Whereas the cowboy embodies honesty, integrity, courage, \n     compassion, respect, a strong work ethic, and patriotism;\n       Whereas the cowboy spirit exemplifies strength of \n     character, sound family values, and good common sense;\n       Whereas the cowboy archetype transcends ethnicity, gender, \n     geographic boundaries, and political affiliations;\n       Whereas the cowboy is an excellent steward of the land and \n     its creatures, who lives off the land and works to protect \n     and enhance the environment;\n       Whereas cowboy traditions have been a part of American \n     culture for generations;\n       Whereas the cowboy continues to be an important part of the \n     economy through the work of many thousands of ranchers across \n     the United States who contribute to the economic well-being \n     of every State;\n       Whereas millions of fans watch professional and working \n     ranch rodeo events annually, making rodeo one of the most-\n     watched sports in the United States;\n       Whereas membership and participation in rodeo and other \n     organizations that promote and encompass the livelihood of \n     cowboys span every generation and transcend race and gender;\n       Whereas the cowboy is a central figure in literature, film, \n     and music and occupies a central place in the public \n     imagination;\n       Whereas the cowboy is an American icon; and\n       Whereas the ongoing contributions made by cowboys and \n     cowgirls to their communities should be recognized and \n     encouraged: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates July 27, 2013, as ``National Day of the \n     American Cowboy''; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am proud to submit a resolution today to \ndesignate Saturday, July 27, 2013 as National Day of the American \nCowboy. My late colleague, Senator Craig Thomas, began the tradition of \nhonoring the men and women known as ``Cowboys'' 9 years ago when he \nintroduced the first resolution to designate the fourth Saturday of \nJuly as National Day of the American Cowboy. I am proud to carry on \nSenator Thomas's tradition.\n\n[[Page S5507]]\n\n  The national day celebrates the history of Cowboys in America and \nrecognizes the important work today's Cowboys are doing in the United \nStates. The Cowboy Spirit is about honesty, integrity, courage, and \npatriotism, and Cowboys are models of strong character, sound family \nvalues, and good common sense.\n  Cowboys were some of the first men and women to settle in the \nAmerican West and they continue to make important contributions to our \neconomy, Western culture and my home State of Wyoming today. This \nyear's resolution designates July 27, 2013, as the National Day of the \nAmerican Cowboy. I hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing the \nimportant role Cowboys play in our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/27/senate-section/article/S5507-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 192--COMMEMORATING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \nBATTLE OF GETTYSBURG AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS BATTLE IN THE HISTORY \n                          OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. CASEY (for himself and Mr. Toomey) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
