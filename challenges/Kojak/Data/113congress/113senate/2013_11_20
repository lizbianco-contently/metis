Mr. President, in recent weeks we have seen a lot of \nhand-wringing on the other side of the aisle over ObamaCare--a little \nshock here, a little dismay there, and more than a little feigned \noutrage. What we haven't seen, of course, is anything even approaching \na good answer as to why the President told the American people one \nthing and then did the other or a solution to the national crisis of \nmillions--millions--of Americans, some with very serious medical \nconditions heading into the holiday season having just been told they \nwould lose their health care plans.\n  The folks who voted for this law and the President whose name it \nbears did everything they could to keep these folks in the dark about \nthe realities of ObamaCare for more than 3 years--3 long years. But the \nproblems we are seeing shouldn't come as news to anyone, least of all \nour Democratic friends, because what we have seen are the utterly \npredictable consequences of ObamaCare.\n  The fact is a lot of folks warned about these kinds of consequences \ncoming to pass, but the President's political machine just steamrolled \nanybody who spoke up--ran right over them. They laughed it all off, \ndismissed everyone else as naysayers and cynics, when all the while \nthey basically knew--they knew--we were right.\n\n[[Page S8294]]\n\n  Countless independent experts, health care professionals, and \ninsurance authorities across the country all warned--all of them \nwarned--about what we are seeing right now. So did many of us. If only \nthe Democrats who run Washington had listened. But the President needed \ntheir votes for a bill he hoped would define his legacy, so they \ngambled that their constituents would just learn to live with ObamaCare \nand forget the false promises. That was the gamble. In other words, \nWashington Democrats were specifically warned about the consequences we \nare seeing, and they voted for ObamaCare anyway.\n  Republicans repeatedly warned about Americans losing their health \nplans--repeatedly. We repeatedly warned about Americans losing access \nto doctors and to hospitals. We repeatedly warned about rising costs \nand skyrocketing premiums. Check the Congressional Record. We warned \nand we warned and we warned about each of these.\n  Frankly, we shouldn't have had to do that. It doesn't take an actuary \nto figure this stuff out, and the issues my constituents now have to \nput up with as a result of this law are just simply unacceptable.\n  Kimberly Maggard from Nicholasville wrote that the health plan \navailable to her through the ObamaCare exchange--now listen to this--\nwould cost more than her family's house payment and car payment \ncombined. Kimberly Maggard from Nicholasville in my State wrote that \nthe health plan available to her through the ObamaCare exchange would \ncost more than her family's house payment and car payment combined.\n  Here is what she said:\n\n       We are just average Kentuckians working and living paycheck \n     to paycheck without any assistance from government programs. \n     I really don't know what we will do if they have to pay that \n     amount out for insurance. We might lose our home . . . our \n     transportation . . . my daughter might have to drop out of \n     college . . . the list goes on and on. What are we supposed \n     to do?\n\n  Harriet White from Rockville said that ObamaCare is negatively \nimpacting her family's finances and quality of care. Here is what she \nsaid:\n\n       The sad truth is that like my coworkers, my deductible has \n     doubled along with my premiums. The only way to be able to \n     adjust is for us to either reduce or stop our 401(k) \n     contributions. This is hardly affordable health care.\n\n  Here is what Larry Thompson from Lexington said:\n\n       [The] health plan that I've had for 10 years just got \n     cancelled, and the least expensive plan on the exchange is \n     the 246 percent increase--that means hundreds of extra \n     dollars per month we don't have.\n\n  Look, all of this is completely and totally unacceptable, and so many \nof ObamaCare's consequences were basically predicted by Republicans \nyears ago--years ago.\n  So it is no wonder vulnerable Democrats are dashing for the exits, \nperforming political contortions that would make Houdini blush. But \nhere is the issue: Until these folks are willing to face reality, I \ndoubt it will matter.\n  One of our colleagues on the other side was asked back in 2009 if she \nwould accept ``100 percent responsibility'' and ``100 percent \naccountability'' for the failure or success of any legislation she \nvoted for. She said she would. So she and her colleagues now have a \nchoice. They can keep trying to distance themselves from ObamaCare in \npublic while simultaneously protecting it from meaningful change in \nprivate--to keep standing by as this train wreck unloads on the middle \nclass--or they can simply accept that they were wrong to ignore all the \nwarnings, and then work with Republicans to repeal and replace \nObamaCare with real bipartisan health care reform. That is the choice.\n  If Washington Democrats are looking for a political exit, that is the \nonly meaningful one available--the only exit. If they are looking for \nthe best policy outcome to do right by the people who elected them, \nthey will reach the same conclusion. That is the good news.\n  I hope they will get there soon because we have already seen \nWashington Democrats travel through just about every one of the stages \nof grief: Denial at first, claiming the law's only problem is that it \nwas just too popular; then anger, pointing fingers of blame at \ncontractors, Republicans, of course, the media--really anyone but \nthemselves, then bargaining, proposing nips and tucks to a law that \nneeds an overhaul instead.\n  For the sake of our country, let's hope they just speed right along \nto acceptance--the acceptance that ObamaCare can't work and won't work, \nand that their constituents deserve better. When they do, Republicans \nwill be right here, just as we have always been, ready to work with \nthem to start over with real reforms that decrease costs and improve \naccess to care. That is what our constituents wanted all along, and \nthat is just what we should give them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/20/senate-section/article/S8294-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague from \nNew Mexico to protest the paralysis that has kept the Senate from \nconfirming well-qualified nominees to do their jobs.\n  The U.S. Senate provides the opportunity for all of us to weigh in on \nour constitutional role of advice and consent, advice and consent \nregarding nominations to the executive branch and to the judicial \nbranch by the President.\n  Everyone in this body agrees that the Senate should, under this \nresponsibility, serve as a significant check on the quality of \nPresidential nominations, the quality of nominations or nominees for \nthe court and for executive positions. I certainly share that \nsentiment, that the Senate should provide this significant check on \nquality. The Senate should vet nominees. We should question them. We \nshould debate them. And then we should vote on whether to confirm or \nreject them.\n  What is absolutely clear, however, is that when advice and consent \nbecomes block and destroy, then the Senate process is broken. A \nminority of one branch of government should never be able to \nsystematically undermine the other two branches of government. Yet that \nis exactly what we have today.\n  Look at the well-qualified nominees who have been blocked from having \nan up-or-down vote here in the Senate Chamber just in recent weeks: Mel \nWatt, nominated to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency; and then \nnominees to the court: Patricia Millett, Cornelia Pillard, and now \nRobert Wilkins.\n  These folks are highly qualified, but they were not allowed to have \nan up-or-down vote. The Senate was not allowed to weigh in on whether \nthey were to be confirmed or not confirmed. This situation in which the \nSenate minority undermines the executive and judicial branches is \nunacceptable. It is inconsistent with the concept of coequal branches \nof government. Our Constitution laid out this vision that the House and \nthe Senate, as the legislative branch, would serve as a coequal branch \nwith the executive branch and the judicial branch.\n  Certainly the ability to check nominations, to vet nominations, is \npart of that check on the other two branches. But when it is used in \nthis manner, this manner in which you can systematically undermine the \nfunction of another branch, then you have taken a position and created \na process that is inconsistent with coequal branches. Taken to its \nextreme--and we are seeing that extreme today--the executive branch is \ncompromised in its ability to function, the judicial branch is \ncompromised in its ability to function.\n  Now we have a special situation that has arisen in which the minority \nsays: We are going to block all nominees to the DC Circuit Court \nregardless of their qualifications because we want to\n\n[[Page S8295]]\n\nsee it dominated by the nominees from a former President, and we do not \nlet the existing President put his fair share of nominees into those \nvacancies.\n  The argument has been brought forward--to cover up this effort to \nideologically pack the court--that this is simply about the work \nrequirements of that circuit not being high enough to justify \nadditional judges. Yet if that was indeed the case and there was an \neffort to distinguish it from the ideological bent that is clear here, \nthen that would be something one would say about the future: Let's \nimplement that 8 years down the road or we would have seen it in the \npast when President Bush was putting his nominees forward. The \nRepublicans would have said: No, we do not want to confirm these \nnominees because the workload is not heavy enough. But just a few years \nago, the argument was very much: Let's confirm these nominees of \nPresident Bush. Well, the workload, if anything, has increased.\n  So we cannot allow this process in which a minority says: When our \nPresident is in charge we are going to insist on up-or-down votes, but \nwhen a President of the other party is in charge, we are not going to \nallow those votes.\n  Let's be clear: There should not be an ``our President'' and ``their \nPresident.'' The President is the President of the entire country, of \nthe blue States and the red States, altogether. The judicial system \nserves all of us regardless of our party identities. It is our \nresponsibility to make it work.\n  In January we had a promise made on the floor of this Chamber, and \nthat promise from Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was to restore the \n``norms and traditions of the Senate'' regarding nominations.\n  What are the norms and traditions of the U.S. Senate regarding \nnominations? It is an up-or-down vote, with rare exception. But, \nunfortunately, as we stand here today, we see that January promise has \nbeen broken. It was broken a few weeks into this year when a filibuster \nfor the first time in U.S. history was launched on a Defense Secretary \nnominee. We then saw it in July--another effort of this Chamber to come \ntogether and return to the norms and traditions of the Senate. And \nbriefly we did have up-or-down votes on executive branch nominees. But \nthat ended a couple weeks ago when Mel Watt was blocked from that \nopportunity. So, therefore, the Senate must act. The Senate must act to \nrestore its traditional role of having an up-or-down vote.\n  I, quite frankly, would prefer, in a perfect world, to see this done \nsimply through the type of agreement we have sought a couple of times: \nup-or-down votes, with rare exception. But it is clear that is not \npossible because the January promise was broken, because the July \npromise was broken, and, therefore, we are in the position where we \nhave to do by rule that which cannot be done by simple cooperation.\n  Some have said this has never been done, changing the rules or the \napplication of the rules by a simple majority in the middle of a term. \nBut that is simply not the case. I have in my hand a list of 18 times \nwhen this has been done since 1977. I have put up a chart in the \nChamber of some of those changes that are quite relevant to this \ndiscussion.\n  By a simple majority in 1977: preventing postcloture filibusters; in \n1979, by a simple majority: preventing abuse of legislative amendments \nin appropriations bills; in 1980, preventing filibusters on the motion \nto proceed to nominations and treaties; in 1987, preventing filibusters \nvia rollcall of the Journal.\n  I have put these up for those instances that pertain to filibusters. \nBut these are only 4 of the 18 times since 1977 that we have changed \nthe application of the rules by a simple majority. So let no one say \nthis is unprecedented. And these 18 changes have come more often in \nRepublican hands than the hands of Democrats in terms of the majority \nof this body.\n  It is time to end the block-and-destroy strategy being employed by \nthe minority in regard to executive branch nominations and judicial \nnominations.\n  I am very honored to be a partner in this conversation with the \nsenior Senator from New Mexico, who has been raising concerns about the \nfunctionality of the Senate from the day he first set foot in this \nChamber.\n  With that, I yield for my colleague.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Merkley and I be allowed to engage in a colloquy following my \nremarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I could not agree more with \nwhat Senator Merkley pointed out. There has been a lot of discussion--\nespecially as shown on that chart the Senator talked about--that we \nhave done this before. When the Senate hits a roadblock, we can come \nback to our majority powers and get through the roadblock and continue \nto do business, to do business as the Senate and do the business we \nwere sent here to do.\n  As the Senator noted, I remember I called for rules reform 4 years \nago. I said the Senate was a graveyard for good ideas. I remember \ntalking about that in my campaign and coming here, and I am sorry to \nsay little has changed, that the digging continues.\n  Americans are tired, I believe, with the gridlock and the dysfunction \nin Washington--filibusters, shutdowns, hyperpartisan attacks. Americans \nwant reform in the way their government operates: more cooperation, \nmore transparency, less partisanship, more problem solving.\n  Monday's vote was one more example of why we need reform. Judge \nRobert Wilkins is well qualified to serve on the Court of Appeals for \nthe DC Circuit. He deserved an up-or-down vote. Instead, what did we \nget? Another filibuster. He is the fourth nominee to that court to be \ntrampled on by the minority--not because he is unqualified, not because \nof any failing on his part, but because a Democratic President \nnominated him. For some that is enough, that is all it takes to tell an \neminent American to go home.\n  First it was Caitlin Halligan in March, then Patricia Millett last \nmonth, followed by Nina Pillard last week, and now Robert Wilkins--each \nof them exceptional, every one of them distinguished nominees. Each \nwould be a credit to the court of appeals.\n  So No. 4, and counting. In baseball, three strikes and you are out. \nNot so in the Senate.\n  But this is not just about the rules. It is about having a Senate \nthat works--not one that buckles under the weight of filibusters.\n  The partisan games continue, and the game has gone on long enough \nbecause the losers are the American people.\n  Senators Merkley and Harkin and I proposed changes to the rules at \nthe beginning of this Congress--rules changes that were fair. They \nreined in the abuse. They protected the minority. We were very clear. \nWe called for a talking filibuster. We argued that if the minority \nwants to continue debate, which is what voting against cloture is, they \nshould actually have to stand on the floor and debate. Come down here, \nif you want to slow things down, and get on the floor and debate.\n  Instead, a compromise was reached. The two leaders agreed to ``work \ntogether to schedule votes on nominees in a timely manner by unanimous \nconsent, except in extraordinary circumstances.'' That was the standard \nand the test: ``extraordinary circumstances.''\n  The minority leader said:\n\n       On the subject of nominations, Senate Republicans will \n     continue to work with the majority to process nominations, \n     consistent with the norms and traditions of the Senate.\n\n  That was the agreement, and we all know it has not been kept.\n  In July, we had another shutdown on confirmations--all qualified \ncandidates, all prepared to serve, but nominated by a Democratic \nPresident--or asked to lead agencies the other side does not like: the \nDepartment of Labor, the EPA, the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau--all blocked.\n  Once again we looked at changing the rules with a simple majority to \nrestore the Senate's ability to function. We had a historic meeting in \nthe Old Senate Chamber, and we reached another compromise.\n  I was hopeful for the outcome. There was feeling on both sides that \nthings had to change, that we needed to change the way we do business \nhere, and we confirmed several of those nominees.\n\n[[Page S8296]]\n\n  But here we are again back on the filibuster merry-go-round and \ngetting nowhere. Four months later, the same debate, the same partisan \ngames, with qualified nominees denied an up-or-down vote. And not just \njudicial nominees but also Congressman Mel Watt blocked from leading \nthe Federal Housing Finance Agency.\n  The only ``extraordinary circumstance'' has been continual \nobstruction.\n  These are not the norms and traditions of the Senate. It is the \nfailure of partisan politics. In fact, it was not long ago that \nRepublicans were the first to say so during the Bush administration. \nThey were up in arms. Why? Because 10 judicial nominations had been \nblocked--10, mind you. That number seems quaint now, but it was enough \nfor the Republicans.\n  Here is what the Republican policy committee said in 2005. These are \ntheir words:\n\n       This breakdown in Senate norms is profound. There is now a \n     risk that the Senate is creating a new 60-vote confirmation \n     standard. The Constitution plainly requires no more than a \n     majority vote to confirm. Exercising the constitutional \n     option in response to judicial nomination filibusters would \n     restore the Senate to its longstanding norms and practices \n     governing judicial nominations, and guarantee that a minority \n     does not transform the fundamental nature of the Senate's \n     advice and consent responsibility. This approach, therefore, \n     would be both reactive and restorative.\n\n  Restoring the Senate to its longstanding norms and practices. It \nwould be difficult to state the case more clearly.\n  One of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle said: We should \nbe careful what we wish for; that is, majority rule could backfire, \nwhich might get more Justice Scalias.\n  Well, that is exactly the point. The Constitution does not give me \nthe right to block a qualified nominee no matter who is in the White \nHouse. The real norms and traditions of the Senate honor that \nprinciple. Some of us may disagree with Justice Scalia on judicial \nphilosophy, but he was a qualified nominee. He received an up-or-down \nvote and he was unanimously confirmed. Likewise, Justice Ruth Bader \nGinsburg was considered liberal, the former ACLU general counsel. Many \non the other side may have disagreed with her views, but there was no \nfilibuster. She was confirmed by a vote of 96 to 3. A minority in the \nSenate should not be able to block qualified nominees.\n  On the other side of the aisle, this is not advise and consent; this \nis obstruct and delay. The people elect the President. They give him or \nher the right to select a team to govern and to appoint judges to the \nFederal bench. If those nominees are qualified, they deserve an up-or-\ndown vote. That is how our democracy is intended to work. That is the \nmandate of our Constitution. That is the real tradition of the Senate. \nThat is the way it is supposed to work. It has worked that way in the \npast.\n  My father was Secretary of the Interior for President Kennedy. He \nlater told me--when I asked him how long it took to get his team in \nplace at Interior, he said, ``Tom, I had virtually my entire team in \nplace in the first 2 weeks''--in place and ready to serve the American \npeople in 2 weeks. The President's team is his team to choose so long \nas they are qualified to do the job.\n  My colleague on the other side is right. The winds can change. Let's \nbe candid. Neither side is 100 percent pure. Both sides have had their \nmoments of obstruction and, no doubt, their reasons at the time. But I \ndo not think the American people care much about that. They do not want \na history lesson or a lesson in parliamentary procedure. They want a \ngovernment that is fair. They want a government that is reasonable and \nthat works for them.\n  I say to Senator Merkley, we are back in this situation now where we \nstarted as we came in the Senate in 2008 and saw a broken Senate, a \nSenate that was not responding to the American people.\n  What I wanted to ask the Senator about, because to me it is one of \nthe troublesome parts of what is happening with these judges, the last \nfour judges who have been filibustered have been women. I think we are \ntalking about a different standard because in between the four, a man \ngot onto the same court, was voted in, but three women have been held \nup and filibustered: Caitlin Halligan, Patricia Millett, Nina Pillard. \nSo over and over we have this kind of obstruction. Does the Senator \nthink we have a double standard? Is it one standard when we look at \nwhat has happened recently on the court of appeals where a man gets on \nand three women get denied?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I say to my colleague from New Mexico, I would say that \nit has been very disturbing to see these very capable women whom you \nhave mentioned not be able to get an up-or-down vote. Indeed, our chair \nof the Judiciary Committee Senator Leahy held a press conference to \nmake this very concern known, that it seemed as if there is one process \nfor men and a different process for women. I am going to defer to his \njudgment on that because I have not been part of the Judiciary \nCommittee. I would like to think that in this day and age there is not \nthat sort of gender bias. That is what I would like to think, but I \nwill let Senator Leahy's commentary and his concerns in that area speak \nfor themselves. It is clear, though, that fundamentally the situation \nis this: These women were highly qualified. They did not get up-or-down \nvotes.\n  I have in my hand a memo from April 25, 2005. It is titled ``The \nSenate's Power to Make Procedural Rules by Majority Vote.'' It consists \nof arguments made by the Republican majority in 2005 that nominees \nshould get up-or-down votes for the judiciary. There are many quotes \nfrom colleagues who still serve in this body who said in 2005 that \nregardless of whether they were in the majority or the minority, they \nfelt nominees deserved an up-or-down vote, that the Constitution \ndemanded it, and that the balance of powers between the branches \ndemanded it.\n  I would ask my colleague if he would help us understand what has \nchanged since 2005 when our colleagues across the aisle made the case \nthat nominees deserved up-or-down votes, said it was essential in the \nconstitutional vision, was essential in the proper application of \nadvice and consent. What has changed that makes those arguments \ndisappear now in 2013, 8 years later?\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I think we have come back to the central \nquestion. That question is, How does our Constitution work when it \ncomes to nominees? I do not have any doubt that we are talking about \nmajorities. There are only five places in the Constitution where a \nsupermajority is mentioned. It is not mentioned when it deals with \nadvice and consent, judicial nominees, or Presidential nominees to the \nexecutive branch.\n  I think the Republican policy committee said it very well in the memo \nthe Senator is talking about. It was authored at the time when the head \nof the policy committee was John Kyl. He was the chairman of the policy \ncommittee, known in the Senate as a good lawyer, and was respected \non the Constitution. He wrote about the Constitution and how the \nConstitution should work. He said a couple of things that I think are \ninteresting. This was back on April 25, 2005:\n\n       The filibustering Senators are trying to create a new \n     Senate precedent--a 60-vote requirement for the confirmation \n     of judges--contrary to the simple-majority standard presumed \n     in the Constitution.\n\n  A little bit further on, he also said:\n\n       An exercise of the constitutional option--\n\n  That means taking an action to put a judge on the court with a \nmajority vote--\n\n     The exercise of the constitutional option under the current \n     circumstance would be an act of restoration--a return to the \n     historic and constitutional confirmation standard of simple-\n     majority support for all judicial nominations.\n\n  So I do not think anything has changed. I do not think it has changed \nfrom the time in 2005 to today. I do not think the Constitution has \nchanged from the time we put it into place until today, that when it \ncomes to those nominees the traditions and norms of the Senate are to \nhave the majority have a say, that they get an up-or-down vote.\n  That is the situation right now. We have a filibuster going on on a \nnumber of nominees, both Presidential nominees and judicial nominees. \nSo I think what we are trying to do in working with our leadership is \nsay: Let's go back to the norms and traditions of the Senate where we \nuse the majority wisely and give that advice and consent.\n\n[[Page S8297]]\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank the Senator for expanding on that picture of the \ncore elements necessary to exercise our constitutional \nresponsibilities. I keep thinking about how polarization in our society \nhas come to bear on this issue. I believe there are many colleagues \nacross the aisle who believe very much in what they said in 2005, that \nthere should be up-or-down votes; therefore, I have to conclude that \nthey have decided their base demands a permanent campaign against the \nPresident and the maximum use of every tool available and that is \ntrumping the appropriate exercise of advice and consent.\n  Perhaps that polarization explains why the promise made by the \nminority leader in January to return to the norms and traditions of the \nSenate fell apart within weeks, if not days. Perhaps it explains how \nthe understanding that was reached in July to allow up-or-down votes on \nexecutive nominations fell apart a couple of weeks ago. In that \nsituation we have a single path left to us to appropriately exercise \nadvice and consent; that is, to change the rules so they cannot be \nabused. If the abuse cannot be cured through good-hearted dialog and \nunderstanding of our need to honor the constitutional vision, then we \nneed to change the rules. That is why I wholeheartedly support moving \ntoward a simple up-or-down vote.\n  In 2005 our Republican colleagues said: If the Democrats keep \nblocking up-or-down votes, we are going to change the rules and require \na simple majority. The Gang of 14 came out with a compromise, and they \nsaid--the compromise was that Democrats would only filibuster under \nextraordinary circumstances and Republican colleagues would then not \nchange the rules. But actually that worked fine in that the Democrats \nhonored that until President Obama came into office. But that \nextraordinary circumstance has not continued to be honored after \nPresident Obama came into office. In that situation, it does seem as if \nthe only way to make sure we honor the constitutional vision and the \nbalance between the powers is to actually change the rules and say it \nis an up-or-down vote.\n  I would ask my colleague from New Mexico whether he shares that \nperspective or perhaps has a different take on it.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I do not think there is any doubt in this \ncountry that on both sides--the Republican side and the Democratic \nside--the base pushes us hard. I think we have reached this stage of \nhyperpartisanship. I believe our job as leaders is to overcome that and \nto lead. Leading here means allowing the norms and traditions of the \nSenate to continue, and that would be an up-or-down vote on judicial \nnominees.\n  What I asked the Senator about what was particularly troublesome to \nme was when we look at the history, the last two women who were put \nonto the Supreme Court--Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan--75 percent of \nthe Republicans in the Senate voted against both of them. So we have \nthat history compared with the women who have been denied here. It is \nvery troubling to me to see that.\n  I think we are supposed to wrap up. I do not know whether the Senator \nhas any closing comments.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank my colleague from New Mexico for his leadership \nin trying to restore the Senate so that it will work--work on \nlegislation, work on executive nominations, work on judicial \nnominations. The country has a low opinion of the function of our \nChamber. We certainly do not deserve a high opinion when we are \ncaptured by this level of partisan paralysis. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work together to help restore this body to a great \ndeliberative body that fulfills its responsibilities under our \nConstitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/20/senate-section/article/S8297-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8297-S8298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OBAMACARE\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I come to the floor to discuss reports I have heard from \nmy fellow Nebraskans about the President's health care law.\n  Senators have been quoting facts, figures, and reports about the \nnegative effects of this law, and that dates back to when the debate \nbegan in 2009. The reality is that no amount of facts or figures can \nillustrate the real-life stories from our hometowns and from the Main \nStreets of Nebraska. These personal stories are compelling and powerful \nexamples of what the reports have been saying all along, why we must \nstand with the American people, and repeal ObamaCare.\n  A woman named Deb from Kearney, NE, reached out to me. As millions of \nother Americans, her family's insurance plan has been cancelled, \nnotwithstanding the President's promise that if you like your plan, you \ncan keep it, period.\n  Now she is facing new premiums for her family. They have increased an \nunbelievable 133 percent. Their plan pays for maternity coverage, even \nthough they no longer need maternity coverage. Why? Because ObamaCare \nmandates this, they have no choice about it.\n  Deb said:\n\n       Obama needs to call it like it is. This is not the \n     affordable health care act.\n\n  Jennifer, from Madison, NE, reached out to me with a very compelling \nstory. Jennifer is a two-time cancer survivor. She shared that last \nyear she spent a fair amount of time evaluating health care plans, \ndoing her homework. She picked a plan that made a lot of sense for her \nfamily under her circumstances. Recently, Jennifer learned that her \ncurrent plan would no longer be available because of the health care \nlaw's new requirements. She described her new plan and said:\n\n       My deductible is going up, my co-insurance is going up, and \n     my premium is almost doubling. . . . I think it is an insult \n     to hard working, responsible people like myself to require me \n     to pay for coverage of all these additional services.\n\n  A woman named Hannah from Lincoln, NE, 25 years old, is seeing \nmassive increases as well. Her monthly premium is increasing by about \n160 percent, and her annual deductible is more than doubling to over \n$6,000. She explains:\n\n       I'm healthy and active--I love long-distance running--and I \n     rarely get sick. This is impossible for my budget. I feel \n     like Obama is punishing those of us who have graduated \n     college and are working hard trying to make a life for \n     ourselves. We're starting our families, building businesses, \n     launching our careers, and trying to give back to our \n     communities however we can. Now ObamaCare is devastating the \n     American dream of an entire generation.\n\n  These Nebraskans and people all over this great country are \nunderstandably frustrated. There has been a lot of talk recently about \nthis law. There has been a lot of talk about the President's promises. \nOver the course of the last 4 years, none of his promises have centered \non American families such as these who are losing the plans they like \nor who are paying more for their coverage. None of its promises \nindicated that young people's costs, such as Hannah's, would go through \nthe roof.\n  One wonders if there had been honesty in this debate whether the bill \nwould ever have passed. In fact, President Obama's promises signal just \nthe opposite. He said over and over that people could keep their plans \nif they liked them. He even put a ``period'' there, and he said they \nwould pay less.\n  These consequences are not happening by accident. They are the \ncentral pillars of the President's law, ObamaCare. The law mandated \ncoverage standards for health insurance plans and forced people into \npolicies that meet those mandates.\n  What is the result? The result is a law that drives up costs. It \neliminates choices. It is motivated by a simple guiding principle; that \nis, that Nebraskans and Americans can't decide for themselves. It is \nmotivated by a principle that government knows best. It is saying that \nthe health insurance people freely chose is an inferior plan because \nthe President and his people say so. It says that government must \nprotect people from their own decisionmaking.\n  That is not what the American people want and is not the kind of \ncountry they want to live in. They have spoken loudly and clearly, \nespecially when the truth came out as the realities of ObamaCare are \nsettling into their daily lives.\n  The frustrating part is that the President's announcement last week \nthat Americans can supposedly keep their plans was provoked not by \ndevastating stories of millions of Americans or Nebraskans but by \nmembers of\n\n[[Page S8298]]\n\nhis own party who are now in a panic about their reelection. To the \nAmerican people, to the people I represent in Nebraska, this is far too \nlittle and far too late.\n  In 2010, the administration's own rule on this subject showed as many \nas 80 percent of small business plans and 69 percent of all business \nplans would lose their grandfathered status. I went to the Senate floor \nat the time to warn about it. Everyone on this side of the aisle voted \nto cancel this ill-advised ObamaCare regulation. Let me remind everyone \nthat every single Senator on the other side of the aisle voted to let \nthis destructive rule go forward. Now Americans and Nebraskans are \npaying the price for that vote.\n  Taking action 3 years ago would have been a very thoughtful step to \navoiding disastrous consequences, but a surprise announcement caught \neverybody by surprise. Essentially 45 days to undo 3 years of ObamaCare \ndamage, to protect people in their reelection, is not a serious policy \neffort. If a team is five touchdowns behind, they can't wait until \nthere is 1 minute left to start playing. Let's face it. President \nObama's announcement last week was not a policy decision. It was an \nattempt to arrive at a political fix to save reelection for members of \nhis party. Once again he sidestepped Congress and the legislative \nprocess to unilaterally enact a temporary delay of one of his signature \nlaw's major provisions. Let me emphasize, it is temporary. It is only \ndesigned to get us past election day and to try to save some seats for \nhis party.\n  Even if people believe that insurance companies and every insurance \ncommissioner in 50 States can undo all of the planning they have done \nto comply with ObamaCare, to follow the rules--even if one assumes they \ncan undo that in 45 days, our citizens will be back in the same boat \nnext year after election day. The cancellation policies will again be \nprinted. The replacement ObamaCare-approved policies will reveal \nskyrocketing prices, and our citizens will be back in the same lurch. \nThe time for temporary fixes that shift the blame or delay the pain \nuntil the election is over needs to end.\n  While I will fight to eliminate this law's most burdensome \nprovisions, the truth is that changes to this law create an avalanche \nof consequences. The provisions of this failed policy are so \ninterconnected, so ill-fated, that no amount of amending and tweaking \nwill solve the problems that American families and businesses are \nfacing. We have only seen the tip of the iceberg. I believe full repeal \nis the only real answer for American families.\n  Congress can take a stand so millions of Americans can keep their \ndoctors and keep the plans they like. We don't need a 2,700-page law \nand $1 trillion in taxes to address the cost of health care or to help \nindividuals with preexisting conditions.\n  Americans are demanding what they didn't get in 2010 and since this \nlaw passed. They are demanding transparency. They are demanding \nthoughtful policy steps for a better, more efficient, and lower cost \nhealth care system. They want leaders who recognize we are not on the \nright track; we never have been with this law. It is time to head in a \ndirection that puts Americans first, not political opportunity.\n  I believe this is a critical moment. I hope we seize upon this moment \nand do all we can to listen to the American people.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/20/senate-section/article/S8298-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TRIBUTE TO STAFF\n\n  Mr. BLUNT.

I want to talk a few minutes about what is happening with \nhealth care. I came to the floor last week to talk about individuals \nwho were having problems. People are contacting our office. In fact, I \nsuspect they are contacting 100 Senate offices every day expressing \ntheir concerns as they lose insurance.\n  At least 4.2 million Americans have now received cancellation notices \non the insurance they had. I know last week the President made his \nproposal that apparently you could keep the insurance you like for 1 \nyear if your insurance company will still offer it and if the State \ninsurance commissioner will approve it. But those are two pretty big \nifs and certainly nowhere close to ``you can keep your insurance if you \nlike it, period. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor, \nperiod.'' Neither of those is going to turn out to be the case. In \nfact, insurance commissioners immediately--their organization--said \nthis is going to be practically very hard to comply with. So it is one \nof many problems.\n  I think the law that is most likely to apply with the Affordable Care \nAct will be the law of unintended consequences--consequences for \nindividuals, consequences for people who had preexisting conditions and \nwho in 35 States were being well served by something called the high-\nrisk pool. Virtually all of those high-risk pools go out of existence \non December 31. I know the Missouri high-risk pool goes out of \nexistence on December 31, and the 4,300 people who depend on that for \ntheir insurance now have to find insurance on their own. They can get \ninsurance through the exchange, but in all cases I have heard of so \nfar, they will be paying more for their insurance on January 1 than \nthey are paying for coverage today or will pay through the end of this \nyear. So much for helping people with preexisting conditions. There was \ncertainly a way to extend those high-risk pools, but we didn't do that.\n  This week I had a number of businesses talking about the problems \nthey are having. I would like to briefly talk about two of them this \nmorning. One of them is the Older Adults Transportation System in our \nState. It is headquartered near the middle of the State in Columbia, \nMO. It provides transportation for seniors, for people who are \ndisabled, for low-income Missourians. Like many, the Older Adults \nTransportation System--called OATS--was notified that their current \nplan would be canceled on January 1. The rate for their new policy for \ntheir 50 full-time employees is going to be 40 percent higher on \nJanuary 1 than the policy they have until December 31, and the only way \nthey can do anything about that is to provide fewer services. So \nbecause of that 40-percent increase, fewer trips will be available to \ntake the people they serve. Surely that wasn't the goal of the health \ncare plan. They wanted to insure their driving staff. There are 600 \ndrivers in that system; they wanted to insure them. They were actually \nhopeful, with all the promises about the Affordable Care Act, that they \nwould be able to add their driving staff. Instead of adding their \ndriving staff, they have to figure out what they are going to do with \nthe 50 employees they have been insuring at rates that are now 40 \npercent higher than they were before.\n  Businesses around the State are calling. I recently heard from \nMcArthur's Bakery in St. Louis. They currently have a 9-percent cap on \na 2-year health policy. It is a qualified plan. Randy, the president of \nMcArthur's Bakery, believes they have a pretty good plan. He thought \ntheir plan was a plan that should meet any standard they would hope to \nmeet. It wasn't a rich plan. He described it to me as not a Cadillac \nplan but at least an Impala plan, and they thought the Impala was what \nthey could do. Suddenly they have learned there is going to be a 4.4-\npercent increase in fees and taxes and a huge increase in the \ndeductible. Their current plan has a deductible of about $500 for an \nindividual and $1,250 for a family. The deductible on the new plan is \ngoing to be about $3,500 for an individual and $10,000 to $12,000 for a \nfamily.\n  That is what I am hearing all the time, that the coverage may be \nbroader, there may be things covered that\n\n[[Page S8299]]\n\ndidn't used to be covered, but the deductible is now so big that the \nplan people thought protected their needs doesn't really protect their \nneeds. For most families, $12,000 is catastrophic. It doesn't take \n$120,000 or $500,000 to be catastrophic; $12,000 is catastrophic. If \nthat becomes your new deductible year after year, you will have a \nproblem you didn't have when your deductible was $1,200.\n  Randy McArthur says:\n\n       The very thing that ObamaCare was supposed to do was to \n     protect the working people--to give them access to affordable \n     insurance--but it's actually doing the exact opposite.\n\n  Instead, this law will mandate coverage for things you will have to \npay for that you didn't have to pay for before and apparently will \noffset that by being sure you pay a lot more of your own money up \nfront.\n  I think we are going to continue to see these problems develop. I \nhope we can find ways to fix that. I introduced a number of bills in \n2009 that I thought were better alternatives than this one. We may have \nto go back and start all over. But right now, the one thing we do know \nis that the law of unintended consequences appears to be hitting a lot \nof families and hitting a lot of families very hard.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight and a half minutes.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I come to the floor today and would \nnote a headline on the front page of Politico today regarding the \nObamaCare Web site. ``Tech Chief: Up to 40% Work Is Left On ObamaCare. \nFinancial management tools are unfinished.''\n  This Web site has been a debacle. People all around the country are \nangry. They are anxious, frustrated, and bothered, but mostly I am \nhearing anger from people in Wyoming. And it is not just the Web site. \nThe Web site is just the tip of the iceberg. People are furious when \nthey get letters of cancellation, when they have coverage canceled and \nthen they see higher premiums. All across the country people are \nfinding out that because of the health care law, they can't keep their \ndoctor. They are hearing stories about fraud, identity theft, and \nhigher copays and deductibles. So I bring to the floor today a couple \nof letters I have received from people in Wyoming.\n  Last week, Veterans Day, I was in Douglas, WY, for the flag-raising \nceremony at the American Legion at 7 a.m. talking to folks--some who \nhad gotten cancellation letters. Let me read a letter from a family in \nDouglas, WY, a small community in Converse County. They say:\n\n       We just found out that our current health insurance policy \n     with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wyoming (which is a $20,000 \n     deductible for our family) will not be allowed after January \n     1st . . . that only those under age 30 will be able to have \n     catastrophic plans. We ranch, work very hard, have been \n     healthy . . . can't afford and don't believe a lower \n     deductible makes sense for us.\n\n  So this is a family who decided what was best for them as a family--\nnot what the government told them they had to buy but what worked for \nthem as a family. They say that what they bought was something that \nmade sense for them.\n  Continuing to read from their letter:\n\n       . . . basically have had insurance to avoid losing our cows \n     and land if something catastrophic happened to us. Don't know \n     what we will do if you guys don't get this derailed.\n\n  Madam President, as someone from the Rocky Mountain West, I can tell \nyou that in a community of lots of ranchers and farmers, what they are \ntrying to do is insure against this catastrophic loss.\n  They go on to say:\n\n       Quick side note--we think most people expect health \n     insurance to cover everyday costs--it wouldn't make sense and \n     it would cost way too much to get insurance to cover new \n     tires, oil changes, washer fluid, new batteries (regular \n     expected upkeep) for our vehicles--if we only had insurance \n     for the big health issues, it wouldn't cost as much for all \n     of us in the end.\n\n  Of course, that is what they wanted to do.\n  They go on:\n\n       Obamacare doesn't deal with any of the issues of why health \n     care in America costs what it does and truly seems to make it \n     all worse.\n       Thank you for what you do--we know you already understand \n     this. We just thought you should know what we are dealing \n     with.\n\n  That is a ranch family in Douglas, WY, in Converse County.\n  This past Saturday night I was in Lusk, WY, in Niobrara County, and I \nhave an email I wish to share with you from Lusk, WY. Again, this is \nsomebody who has had coverage canceled, higher copays, and all of the \nthings we are talking about.\n  Just for a second, let me show the list of the number of people who \nhave been canceled. Some 4.7 million Americans have had their health \ninsurance canceled in 32 States, and we don't even have the numbers for \na number of other States. This is what people all across the country \nare seeing.\n  Let me read this email from Lusk, WY. This individual says:\n\n       I have supported the President and the Affordable Health \n     Care act since the beginning. That changed on Thursday. All \n     along we have been told if we have insurance, and we are \n     satisfied, no changes will be necessary. That is a misleading \n     statement. I was informed by my company my policy will be \n     canceled in December. Then they will offer me another policy \n     but with huge changes. My premium will go up . . . my \n     deductible will rise . . . That is not the same as my current \n     policy. I feel like, after decades of paying my own \n     insurance, I am being penalized. I won't call it lying, but \n     the President certainly misled a lot of us middle aged \n     Americans.\n       I do have one alternative I am pursuing. I can buy \n     insurance that does not meet the guidelines of the Act. \n     However, I will be forced to pay the penalty for \n     noncompliance. I can afford my insurance and the penalty.\n       Once again, Americans do not like to be misled from the top \n     leadership down. It simply helps to solidify the mistrust we \n     have in government.\n       Thank you for your solid leadership.\n\n  That is why I am here today on the floor. We need to hear more \nstories from people around the country--not just Republicans but \nDemocrats need to hear these stories. Tweet us your story at hashtag \n``your story.''\n  Republicans have better ideas about ways we can actually help people \nget the care they need from a doctor they choose at a lower cost.\n  This health care law is hurting many millions of Americans. We now \nknow that the President knew it at the time he continued to repeat the \nline--which we now know is a misleading line--to the American people. \nVery soon we will find that the line ``if you like your doctor, you can \nkeep your doctor'' was misleading as millions more will be losing their \ndoctor. There is great damage continuing to be done. We need to start \nover.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be up to \n6 hours of debate only.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, I rise today to speak about my \namendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, an amendment known \nas the bipartisan Military Justice Improvement Act. I wish to start by \nthanking my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their strong and \nunwavering leadership on behalf of our brave men and women in uniform. \nI could not be more proud of the bipartisan work that has been done to \ndo the right thing.\n  I thank Senator Reid, Senator Booker, and Senator Heller, the three \nmost recent supporters of our bill. I thank them for their \nextraordinary leadership and determination to end the scourge of sexual \nviolence in the military.\n  I also thank my colleague and friend from Missouri for her unwavering \ncommitment to helping victims of sexual assault. Although we disagree \non my amendment, I remind all of our colleagues that the Defense \nAuthorization Act has been made stronger in enumerable ways by Senator \nMcCaskill's work, advocacy, and dedication. I also will be supporting \nher amendment today because I think the provisions in her amendment \nwill add even more positive changes to the command climate and will \nhelp victims feel like they have a stronger voice.\n  However, while the changes in the McCaskill amendment are very good, \nI do not believe they are enough to truly ensure justice for victims of \nsexual assault. For that, we essentially need impartial, unbiased, \nobjective consideration of the evidence by trained military \nprosecutors, which is what my amendment will provide.\n  Yesterday, I proudly stood with retired generals, leaders of veterans \norganizations, and survivors, who represent a growing chorus of \nmilitary voices, to urge Congress to take its oversight role head-on \nand finally create an independent, unbiased military justice system the \nmen and women who serve in our military so deeply deserve.\n  Leaders such as retired Maj. Gen. Martha Rainville, the first woman \nin history of the National Guard to serve as an adjutant general, who \nhas served in the military for 27 years, including 14 years in command \npositions, wrote to me:\n\n       As a former commander, endorsing a change that removes \n     certain authority from military commanders has been a tough \n     decision. It was driven by my conviction that our men and \n     women in uniform deserve to know, without doubt, that they \n     are valued and will be treated fairly with all due process \n     should they report an offense and seek help or face being \n     accused of an offense.\n       When allegations of serious criminal misconduct have been \n     made, the decision whether to prosecute should be made by a \n     trained legal professional. Fairness and justice require \n     sound judgment based on evidence and facts, independent of \n     pre-existing command relationships.\n\n  Leaders such as BG (retired) Lorree Sutton, who served as the top \npsychiatrist in the U.S. Army, wrote, saying:\n\n       Failure to achieve these reforms would be a further tragedy \n     to an already sorrowful history of inattention and ineptitude \n     concerning military sexual assault.\n       In my view, achieving these essential reform measures must \n     be considered as a national security imperative, demanding \n     immediate action to prevent further damage to individual \n     health and well-being, vertical and horizontal trust within \n     units, military institutional reputation, operational mission \n     readiness and the civilian military compact.\n       Far from ``stripping'' commanders of accountability, as \n     some detractors have suggested, these improvements will \n     remove the inherent conflict of interest that clouds the \n     perception and, all too often, the decision-making process \n     under the current system.\n       Implementing these reforms will actually support leaders to \n     build and sustain unit cultures marked by respect, good \n     order, and discipline.\n\n  LTG (retired) Claudia Kennedy, the first three-star female general in \nthe Army, wrote:\n\n       Having served in leadership positions in the U.S. Army, I \n     have concluded that if military leadership hasn't fixed the \n     problem in my lifetime, it's not going to be fixed without a \n     change to the status quo. The imbalance of power and \n     authority held by commanders in dealing with sexual assault \n     must be corrected. There has to be independent oversight over \n     what is happening in these cases.\n       Simply put, we must remove the conflicts of interest in the \n     current system. . . . The system in which a commander can \n     sweep his own crime or the crime of a decorated soldier or \n     friend under the rug protects the guilty and protects serial \n     predators. And it harms military readiness . . .\n       Until leadership is held accountable, this won't be \n     corrected. To hold leadership accountable means there must be \n     independence and transparency in the system.\n       Permitting professionally trained prosecutors rather than \n     commanding officers to decide whether to take sexual assault \n     cases to trial is a measured first step toward such \n     accountability . . . I have no doubt that command climate, \n     unit cohesion and readiness will be improved by (these) \n     changes.\n\n  BG (retired) David McGinnis, who also served as a Pentagon appointee, \nwrote:\n\n       I fully support your efforts to stamp out sexual assault in \n     the United States military and believe that there is nothing \n     in (the Military Justice Improvement Act) that is \n     inconsistent with the responsibility or authority of command. \n     Protecting the victims of these abuses and restoring American \n     values to our military culture is long overdue.\n\n  It is because they love the military that they are making their \nvoices heard--standing united behind brave survivors. I will share some \nof those stories because it is their stories which inform some of this \nlegislation.\n  Kate Weber, from Protect Our Defenders, was awarded the 2013 Woman \nVeteran Leader of the Year by the California Department of Veteran \nAffairs, and Sarah Plummer came to Washington, DC, all the way from \nColorado. Yesterday they came to courageously tell their stories so \nthat their brothers and sisters in uniform get a military justice \nsystem that is finally worthy of their great service to our Nation.\n  Sarah's story is extremely disturbing. She was raped as a young \nmarine in 2003. She said:\n\n       I knew the military was notorious for mishandling rape \n     cases, so I didn't dare think anything good would come of \n     reporting the rape.\n       Having someone in your direct chain of command doesn't make \n     any sense, it's like getting raped by your brother and having \n     your dad decide the case.\n\n  Kimberly Hanks, the brave survivor from the infamous and horribly \nunjust Aviano case, who I spoke to months ago about this issue when our \njourney began, just wrote an op-ed published this week:\n\n       Regardless of all the promises by military leadership and \n     half measures offered in the name of reform nothing short of \n     removing the prosecution and adjudication authority away from \n     the commander and placing it with independent, military \n     professionals outside the accused's and victim's chain of \n     command will end this nightmare.\n\n  Trina McDonald, who at 17 enlisted in the Navy, was stationed at a \nremote base in Alaska. Within 2 months, she was attacked, repeatedly \ndrugged, and raped by superior officers over the course of 9 months. \nShe said:\n\n       At one point my attackers threw me in the Bering Sea and \n     left me for dead in the hopes that they would silence me \n     forever. They made it very clear that they would kill me if I \n     ever spoke up or reported what they had done.\n\n  Listen to Army SGT Rebekah Havrilla, who served in Afghanistan and \nwas raped in 2007, and said reporting the crime to her commanding \nofficer to her was ``unthinkable'':\n\n       There was no way I was going to my commander. He made it \n     clear he didn't like women.\n\n  A1C Jessica Hinves, who was raped in 2009 by a coworker who broke \ninto her room at 3:00 in the morning, said:\n\n       Two days before the court hearing, his commander called me \n     on a conference call at the JAG office, and he said that he \n     didn't believe that [the offender] acted like a gentleman, \n     but there wasn't reason to prosecute.\n       I was speechless. Legal had been telling me this is going \n     to go through court. We had the court date set for several \n     months. And two days before, this commander stopped it. I \n     later found out the commander had no legal education or \n     background, and he had only been in command for four days.\n\n  Her rapist was given the award for Airman of the Quarter. She was \ntransferred to another base.\n  We also can't forget that more than half of the victims last year \nalone were men.\n  Blake Stephens, now 29, joined the Army in 2001, just 7 months after \ngraduating high school. The verbal and physical attacks started \nquickly, he says, and came from virtually every level of the chain of \ncommand. In one of the worst incidents, a group of men\n\n[[Page S8301]]\n\ntackled him, shoved a soda bottle into his rectum, and threw him \nbackward off an elevated platform onto the hood of a car.\n  When he reported the incident, his drill sergeant told him: ``You're \nthe problem. You're the reason this is happening.'' His commander \nrefused to take action.\n  Blake said:\n\n       You just feel trapped. They basically tell you you're going \n     to have to keep working with these people day after day, \n     night after night. You don't have a choice.\n\n  His assailants told him that once they deployed to Iraq, they were \ngoing to shoot him in the head. ``They told me they were going to have \nsex with me all the time when we were there.''\n  This is the problem: There were 26,000 sexual assaults estimated by \nthe Department of Defense last year alone based on confidential \nsurveys, but only 3,374 were actually reported. Of those reported, 302 \nwent to trial.\n  So if you are starting with 26,000 estimated cases and only 302 go to \ntrial, that is a 1-percent rate of conviction in the U.S. military for \nthe heinous crime of degradation, aggression, and dominance of rape and \nsexual assault. One percent. And we just heard from these victims. \nThere are too many command climates that are toxic, that do not ensure \ngood order and discipline, that do not protect against rape and sexual \nassault, that do not create a sense that if I come forward and report, \nthat justice could be done.\n  In this survey--this a confidential survey--the reason victims didn't \nreport is they said they didn't believe anything would be done. They \nalso said they either feared or witnessed retaliation. This is the \nproblem. About 23,000 cases weren't reported. It means in 23,000 \ncommand climates, these assaults are happening and victims feel they \nwill not get justice.\n  So I am grateful for every reform we have put in place in this \nunderlying bill. They are good, strong reforms that will help victims \nwho report. But every single one of them applies only to these 3,000 \ncases. They apply to the cases that are reported, where the command \nclimates are sufficient that a victim feels: I can come forward. I can \nat least report these cases. In the 23,000 other cases, those victims \ndon't have that confidence.\n  So if we don't create a transparent, accountable system that is \noutside the chain of command, the hope of getting more victims to come \nforward and report so we can at least weigh the evidence and see if we \ncan go to trial is not there. The hope isn't there. The confidence in \nan objective review by someone who doesn't know the perpetrator and \ndoesn't know the victim doesn't exist.\n  So while we have these 3,000 cases which were reported and commanders \ndid make sure 1 in 10 went to trial--and when they did go to trial, \nthere was a 95-percent conviction rate. So they are not making the \nwrong decisions about what case to try. It is just that only 3,000 \ncommand climates were strong enough. We can't train their way out of \nthis problem. There are 23,000 command climates that weren't strong \nenough, that didn't ensure justice, that created fear of retaliation. \nThat is the problem.\n  So without an objective system, without creating transparency and \naccountability, without saying the decider doesn't know the victim of \nthe perpetrator, there is no bias, because in too many cases, as we \nheard from these stories, the perpetrators may well be more valuable to \nthe commander, may well have several tours of duty under his belt, may \nwell have done great acts of bravery, may well have two kids and a wife \nat home. So when that commander, looking at the case file, says: You \nknow, it can't possibly have happened; it didn't happen this way; he \nweighs the evidence differently than someone objective, who is trained, \nwho actually knows the difference in these crimes and knows what a rape \nis. They know rape is not a crime of romance. They know rape is a crime \nof dominance. They know rape is a crime of violence. It is not about a \ndate gone badly. It is not about hormones. It is not about a hookup \nculture. It is actually a crime that is brutal and violent, committed \nby someone who is acting on aggression and dominance and violence.\n  That is why the training matters. I want somebody who knows that, who \nhas been trained as a lawyer, who understands prosecutorial discretion \nand can weigh evidence objectively.\n  We have to look at who is advocating for this bill--our veterans \norganizations: Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America wants this \nreform. Vietnam Veterans of America wants this reform. Service Women's \nAction Network wants this reform. They are all speaking in one voice, \nand they say: ``A vote for an independent and objective military \njustice system is a vote for our troops and a vote to strengthen our \nmilitary.''\n  They know. They have served. They are veterans. They are no longer \nActive Duty. They can speak their mind.\n  This week we released a letter of 26 retired generals, admirals, \ncommanders, colonels, captains, and senior enlisted personnel, \nincluding two generals and two admirals known as flag officers, who are \nsaying to Congress:\n\n       We believe that the decision to prosecute serious crimes \n     including sexual assault should be made by trained legal \n     professionals who are outside the chain of command but still \n     within the military.\n       This change will allow prosecutorial decisions to be made \n     by facts and evidence and not be derailed by preexisting \n     relationships, attitudes, biases, and perceptions.\n       It is our sincere belief that this change in the military \n     justice system will provide the opportunity for real progress \n     toward eliminating the scourge of sexual assault in the \n     military.\n\n  I am hopeful our colleagues will listen to these collective voices \nbecause nobody knows the military and what needs to be done to fix this \nbroken system better than they do. Listen to the victims who have \nclearly told us over and over how a system that only produces 302 \nprosecutions out of the DOD's estimated 26,000 cases of rape, sexual \nassault, and unwanted sexual contact last year must be fundamentally \nchanged to restore trust and accountability.\n  These men and women of America's military have put everything on the \nline to defend our country. Each time they are called to serve they \nanswer that call. But too often these brave men and women find \nthemselves in the fight of their lives, not on some far-off battlefield \nagainst an enemy but right here on their own soil, within their own \nranks, with their commanding officers, as victims of horrible acts of \nsexual violence.\n  Sexual assault is not new, but it has been allowed to fester in the \nshadows for far too long because instead of the zero tolerance pledge \nwe have heard for two full decades now, since Dick Cheney was the \nSecretary of Defense, first using those words in 1992, what we truly \nhave is zero accountability.\n  There is no accountability because any trust that justice will be \nserved has been irreparably broken under our current system where \ncommanders hold all the cards over whether a case moves forward to \nprosecution.\n  There are those who argue that removing these decisions out of the \nchain of command into the hands of independent prosecutors in the \nmilitary will diminish good order and discipline. This is not a \ntheoretical question. We actually know the answer to this. Our allies \nhave already made these reforms and they have not seen a diminishment \nin good order and discipline. The UK, Israel, Australia, Canada, \nNetherlands, Germany--all of them have taken the decisionmaking whether \nto prosecute the cases outside the chain of command for civil liberties \nreasons--some in interests of defendants' rights, some in interests of \nvictims' rights--to make their justice system better. We could use a \nbetter justice system. We could use that transparency and \naccountability. We have a unique problem. I think this reform solves \nour problem.\n  Director general of the Australian Defence Force Legal Service Paul \nCronan said that Australia has faced the same set of arguments from \nmilitary leaders in the past. Cronan said:\n\n       It's a little bit like when we opened up [to] gays in \n     military in the late '80s. There was a lot of concern at the \n     time that there'd be issues. But not surprisingly, there \n     haven't been any.\n\n  There are those who argue that our reform would somehow take \ncommanders off the hook or that they would no longer be accountable. \nLet me be clear. There is nothing in this bill that takes commanders \noff the hook. They are still the only ones responsible for setting \ncommand climate, for maintaining good order and discipline, for making \nsure these rapes\n\n[[Page S8302]]\n\nand assaults do not happen, for making sure there is no retaliation and \nthe victim comes forward, for making sure the command climate is \nsufficient when they do come forward.\n  This is a legal decision and actually most commanders never get to \nmake this legal decision. Your platoon sergeant, your drill sergeant, \nthey are never going to be able to be the convening and disposition \nauthority. That is not their job. But they still have to maintain good \norder and discipline. They are on the hook and the underlying bill is \nstrong because we make retaliation a crime to give them just one more \ntool to help them set their command climate.\n  There are those who argue that this reform will cost too much. I do \nnot know how you could possibly say that forwarding cases and \nprosecuting rape in the military costs too much. Our men and women in \nuniform are worth much more. Not only do these critics ignore the facts \nthat we already have trained JAGs serving in our military, they \nactually ignore the financial cost of sexual assault in the military. \nThe RAND Corporation has estimated that this scourge cost $3.6 billion \nlast year alone.\n  There are those who say commanders move forward on cases that \ncivilian prosecutors will not. To claim that keeping prosecutions \ninside the chain of command will increase the prosecutions is not \nsupported by the statistics. If you only have 3,000 or so cases being \nreported and 23,000 cases not being reported under the current system, \nif you change that system and those 23,000 cases start becoming \nreported cases, you will have more prosecutions, you will have more \nconvictions, you will have more justice.\n  The bottom line is simple. The current system oriented around the \nchain of command is producing horrible results and has been producing \nhorrible results for 25 years. The current structure is producing 1 \npercent of cases that go to trial. That is not good enough. It is not a \nsystem that is deserving of the sacrifice that the men and women in \nuniform give to our country every single day.\n  It is also contrary to the fundamental values of our American justice \nsystem. Our justice system relies on the fact that a decision about \nwhether to go to trial is never made on bias, it is always made on \nfacts and evidence. It is not made on whether it is good for the \ncommander. It is made on whether there are facts and evidence to prove \na serious crime has been committed.\n  For all those who say this is a radical idea and should wait until \nnext year, the DOD has an advisory panel that actually has opined for \nthe past 50 years on the status of women in the military. That panel, \ncalled the DACOWITS--that panel had a vote on these proposals. They \nvoted in favor overwhelmingly, with no one against. Of the 10 votes \nthat we have, 9 are former military, 4 are high-ranking generals and \nofficers. The nonmilitary voice is the head of a women's law center--\nknowledgeable individuals who are actually tasked by the Department of \nDefense, handpicked by the Department of Defense, to opine on the \nstatus of women in the military. They have voted to support these \nmeasures.\n  Secretary Hagel has even said he places ``a great premium'' on the \nvoices of this panel.\n  I have not come lightly to the conclusion that we need to \nfundamentally reform our military justice system in order to strengthen \nit, but this is a commonsense proposal. It is not a Democratic idea. It \nis not a Republican idea. It is just doing what is right. If you listen \nto these survivors, veterans, retired generals, and commanders, they \nbelieve this change is needed. But even our current military commanders \nat the Department of Defense do not dispute the problem or the facts or \nthe reason for the problem. The Commandant of the Marine Corps Gen. \nJames F. Amos said earlier this year the victims do not report these \ncases because ``they don't trust us, they don't trust the chain of \ncommand, they don't trust the leadership.''\n  We have to restore that trust. If you have too many commanders and \ntoo many command climates with 23,000 unreported cases where that trust \nis broken, you are not going to fix it by keeping it with the \ncommanders. That is the problem. This is a fundamental problem.\n  Listen to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dempsey, \nwho said that the military is sometimes ``too forgiving'' in these \ncases, admitting bias in the system toward decorated officers.\n  I firmly believe it is our obligation to restore that trust. Our \nfundamental duty as Senators, as Members of Congress, is to provide the \nneeded oversight and accountability over the armed services. We should \nnot do what the generals are telling us to do. This is our job.\n  Every time I meet with a member of the military I am overwhelmingly \ngrateful for their service, for their sacrifice, for their courage. \nThey deserve better. They deserve a military justice system that is \nconsistent with our core, fundamental American values of objectivity, \nof truth, of evidence, of fact, and of justice.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that any time \nspent on quorum calls during this debate on the sexual assault issue be \nequally divided between Senator Gillibrand on one side and Senator \nAyotte and Senator McCaskill on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I yield 5 minutes of the time of Senator Ayotte to \nthe Senator from Missouri, Mr. Blunt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank Senator McCaskill, my colleague from Missouri, and \nSenator Gillibrand both for the effort, the time, the commitment, the \nfocus they have made on this issue. They have clearly both been at the \nfrontlines of changing the underlying bill.\n  There are two things Senator Gillibrand said that I absolutely agree \nwith. The underlying bill is strong. It is a step in the right \ndirection. It is the result of our committee debate, our committee \naction. I think I heard the Senator from New York say she was \nsupporting the McCaskill amendment which adds even additional strength \nto that.\n  I also am supporting that amendment. I think it does make the bill \neven stronger. It says the commanders will be evaluated based on this \nas one of the factors; that no longer would this just be something if \nit happens to come up you talk about it, but the commanders will be \nevaluated based on what they did to change the command atmosphere, what \nthey did to protect people against sexual assault, what they did to \ncreate an atmosphere where these things not only do not happen, but \nwhen they do happen, they are vigorously dealt with and looked to as \nsomething that has to be dealt with, and the commander should be \nevaluated in that way.\n  There is another layer of review in the McCaskill amendment. If the \ncommander disagrees with something that has happened in this process, \nthey have to kick that review up another level. The so-called good \nsoldier defense is no longer a defense. This is about this incident, \nthis assault, this accusation, and dealt with solely in that way \nbecause of this additional amendment that I think many of us will \nsupport that will be added to what is already a strong underlying bill.\n  Also, this amendment would allow victims to express a preference, \nwhether they would have this pursued in a civilian trial or in a \nmilitary trial, a court-martial. Those are all good additions. I think \nthat is why--not only why Senator McCaskill proposed them, but the \nSenator from New York and I would be supporting that amendment.\n  I believe the amendment improves what the committee did. But I think \nthe committee had a full debate and a long debate and a vigorous debate \non how important it is the commanders be involved. Senator McCaskill, \nmy colleague from Missouri, has been a leader on this all her time in \nthe Senate. When she came to the Senate, one of the things in her \nbackground was her work as a county prosecutor and, more specifically, \na prosecutor for sexual assault cases. I have relied on her judgment as \nwe looked at these issues, and I think her judgment is borne out by so \nmany things we heard in the committee.\n\n  Senator Ayotte will be speaking in support of the McCaskill amendment\n\n[[Page S8303]]\n\nand underlying bill. Senator Fischer, a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, will also be part of that debate.\n  The Armed Services Committee introduced a bill that has the most \ncomprehensive legislation targeting sexual assault that has ever been \nconsidered by the Congress. We added to that amendment these important \nelements of another McCaskill amendment. There are 26 provisions in the \nunderlying bill which deal with this issue. It was among the most \ndifficult decisions I think we met, but also one of the most important \ndecisions we met: the idea that commanders would have responsibility \nfor the atmosphere they create.\n  One of the things that was mentioned more than once was the \nintegration of the Armed Forces. I stand by Senator Truman's desk, one \nof our predecessors in this Senate from Missouri. He signed the order \nthat integrated the Armed Forces. President Eisenhower pursued that \nfurther, but only when the command structure was given absolute \nresponsibility to deal with what had become a real problem. There were \neven race riots on ships, according to Senator McCain, who talked to us \nabout this issue. It was when the commanders were given the \nresponsibility to see that this problem was solved that it was solved.\n  I think this bill, and the additional amendment I will be supporting, \nthe McCaskill amendment, clarifies in new ways how important it is that \ncommanders accept this as part of their command responsibility.\n  The numbers Senator Gillibrand talked about are totally unacceptable. \nOne of the things commanders will be evaluated on in the future will be \nwhat they did about changing that environment. In my view, taking them \nout of the command responsibility in this area makes it less likely, \nnot more likely, that the atmosphere will change.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute. Since Senator Ayotte \nis not here to object, I will take it from her time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. The fact that this is in the bill and further improved, I \nbelieve, by the amendment, clearly says we are going to change the \nculture of the military.\n  Had it not been for the hard work of my colleagues, particularly \nSenator McCaskill and Senator Gillibrand, this bill would not be as far \nalong as it is. Their difference of opinion is not about solving this \nproblem, because we all believe this problem is going to be solved. I \nthink we all believe this bill takes a significant and strong step \ntoward doing that. I feel most Senators will believe the McCaskill \namendment adds another element to the bill.\n  I am glad the defense committee, the Armed Services Committee, and \nnow the U.S. Senate, are taking additional steps to solve this problem. \nIt is a tragedy for every individual in the military, man or woman, who \nhas been the victim of a sexual assault, reported or not. Whatever we \ncan do to see that they are reported, minimized, and finally ended is \nwhat ought to happen. I hope this bill does that, and I believe it \ndoes.\n  I was pleased to be part of bringing this bill to the floor, and I \nwill be pleased when the McCaskill amendment is added to it today, and \nwe face a new view of how this issue is dealt with.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I thank Senator Blunt for his comments \nand appreciate his hard work on the Armed Services Committee as we \ntackle an issue that all of us have an emotional commitment to for all \nthe right reasons.\n  I thank Senator Gillibrand. We both want fundamental reform. We are \nboth working as hard as we know how to get it. We have a fundamental \ndisagreement on how best to obtain that goal, and I would like to go \nthrough some of that disagreement for the next few minutes.\n  The 26 historic reforms that are in the bill are going to make our \nmilitary the most victim-friendly criminal justice system in the world. \nIn no other system does a victim get their own lawyer. In no other \nsystem will they have the protection, empowerment, and the deference we \nare creating for them in this bill.\n  In my years of experience in handling these cases--hundreds of them \nwith victims--I would have given anything if that victim had had the \nconfidence of independent advice. I think it would have made a \ntremendous difference in the staggering number of victims who refused \nto go forward.\n  This is the most personally painful moment of anyone's life. Make no \nmistake about it, no matter what we do in this Chamber and no matter \nwhat this bill accomplishes, we will never be able to get every victim \nto come forward because of the nature of this horrific crime, but we \nhave to do better.\n  Like Senator Gillibrand, I have talked to dozens and dozens and \ndozens of victims. I have talked to and spent hundreds of hours with \nprosecutors--military prosecutors, women and men, veterans, commanders, \nactive and retired--and just as there is not agreement among all the \nwomen in this Chamber, there is not agreement among all the victims, \nthere is not agreement among all the veterans, there is not agreement \neven among all the commanders, although most women commanders have \nacknowledged that even though this sounds seductively simple, it is \nmuch more complicated, and we will be creating more problems than we \nwill be solving if we make the change as advocated by Senator \nGillibrand.\n  Let's get at what we are trying to do. We have no disagreement that \nthere are too many of these crimes and that they are not reported \nenough--complete agreement. The goal here is how do we get more \nreporting. There is a theory that if we do this--if we take this \ndecision away from any command at all to go forward, that that will \nmagically have victims come forward.\n  Senator Gillibrand talked about our allies. I am grateful we have \ntheir experience because we can look and see what happened. Our allies \nhave done this, and not in one instance has reporting gone up. We know \nthis is not the silver bullet because if it were, we would have seen an \nincrease in reporting in all the countries that have adopted this \nsystem.\n  The response systems panel was put in place by the Armed Services \nCommittee to recommend to the Pentagon changes in this area. We know \nthey have formally acknowledged that our allies--many of whom did this \nto protect defendants' rights--have not seen an increase in reporting.\n  If the theory is that reporting can only go up if we do this, then \nwhy are we seeing a spike in reporting right now? There is a 46-percent \nincrease of reporting this year over last year. That is because some of \nthe military are already putting in the reforms we are codifying in the \nunderlying bill. They are giving victims their own lawyers. They are \nramping up the protection, information, and deference they give \nvictims. That is the single most important factor, based on all of my \nexperience, that will dictate whether a victim has the courage to come \nout of the shadows, and finally that somehow doing this will stop \nretaliation. That unit is still going to know that that crime was \nreported.\n  Keep in mind that currently, and under our reforms, the victim does \nnot have to report to the chain of command. Right now the victim does \nnot have to report to the chain of command. Many of my colleagues \ndidn't realize that a victim has many places they can report this \ncrime. Under our reforms, they will immediately get a lawyer and have \nthat level of protection immediately. They will also have the \ninformation that they don't have to report to the chain of command.\n  I am trying to understand how reporting, investigating, and deciding \nhalf a continent away--a group of lawyers making that decision--stops \nretaliation. How does that keep the people in your unit from acting \ninappropriately toward you because you have reported a crime? There is \nnothing magical about that. In most instances the word will get out.\n  Let's use our common sense. Say you are back in your unit after \nhaving been assaulted. Which way are you going to have more protection? \nWill you have more protection if a group of colonels a half continent \naway is looking at the facts of the case or if your commander has \nsigned off? Of course, if your commander has signed off, because that \nsends a message to the unit: We are getting to the bottom of this.\n\n[[Page S8304]]\n\n  Probably the most telling fact about this debate is: Is this \nhappening now? Because at this time outside investigators investigate \nthese cases, and outside JAGs make recommendations. We have that in our \nsystem now. So the question is: If these outside lawyers are \nrecommending that we go forward based on their independent \ninvestigation, are commanders shutting them down? Are commanders \nsaying: We will not go forward? No one can find me a case where that \nhappened and the prosecutors said: We need to go and the commanders \nsaid no.\n  On the other hand, over the last 2 years, there have been 93 separate \ntimes the outside lawyer said: You know, this case is too weak, this \ncase doesn't have enough facts--93 times. You know what happened in \nevery one of those cases? The commander said: We are going to get to \nthe bottom of it. So almost 100 victims over the last 2 years would not \nhave had their day in court under Senator Gillibrand's proposal.\n  In Senator Gillibrand's proposal, when the lawyer says no, it is \nover, whereas, in our proposal, if this were to ever happen, even \nthough we know this is not a problem now, we have review after review \nafter review. No one is going to be able to turn a victim away from her \nday of justice without accountability, checks and balances, and \noversight. There will be a difference in that unit because now \nretaliation is a crime and the commander is going to be evaluated on \nhow they are handling this issue within their command.\n  There are also practical problems--and some of my colleagues will \ncome to the floor today and talk about this. There are a number of \nimplementation issues that I don't think have been thought through, and \nthis is the real world here. We are talking about appeals and \nchallenges. We are talking about not even having enough colonels right \nnow to staff this. We are talking about risking the ability to get a \nspeedy trial. We are talking about eliminating the ability to plea \nbargain.\n  Let me tell the Presiding Officer, having handled these cases, I \nthink people sometimes make the assumption that a plea bargain is about \ncopping out, it is about not protecting the victim. Talk about stories \nof victims, I can tell story after story of real people whom I dealt \nwith who came forward and said: Yes, I think I can do this.\n  I will never forget this one woman who came to me and said: My mental \nhealth counselor said that testifying in court will set me back so far \nI can't do it, but can you get something on him? In those instances, do \nyou think that defense lawyer is going to plead to a sexual offense or \neven a serious offense? But many times we were able to get something on \nhim so the next time, if it happened, we at least had a better shot. \nMany times plea bargains are dictated by victims. Military prosecutors \nare telling me this, that it will really limit their ability and create \nserious due process concern.\n  In her proposal, this outside lawyer picks everybody--picks the \ndefense lawyer, picks the jury, and picks the prosecutor. How is that \ngoing to stand up to a due process claim? It is not clear who picks the \njudge. That is left silent. I don't know who picks the judge. It is not \nclear. That is another question: Who is going to decide who is going to \nactually pick the judge?\n\n  It eliminates the option of nonjudicial punishment. Take the case of \nthe Air Force airman who was just recently tried in civilian courts. He \nwas initially charged with a sexual offense. It was reduced to a simple \nassault. If that had been within the military, they couldn't have done \nthat because it wasn't a serious offense so it goes back over to the \nconvening authority within the command and then that soldier knows they \nare not going to do a trial--they can't--and all he has to do is turn \ndown nonjudicial punishment.\n  Some of these difficulties will be explored in more detail, as I say, \nthroughout the day.\n  Here is the one I don't understand. If a person believes deeply in \nthe policy he or she is advocating, why in the world would that person \nthen proactively limit the ability to resource it? In the language of \nthe Gillibrand amendment, it actually says there shall be no funds \nauthorized for this, no personnel billets authorized for this. The \nmilitary has estimated over $100 million a year just in personnel costs \nbecause they have to create a completely different system outside the \nsystem they currently have, which will still be operative for some \noffenses that are related to the military and that are low-level \noffenses. But we have to have a whole new system for arson, robbery, \ntheft, murder, and for sexual assault. Yet she proactively in her \namendment says we can't resource it. That is truly one that makes me \nscratch my head.\n  There are a lot of problems surrounding this amendment, but let me \nemphasize our goals are the same and our motives are pure. We believe--\nand we believe this is borne out by the data--we will have more \nprosecutions because it will be very easy for lawyers who are a long \nway away--overworked, underresourced--to say: This is a consent case. \nIt is a little messy. Everybody was drunk. Let that one go, and then it \nis over.\n  Let me briefly talk about what we have in our amendment because it is \nalso very important, once again empowering victims further. In our \namendment we are going to allow victims to formally weigh in, whether \nthey would prefer, if there is concurrent jurisdiction, for the \ncivilian authorities to handle the case in addition or whether they \nwould rather the military authorities handle the case. It strengthens \nthe role of the prosecutor because it provides another layer of review \nover the prosecutor's decisions. It increases the accountability of \ncommanders making this evaluation on their forms and adding that other \nlayer of review. It eliminates the good soldier defense. It is \nirrelevant whether someone is a good pilot if they have sodomized or \nraped someone in the military, and our amendment will make it \nirrelevant and inadmissible.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the time. I know we have others who \nwant to visit on this, and I will be happy to be back later in the day \nto talk specifically about some of the other issues in this bill.\n  I do not see anyone else here right now, so I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, as we wait for our colleagues to join \nthe floor so they can have their floor time, I wish to address a few of \nmy colleague's concerns.\n  Some of the technical concerns she raised--we actually took some of \nthose concerns and revised them in the bill that has actually been \npresented, so some of those concerns have been actually fully \naddressed.\n  For example, as to her concern about the convening authority, the \ndisposition authority, our bill is very specific. The disposition \nauthority is the decisionmaking authority. That goes to the trained \nmilitary legal prosecutor, the JAG counsel, so they actually get to \nmake the decision about whether to proceed to trial on the evidence.\n  The convening authority, which is a different right, a different \nduty, is left intact as it is. So the convening authority still will \ndecide judges, juries, and all the details of what the court and the \ntrial will look like. It is two separate authorities in two separate \nplaces. That has been clarified in the bill so there is no concern \nthere.\n  One other concern my colleague raised is this issue of nonjudicial \npunishment. Our bill is very specific. We exclude 37 specific crimes, \nincluding all article 15 crimes, all of the crimes that one would be \nusing nonjudicial punishment to enforce. If the disposition authority \ndecides they do not want to prosecute the case because they don't have \nenough evidence to go forward, it goes directly back to the commander \nto use the benefit of the nonjudicial punishment to do whatever kind of \npunishment he or she thinks is appropriate.\n  So those are just two technical issues my colleague raised that I \nthink are very important to clarify.\n  Then the third issue Senator McCaskill raised that I think is a \nmisunderstanding of the bill is about this world away problem. Today, \nin our bill, compared to the current system, the reporting is the same. \nOne can report\n\n[[Page S8305]]\n\nanywhere. One can report to a chaplain or to a friend or to a nurse or \nto a doctor. One can report anywhere. That is not changing. The \nreporting is exactly the same.\n  What also is exactly the same is the investigation. So once a person \ndoes report, whether to a chaplain or to a commander, investigators \nwill be sent to investigate the case, whether in Iraq or Afghanistan or \nGermany or anywhere. That stays exactly the same. So it doesn't matter, \nthis world away, because the investigators go to the person. It is not \na different set of investigators; it is the exact same set of \ninvestigators, and the commanders are still responsible to make sure \nthe investigators do their job. So the commander has to be protecting \nthe victim and has to be making sure the unit is not retaliating. He \nhas to make sure the investigator has access to the evidence, and he \nhas to make sure the command climate stays strong with good order and \ndiscipline. That never changes. Those commanders are always responsible \nfor good order and discipline and command climate.\n  The only difference under this bill is after the investigation is \ncompleted and there is a file--a file of evidence--it doesn't go sit on \nan 06 commander's desk. An 06 commander is colonel and above, so quite \na senior commander. He may not even be in Afghanistan or Germany or \nexactly where that crime has occurred. The 06 commander will look at \nthe file and decide: Has a crime been committed and is there enough \nevidence to go forward?\n  Instead of that commander making that decision, this bill proposes \nthat it will be a trained military prosecutor, so it doesn't matter \nwhat desk the file goes on. What does matter is whether the person \nwhose desk that file goes on is objective. What matters is that person \nis actually trained, understands the law, understands the nature of the \ncrime, can weigh the evidence and make a decision based on the \nevidence, not whether he likes the victim or values or doesn't value \nthe perpetrator. Those biases are what is affecting the system \nnegatively today.\n  So that is why the world away is not a concern, because the \ninvestigation proceeds exactly as it always did. The only difference is \non whose desk it goes to make the ultimate legal decision.\n  Then, lastly, back to this issue of whether commanders are being held \naccountable. Commanders are held accountable. We actually have it in \nthe underlying bill. Not only is retaliation now a crime, but they will \nbe measured, as Senator Blunt said, on whether their command climate is \nstrong. Is the command climate strong enough to make sure these rapes \naren't happening? Is your command climate strong enough to make sure \nretaliation of a victim doesn't happen? Is the command climate strong \nenough to make sure victims believe justice is possible?\n  So they will be evaluated and commanders will be held accountable.\n  I don't think it is appropriate to hold a commander accountable based \non whether he weighs the evidence properly. That is a legal judgment. \nIt is not based on whether a person is tough or not tough on these \nrapes. It is based on whether there is enough evidence to show that a \ncrime has been committed. It should be a technical, legal decision, not \na decision based on how tough one is on crime. That is not the \nmeasurable. It is just not the measurable.\n  So commanders are going to be held accountable for their command \nclimate, for good order and discipline. Whether they make a legal \ndecision up at the colonel level is not determinative as to whether \nthey have done their job. The commanders who are getting the \nopportunity to make those legal decisions today, they are not doing a \nbad job. Of those 3,000 cases reported, 1 in 10 went to trial. That is \nnot a terrible ratio. The ones they do choose to move forward, there is \na 95-percent conviction rate.\n  Yes, I agree in those 100 cases, where the commander said move \nforward, the conviction rates weren't as high. Some of those cases had \nconvictions and some did not, and those are excellent opportunities for \nthe victims to be heard. But we don't want just 100 more cases going \nforward; we want tens of thousands of cases to be reported so they have \na chance to go forward. It is the difference of thousands, and that is \nwhy I feel this reform is so necessary. Still, in light of all of the \namazing reforms in the underlying bill, I think it is necessary because \nthat crisis of confidence is so raw, is so real, is so present.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the NDAA which is \ncurrently on the floor. I wish to address a couple of issues. One I am \npassionate about is the veterans unemployment rate and how it is dealt \nwith in the NDAA, another is shipbuilding, another is the critical \nissue of sexual assault and misconduct and, finally, sequester.\n  Before I begin, let me talk about how important this bill is. This is \na bill the Senate has passed every year for over 50 years. We pass it \nevery year, even if we can't pass a budget, even if we can't do other \nthings, because it is so critical to show those who serve in the \nmilitary that we are behind them. I have heard some indications, even \nwithin the last 24 hours, that because of so many amendments that might \nbe possible on this bill, would that call into question whether we \nwould be able to keep our streak going. If we have to be here Christmas \nDay, we need to be on the floor Christmas Day to make sure we pass this \nbill before the end of the year. It is that important. It is the most \nimportant bill that comes before this body, and we need to do \neverything we can to guarantee the certainty to those who serve.\n  In Virginia, we are so connected to Active-Duty service and to our \nveterans. My wife and I are a Blue Star Family. This is very important \nand we have to make sure we pass this bill.\n  Let me start with a personnel issue that matters a lot to me, which \nis the veterans unemployment rate. Right now it is unacceptable that \nveterans, especially enlisted, who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan \nhave an unemployment rate that is higher than the national average.\n  A report that was issued last week by the Bureau of Labor Statistics \nstates that the unemployment rate for veterans who have served since 9/\n11 remains around 10 percent, which is higher than nonveterans of the \nsame age. Ten percent represents 246,000 individual veterans of that \nera who want to work but don't have it.\n  That is why I introduced as my first legislation in April the Troop \nTalent Act of 2013. A companion bill in the House was introduced by \nRepresentative Tammy Duckworth. The bills have been incorporated into \nthe NDAAs in both Armed Services Committees. They are now on the floor \nand virtually identical.\n  The bill represents a strategy to deal with our veterans unemployment \nrate by making sure Active-Duty military receive civilian credentials \nfor the skills they obtain in the military at the moment they obtain \nthem.\n  The bill has a number of provisions. My colleagues on the Armed \nServices Committee were good enough to include them in the underlying \nbill. This bill will help us deal with the veterans unemployment rate, \nand that is one of the reasons I so much wanted to get to it and am so \nstrongly supportive.\n  Second is shipbuilding. The Presiding Officer and I both have a real \ninterest in this topic, as all Americans do. It is an area of great \nimportance to the State. In Virginia we manufacture the largest items \non the planet Earth, which is the nuclear aircraft carrier, at the \nHuntington Ingalls Shipyard in Newport News.\n  As the Defense Department reorients, resources its strategy toward \nAsia, we have to find the Navy bearing more and more of the operational \nburden of our military in that policy shift, and we have to continue to \nprovide the Navy with adequate resources and funding through this \nprovision to support that shift and to support shipbuilding.\n  Unfortunately, sequestration--and I will finish with sequestration in \na minute--poses grave dangers. So we need to do what we can to maintain \nthis priority for shipbuilding. Right now the sequester has reduced our \nnormal level of three carrier strikers and three amphibious ready \ngroups, which weakens our readiness to deal with challenges in a very \nchallenging world. We have to maintain the priorities mandated and the \nNDAA does that and that is one of the reasons I support it.\n  Regarding the issue of sexual misconduct, 2014 is going to be \nremembered as a potentially historic year for\n\n[[Page S8306]]\n\na good reason in the military. I wish to make sure history is good and \nis not clouded by our continued inability to grab onto and reduce the \nissue of sexual misconduct.\n  Earlier this year, I know Members of this body were very happy when \nSecretary Hagel and the military leadership embraced the proposition \nthat women should be able to serve in the military without being barred \nby gender from any military specialty, that military specialties could \nhave rigorous physical or training criteria, but that both men and \nwomen should be able to compete to serve in any military specialty, \neven combat-related specialties.\n\n  We will be remembered--2014 will be remembered--for that. But that \nmemory will fade by comparison if what we are really remembered for is \nwe missed an opportunity, an important opportunity, to tackle the \nimportant issue of sexual assault.\n  I congratulate Senators Gillibrand and McCaskill for all the great \nwork they have done to bring this to the attention of the body and to \nlook the military in the eye and say: This has to stop.\n  They have said it would stop over and over for 20 years, and it has \nnot. This has to be the moment when it stops, and these Senators, \nworking together with us on the Armed Services Committee, have put \ntogether a sizeable package of reforms that I am confident will help \nthis time be different.\n  I also thank the brave victims who testified. I went to every hearing \nin the Senate on the sexual assault issue. Senator Gillibrand had a \nPersonnel Subcommittee hearing. I was there for that entire hearing. \nSenator Levin had a hearing in Armed Services. I was there for nearly \nthat entire full-day hearing. Committee markups in the Subcommittee on \nPersonnel and the full committee--I have been to all the meetings.\n  I have heard these victims testify. How brave they are as survivors \nto come forward and testify. I also thank survivors in Virginia who \nhave come and shared their stories with me personally so I could \ngrapple with what is the right mix. These survivors have done a \nwonderful job in making sure we address this issue.\n  I tackled the issue of sexual assault in a way when I was Governor. \nWe were treating victims of sexual assault in the civil justice system \npoorly in Virginia. We were not unique in that, but there was no excuse \nfor it.\n  So I impaneled a group of advocates and survivors to look at Virginia \nlaw and tell us what we needed to change if we were going to try to \ndeal with this scourge. One of the problems with sexual assault is--\ntogether with domestic violence--it is often a very underreported \ncrime.\n  If somebody breaks into my apartment, I do not hesitate to call the \npolice and say: There has been a break-in. If somebody bashes my car \nwindshield in, I do not hesitate to call in and say: Look, a crime has \nbeen committed.\n  But crimes of sexual assault and crimes of domestic violence--and \nthere tends to be on overlap, not completely but there is an overlap--\nare crimes where there is underreporting, in both civilian and \nmilitary, and on college campuses. So one of the most important aspects \nin any reform is to create an environment where people feel they can \ncome forward with a complaint, when they have one.\n  The statistics are well known. They have just been cited on the \nfloor. By a statistical sampling, it has been estimated there have been \n26,000 instances of unwanted sexual conduct, of sexual assaults in the \nmilitary, and only 3,000 have been reported. We have to make sure these \nreforms we are about to embrace help us deal with this reporting issue \nso people feel a sense of comfort.\n  What we realized in tackling these issues in Virginia is that for \npeople to feel comfortable with reporting sexual assaults, they have to \nhave time. You cannot make them make the decision about reporting in an \ninstant. There is often a psychological component about deciding what \nto do. There needs to be privacy and discretion and confidence, and \nthere also needs to be advice and resources. People need to know: what \nare the avenues they have. What are the legal procedures, how do they \nlook, and what are their rights if they decide to pursue a complaint.\n  I support the ongoing bill that is on the floor, and I will support \nsome other proposals that are out. The McCaskill-Ayotte proposal I will \nsupport. I support the reform for a number of reasons. It affects the \ntraining and evaluation of military personnel. It affects the way \nsexual assault allegations are investigated, the way they are \nprosecuted, and the way they are punished. It protects witnesses.\n  An amendment Senator Warner and I got into the bill--and we will be \nadding to it on the floor--protects whistleblowers who blow the whistle \non an unfortunate or sexually harassing climate.\n  But the most important part of this bill is what the bill does for \nanyone who has been victimized by a crime of sexual assault--to create \na climate where they can come forward and lodge a complaint.\n  In the military right now there are a number of avenues whereby \nsomebody who has been victimized by a crime of sexual assault can lodge \na complaint. Unique in this form of crime, there is a restricted \nreport, where someone can come forward and report confidentially. That \nis very, very important.\n  But this bill adds to it what I think is the core of driving up \nreporting, which is salutary. It adds to it, also, something that would \nbe unique in the military. It would exist for no other crime category, \nno other offense category. If someone complains of a sexual assault, \nthey will be assigned a special victims' counsel, whose job it is to \nhave their back, to hear the painful story, to share the various \nreporting mechanisms, counseling resources that are available, how the \ncrime might be prosecuted. At every step along the way, as that victim \nis becoming a survivor and dealing with the challenge, that special \nvictims' counsel will be there to help them make decisions and give \nthem the backup and support they need.\n  This is based on a pilot project in the Air Force, a pilot project in \nthe Air Force that is working. What we are finding, based on this pilot \nproject in the Air Force, is even when people file complaints in a \nrestricted, confidential way--they come in and say: I want to file a \ncomplaint, but I don't want to go against the perpetrator because I \ndon't want people to know; I just want help--after they get a special \nvictims' advocate and learn about the proceedings and learn about the \nprotections, and they build up a bond with somebody who has their back, \nthey are very likely to say: You know what, now I have the confidence \nto actually file my complaint publicly and take on the perpetrator--who \nneeds to be taken on, who needs to be drummed out of the military if \nthey committed a sexual assault.\n  So I believe the core of getting this right is about giving victims \nan avenue where they can have the time, they can have the advice, they \ncan have the privacy and discretion to understand what their options \nare and then make a decision and go forward.\n  I think if we pass this bill with that special victims' counsel this \nwill be the single best thing we will be able to do to tackle the crime \nof sexual assault.\n  Let me conclude by saying a word about sequestration.\n  A word that none of us knew before the beginning of 2013 has been \nspoken so many times on the floor of this body. No one intended for \nsequestration to happen when the votes were cast in the summer of 2011. \nEveryone was told across the board: Nonstrategic cuts to health care, \ndomestic accounts, and to defense would be harmful to us. We have seen \nthe harm that sequestration is doing to our Nation's military at a time \nwhen our military is getting more and more dangerous.\n  Indiscriminate across-the-board cuts are not only hurting all kinds \nof military priorities, they are also sending the signal to young men \nand women who are thinking about military careers or who are in the \nmilitary and deciding how long they want their careers to be--they are \nsending them a signal that Congress does not value what they do.\n  We need to show the men and women of the military we value what they \ndo. We need to show them by getting an NDAA bill done this year. We \nneed to show them by ending sequestration. Will there be savings we can \nfind in our defense spending? Of course. We ought to be looking at \nevery item of government to determine whether we can do\n\n[[Page S8307]]\n\nbetter and save money. But this across-the-board sequester that is \ngrounding air combat wings, that is grounding carrier units, that is \nmaking us less able to confront a more challenging world, is not \nbehavior befitting of the greatness of this Nation.\n  I am a budget conferee right now, working on a budget deal. We are \nunder a Senate- and House-imposed deadline to try to find that deal by \nDecember 13 so the appropriators can work on a budget. We will work \ndiligently on that. I have an optimistic sense about finding a budget \ndeal that enables us to replace this foolish sequester with a more \nstrategic approach that will not hurt our military.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the time and I now yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I want to, first of all, thank the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee and the ranking member, \nSenator Levin and Senator Inhofe, for the leadership they have provided \nto this body and to our Nation in fashioning a bill, the National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, that truly serves our \nnational security and preserves and enhances our national defense.\n  I want to thank my colleague Senator McCaskill for the leadership she \nhas provided, along with others, such as Senator Reed and Senator \nGillibrand, all who have focused on the issues that are raised by the \nMilitary Justice Improvement Act--the need to reform and strengthen our \nsystem of prosecuting and providing justice to the survivors of sexual \nassault.\n  I have joined with Senator Gillibrand in supporting the Military \nJustice Improvement Act because I think it embodies the kind of major \nreform that is necessary to provide enhanced confidence and trust in \nthis system of military justice--major change that is needed to drive \nout the scourge of military sexual assault from our Armed Forces and \nprovide the men and women of our military--the strongest and best \nmilitary in the world now and in the history of the United States--with \na system of military justice that matches their excellence.\n  The legislation before us, the National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2014, provides much-needed equipment and training needed by \nour warfighters. It keeps us dominant across the globe and all of the \ndomains that are necessary for our national defense. It authorizes two \nnew attack submarines for the coming fiscal year, and it keeps us on \ntrack for developing the next generation of ballistic missile \nsubmarines. These weapon systems, these weapon platforms, and all that \nis contained in this act, are vitally important for the defense of our \nNation. The debate about the Military Justice Improvement Act should in \nno way distract us from that mission to maintain and enhance the \ndefense of the United States.\n  This bill enables the Air Force to move forward with a new combat \nrescue helicopter that will take injured airmen and others to safety. \nIn June I wrote with five of my colleagues to Gen. Mark Welsh, the Air \nForce Chief of Staff, to support the Air Force in its efforts to \nreplace the current fleet of HH-60G Pave Hawks with helicopters that \ncan carry more and go further, all the while keeping the fuel \nefficiency and value that the H-60 aircraft provides. This legislation \nkeeps our progress underway in the development and fielding of the \nJoint Strike Fighter that will assure that our Air Force, Navy, and \nMarines are ready to respond.\n  This bill has so many critical and valuable elements that should be \nat the forefront of this debate and evoke appreciation for Senator \nLevin and Senator Inhofe and the work done by my colleagues on the \nArmed Services Committee. So I am proud to support this bill. At the \nsame time, Congress has a responsibility to transform the time-worn \nslogan of ``zero tolerance for military sexual assault'' into a real \nplan and strategy that will achieve that goal.\n  For years and years the military has promised zero tolerance toward \nsexual assault. Yet the actual achievement has fallen short. That is \nwhy reporting has been so low and why the crime of military sexual \nassault is not only underreported but underprosecuted.\n  The goal of the Military Justice Improvement Act is to improve \nreporting because without reporting there cannot be investigating and \nthere cannot be prosecution, which means there can be no punishment and \nno prevention and protection.\n  Those are the goals of this major reform: better reporting and \nenhanced prosecution to deter this horrific crime, and to make sure \nthat victims are better protected and the crime itself prevented.\n  This bill requires the Secretary of Defense to afford rights to \nvictims of crimes prosecuted under the Uniform Code of Military \nJustice, such as protections from unreasonable delay and the right to \nbe heard. This bill gives those protections even without the Military \nJustice Improvement Act. It also obligates the Secretary of Defense to \nensure these rights are enforceable and affords every victim a special \nvictim's counsel--again, measures on which there is consensus provided \nin the bill right now.\n  I am pleased that in response to my request to the defense \nappropriations committee, when this provision is authorized in this \nlegislation, there will be $25 million appropriated to stand up this \nprogram systemwide and defensewide.\n  So the legislation before us has many good things even without the \nMilitary Justice Improvement Act. I am proud of the reforms that are \naccomplished in this bill on which we agree. Where we disagree is on \nthe proposal to take prosecutorial decisions out of the chain of \ncommand. That is a narrower change that many people appreciate because \nthe rest of the system, which is required for the present command and \ncontrol authority, would be essentially maintained. What is taken out \nof the chain of command is simply the prosecutorial decision so that an \nexperienced, trained, objective professional can make those decisions.\n  I really believe this measure, if adopted, as I hope it will be, will \nlead the military at some point--those commanders who may resist it \nnow--to actually thank the Senate and the Congress for taking these \ndecisions out of their hands so that they can focus on the incredible \nchallenges of military readiness and preparedness, so they can do what \nthey are trained to do, which is to train their men and women and \nmaintain and enhance their readiness so that they can do professionally \nwhat is their prime mission, which is to fight wars and defend our \nNation.\n  These decisions about prosecuting sexual assault cases can be better \nmade by trained, experienced prosecutors who have the expertise in \ntheir field that our military commanders have in their field. I think \nit will serve the entire interests of our military to make sure that \nthese decisions are made by those military professionals in JAG \noffices, just as they are trained in other areas of expertise that \nrequire that kind of training.\n  I am listening to the voices of the victims as to what will enhance \ntheir reporting and eliminate their fear of reprisal and retaliation. \nOn Monday I was joined by four survivors of military sexual assault to \ndiscuss the need for reforming military justice. I wish to express my \nappreciation for Army SST Sandra Lee, Army SGT Cheryl E. Berg, Air \nForce SSgt Pattie Dumin, and Marine Corps Cpl Maureen Friedly. Each \ndemonstrated that day that their shared experiences of military justice \nwarrant the reforms contained in the Military Justice Improvement Act.\n  I would like to share just one--Marine Corps Cpl Maureen Friedly, who \nwas sexually assaulted by a fellow marine in 2006 while attending the \nNavy School of Music. She pressed charges against her attacker and \nrequested an unrestricted investigation. I will now read her words into \nthe Record:\n\n       I went to an NCIS investigator who questioned me about the \n     day I was attacked and, after hearing my testimony, told me \n     that I would have to take a lie detector test to insure I was \n     not filing falsely. I agreed to it but was never asked \n     anything by my investigator again. My chain of command made \n     it very clear that they preferred my attacker,\n\n[[Page S8308]]\n\n     who was a platoon leader, over me and supported him through \n     everything. When I graduated from the school and went to my \n     duty station in San Diego, CA, my new chain of command tried \n     to help me find out what had happened to my case as I had not \n     heard about it for several months. A few weeks passed before \n     we found that my paperwork had been mishandled, and I was \n     told that nothing could be done and my attacker would go out \n     to the fleet.\n       Eventually it was found that he had sexually assaulted \n     several other women and he was administratively separated \n     from the Corps, not charged, and not given a dishonorable \n     discharge.\n\n  Her remarks say more than I ever could about the need for enacting \nthe Military Justice Improvement Act. The reforms contained in the \nmeasure already are a vitally important step in the right direction. \nTaking these decisions out of the chain of command is important to good \norder and discipline because eliminating the crime of sexual assault \nand providing for greater reporting is vital to good order and \ndiscipline. Our experience shows that it has worked when our allies \nimplemented it. Whatever the claims about numbers of cases reported in \nthose allies' armies, clearly they are satisfied with the way it has \nworked there.\n  Finally, let me just say that I appreciate the bipartisan efforts on \nthis bill on both sides. I think that eventually we will see this kind \nof reform. Whether or not it is approved today, history is moving in \nthis direction, demanded and driven by the brave men and women who have \nsuffered from this crime, the survivors and victims whose voices we \nhave heard, and the commanders and veterans who have come forward to \nus, all of the major veterans organizations that have made their voice \nheard to us and who wholeheartedly have said: This kind of reform is \nnecessary to vindicate and support the brave men and women who put \ntheir lives on the line for our Nation day in and day out, whose \nexcellence should be matched by a military justice system that truly \nand really looks for zero tolerance and achieves zero tolerance in \nsexual assault.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin.) The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, before he yields the floor, I wish to \ncommend my colleague from Connecticut in terms particularly--and I am \ngoing to go into some of the history with respect to this so-called \nzero tolerance policy because I think when we look back over history, \nthere is a very big gap between the past pledges of zero tolerance for \nsexual assault and the realities of what we have seen. That is one of \nthe key points the Senator from Connecticut has made, among many \nothers. I thank him for it. It was a very valuable presentation.\n  I also commend the Presiding Officer for her extraordinary work. \nAgain and again, she has outlined what I think is very constructive; \nthat is, the areas where there is common ground here, common ground to \ntry to address an issue that I just went through with Senator \nBlumenthal. We have heard past pledges about it, and it has not really \ncome to be. The Presiding Officer has done very fine work. Senator \nGillibrand, Senator McCaskill, Senator Ayotte, I know the best, but a \nwhole host of Senators have been interested in this issue. I also see \nmy friend from Rhode Island Senator Reed. He and Senator Levin have \nbeen very interested in this issue over the years. So there has been \nplenty of good work. I think the question now really is: How are we \ngoing to make a fundamental break from policies that over the last \ncouple of decades simply have not worked?\n  Go back to the Tailhook scandal. That was in 1991. Over the course of \na 4-day conference in Las Vegas, more than 100 Naval and Marine Corps \naviation officers sexually assaulted 90 victims. We watched the \nSecretary of the Navy resign after Tailhook. His replacement said that \n``sexual harassment will not be tolerated'' and that ``those who do not \nget the message will be driven from our ranks.''\n  Then there was the Aberdeen debacle 5 years later. Five years after \nwe were told this would not be tolerated, 5 years later, we had the \nAberdeen debacle. Army Secretary Togo West delivered remarks to the \nSenate Armed Services Committee titled ``There's a Problem, And We Mean \nTo Fix It.''\n  Once again, years go by, and we have another such problem. That was \nthe 2003 scandal at the Air Force Academy where 19 percent of women \ncadets reported having been sexually assaulted and 7 percent reported \nhaving been the victim of a rape or attempted rape. The Air Force \nSecretary told Congress, ``We will not tolerate in our Air Force, nor \nin our Academy, those who sexually assault others; those who would fail \nto act to prevent assaults.''\n  So, again, we heard--and certainly I am not here to doubt the \nsincerity of those who made those comments, but yet the pattern \ncontinues. We have a horrible set of sexual assaults, not just one but \nmultiple ones. We have these pledges for zero tolerance. Yet we have \none event after another. After the 2003 scandal, there were again the \npledges of zero tolerance. We had the Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland \nscandal where some 30 training instructors were accused of offenses \nranging from improper relationships with trainees to sexual assault and \nrape. In response, the Secretary of Defense said--as did many of his \npredecessors in the military--``the command structure from the chairman \non down have made very clear to the leadership in this department that \nthis is intolerable and it has to be dealt with. We have absolutely no \ntolerance for any form of sexual assault.''\n  So the pattern through all of these instances is ``zero tolerance. We \nwill fix this.'' These comments--as I say, I do not question the \nsincerity of those who made them. These were officials in the military \nwho served their country with great distinction and great valor. But \nthe bottom line is the bottom line: When they said there would be zero \ntolerance, somehow those policies did not actually work as it related \nto real life for those who wear the uniform of the United States.\n  Today the military officer in charge of sexual abuse education at \nFort Hood is under investigation for running a prostitution ring. Two \nNavy football players await trial in a military court on charges of \nsexual assault. Today a West Point sergeant stands accused of secretly \nvideotaping female cadets in the shower. So it seems to me that because \nof the good work of so many here--I cited the Presiding Officer; \nSenator Reed, who is managing the bill at this point; Senator \nGillibrand; Senator McCaskill--I believe we are now in a position to \nfinally make some significant changes and turn these past pledges of \nzero tolerance into a new reality that really ensures that those who \nwear the uniform of the United States do have a new measure of \nprotection from sexual assault.\n  In effect, this is a new zero tolerance policy, a new policy that \nsays: Zero tolerance for promises that go unfulfilled. Zero tolerance \nfor a culture in which these assaults are treated as something less \nthan the violent crimes they are. Zero tolerance for a system that \ncontinues to fail so many victims.\n\n  The Pentagon estimates that in 2012 some 26,000 servicemembers \nexperienced sexual assault. Some, I know, have looked at this issue as \nsort of a glorified hazing matter, boys being boys, a discipline issue.\n  Senator Fischer, one of our colleagues who has come to the Senate \nmost recently, has been correct to point out this is not a gender \nissue, this is a violence issue. It is a violence issue because sexual \nassault is called assault for a reason. It is assault. We are talking \nabout a violent crime that involves control and domination.\n  I think it is also worth noting that somewhere in the vicinity of \nclose to half of military assault victims are men. In fact, the \nDepartment of Defense estimates that 14,000 of those 26,000 victims \nlast year were men.\n  Colleagues are waiting to speak, and I would simply wrap up by way of \nsaying that I think the bill, the committee bill, takes some \nconstructive steps in the right direction. I wish to see it go further. \nIt is why I joined a bipartisan group of colleagues to support Senator \nGillibrand's legislation that would remove the decision to prosecute \nfrom the chain of command and give it to experienced, impartial \nmilitary lawyers.\n  Suffice it to say we are going to have to come to grips, colleagues, \nwith this question of assault--and particularly sexual assault--in a \nvariety of forums.\n  This is not the place to discuss it, but yesterday Senator Cornyn, I, \nand Senator Klobuchar introduced a fresh approach to dealing with sex \ntrafficking,\n\n[[Page S8309]]\n\nwhich is also sexual assault. There will be an opportunity to discuss \nthat bipartisan bill in the future.\n  This is the time. This is the time to close the gap between all of \nthose unfulfilled promises about how there will be zero tolerance for \nsexual assault and a new reality that affords a new measure of \nprotection from sexual assault for those who wear the uniform of the \nUnited States. This is the opportunity we have in the Senate today and \nthe opportunity we have to achieve that goal in a bipartisan manner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. When sexual abuse occurs in a military unit or when a \nservicemember is a victim or a perpetrator of sexual abuse, we have \nfailed.\n  Certainly the military has failed, but Congress with its \nconstitutional mandate to ``make rules for the government and \nregulation of the land and naval forces'' and to ``provide for . . . \ndisciplining the militia'' shares in that failure.\n  This is why the efforts of Senator McCaskill, Senator Gillibrand, and \nindeed all of my colleagues are so important and so commendable. They \nhave elevated this debate and challenged this Congress and our military \nto act. They have recognized, through their passionate advocacy, that \nsexual abuse not only is a violation of an individual, but it is a \ncorrosive force that can undermine the trust that is essential for the \nfunctioning of any military unit.\n  The essence of military service is selfless service in which every \nsoldier, sailor, marine, and airman must be prepared to give his or her \nlife for a comrade. Sexual abuse is the antithesis of that ethic. It \nrepresents predatory behavior and exploitation, not selfless sacrifice \nand protection of those you serve with. It has no place in the \nmilitary, and if not eliminated, it will insidiously destroy our \nmilitary. No technology, no amount of military resources can assure \nmilitary success if courage and character fail. Sexual abuse is a \ncowardly act that betrays the ethic and character of the military.\n  I believe we are united on this point. This debate is about \npreventing sexual abuse, a shared goal of every Member of the Senate, \nof Congress, of the military, and of this Nation. The question is how \nbest to achieve this essential goal.\n  I believe it requires leadership at every stage: recruitment, \ntraining, evaluation, promotion, retention, and punishment. I believe \ncommanders must be involved in every step. They must be responsible and \ntheir subordinates must recognize this responsibility and their \nauthority. To remove the commander from any of these responsibilities \nwill, in my view, weaken his or her effectiveness in every one of these \ndimensions.\n  I had the privilege of commanding a company of paratroopers in the \n82nd Airborne Division. I was responsible directly for nonjudicial \ncompany-grade punishment under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. \nBut it was clear to me and to my troops that the battalion and brigade \ncommanders and the division commander had court-martial authority and \nwould necessarily confer with their subordinate commanders in the \nexecution of this authority. This reality, this authority, permeated \neverything we did and reinforced the policy orders of every commander, \nincluding myself.\n  I will admit that my experience is decades old, and it preceded the \nintegration of women into combat units such as an airborne infantry \nbattalion, but the central role of the commander has not diminished. \nMoreover, the experiences of the sixties and the seventies also reveal \na military struggling with serious and corrosive problems, principally \nracial integration and drug use. Congress ultimately dealt with these \nproblems, not by bypassing commanders but by holding them, and through \nthem every member of the Armed Forces, to a higher standard.\n  Today the American military is the first institution anyone points to \nwhen noting the progress we have made in racial equality and \nopportunity. This was not always the case.\n\n       Incidents with racial overtones plagued the Vietnam period \n     [and the post-Vietnam era.] Among the most widely publicized \n     were a race riot among prisoners in a stockade in Vietnam in \n     1968 and several incidents aboard naval vessels in the early \n     1970s.\n\n  In one of these incidents in 1972 on the carrier Kitty Hawk, there \nwas a 15-hour melee between Black and White sailors. Effectively, that \ncarrier, that ship--a capital ship of the Navy--was absolutely \nineffectual. They weren't prepared to fight the enemy, they were \nfighting each other.\n\n  In May of 1971, there were 4 days of rioting at Travis Air Force Base \nin California ignited by racial incidents on the base; over 100 \nindividuals were arrested and more than 30 Air Force personnel were \ntreated for riot-related injuries. The Marine Corps saw serious racial \nclashes at Camp Lejeune, NC, and Kaneohe Naval Air Station in Honolulu. \nIn the Army, especially in Germany, there were frequent racial clashes.\n  In December of 1970, a special investigating team reported to \nPresident Nixon on the situation in Europe and declared that black \ntroops were experiencing ``acute frustration'' and ``volatile anger'' \nbecause of their treatment.\n  Interestingly, this report cited as a major cause of this frustration \n``the failure in too many instances of command leadership to exercise \nthe authority and responsibility in monitoring the equal opportunity \nprovisions that were already a part of military regulations. . . . ''\n  The military has made significant progress on racial opportunity. I \nam sure more can and should be done, but the progress to date has been \ndriven principally by command leadership at every stage, including the \nenforcement of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n  The point was made by Charles Moskos and John Sibley Butler, two of \nthe utmost authorities on race relations in the military. In 1996 they \nwrote:\n\n       Perhaps surprisingly, no Army regulation deals solely with \n     race relations or equal opportunity. Instead, these issues \n     fall under Army Regulation (AR) 600-20, whose broad concern \n     is ``Army Command Policy.'' This title is more than symbolic. \n     The Army treats good race relations as a means to readiness \n     and combat effectiveness--not as an end in itself. This is \n     the foundation for the Army's way of overcoming race. Racial \n     concerns are broadened into a general leadership \n     responsibility, and commanders are held accountable for race \n     relations on their watch.\n\n  Once again, the emphasis is on commanders, not specialized legal \nprocedures that bypass commanders. My best judgment is we will make the \nmost progress addressing the issue of sexual abuse by holding \ncommanders accountable, not by excluding them from a critical aspect of \nmilitary life.\n  Under the leadership of Senator Levin and Senator Inhofe, the Armed \nServices Committee made significant changes to provisions regarding \nsexual abuse in the military. Moreover Senators McCaskill, Ayotte, and \nFischer will make additional changes in their proposed amendment that \nwill further strengthen our commitment and ability to respond to the \ncrisis of sexual abuse in the military. But it is also important to \ndescribe the ongoing efforts by the Department of Defense to deal with \nsexual abuse in the military.\n  I am drawing on testimony of LTG Flora D. Darpino, the Judge Advocate \nGeneral of the Army, and she described policies effective in the Army, \nbut generally there are equivalent procedures in the other services.\n  The Army began a major effort to combat sexual abuse beginning in \n2004 with the creation of the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response \nProgram, the SAPR Program, and the implementation of restricted \nreporting. This allows victims of sexual assault to confidentially \ndisclose a crime to specifically identified individuals and receive \nmedical treatment and counseling without triggering the official \ninvestigative process.\n  This program has evolved into a comprehensive effort ``fielding a \ncapability of over 11,000 personnel, deployable and available 24 hours \na day,'' to respond to the victims' needs.\n  Included in the procedures available under the SAPR Program are new \nreporting options for the victim, expedited transfers, access to victim \nadvocates and, most recently, access to victim counsel.\n  In addition, this program has a significant educational component \nthat ``saturates Soldier training from the first days of initial entry \ntraining to senior leader forums.'' The training focuses on bystander \nintervention and is\n\n[[Page S8310]]\n\nlinked to ``Army values that bond Soldiers as a team.'' It reinforces \nthe military ethic of selfless service over predation and self-\ngratification.\n  ``In 2009, the Army recognized the need for improved training and \nresources for the prosecution of these crimes.'' Special Victim \nProsecutors were created in the Judge Advocate General's Corps and \nsexual assault investigators were created in the Criminal Investigative \nDivision, CID. Together, these specially trained and experienced \nprofessionals work only special victim cases. They are able to apply \nunprecedented expertise. In addition, all JAG prosecutors and defense \ncounsels have received enhanced training regarding cases of sexual \nabuse.\n  With all of these changes, Lieutenant General Darpino still \nidentifies the commander as the ``critical'' element. In her words: \n``The most critical element of this institutional effort, however, is \nthe focus of commanders.''\n  As such, she points out:\n\n       The Army, like the other services, has moved aggressively \n     to hold commanders accountable for setting a command climate \n     that encourages reporting, deplores conduct that degrades or \n     harasses individuals, and provides a safe environment, free \n     of retaliation, for victims after they come forward. To \n     support this effort, officers and commanders are receiving \n     enhanced training at every level. Specifically, ``the \n     officers entrusted with the disposition of sexual assaults, \n     withheld to the 0-6 (Colonel) Special Court Martial Convening \n     Authority, are required to attend Senior Legal Orientation \n     Courses at the Judge Advocate General's Legal Center and \n     School with a focus on the proper handling of sexual assault \n     allegations. General officers, who will serve as convening \n     authorities, are offered one-on-one instruction in legal \n     responsibilities, again with a focus on sexual assault.''\n\n  Most significantly, in my view, and most recently, the Secretary of \nthe Army, on September 27, 2013, directed that every officer and \nnoncommissioned officer will be rated on how well he or she ``fostered \na climate of dignity and respect and adhered to the Sexual Harassment/\nAssault Response (SHARP) Program.''\n  Secretary McHugh and General Odierno have made it clear that \ncommanders and senior leaders are responsible. Their advancement, their \nretention, their standing in the Army will rest with an annual, \nexplicit, written review of their efforts to combat sexual abuse.\n  I wish to return for a moment to my discussion of the racial \nchallenges facing the Army while I served. Let me also return to the \ncomments of Charlie Moskos, the most respected academic authority and \nalso an Army veteran. In 1986 he wrote:\n\n       More important for blacks than the new race relations \n     curriculum was the revision of the efficiency report, a \n     performance evaluation that carries a lot of weight in all \n     promotions. Starting in the early 1970s, a new category \n     appeared in the official report for officers and NCOs: race \n     relation skills. Filling out this section was mandatory and \n     the requirement was rigorously enforced. More blacks \n     received promotions. Some officers with a poor record on \n     race were relieved of command. All of this set a tone. If \n     for only self-interest, Army officers and NCOs became \n     highly sensitive to the issue of race. Today--\n\n  He is talking about 1986.\n\n     one is more likely to hear racial jokes in a faculty club \n     than in an officers' club. And in an officers' club one will \n     surely see more blacks.\n\n  I think we have made great progress, finally, by focusing on the \nevaluation and efficiency reports that every officer and NCO must \nreceive each year.\n  Now in the context of what the military is doing to combat sexual \nassault and in the context of glaring examples of what it is not doing \nand what it is failing to do, the Armed Services Committee adopted \nprovisions that should rapidly and dramatically combat sexual abuse \nwithin the military. The Secretary of Defense has already taken \nadministrative steps to implement some of these provisions. Senator \nMcCaskill will offer additional provisions with her amendment that I \nwholeheartedly support.\n  It is important to recognize the comprehensive and critical nature of \nthese provisions that are already in the National Defense Authorization \nAct--from improving measures to prevent sexual assault, to protecting \nvictims when it does happen, and strengthening the judicial process to \ndiscipline those who commit such heinous crimes.\n  The bill makes important changes that will improve the prevention of \nsexual assaults. First, the bill prohibits the commissioning or \nenlistment of individuals convicted of rape, sexual assault, forcible \nsodomy, or incest, or attempting to commit these offenses.\n  Second, the bill requires the Secretary of Defense to report on \nwhether legislative action is required to modify the UCMJ to prohibit \nsexual acts and contacts between military instructors and their \ntrainees.\n  The next step is to ensure that all servicemembers understand how \nthey can and must prevent and respond to incidents of sexual assault. \nEach of the services is conducting a variety of training programs on \nsexual assault prevention and response. This bill requires the \nSecretary of Defense to conduct a comprehensive review of the adequacy \nof this training and to then prescribe in regulations such \nmodifications to address any inadequacies identified by this review. \nThe bill also requires the Secretary of Defense to review the adequacy \nof the training, qualifications, and experience of individuals assigned \nto positions responsible for sexual assault prevention and response, to \nretrain or reassign any individual who does not have adequate training \nor qualifications, and to improve the requirements for selection and \nassignment to sexual assault prevention and response billets.\n  Servicemembers who have been sexually assaulted or raped should have \nevery resource available to report the incident, to receive care, and \nto see that justice is done. In crafting this bill, the committee \nacknowledged that many victims do not report such incidents because of \na fear of retaliation from their peers and leaders. So this legislation \nincludes a provision that makes retaliation against servicemembers for \nreporting criminal offenses a punishable offense under the Uniform Code \nof Military Justice. This will ensure that both victims and witnesses \nto such crimes are able to report the occurrence without facing \nretaliatory action or threat of such action. This bill also requires \nthe DOD inspector general to review and investigate allegations of \nretaliatory personnel actions for reporting a rape, sexual assault, or \nsexual misconduct.\n  Next, the bill expands certain existing protections to victims who \nare members of the National Guard and Reserves, and members of the \nCoast Guard. First, it requires the service secretaries to ensure that \nmembers of the National Guard and Reserves have access to a sexual \nassault response coordinator not later than 2 business days following \nthe request for such assistance. These coordinators explain the \nreporting process, address the victim's safety and security needs, and \noffer expertise and available services, including medical care, \ncounseling, and legal support.\n  Second, it clarifies that an existing requirement for the expedited \nchange of station or unit transfer requested by a victim of sexual \nassault also applies to members of the Coast Guard.\n  The bill requires the service secretaries to provide a special \nvictims' counsel to provide legal advice and assistance to \nservicemembers who are victims of a sexual assault committed by a \nmember of the Armed Forces. This resource was initially created by the \nAir Force, in a program that began in January of this year. Since the \ncommittee's markup of this bill, Secretary of Defense Hagel has \ndirected each of the services to implement such a program. This \nprovision will codify administrative action that has already been \ntaken.\n  The bill also authorizes the service secretaries to provide \nguidelines to commanders regarding their authority to temporarily \nreassign or remove from an assignment a servicemember on active duty \nwho is accused of committing or attempting to commit a sexual assault \noffense, not as a punitive measure but solely for the purpose of \nmaintaining good order and discipline within the member's unit. In \naddition, the bill directs the Secretary of Defense to provide \ninformation and discussion of this authority as part of the required \ntraining for new and prospective commanders at all levels of command.\n  The bill also makes several changes to further strengthen the \njudicial process. First, the bill eliminates the element of the \ncharacter and military service of the accused--the so-called good \nsoldier defense--from the factors a commander should consider in \ndeciding how to dispose of an offense.\n\n[[Page S8311]]\n\n  I should add that Senator McCaskill's amendment further limits the \ndefendant's use of good military character as evidence.\n  Second, the bill requires the defense counsel in courts martial to \nmake requests to interview complaining witnesses through the trial \ncounsel, and, if requested by the witness, requires that defense \ncounsel interviews take place in the presence of the trial counsel, \ncounsel for the witness, or outside counsel. This is to protect against \nthe abuse of this process.\n  Next, the bill changes Article 60 of the UCMJ to limit the ability of \na convening authority to modify the findings of a court-martial to \nspecified sexual offenses. In other words, this provision eliminates a \ncommander's ability to overturn a jury's conviction for sexual assault, \nrape, and other crimes.\n  Additionally, the bill requires a mandatory minimum sentence of \ndismissal or dishonorable discharge of a servicemember convicted of a \nsexual assault offense.\n  The bill also eliminates the 5-year statute of limitations on trial \nby court-martial for certain sexually related offenses, and requires \nthat substantiated complaints of a sexually related offense resulting \nin a court-martial conviction, nonjudicial punishment, or \nadministrative action be noted in the service record of the \nservicemember, regardless of the member's grade.\n  Importantly, the bill maintains and strengthens the role of \ncommanders in the judicial process. During the markup of this bill, the \ncommittee adopted an amendment on a bipartisan basis that preserves the \nability of commanders to initiate court-martial proceedings. Removing \nthis authority, which some of our colleagues advocate, would weaken \naccountability and undermine efforts to combat sexual assault. \nCommanders have the responsibility to train their subordinates, they \nare charged with maintaining good order and discipline within their \nunits, and they are responsible for the safety of the men and women \nthey lead. The commander is essential to instilling among the members \nof his or her unit that sexual assault and related behaviors will not \nbe tolerated and will be adjudicated.\n  The bill includes several provisions that address the role of the \ncommanding officer. First, it requires commanding officers to \nimmediately refer to the appropriate military criminal investigation \norganization reports of sexually related offenses involving \nservicemembers in the commander's chain of command. Next, the bill \nrequires automatic higher level review of any decision by a commander \nnot to prosecute a sexual assault allegation, with the review going all \nthe way to the service secretary in any case in which the commander \ndisagrees with the military lawyer's recommendation to prosecute.\n  If a legal counsel advises prosecution, and the commander does not do \nit, ultimately it will be resolved by the service secretary. Most \ncommanders do not want their decisions reviewed by the service \nsecretary. I think this will add more sense and more purpose to their \nefforts to combat sexual abuse.\n  All of these changes take significant steps forward in addressing \nthese horrible crimes. However, we must remain committed to further \nimproving both prevention and response. That is why the bill includes \nseveral provisions related to the review that is currently under way by \nthe independent panel created by last year's Defense authorization \nbill--the Response Systems to Adult Sexual Assault Crimes Panel. This \ncommittee is assessing the systems used to investigate, prosecute, and \nadjudicate crimes involving sexual assault. The bill we are considering \ntoday assigns additional issues to be considered by this panel and \nrequires the panel to produce its report no later than 1 year from its \nfirst meeting, which occurred in July, rather than 18 months, as \noriginally laid out in last year's law.\n  As I mentioned before, Senators McCaskill, Ayotte, and Fischer are \nproposing an amendment that further strengthens all of these provisions \nthat are already in the committee's bill. First, their amendment \nrequires the special victims' counsels to advise victims of the \nadvantages and disadvantages of their cases being prosecuted in a \ncivilian court with jurisdiction or through the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice. The victim may express his or her preference, and \nthis preference must be afforded great weight in the determination to \nprosecute the offense by court-martial or by a civilian court.\n  The amendment codifies the decision by the Department of the Army to \nevaluate the performance of soldiers in adhering to the standards \nregarding sexual assault prevention and response. It extends this \nprovision to every service in the Department of Defense. As previously \nnoted in the context of race relations, this provision is likely to \nmake a profound and lasting contribution to the prevention of sexual \nabuse. That is what we are about here--preventing sexual abuse. This \ncould be one of the key drivers in that effort.\n  The amendment also improves accountability of commanders by requiring \nthat a command climate assessment be performed after an incident \ninvolving a covered sexual offense, as defined in the legislation, for \nboth the command of the victim and the command of the accused, if they \nare in separate commands, or a single assessment if they are in the \nsame command. These assessments will be completed promptly and provided \nto the military criminal investigation organization conducting the \ninvestigation of the offense concerned and to the next higher commander \nin the chain of command of the affected unit.\n  You will know, if you are a commander, if there is an incident in \nyour unit that all the details will be known by your battalion \ncommander, your brigade commander, your division commander, and all the \nway up. That will be another strong incentive to make sure that nothing \nhappens in your unit. That is part of the amendment proposed by my \ncolleagues.\n  This provision, particularly in conjunction with the requirement to \nevaluate servicemembers' compliance under the official report, will go \na long way to provide the accountability and the emphasis on commanders \nto do their jobs.\n  GEN Bruce Clarke, a distinguished officer wounded in the Battle of \nthe Bulge and who was awarded the Silver Star--one of the great heroes \nof the U.S. Army--famously instructed his units that, in his words, \n``an organization does well only those things the boss checks.'' Well, \nwe are checking each individual to make sure commander and \nnoncommissioned officer--they are doing their best. We are checking \neach unit, if there is an incident in that unit, and we are living up \nto the advice of General Clarke. It will get done because, finally, it \nwill be checked consistently, thoroughly and appropriately.\n  The amendment also establishes a confidential process that will \nenable a victim of a sexual assault who is subsequently discharged to \nchallenge the terms or characterization of his or her discharge in \norder to correct possible instances of retaliation. This provision will \nhelp ensure that a discharge accurately reflects the service of the \nindividual, taking into consideration the effects of sexual assault and \nalso helping to remove the concern that reporting sexual abuse could \ninfluence the character of a military discharge. Reporting such a crime \nshould never influence the character of a military discharge.\n  The amendment strengthens the role of the prosecutor in advising \ncommanders on courts martial. The committee language requires the \ncivilian service secretary review all cases where a commander does not \nchoose to prosecute when his or her legal counsel/judge advocate \nrecommends prosecution. The amendment extends that mandatory review if \nthe prosecutor recommends prosecution and the commander demurs. In \neffect, if either the prosecutor or the legal counsel/judge advocate \nrecommends prosecution and the commander demurs, the case will \nautomatically be referred to the civilian service secretary. You will \nhave the highest ranking civilian in the uniform service making the \nfinal call. Every commander will know that.\n  The amendment modifies the Military Rules of Evidence to prevent \ndefendants from introducing evidence of good military character as a \ngeneral defense of a charge. Such evidence may only be admitted if that \ntrait is relevant to an element of the offense for which the accused \nhas been charged. Too often, the good soldier defense has been seen as \novercoming specific evidence directly related to a crime. This\n\n[[Page S8312]]\n\nappearance undermines the essential perception that a verdict is \ndetermined by direct evidence supporting the elements of the crime, not \nthe previous reputation of the defendant. This provision builds upon a \nsection of the underlying bill that eliminates the character and the \nmilitary service of the accused from the factors a commander should \nconsider in deciding how to dispose of an offense.\n  Finally, the amendment ensures that all of the protections of this \nlegislation are extended to the cadets and midshipmen of our service \nacademies. The McCaskill-Ayotte-Fischer amendment strengthens the \ncommittee bill. Through enhanced accountability of commanders and \nadditional changes to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, we will \nstrengthen prevention and prosecution of sexual abuse.\n  Those who argue for the exclusion of the commander from the judicial \nprocess point to the policies of our allies, including Canada, the \nUnited Kingdom, Australia, and Israel. These countries have removed \ncommanders as convening authorities and use independent military or \ncivilian prosecutors to make charging decisions. While it can be useful \nat times to draw comparisons between our Armed Forces and those we \nserve alongside, there are several points to be made with respect to \nour military justice system that do not align.\n  First, none of these countries changed their system in response to a \nsexual assault crisis among their ranks or to protect rights of victims \nmore generally. In most cases the system was changed to protect the \nrights of the accused.\n  Second, none of the allies can draw a correlation between their \nsystem and any change in reporting by victims of sexual abuse. Many \nargue that removing the commander as the decisionmaker will remove a \nsignificant hurdle that victims face in deciding whether to report \nsexual assaults. There is no statistical or anecdotal evidence that \nremoving commanders from the charging decision has had any effect on \nvictims' willingness to report crimes in these judicial systems among \nour allies.\n  In materials provided to the Response Systems Panel, the deputy \nmilitary advocate general for the Israeli Defense Force noted an \nincrease in sexual assault complaints between 2007-2011, attributing no \nspecific reason for the increase but noting that it could represent an \nincrease in the number of offenses or it could be a result of campaigns \nby service authorities to raise awareness on the issue.\n  Similarly, the commodore of Naval Legal Services for Britain's Royal \nNavy has assessed that recent structural changes to their military \njudicial system had no discernible effect on the reporting of sexual \nassault offenses.\n  Third, the scope and scale of our allies' caseloads are vastly \ndifferent, primarily because of the much greater size of the U.S. Armed \nForces. For example, the Canadian military only tried 75 to 80 courts-\nmartial last year, which is roughly comparable to one U.S. Army \ndivision's annual caseload. But several of our allies who have changed \ntheir military justice system have indicated that the changes have \nresulted in the process slowing down and taking longer. Frankly, that \nis one of the issues victims have raised in terms of why they aren't \nreporting and why they are so terribly frustrated--because of the \nlength and duration of the process.\n  Furthermore, most allies cannot conduct courts-martial in a deployed \nenvironment. BG Richard Gross, the legal counsel to the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staffs, stated in a letter:\n\n       One critical feature of our justice system is its \n     expeditionary nature--the ability to administer justice \n     anywhere in the world our forces deploy.\n\n  Notably, the Army alone tried over 950 cases in deployed areas over \nthe past 10 years. In one case in Iraq, four soldiers committed \nmultiple crimes in a single night. The commander referred all four \nsoldiers to court-martial, and they were charged with consuming \nalcohol, breaking into local Iraqi homes, and stealing property and \nmoney from the locals. Because the commander in Iraq had authority to \nrefer these cases to trial, the first trial was underway within 2 \nmonths of the incident. All of the co-accused and many defense \nwitnesses were in the same unit, and local Iraqis were available as \nfact witnesses. Because the commander had a fully deployable military \njustice system at his disposal, he was able to send a strong message to \nthe unit that such conduct would be dealt with swiftly and decisively. \nSimultaneously, he was able to restore positive relations with the \nlocal community.\n  The Army has also cited instances of allied soldiers committing \nsexual assault crimes against U.S. soldiers, and because of the allied \nnation's system removing the authority of the chain of command and \nremoving the process from the battlefield, our commanders would demand \nbut not receive timely information on the status of any prosecution. We \nhad a soldier victim, and they could not find anything about the \nprocess that was going on.\n  Tragically, sexual assault is a crime that historically is \nunderreported, and this is not only with respect to the military. The \nRape, Abuse, and Incest National Network cites Department of Justice \ncrime surveys that show that an average of 60 percent of assaults in \nthe last 5 years were not reported to police. However, in numbers \nreleased earlier this month, DOD showed that more servicemembers are \ncoming forward to report sexual assaults. From October 2012 to June \n2013, 3,553 sexual assault complaints were reported to DOD. That is a \n46-percent increase over the same period a year ago. These cases \ninclude sexual assaults by civilians on servicemembers and by \nservicemembers on civilians. A significant number of the reported \nincidents occurred before the victim had even entered military service.\n  Another argument for removing the commander's authority is that \nindependent JAGs or even civilian authorities will prosecute more \ncases. However, statistics show that commanders from all services have \nexercised jurisdiction and pursued courts-martial for sexual assault \ncases over the determination of civilian authorities. Over the last 2 \nyears, Army commanders have exercised jurisdiction in 49 sexual assault \ncases the local civilian authorities declined to pursue, and 32 of \nthose cases were tried by court-martial, resulting in 26 convictions. \nThe U.S. Marine Corps exercised jurisdiction in 28 sexual assault \ncases, all of which were tried by court-martial, and 16 cases resulted \nin conviction. This goes on throughout every service.\n  Commanders also have an interest in pursuing a court-martial as a way \nto demonstrate the seriousness of the crime and its impact on unit \ndiscipline, not merely because of the quantity or quality of evidence \nthat a crime occurred.\n  On June 4 the Armed Services Committee held a hearing on the \nlegislative proposals to address sexual assault in the military. We \nheard from four colonels from the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air \nForce. They all spoke about the importance of seeking legal advice from \ntheir command judge advocate and having the responsibility to \nadjudicate crimes within their command.\n  COL Donna Martin, commander of the Army's 202nd Military Police Group \nCriminal Investigation Division, stated:\n\n       It is of paramount importance that commanders are allowed \n     to continue to be the center of every formation, setting and \n     enforcing standards, and disciplining those who do not. The \n     commander is responsible for all that happens or fails to \n     happen in his or her unit.\n\n  She went on to say:\n\n       The Uniform Code of Military Justice provides me with all \n     the tools I need to deal with misconduct in my unit from \n     low-level offenses to the most serious, including murder \n     and rape. I cannot and should not relegate my \n     responsibility to maintain discipline to a staff officer \n     or someone else outside the chain of command.\n\n  When asked about whether a commander might be more likely to pursue a \ncourt-martial than even an outside independent officer because of the \ndesire to send a message to his or her unit, Marine Colonel King \nreplied that he considers ``achieving justice for whatever crime was \ncommitted and also the message that I send to the thousands of Marines \nthat are actively watching what's going on. So I can, even if I fail to \nachieve a conviction at whatever level, still send a powerful message \nto them that this kind of conduct, even alleged, even not proven, is \ncompletely unacceptable.''\n  Col. Jeannie Leavitt, commander of the 4th Fighter Wing, stated:\n\n\n[[Page S8313]]\n\n\n       I could absolutely see the scenario where a prosecutor may \n     not choose to prosecute a case or recommend prosecuting a \n     case because of the likelihood of conviction. However, as the \n     commander, I absolutely want to prosecute the case because of \n     the message it sends so that my airmen understand that they \n     will be held accountable. And then we'll let the jury decide \n     what happened in the case and whether or not it will be \n     convicted. But that message is so important, whereas an \n     independent prosecutor may not see the need to take it to \n     trial if the proof is not necessarily going to lead to \n     conviction.''\n\n  Additionally, our service JAGs have expressed several concerns about \nthe proposed amendment my colleague from New York is introducing. I \nwill take a moment and talk about the amendment.\n  I thank and commend Senator Gillibrand because without her \npersistence and passion, we would not be here today. She perhaps has \ndone more than anyone else to focus our attention on this incredibly \nheinous crime done to individuals and the threat to good order, \ndiscipline, and efficiency of the military.\n  Her objective--the elimination of sexual abuse in the ranks of our \nmilitary--must be our objective, and it must be realized. She and her \ncosponsors have determined, in their view, that the removal of the \ncommander from the application of the Uniform Code of Military Justice \nfor a wide variety of offenses is the best approach to achieve the goal \nof ending sexual abuse in the military, but, as my previous comments \nclearly indicate, I disagree. Indeed, given the nature of military \nservice, which is significantly different from civilian life, I believe \nthat without the active involvement of commanders in every phase of \nmilitary life, this goal cannot be effectively and rapidly achieved.\n  The approach in the amendment proposed by my colleague from New York \nposes significant problems in practice that could unwittingly \ncomplicate rather than accelerate efforts to end sexual abuse.\n  The amendment attempts to divide crimes designated by specific \narticles of the UCMJ into two broad categories: traditional military \noffenses subject to command adjudication, such as AWOL and \ninsubordination, and a broad category of serious offenses that would \ntypically constitute civilian criminal offenses, such as murder, \nrobbery, and rape and sexual crimes. In fact, here is a chart depicting \nthe division of the articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n  This second category of offenses would be removed from command \nadjudication and would be referred to an independent prosecutor. This \nindependent prosecutor must be at least a full colonel with \n``significant experience in trials by general or specific court \nmartial'' and be ``outside the chain of command of the member subject \nto such charges.''\n  This bifurcated system--especially considering the scope of crimes \nexcluded from the chain of command--will have profound effects on the \nability of commanders and units to function effectively.\n  Let's take the case, which is not uncommon, of a soldier who writes \nfive checks on five separate occasions for $30 each to the PX knowing \nhe doesn't have the funds to cover his purchases. The Criminal \nInvestigations Division investigates and informs the commander. Under \nthe Gillibrand amendment, the CID must refer this case to the \nindependent prosecutor because it falls under article 123a. These are \nreferred to special prosecutors if they fall under the category. The \nfive separate incidents, although they individually have a maximum \npunishment of 6 months, would be charged together, leading to 30 \nmonths, which exceeds the 1-year threshold for the Gillibrand \namendment. As a result, this would be sent forward to the special \nprosecutor.\n  I hardly think that charging this soldier for writing bad checks is \nthe intent of the Gillibrand amendment, but it will be the effect. It \nalso raises the very practical questions of how the independent \nprosecutor will deal with an onslaught of cases like this when the \nexpectation is that he or she will be focused on sexual abuse and other \nserious crimes, such as murder. There is a practical issue: Are you \ngoing to take a bad check case when you have 15 pending attempted \nmurders, assaults, rapes, et cetera? That is a practical issue, and I \nthink the answer is probably no.\n  Under the amendment, the independent prosecutor has the choice of \nconvening a special court-martial or a general court-martial. A special \ncourt-martial consists of a panel of at least three members or, at the \nservicemember's election, a military judge sitting alone. There is a \nprosecutor, referred to as the trial counsel, and a defense counsel. In \ncomparison, a general court-martial is the military's highest level \ncourt where servicemembers are tried for the most serious crimes--\nroughly analogous to a civilian felony court--and the maximum \npunishments are increased.\n  Before any charge can be sent to a general court-martial, an Article \n32 investigation must be conducted, which is a hybrid of a civilian \ngrand jury proceeding and a preliminary comprehensive discovery \nproceeding. The Article 32 investigation is intended to be more than a \nmere formality; it is a valuable right for the accused and a source of \ninformation for the commander. The general court-martial may consist of \na military judge and not fewer than five members or a military judge \nalone if the defendant chooses. Capital cases require 12 members.\n  As we can see, these proceedings are intensive in terms of time, in \nterms of commitment of military personnel, and in terms of \ninvestigatory efforts. In fact, the average length of special court-\nmartial proceedings ranges from 3 to 5 months. General courts-martial \ncan take anywhere from 5 to 8 months. In cases involving sexual \nassault, both special and general courts-martial take longer--an \naverage of 9 months. Again, this is probably going to delay the \nprocess, not accelerate the process.\n  Given the time and resources involved in a general or special court-\nmartial, in the case of a young soldier writing bad checks and the \nlongstanding practice of reserving general and special courts-martial \nfor the most serious offenses, I seriously doubt that an independent \nprosecutor would take this case. At some point, the independent \nprosecutor will inform the commander, which raises another issue. If \nthis notification is delayed extensively, there is a related problem of \nwhat to do with the soldier under suspicion. Do you deploy him or her \nsubject to recall? Do you leave him behind? So all of these issues are \nimportant.\n  The independent prosecutor's decision is binding on any applicable \nconvening authority for a trial by court-martial on such charges. It is \nbinding on every commander. The amendment, however, does attempt to \npreserve authority to punish these types of offenses by declaring that \nthe independent prosecutor's decision ``shall not operate to terminate \nor otherwise alter the authority of commanding officers'' to employ a \nsummary court-martial or to impose nonjudicial punishment under Article \n15 of the UCMJ. But this authority is absolutely an illusion.\n  Under the UCMJ, every soldier has the right to turn down a summary \ncourt-martial or an Article 15. Once he is informed by counsel that he \nwill not be subject to a general court-martial or a special court-\nmartial, and he can turn down a summary court-martial and article 15, \nthe soldier will invariably refuse the summary court-martial or article \n15. Ironically, in doing so he will demand a court-martial. But the \ncommander cannot comply, as he can now, because he has already been \npreempted by the independent prosecutor.\n\n  This scenario will play out over and over again. A unit is plagued by \na series of barracks thefts which, if unchecked, erodes good order and \ndiscipline. The commander has information that one soldier is boasting \nabout ripping off people but he has no other evidence. During a routine \nhealth and welfare inspection, an iPhone valued at over $500 and \nreported missing is found in the boasting soldier's room. Under the \nGillibrand amendment, the commander must refer the case to the \nindependent prosecutor and again you will have the issues of whether \nthe independent prosecutor takes such a case, and if not, the \nlikelihood that the accused will refuse a summary court-martial or an \nArticle 15 and walk free.\n  Incidents like this--and this is not the intent of the legislation, \nbut this is what will happen--will erode unit cohesion and raise \nquestions at least implicitly: Who is really running the\n\n[[Page S8314]]\n\nunit? The commander? An unseen and unknown JAG, hundreds of miles away? \nOr individual soldiers who may appear to be violating the rules with \nimpunity?\n  This question is important here, but it is critical when a commander \nhas to order soldiers to do dangerous things, and ultimately, that is \nwhat commanders have to do and soldiers have to have no doubt that the \ncommander, he or she, is fully in charge.\n  As I referenced earlier, the bifurcation of the articles of the UCMJ \nposes significant challenges. The problem with the drafting of this \namendment complicates not just cases of common theft, not just issues \nthat you say we could throw out, but the very issue of sexual assault \nwe are trying to address.\n  Let's take another example of a married couple, both of whom are \nActive Duty servicemembers, who get into a shouting match in their \nquarters on post. The husband stabs the wife with a kitchen knife and \nknocks her unconscious. She provides a statement to CID but later \nretracts it. They have another argument which results in his assaulting \nher with an attempt to commit rape. Under the Gillibrand amendment, the \nfirst offense of aggravated assault, Article 128, would have to be \nreferred to the independent prosecutor to decide whether to send the \ncase to a court-martial, while the offense of assault with intent to \ncommit rape, which is specified under Article 134, is exempt from the \nGillibrand proposal and would be referred to the chain of command. \nAssuming both the independent prosecutor and the independent commander \nseek a general court-martial, this particular victim will now have to \nhave two separate Article 32 hearings, two subsequent courts-martial, \nat least doubling the number of times she must recount her nightmare \nand prolonging the administration of justice.\n  The accused will demand and likely get two separate panels for each \nset of offenses, thus doubling the number of officers unavailable for \ntheir duties in the command and more than doubling the administrative, \npersonnel, and witness costs associated with the general court-martial.\n  This is a situation where, rather than streamlining, reinforcing, and \nclarifying the military's efforts to deal with sexual assault, we have \nconfused them, we have delayed them, and we have put commanders in the \nposition of competing with independent prosecutors. This is not going \nto add to the solution on a practical basis of how we deal with sexual \nassault.\n  We know so many of the men and women in our Armed Forces serve our \nnation selflessly. Every day they are prepared to give their lives. \nSexual assault is the antithesis of this ethic. It has no place in the \nArmed Forces, and if not eliminated, it will insidiously destroy our \nmilitary. I believe preventing sexual abuse requires leadership at \nevery stage and that commanders must be involved in every step. I \nbelieve that we will make the most progress in addressing this issue by \ninvolving and holding commanders accountable, not by excluding them \nfrom a critical area of militarily life.\n  We have worked extensively to include provisions in this bill that \nwill improve the prevention of sexual assault, the protection of \nvictims, and the prosecution of perpetrators. We must pledge to do \nmore, to continue our oversight of these programs and make further \nchanges if needed. We owe it to all those who bravely and honorably \nwear the uniform of our Nation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, first, let me thank Senator Gillibrand \nfor her leadership on this issue of sexual assault in our military. I \nsupport her amendment. I believe we need to look at a new way to deal \nwith this issue so there is not only confidence within the military but \nwithin our country that sexual assault will not be tolerated in our \nmilitary and that we have an effective way to deal with it. I thank \nSenator Gillibrand. It is quite clear, as Senator Reed said, without \nher leadership we would not be having these discussions on the floor of \nthe Senate today. I applaud her for that.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Major Nate Somers\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, we are now dealing with the NDAA bill, \nthe National Defense Authorization Act, and it is our opportunity as a \nSenate to weigh in on one of the primary roles of government and that \nis the security of our country, how we can support our men and women in \nour military service to make sure they have the best equipment and the \nbest support and live up to our commitments to our veterans when they \nreturn to civilian life. It is an awesome responsibility. I know each \nof us in our own capacities need to rely on outside help in order to be \nable to carry out this responsibility.\n  We have staff. In my case I have been blessed to have a detailee from \nthe Department of Defense from the Air Force. That person is Maj. Nate \nSomers. I mention that because he will be leaving my assignment very \nshortly, within the next week or so. I wanted to take this time to let \nmy colleagues know, but also to let all the people know, that these \ndetailees who are assigned to our office play a critical role. He has \nhelped me in developing provisions that are in the National Defense \nAuthorization Act and amendments that we are offering that deal with \nmilitary health issues, that deal with regional security concerns, that \ndeal with the impact of sequestration and how we can deal with the \nimpact of sequestration and that deal with human rights issues with \nU.S. leadership globally as well as within the military.\n  To say the least, I could not have done this as effectively as I \nneeded to on behalf of the people of Maryland if it were not for Maj. \nNate Somers. He comes to this assignment with an incredible background. \nHis military record is unbelievable. Major Nate Somers has dedicated \nhis life to serving our Nation. Nate started his career with the U.S. \nAir Force in 2001 when he graduated and received his commission through \nthe Officer Training Program at Mississippi State University. He also, \nI might add, has two master's degrees. Nate then went on to serve in \nArkansas, Florida, and Virginia, and was deployed in support of both \nOperation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. Prior to \njoining my office, Major Somers served as liaison between the Air \nCombat Command and the Air Force Legislative Liaison Director on issues \nranging from constituent inquiries to weapons systems.\n  Over the course of his incredible career, Major Somers has earned 17 \ndifferent major awards and decorations, including the Meritorious \nService Medal and the Air Force Commendation Medal. His receiving these \nawards comes as no surprise to those who know him. Nate demonstrates \nhis extraordinary service to our Nation and to our Armed Forces each \nand every day.\n  There is hardly a day that goes by that I am not better informed \nbecause of his assignment to my Senate office. To say that Major Somers \nwill be missed is an understatement. Nate has truly been a integral \npart of my staff. Whether ensuring our Maryland veterans get the \nservices they need or advising me on complex defense issues, there was \nno task Nate would not do or could not do in order to help our office. \nThe Air Force should be proud of the extraordinary talent they have in \nMaj. Nate Somers. I thank him for his service to this Nation.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to thank Nate's wife and sons \nfor sharing Nate with the Senate and for his service to the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, yesterday morning I was pleased to be \nable to come to the floor of the Senate and join with a good, strong, \ngroup of women from both sides of the aisle to express our joint \ncommitment--really the commitment of every Member of this body--to \naddress the scourge of sexual assault, sexual misconduct within the \nmilitary.\n  I thought it was a good way to start off the debate yesterday on the \nissue of sexual assault within the military, recognizing that some are \nin different places in terms of how we deal with these very important \nissues. But ultimately the goal of each of us is the same. The goal is \nthat we make things right for those who are serving our Nation, and \nthat when it comes to instances of sexual assault, military sexual \ntrauma, sexual harassment, that really there is no place in our \nmilitary for this.\n\n[[Page S8315]]\n\n  We use different terminology when we are discussing the issue of \nsexual misconduct in the military. How we define what we are seeking to \neradicate is important. We have used the more generic term sexual \nassault probably more often to describe the problem that we need to \naddress, but I suggest that definition is probably a bit too narrow. I \nprefer to use the term military sexual trauma, which is the term that \nthe VA, the Veterans Administration, uses to describe a spectrum of \nharms. Their term, the VA's term, military sexual trauma, means ``the \ntrauma resulting from a physical assault of a sexual nature, battery of \na sexual nature, or sexual harassment which occurred while the veteran \nwas serving.''\n  I prefer this term because it emphasizes the various traumas that can \noccur, both with and without physical assaults and batteries. This \ndefinition also calls to our attention the fact that whatever the \ninstrument of trauma there are psychological scars that need to be \naddressed. These are psychological scars that can last a lifetime. I \nthink it is fair to say that this spectrum of scars is broad and it is \ndeep.\n  I have looked very carefully at the work that came out of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee. I have looked at Senator Gillibrand's \namendment very carefully. I have considered all that is being \nincorporated in the Defense Authorization Act. Again, as I mentioned \nyesterday, I am pleased with how in so many different areas we have \nbeen working together to address these issues of military sexual \ntrauma.\n  I am a supporter of Senator Gillibrand's approach to ensure justice \nfor victims of military sexual trauma. Today, I would like to explain \nsome of the reasons why I have chosen to support that approach.\n  The current system of military justice relies upon the individual \ndecisions of commanders for a decision on whether or not an offense is \nto be punished, and which charges are to be brought. In our complex \nmilitary there are many commanders. We all know that. While our code of \nmilitary justice may be uniform, I think we are seeing strong evidence \nthat its implementation is anything but uniform.\n\n  Senator Gillibrand's approach ensures that charges will be \ninvestigated and that the charging decision will be made by \ndisinterested military prosecutors. Decisions will be made by \ndisinterested prosecutors whose only interest is that the perpetrators \naccount for their actions, that victims' interests are protected, and \nthat the integrity of the process is paramount. I think that this is \nvery important. I think this is a breath of fresh air.\n  The recent experiences I have had, as a Senator from Alaska, with the \ntransparency of decisions made within the chain of command leaves much \nto be desired. Unfortunately, we have learned about these situations \nfrom what we read in the headlines, and it makes you say: Oh my gosh. I \ncannot believe this is happening in our military.\n  It makes your stomach turn. We are not hearing this from the chain of \ncommand. We are reading this in our newspapers. We are seeing this \nreported in the media, and that is the first time we hear of them.\n  Case in point: The 49th Missile Defense Battalion, which operates our \nNation's missile defense at Fort Greely. The missile defense \nestablishment at Fort Greely is a very important facility for us in \nAlaska--as well as for the Nation. Last spring it was widely reported \nthat unlawful fraternization among certain members of the battalion--\nrising up into the chain of command--was creating an uncomfortable \nsituation for those who were not part of what I would describe as the \nin-crowd at Fort Greely.\n  Just when I thought I understood what was going on at Fort Greely--\nafter I was told not to worry and that everything was all fixed--there \nwas a bizarre series of events which showed up on my doorstep. The \ncomplainant, who was a member of the Alaska National Guard, was \ninvolved in a child custody dispute with another member of the Alaska \nNational Guard. For reasons I don't understand, the complainant's chain \nof command decided to inject himself into this custody dispute by \ncausing the complainant to be detained in an electrical closet on a \nsecure U.S. military base for a period of days in order to deny him \nlawful visitation with his children. It is also alleged that DOD \ncivilian police and Fort Greely military police were complicit in these \nactions.\n  All of this is detailed in a sworn affidavit, which the complainant \nsubmitted to my office.\n  You just have to shake your head. Are we supposed to call this \nmilitary justice? Maybe it is frontier justice. Maybe it is military \njustice in the last frontier. I don't like it, and I don't think we \nshould ever accept it.\n  I asked the Army CID to look into this incident because it was my \nimpression then that an unlawful denial of one's freedom is a criminal \noffense. I understand that the complaint my office forwarded was not \npursued by the Army CID, but was referred to the Space and Missile \nDefense Command.\n  I am most appreciative that an investigation was pursued, but one \nmight legitimately ask the question: How did it end? What was the \noutcome of this story? I don't know. Alaskans don't know. We don't \nknow. Neither I nor the individual who sought the investigation has \nbeen informed of the outcome, just that the chain of command had looked \ninto it. Where is the transparency?\n  The complainant has been told he needs to file a Freedom of \nInformation Act request in order to get an answer. None of this sits \nright with me as an example of how the chain of command is an \nimpartial, unbiased, and vigorous protector of victims. I am not able \nto see that in this instance. In this case it is alleged that the chain \nof command were either the perpetrators or complicit with the \nperpetrators.\n  Think of the message that sends. Fort Greely is a very small \ninstallation. Folks pretty much know what is going on at smaller \ninstallations. We know of this incident. It has been reported in the \npapers. We were told the chain of command has looked into it, but then \nnothing happened after that.\n  I would like to suggest that this is the only incident that has come \nto my attention, but that is not the case. Literally, less than a month \nago, on October 27, the Anchorage Daily News reported on allegations \nthat were made by senior Alaska National Guard chaplains of pervasive \nand longstanding sexual assault and sexual misconduct within Guard \nranks.\n  There were allegations of some 26 different sexual assault and sexual \nmisconduct incidents that were reported in the news. The chaplains \nbecome aware of these incidents through their own observations and \nthrough complaints that were brought to them by Guard members.\n  I had an opportunity to ask senior leaders of the National Guard \nBureau what they knew about this situation. I asked them when they \nfound out about this situation. You know what the answer was? They read \nabout it in the news clippings. Really? I mean, it just stuns me to \nhear this after we heard about how we have this system--throughout the \nchain of command--that has been addressing this issue. Somewhere there \nis a broken link in this chain.\n  When the media finds out first and reports about it, and the senior \nleaders here are unaware of 26 different allegations, it just causes \none to wonder.\n  It is a truism of management that if you want a problem managed, you \nhave to know about it. You have to measure it and let your subordinates \nknow that their performance is being evaluated on that measure.\n  So answer this question: How can the Secretary of Defense and our \nsenior military leaders ever hope to manage the critical problem before \nus when the deplorable facts--and I am not talking about the number of \ncomplaints--are buried within a decentralized and far flung chain of \ncommand? How can I develop any sense of comfort that those who were \nresponsible for these hideous activities have been brought to justice \nand not just simply moved around the military? It does cause one to \nwonder.\n  It is a horrible truth that we are still dealing with in Alaska, but \nwe have all heard--and are very aware--of the widespread allegations of \nchild sexual abuse within the Catholic Church. We have come to learn \nthat the Church, in fact, was aware of many of these allegations. \nUnfortunately, for a period of time, the way they handled the problem \nwas to move the offending clergy to other places. Some of them were\n\n[[Page S8316]]\n\nmoved to the State of Alaska. If they acted inappropriately in an urban \ncommunity, they were shipped out to a bush community--a very remote \nplace.\n  Out of sight, out of mind, and free to offend again. That is not \nresponsibility. That is not accountability. That is not how it should \nbe done within the church, and it certainly should not happen within \nour military.\n  We have all shared many different victim stories here on the Senate \nfloor. I want to add that the more this issue of military sexual trauma \nand sexual assault has been discussed on the Senate floor, more victims \nhave come to speak to me.\n  I was in my home State 2 weeks ago for a big outdoor community event. \nIt was a pretty cold Saturday afternoon. I was approached by a woman \nwho had seen me from across the street. She was attending a conference \nat the time. She came across the street and into the town square. She \nwas not wearing a coat. She wanted to make sure that I knew she too had \nbeen a victim but had not had the strength to report the crime. She \njust left the service.\n  She said to me: Don't give up on this because I had to step down from \nmy military career and the perpetrator stayed on, and as he stayed on, \nhe continued to be promoted. Her plea to me was: Please don't let that \ncontinue.\n  I want to share another story that is very personal to me. I think \nall of us as Members of the Senate know what a privilege and honor it \nis to nominate qualified constituents to attend our Nation's service \nacademies. The military stands very tall in the eyes of Alaskans, so in \nmy State these nominations are highly competitive.\n  Last spring I became aware that one of my nominees who was accepted \ninto one of the service academies and did phenomenally well was \nsexually assaulted at the academy. I was following this young woman \nbecause I knew her family.\n  She graduated and was commissioned, but now the burden of dealing \nwith the fact that she was not protected from the crime has caused her \nto resign her commission. She put 4 years of very hard work toward a \nmilitary career, and now that career is in the garbage.\n  I contacted her recently. She is a strong woman, but her dreams have \nbeen completely dashed by what she experienced.\n  Many of my colleagues know I have taken a keen interest in the work \nof our service academies. I served for a short time on the Board of \nVisitors of one of the academies, but I was not aware of the trauma my \nconstituent had suffered until she contacted me long after graduation. \nI don't recall any substantial discussions about issues like this \nduring my tenure on the Board of Visitors. It needs to be discussed. It \nnot only needs to be discussed but action needs be taken to eliminate \ninstances like that from ever happening.\n  These issues are all current issues, but not all of these issues are \nnew. Earlier this year I came to know a woman by the name of Trina \nMcDonald. At one point in time she had the opportunity to live in the \nState of Alaska as a servicemember. So many of our servicemembers who \nhave been stationed in Alaska want to stay for life. They want to \nretire there because they love it. Unlike many of her colleagues, Trina \nchose to try to forget everything that had been attached to her service \nin Alaska. She prefers to forget that experience. That is because she \nwas sexually assaulted while serving in my home state.\n  Many of you may have seen ``The Invisible War.'' Ms. McDonald speaks \nof the experiences she had when she was assigned to the Navy and \nstationed at Adak, which is now a closed naval base on the Aleutian \nChain. This happened about 20 years ago. Trina asserts she was \nrepeatedly drugged, raped, and ultimately dumped in the Bering Sea by \nsuperior officers.\n  What did the chain of command do? Trina states that she had no place \nto turn because both the police and her superiors were the \nperpetrators. What do you do? Where do you go? Where is the redress? It \npains me to think that the issues, which today are very high in the \nattention of this body, have been out here for 20-plus years. I have \nlistened to my colleagues on the floor talk about the Tailhook scandal, \nand we have talked about so many of the other high profile instances \nwhere we have heard our military leaders say, Never again; never again; \nzero tolerance. They are using all the right words.\n\n  It really does cause us to ask the question: Are we to attribute this \ncycle of violence we are seeing to attention deficit on the part of us \nhere in Congress or attention deficit on the part of our military \nleaders? This is not what zero tolerance looks like. Whatever the case, \nI think it is going to take some very strong medicine to break through \nthis powerful attention deficit we have seen historically.\n  Incremental steps, in my view, don't cut it anymore. For the young \nwoman, again, whose military career is no longer; the woman I met out \nin the cold 2 weeks ago who gave up her dream and has just had to stand \nby and watch her perpetrator ascend his career ladder, incremental \nmeasures don't cut it.\n  I think it is time for profound change. I think the amendment offered \nby the Senator from New York, while it is strong medicine, and I \nacknowledge that, I think it is the right tool for what we are dealing \nwith at this time.\n  With that, I thank the Presiding Officer and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I wish to reiterate my strong support \nfor Senator Gillibrand's reforms to the military justice system. I am \nproud to be an original cosponsor of this act, and I should add it has \nbeen a pleasure working with Senator Gillibrand on the issue. Her \npassion and commitment to rooting out sexual assault in the military \nought to be inspiring to all of us, and watching how she negotiates and \nhow she lobbies for her ideas can teach all of us a good lesson.\n  I should also add that I appreciate the work of the Armed Services \nCommittee, which added a large number of commonsense reforms to the \nunderlying bill. In fact, some of them are so commonsense that one has \nto wonder why the military hasn't adopted them already or, if need be, \nasked for legislation to do so before now.\n  For instance, the bill before us provides that people convicted of \ncertain sexual assault offenses may not join the Armed Forces--common \nsense. It requires mandatory discharge from the Armed Forces of any \nmember convicted of certain sexual assault offenses--common sense. It \ndirects a comprehensive review of the adequacy of training pertaining \nto sexual assault prevention and response--common sense.\n  The underlying bill also has a number of provisions to address \ncertain concerns about commanding officers not handling sexual assault \ncharges properly but still keeps this judicial process in the chain of \ncommand. That is inappropriate; hence, this amendment.\n  We have tried working within the current system. This isn't a new \nissue. Military leaders have been making emphatic promises about \ntackling the problem of sexual assault for years and years, but the \nproblem only seems to be getting worse. What is more, the current \nsystem appears to be part of the problem. There is a culture that has \nto change, and it won't change by itself.\n  According to a recent Defense Department report, 50 percent of female \nvictims stated they did not report the crime. Why? Because they \nbelieved that nothing would be done with their report.\n  Seventy-four percent of females and 60 percent of males perceive one \nor more barriers to reporting sexual assault. Sixty-two percent of the \nvictims who reported a sexual assault indicated they received some form \nof professional, social, or administrative retaliation. This should not \nhappen in a military where everybody ought to be looking out for \neverybody else.\n  A very cohesive unit is essential for everybody's protection but also \nfor the success of the mission. So it is a terrible deterrent when \nsexual assaults ought to be reported 100 percent but aren't. If sexual \nassault cases are not reported, it is quite obvious, common sense tells \nus they can't be prosecuted. If sexual assault isn't prosecuted, common \nsense ought to tell us it leads to predators remaining in the military \nand a perception that that sort of activity will be tolerated or a \nperson can get away with it. Common sense tells us that people get away \nwith it.\n\n[[Page S8317]]\n\n  By allowing this situation to continue, we are putting at risk the \nmen and women who have volunteered to place their lives on the line. We \nare also seriously damaging military morale and military readiness. \nTaking prosecutions out of the hands of commanders and giving them to \nprofessional prosecutors who are independent of the chain of command \nwill help ensure impartial justice for the men and women in uniform.\n  I know some Senators will be nervous about the fact that the military \nis lobbying against this legislation. There is a certain awe that \npermeates among Senators when people with stars on their shoulders \nappear among us. We are being asked, once again--that environment is \nhere--to wait and see if the latest attempt to reform the current \nsystem will do the trick. I respond that the time for trying tweaks to \nthe current system and waiting for another report or study has long \nsince passed.\n  We also hear that this measure will affect the ability of commanders \nto retain good order and discipline. I would like to be clear that we \nin no way take away the ability of commanders to punish troops under \ntheir command for their military infractions. Commanders also can and \nshould be held accountable for the climate under their command. But the \npoint here is sexual assault is a law enforcement matter, not a \nmilitary one.\n  If anyone wants official assurances that we are on the right track, \nwe can take confidence in the fact that an advisory committee appointed \nby the Secretary of Defense himself supports our reforms. On September \n27 of this year, the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the \nServices--and I believe that acronym is DACOWITS--voted overwhelmingly \nin support of each of the components of the Military Justice \nImprovement Act amendment.\n\n  This advisory committee isn't something new. These various advisory \ncommittees under different Secretaries of Defense have been around \nsince 1951 when they were created by then-Secretary of Defense George \nC. Marshall. The committee is composed of civilian and retired military \nmen and women who are appointed by the Secretary of Defense to provide \nadvice and recommendations on matters and policies relating to the \nrecruitment and retention, treatment, employment, integration, and \nwell-being of highly qualified professional women in the Armed Forces. \nHistorically, this advisory committee's recommendations have been very \ninstrumental in affecting changes to laws and policies pertaining to \nmilitary women.\n  The bottom line is--and, again, this is common sense--this isn't some \nadvocacy group or fly-by-night panel. It is a longstanding advisory \ncommittee handpicked by the Secretary of Defense, and it supports the \nsubstance of our amendment to a tee.\n  I know it is easier to support incremental reforms. That is even \nprudent in some cases. However, when we are talking about something as \nserious and life-altering as sexual assault, we cannot afford to wait \nany longer than we already have. Our men and women serving in this \nmilitary deserve bold action to solve this problem--not in a few years \nor a little bit at a time but right now. So I urge my colleagues to be \nbold and join us in this effort. It is the right thing to do.\n  It seems to me as though a lot of debates in this body get \ncomplicated, and this one seems to be complicated too by some people. \nBut it is really a very simple issue. It doesn't need to be this \ncomplicated, because it talks about changing the culture. I know there \nare cultures in every bureaucracy that need to be changed that affect \ntheir operations, but none of them are as damaging as the No. 1 \nresponsibility of the Federal Government. So a culture in the Defense \nDepartment has to be taken seriously. We have to change the culture.\n  When one joins the military--and I haven't been in the military so I \ndon't speak with authority, but it seems to me as I understand the \nmilitary--I have a grandson in the Marines and I had sons in the \nmilitary. But when a person joins, they join because they feel that \neverybody in that unit will have each other's back. There should be no \nfear of anyone--anyone--in the unit. There should be nothing but \nrespect for each other. Members of the military should have confidence \nin each other and loyalty toward each other. They are all on the same \nmission. None of them should be considered an enemy. None of them \nshould have any particular power over another. That is what this sexual \nassault thing is all about--power over weak individuals--not weak \nbecause of who they are, but weak because of the power of the people \nabove.\n  This is badly needed legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Madam President, this is a tough issue. It is a tough \nissue because good people don't agree. Good people don't see the issue \nthe same way. But we cannot lose sight of the fact that so many of the \nreforms we will be voting on to guarantee a safe haven, to guarantee a \nsafe experience, a common camaraderie, are all parts of a big plan for \nchange. What we are debating today is one small portion of that--not \nsmall in the sense of impact. We need to make sure we reward all of the \ngreat work the committee has done, the great work that has been done \nwith the leadership of Senator McCaskill from the great State of \nMissouri, and the commitment that this body is making today, in a very \nunified way, to change the outcome.\n  I will spend a moment with that in mind to talk about how I came to \nmy decision to support the Gillibrand amendment. I wish to first talk \nabout my experience. I am probably one of the few people in this body \nwho has actually sat across a table as somebody who had the power to \nmake the decision on whether we were going to, in fact, pursue a \nprosecution and have that discussion. I know that is a shared \nexperience I have with Senator McCaskill, and those are experiences we \nwill never forget--the damage that is done so often when people are \nvictims of sexual assault, beyond other kinds and other forms of \nphysical assault, the power and the responsibility. So I recognize the \ngreat need we have to deal with this issue. I recognize the great need \nwe have to have professionals make the decision.\n  The bottom line for me is, if someone came forward and appendicitis \nwas suspected, he or she wouldn't ask the commanding officer to make \nthe decision for the doctor. What I am suggesting today is that these \nare very difficult decisions on whether one is going to pursue or \ndecline a prosecution and they should be made by people who are \ntrained. There should be a whole system--as we have seen in the civil \nside--a whole system of support.\n\n  Frequently we talked about, back in the 1980s and the 1990s--as we \nwere moving through these same questions in the civil courts--not \nrevictimizing the victim. I think what you are hearing today is story \nupon story where victims of sexual assault in the military feel not \nonly let down but they feel revictimized.\n  So I want to very quickly go through a couple of the points we have \nheard over and over, which is that this change in the Gillibrand \namendment would affect good order and discipline in the military. I \nhave heard this from many of the military, the good military leaders \nwho have come to my office to talk about this problem: that they need \nthis authority, this specific convening authority, because their orders \nwill fall on deaf ears or their leadership will be questioned.\n  I am not an expert in leadership, but I have to ask you: Do we really \nbelieve that sort of authority is truly essential to being someone whom \nthe troops will follow, someone who demands respect, who inspires \ndevotion or truly will stand and fight side by side no matter what the \ncost?\n  The conclusion I make is that I do not think so. Because when I talk \nto our brave veterans in North Dakota or our noncommissioned officers \nwho lead our servicemembers every single day, that is not what I hear. \nI hear: I knew he would do the same for me. Not: Well, he has convening \nauthority.\n  That is what I believe inspires and maintains good order and \ndiscipline: the shared values of a mission, of trust, of concern, and \nrespect.\n  I also have heard great reforms, especially in the Air Force--and we \nhave a special relationship in North Dakota to the Air Force, having \ntwo air bases. The Air Force JAG came in and told me about the new \nprocess and the new procedures and impressed upon me this\n\n[[Page S8318]]\n\ngreat opportunity they had taken now for change. I said one thing. I \nsaid: It is too late. It is too late to expect that we are going to \nbelieve it this time. It's the old adage: ``Fool me once, shame on you; \nfool me twice, shame on me.'' We are at that point now where something \nvery dramatic needs to happen in order to send the very important \nmessage that you matter and this behavior does not reflect behavior \nthat is becoming of our troops, of our country, and the people who step \nup to serve our country.\n  Progress that has been made does not go far enough. I think it is \ntime to boldly act and step up for people who serve, who have stepped \nup bravely and said: What can I do, no matter the cost or the \nsacrifice--knowing the hardship they will endure and the distance from \nhome and family who love and care for them; that when they go, our \nmilitary personnel say: I am yours. I will go and do whatever I need to \ndo, whatever you tell me, to protect our values and to protect our way \nof life.\n  It seems a small thing to do everything we can to protect those who \nprotect us. The time has come to address this, to send a strong and \nimportant message to our volunteer service that we will not tolerate \nthis and that we will put this decision in the hands of the people who \nare best equipped to make this important decision. And that is the \nprosecutors.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business for 10 minutes, without taking \nthe time from either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Texas and \nthe Senator from Missouri for their courtesy, and I will endeavor to do \nit a little quicker than in 10 minutes.\n\n\n                         Changing Senate Rules\n\n  Madam President, this weekend, Vanderbilt plays Tennessee in a \nfootball game in Knoxville. Let's say Vanderbilt gets on the 1-yard \nline of Tennessee and Tennessee then says: Well, we are the home team. \nLet's add 20 yards or whatever it takes to win the game. Or let's say \nin the World Series recently the Red Sox were behind St. Louis in the \nninth inning and the Red Sox said: Well, we are the home team. Let's \nadd a couple of innings or whatever it takes to win the game. Everyone, \nI think, would say that is cheating. Everyone would say: You are \ndestroying the game of football or baseball.\n  If a home team could change the rules at any time during the game or \nwhatever it takes to win the game, what kind of game is it? That is \nwhat Senator Vandenberg said after World War II and Senator Levin \nrepeated to all of us--that a Senate in which a majority can change the \nrules any time the majority wants to change the rules is a Senate \nwithout any rules.\n  Yet we hear that is what the Democratic majority may be seeking to do \nthis week. They are unhappy, they say, that Republicans have said it is \npremature to vote up or down on three circuit judges nominated by \nPresident Obama--even though that was exactly the position of the \nDemocratic Senators in 2006 and 2007 when they argued that the DC \nCircuit Court is underworked and that we should transfer judges from \nwhere they are needed the least to where they are needed the most. So \nthey are going to change the rules of the game during the game or \nwhatever it takes to get the results they want.\n  We have a lot of new Senators on both sides of the aisle. Nearly half \nthe Senate, 44 members, are in their first term. It is important for \nthem to remember that in Senator Reid's book he said that to do this \nwould be the end of the U.S. Senate, that Senator Robert Byrd--probably \nthe most distinguished Senate historian in its history--said in his \nlast speech to us that the filibuster is the necessary fence against \nthe excesses of the majority and of the Executive. It is the fence \nagainst what de Tocqueville called in the early 1830s the greatest \ndanger to our country that he saw, which was the tyranny of the \nmajority.\n  You may ask, how could this possibly happen? Here is how I am afraid \nit is happening. Sometimes we get off in our rooms by ourselves--and \nRepublicans do it as well as Democrats--and we give ourselves our own \nversion of the facts. The last time this came up, we tried to address \nthis in the Old Senate Chamber. I think all of us thought it was a \npretty good session. But this is my third opportunity to respond to \nthese nuclear threats, and I am not going to do it again.\n  The President said during the government shutdown that he was not \ngoing to negotiate with a gun to his head. Neither am I. Democrats have \nhad their finger on the nuclear button for 2 years. I hope they will \nreconsider.\n  No. 1, I hope they will read Senator Leahy's letter, which I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 2006.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter: We write to request that you \n     postpone next week's proposed confirmation hearing for Peter \n     Keisler, only recently nominated to the DC Circuit Court of \n     Appeals. For the reasons set forth below, we believe that Mr. \n     Keisler should under no circumstances be considered--much \n     less confirmed--by this Committee before we first address the \n     very need for that judgeship, receive and review necessary \n     information about the nominee, and deal with the genuine \n     judicial emergencies identified by the Judicial Conference.\n       First, the Committee should, before turning to the \n     nomination itself, hold a hearing on the necessity of filling \n     the 11th seat on the DC Circuit, to which Mr. Keisler has \n     been nominated. There has long been concern--much of it \n     expressed by Republican Members--that the DC Circuit's \n     workload does not warrant more than 10 active judges. As you \n     may recall, in years past, a number of Senators, including \n     several who still sit on this Committee, have vehemently \n     opposed the filling of the 11th and 12th seats on that court:\n       Senator Sessions: ``[The eleventh] judgeship, more than any \n     other judgeship in America, is not needed.'' (1997)\n       Senator Grassley: ``I can confidently conclude that the DC \n     Circuit does not need 12 judges or even 11 judges.'' (1997)\n       Senator Kyl: ``If . . . another vacancy occurs, thereby \n     opening up the 11th seat again, I plan to vote against \n     filling the seat--and, of course, the 12th seat--unless there \n     is a significant increase in the caseload or some other \n     extraordinary circumstance.'' (1997)\n       More recently, at a hearing on the DC Circuit, Senator \n     Sessions, citing the Chief Judge of the DC Circuit, \n     reaffirmed his view that there was no need to fill the 11th \n     seat: ``I thought ten was too many . . . I will oppose going \n     above ten unless the caseload is up.'' (2002)\n       In addition, these and other Senators expressed great \n     reluctance to spend the estimated $1 million per year in \n     taxpayer funds to finance a judgeship that could not be \n     justified based on the workload. Indeed, Senator Sessions \n     even suggested that filling the 11th seat would be ``an \n     unjust burden on the taxpayers of America.''\n       Since these emphatic objections were raised in 1997, by \n     every relevant benchmark, the caseload for that circuit has \n     only dropped further. According to the Administrative Office \n     of the United States Courts, the Circuit's caseload, as \n     measured by written decisions per active judge, has declined \n     17 percent since 1997; as measured by number of appeals \n     resolved on the merits per active judge, it declined by 21 \n     percent; and as measured by total number of appeals filed, it \n     declined by 10 percent. Accordingly, before we rush to \n     consider Mr. Keisler's nomination, we should look closely--as \n     we did in 2002--at whether there is even a need for this seat \n     to be filled and at what expense to the taxpayer.\n       Second, given how quickly the Keisler hearing was scheduled \n     (he was nominated only 28 days ago), the American Bar \n     Association has not yet even completed its evaluation of this \n     nominee. We should not be scheduling hearings for nominees \n     before the Committee has received their ABA ratings. \n     Moreover, in connection with the most recent judicial \n     nominees who, like Mr. Keisler, served in past \n     administrations, Senators appropriately sought and received \n     publicly available documents relevant to their government \n     service. Everyone, we believe, benefited from the review of \n     that material, which assisted Senators in fulfilling their \n     responsibilities of advice and consent. Similarly, the \n     Committee should have the benefit of publicly available \n     information relevant to Mr. Keisler's tenure in the Reagan \n     Administration, some of which may take some time to procure \n     from, among other places, the Reagan Library. As Senator \n     Frist said in an interview on Tuesday, ``[T]the DC Circuit\n\n[[Page S8319]]\n\n     . . . after the Supreme Court is the next court in terms of \n     hierarchy, in terms of responsibility, interpretation, and in \n     terms of prioritization.'' We should therefore perform our \n     due diligence before awarding a lifetime appointment to this \n     uniquely important court.\n       Finally, given the questionable need to fill the 11th seat, \n     we believe that Mr. Keisler should not jump ahead of those \n     who have been nominated for vacant seats identified as \n     judicial emergencies by the non-partisan Judicial Conference. \n     Indeed, every other Circuit Court nominee awaiting a hearing \n     in the Committee, save one, has been selected for a vacancy \n     that has been deemed a ``judicial emergency.'' We should turn \n     to those nominees first; emergency vacancies should clearly \n     take priority over a possibly superfluous one.\n       Given the singular importance of the DC Circuit, we should \n     not proceed hastily and without full information. Only after \n     we reassess the need to fill this seat, perform reasonable \n     due diligence on the nominee, and tend to actual judicial \n     emergencies, should we hold a hearing on Mr. Keisler's \n     nomination.\n       We thank you for your consideration of this unanimous \n     request of Democratic Senators.\n           Sincerely,\n     Patrick Leahy.\n     Chuck Schumer.\n     Russ Feingold.\n     Ted Kennedy.\n     Dianne Feinstein.\n     Dick Durbin.\n     Herb Kohl.\n     Joe Biden.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. It was signed in 2006 by all the Democratic members of \nthe Judiciary Committee: Senator Leahy, Senator Feinstein, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Biden, Senator Schumer, Senator Durbin, Senator \nFeingold, and Senator Kohl. These Senate Democrats said under no \ncircumstances should we consider confirming a judge to the DC Circuit \nwhen it is so underworked. So the Republican President and the \nDemocratic Senate agreed with that and reduced the Court's size by one \njudge--just the same argument being made today.\n  No. 2, any suggestion that the President's nominations are being held \nup is completely wrong. I invited the Congressional Research Service \ninto my office. I asked that question. They have said: No. President \nObama's cabinet nominations in his second term are being considered at \nabout the rate as those of President Clinton and President George W. \nBush.\n  On every Senator's desk is an Executive Calendar. Every person who \ncould be confirmed by the Senate is on this calendar. There are about \n11 pages. The one who has been on there the longest goes back to \nFebruary and six were reported in the Summer. But all the rest of them \ngo back just to September 12--just a few weeks. Most of them have been \nthere just 3 or 4 weeks.\n  So people are not being held up. The only way a nominee can be \nreported to the Senate floor is by a Democratic committee. The only \nperson who can bring them from the calendar to be confirmed is the \nDemocratic leader. Why doesn't he bring them to the floor and let them \nbe confirmed?\n  In the history of the Senate--and this is from the Congressional \nResearch Service--there have only been 17 executive nominees in its \nhistory who have failed to be seated because of a filibuster vote, a \nfailed cloture vote. There have been two under the Clinton \nadministration, three in the Bush administration, two in the Obama \nadministration. There have been five Bush circuit judges and five Obama \ncircuit judges. Never a Supreme Court Justice--there was a little \nexception with Abe Fortas, which was different--never a district court \njudge, and never a Cabinet member denied a seat by a filibuster--a \nfailed cloture vote. So where is the crisis?\n  In conclusion, I would make this suggestion: I think what makes \nAmericans angry about ObamaCare is it is taking us in the wrong \ndirection, it is the 3,000-page bill, but as much as anything else it \nis the raw exercise of political power in the middle of the night \nduring a snowstorm to pass a bill by a partisan vote, without any \nbipartisan support.\n  If the Democrats proceed to use the nuclear option in this way, it \nwill be ObamaCare II, it will be the raw exercise of political power to \nsay: We can do whatever we want to do.\n  Grantland Rice, a famous sportswriter, once said: ``It's not whether \nyou win or lose, it's how you play the game.'' In this case, it is not \nso much what the rule is, it is how you change the rule. There have \nalways been a few Senators on either side of the aisle who care enough \nabout our institution and enough about our Constitution of checks and \nbalances to stop a stampede that we will later regret. I hope that will \nbe true again. I hope we will resist turning the Senate into an \ninstitution where the home team can cheat to win the game, to get \nwhatever result it wants at any time it wants. Because as Senator \nVandenberg said, and Senator Levin has repeated: A Senate where a \nmajority can change the rules any time it wants is a Senate without any \nrules at all.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a 1-page \nsummary of the 17 nominations that have not been confirmed after a \nfailed cloture vote, which, according to the Congressional Research \nService, is the entire number in the history of the U.S. Senate that \nhave ever been denied their seat by a filibuster.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Nominations Not Confirmed After a Failed Cloture Vote\n\n                            Executive Branch\n\n\n                            Clinton Nominees\n\n       Sam Brown--to be Ambassador to the Conference on Security \n     and Cooperation in Europe\n       Henry Foster--to be U.S. Surgeon General\n\n\n                          G.

The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes to respond to \nthe statement just made by my colleague from Tennessee, my friend, \nLamar Alexander.\n  We have a circumstance here in the U.S. Senate which is----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On whose time does the Senator speak?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am sorry. I did not know we were in \ncontrolled time, so I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Gillibrand \namendment. I am proud to support Senator Gillibrand's concerted effort \nto deal with the problem of sexual assault in our military.\n  I want to begin by commending her persistent leadership in forging a \nbipartisan coalition to tackle this serious problem. I supported the \nGillibrand amendment in committee, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of \nthe amendment here on the floor of the Senate. I rise today to share my \nreasons for supporting it and to encourage my colleagues to continue to \ncome together in support of this amendment.\n  Everyone in this body wants to support the men and women of our \nmilitary. In the course of the Senate Armed Services Committee hearings \non sexual assault, we heard testimony after testimony after testimony \nabout the persistent problem of sexual assault in the military. I found \nmyself persuaded by the arguments that Senator Gillibrand raised in \ndefense of her amendments.\n  Indeed, when I said at the hearing that I had been persuaded by the \narguments, I have to tell you, afterwards a reporter from a newspaper \ncame up to me astonished, and asked, in wonderment: Were you really \npersuaded by arguments at a hearing? I thought everyone came in with \ntheir views already set in stone, and nothing that was said here made a \ndifference.\n  I chuckled and said: Well, the arguments Senator Gillibrand put forth \nI\n\n[[Page S8320]]\n\nfound powerful in terms of how do we deal with a serious problem.\n  There were two arguments in particular that I found persuasive. The \nfirst is that sexual assault has proven to be a persistent problem in \nthe military. According to the Defense Department, 3,374 cases of \nunwanted sexual contact were reported last year.\n  More than 23,000 additional cases of unwanted sexual contact went \nunreported. This has been a problem that has been present in the \nmilitary for decades. Our commanders, our generals, our admirals, have \nworked in good faith, have worked diligently to correct this problem. \nIt has proven a persistent problem. Yet, unfortunately, their efforts \nto correct the problem have not proven successful.\n  In the civilian side, one of the great challenges when it comes to \nsexual assault is the relatively low rate of reporting. Sadly, on the \nmilitary side, that problem is even greater. The most significant \nbarrier we see to deterring and preventing sexual assault is that many \nof the victims are unwilling, are not comfortable coming forward and \nreporting the assaults they are experiencing. Despite the repeated \ngood-faith efforts of our military commanders, we have been unable to \nfix that problem.\n  The second argument Senator Gillibrand raised that I find quite \npersuasive is that a number of our allies, including Great Britain, \nincluding Israel, including Canada, including Germany, have implemented \nreforms quite similar to the reforms she is proposing, which is namely \nthat the decision whether to bring a prosecution for a crime like \nsexual assault should be made by an impartial military prosecutor and \nnot by the commanding officer who may well be the commanding officer \nboth of the victim of the crime and the perpetrator of the crime. Those \nreforms have been implemented by our allies. Our allies have not seen \ngood order and discipline undermined. Indeed, the data suggests they \nhave seen an increase in reporting rates. Those are the arguments that \npersuaded me that we need to solve this problem, we need to stop this \nproblem.\n  Let me point out that the coalition supporting the Gillibrand \namendment is a bipartisan coalition. This cuts across party lines.\n  In my view, there are two strong conservative principles, both of \nwhich the Gillibrand amendment furthers. No. 1, all of us want to \nstrengthen our military, ensure that good order and discipline are \nprotected; that our commanders are effective; that we maintain the \nstrongest fighting force on the face of the planet. But, No. 2, all of \nus want to prevent and deter violent crime and to ensure that anyone \nwho commits violent crime, and in particular a crime of a sexual \nnature, meets swift and sure punishment.\n  Prior to being elected in the Senate I spent many years in law \nenforcement working to ensure that those guilty of violent crimes, and \nin particular crimes of sexual violence against children, against \nwomen, received the swiftest and surest punishment.\n  In my view, the Gillibrand amendment furthers both of these \nconservative objectives. I have tried to think about this issue not \njust from the perspective of a Senator but also from the perspective of \na father. My wife and I have two little girls, Caroline and Catherine, \nwho are 5 and 3. I have tried to think if some years hence Caroline or \nCatherine made a decision to step forward and volunteer to serve in our \nArmed Forces, what are the rules I would want to be in place to ensure \nthat my daughters were protected against any risk of sexual assault.\n  Given the two-decade-plus history that we have seen in the military \nof not being able to effectively prevent these crimes and not having \nvictims willing to come forward and report, in my view, shifting not to \na civilian authority but to an impartial military prosecutor is going \nto significantly increase the reporting rates, which, in turn, is going \nto deter these crimes from being committed.\n  All of us owe a duty to our soldiers, our sailors, airmen, and \nmarines, the young men and women who voluntarily step forward to risk \neverything to defend our Nation. For one of those young soldiers to \nfind himself or herself the victim of sexual assault is an absolute \nviolation of that trust.\n  The Supreme Court has referred to rape as ``short of murder, the \nultimate violation of self.'' All of us have an obligation to make sure \nwe are protecting our soldiers. An environment where young men and \nwomen in the military fear the risk of sexual assault or are not able \nto come forward and report those crimes is not an environment that \nfurthers good order and discipline. So I would encourage all of my \nfriends in this body, both Democrats and Republicans, to come together \nin support of this commonsense proposal to strengthen our military, and \nat the same time to deter and punish the unacceptable, unspeakable \ncrimes of sexual assault so we can together honor the commitment we owe \nto all men and women in the military.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a very \nimportant issue I spoke about on the floor yesterday; that is, \neliminating sexual assaults in our military, making sure victims are \nsupported, that they get the support they need.\n  Yesterday on the floor I talked about important reforms we are doing \ntogether on a bipartisan basis to make sure victims receive special \nvictims' counsel, so each victim is now going to receive an attorney \nwho represents him or her in the system, and stands up for their \nrights.\n  We make retaliation a crime under the Uniform Code of Military \nJustice so that victims of sexual assault understand if they are \nretaliated against, there will be a crime for that. In fact, those who \nretaliate will be brought to justice.\n  There are many other dozens of reforms that are in the Defense \nauthorization, but today I want to talk about a very important issue. I \nsee on the floor Senator McCaskill. I want to commend her for her \nleadership on this issue. She has been a tremendous leader. Senator \nMcCaskill, Senator Fischer from Nebraska, and I have offered an \namendment that will further strengthen historic reforms that we \ndiscussed yesterday on the Defense authorization, including allowing a \nvictim to formally express their wish about how their case will be \nhandled, in addition to their being, of course, provided special \nvictims' counsel, to provide the prosecuting attorney the ability to \ndisagree with a commander's decision, which I will talk about more, and \nto have a review of that decision by the civilian head of each force.\n  Then we eliminate things such as the good soldier defense. Then those \nwho feel like they have been discharged from the military or how their \ndischarge has been described will now get an opportunity to have their \ncase reviewed. So we are not only looking forward, but we are going to \nlook backward to make sure that victims of crimes know they will be \ntreated with dignity and respect.\n  I have come to this issue as someone who was a prosecutor. Most of \nthe cases I prosecuted were murder cases, but I also had the chance to \nserve as attorney general of our State, where I worked with not only \nmurder victims but also victims of sexual and domestic violence. This \nis a set of crimes that is unacceptable in society, but particularly \nunacceptable in our military, where we expect the very best from our \nmilitary.\n  I looked at this issue very carefully, the issue that has been \ndiscussed so much on the floor today, that is, in handling sexual \nassault cases and other types of cases, should the military justice \nsystem be changed fundamentally to take the commander out of the \ndecision on whether a charge will be brought after an independent \ninvestigation. I came down on the side of we need to hold commanders \nmore accountable, not less accountable, because everything within our \nmilitary, of course, is deployable. We have the finest men and women \nwho serve our country in the world. We have to have a military justice \nsystem structured in a way that it can bring justice in Afghanistan as \neasily as it can bring justice in the United States of America, \nwherever our men and women are situated. If we take commanders out of \nthe\n\n[[Page S8321]]\n\ndecisionmaking process, then fundamentally we are holding them less \naccountable for the results of how these cases are handled. So I would \nlike to talk about the proposal Senators McCaskill, Fischer, and I have \nthat I think will hold commanders much more accountable.\n  Right now, as we look at cases of sexual assault in our military, we \nwant victims to understand they can come forward. When they come \nforward, and we want them to come forward, they will get the support \nthey need and deserve; that their perpetrators will be held accountable \nfor the crimes they have committed.\n  We want commanders to establish a climate within their unit to say no \ntolerance when it comes to sexual assault. If you do not handle a \nsexual assault case properly, you will be relieved of your command. \nThat is what this is about.\n  So in our proposal, rather than remove commanders from the \ndecisionmaking--let me say how this works so people understand. Right \nnow, a victim of a sexual assault or another serious crime comes \nforward. They do not have to come forward through their chain of \ncommand. They can come forward through a health care professional, they \ncan come forward through a 911 call, they can come forward through \ntheir pastor to report a sexual assault. Then it is independently \ninvestigated.\n  From there, that investigation is presented to a JAG lawyer in the \nchain of command who then makes a recommendation to the commander of \nwhether a charge should be brought and whether they should be going to \na military trial at that point. So to take out of that the decision of \nthe commander is now to leave the victim in a situation where--let's \nput this victim in Afghanistan. They are in a situation where the case \nhas been investigated. It comes back. The commander now does not take \nresponsibility for whether a charge is brought. The commander is now \nput in a situation where: I am sorry, that decision is being made by \nanother set of JAG lawyers who are outside of the chain of command, so \ngo talk to the lawyers over here, not me. It puts the commander in a \nbystander responsibility rather than taking responsibility for these \ndecisions.\n  So what we have done is made commanders more accountable. When the \nJAG lawyer comes to the commander for a recommendation, saying this \ncase should be brought on a sexual assault case, if the commander says: \nNo, it should not, that will go all the way up to the civilian \nsecretary of whatever force is involved, whether it is the Secretary of \nthe Army, the Secretary of the Air Force, each branch, and will be \nreviewed separately. That will hold commanders more accountable than \nturfing it over to a lawyer over here where the victim has to hear \nthat: I am sorry, I cannot tell you what the decision is on your case \nbecause there is a lawyer over here making this decision.\n  Even in a case where the commander and the JAG lawyer both agree that \na charge should not be brought, under our proposal there will be \nanother review of those cases up the chain of command to say someone \nelse should look at it. There should be accountability. There should be \naccountability at every level of our military to ensure that victims of \nsexual assault will be supported and that these cases will be handled \nand the perpetrators will be brought to justice.\n  There has been a lot of discussion on the floor today. All of us want \nmore victims to come forward and feel that they can report their case, \nbecause not enough of them have come forward.\n  Yet the evidence shows that if we take commanders out of it, we are \nnot necessarily going to get any more reporting. In fact, we have cases \nthat may not be brought to justice. The evidence shows that commanders \nare being more aggressive than the actual JAG lawyers in terms of cases \nthat are being brought. If we look over the last 2 years, there are 26 \nArmy victims where the JAG lawyer said: Don't bring the case.\n  The commander overruled the JAG, went to trial, and the perpetrator \nwas convicted. There was justice for this victim.\n  Under this proposal those cases would not have gone forward because \nthe JAG lawyer said: No, don't bring it. There were 16 cases in our \nMarine Corps over the last 2 years where that would have happened as \nwell, where 16 victims wouldn't have received justice.\n  There was one Navy victim, and nine Air Force victims would not have \nseen a conviction for their perpetrators--the rapists, who deserve to \ngo to trial, to be convicted, and to be judged. Those cases would not \nhave gone forward.\n  When I hear Senator Gillibrand's proposal--and I respect her so much, \nand there is so much we agree on, and I respect the work that she has \ndone and the work that we have done together on many of the provisions \nthat I have talked about--the discussion that taking it out of the \nchain of command will cause more reports to come forward, then if less \ncases will go to conviction, if I am the victim, how does that make me \nfeel more as if I want to come forward and report my case? Maybe my \ncase won't be brought or there is a set of cases that would not ever be \nbrought if a commander--who has responsibility within his or her unit \nfor this--hadn't recommended this case go forward.\n  The other argument we have heard a lot about is many of our allies \nhave taken it out of the chain of command, including Canada, Great \nBritain, Israel, Germany, and Australia. There has been a \nmisunderstanding, because as we researched this issue as to why our \nallies took it out of the chain of command, we discovered the truth is \nthey took the decision out--of whether a commander would make the \ndecision to go to a trial on a sexual assault case or other serious \nfelony--to protect defendants, not victims.\n  I can assure people--with all due respect to defendants, and I have \ndefended cases as well because they certainly have rights under our \nlaws and I respect that--this is about protecting victims. Our allies \nchanged their system to protect defendants. What we are trying to do is \nto have a victim-friendly environment where people will come forward \nand where perpetrators will be held accountable.\n  If we look at those countries such as Canada, Great Britain, Israel, \nand Australia, that have changed their system, they have not seen any \ngreater reporting. In other words, it is one thing if we looked at it \nand said when they changed their systems the victims came forward. That \nis not the case. That is not what the evidence shows. Facts are \nstubborn things.\n  As a former prosecutor, I want to make decisions on how to address \nthis very real and important problem based on facts. The facts are that \nthere are cases that wouldn't have been prosecuted if we took it out of \nthe chain of command--perpetrators that should have been held \naccountable. Our allies did it, but they haven't seen any greater \nreporting, and they did it to protect defendants.\n  What do we want to do? Let's hold our commanders more accountable. \nThis is what some former peers of our military have said, such as COL \nLisa Schenck, U.S. Army retired former Judge Advocate General, who \nspent 25 years in the military. We asked her about these two proposals. \nShe said: If you take out the convening authority--meaning the \ndecisionmaking process from the commander--you are essentially gutting \nthe military justice process. If you take the court-martial process \naway from the convening authorities for sexual assaults or for major \noffenses, that allows them to say: Hey, the JAGs are dealing with it. \nThey need to be held accountable, and they need to be part of a \nprocess.\n  We don't want to create a situation where we say: I have turfed it to \nmy lawyer over here, and the lawyers over here are going to make the \ndecision.\n  Commanders should be held accountable for those decisions.\n  In fact, we had a woman who is currently in the Marine Corps come to \nthe Republican Conference, a woman commander. She is very impressive to \nhave reached the level she has in the Marine Corps. She works training \nour marines. I was very impressed with her experience. She has \ncommanded at every level. She said: If you want to get this done for \nvictims, don't make the commanders bystanders.\n  This is what makes me very worried. If I thought that taking the \ncommanders out of the decisionmaking process would help victims \nfurther, I would do it. As she describes: If you make a commander a \nbystander--which is what the proposal on the table of Senator \nGillibrand is, who I very\n\n[[Page S8322]]\n\nmuch respect, and I know her passion is very real for this and I share \nit. I don't want commanders to be bystanders. If they are bystanders, \nthen how do we relieve them from command when they don't do their job \non this because we have taken the decisionmaker standard from it.\n  This is another issue that concerns me. We have spent a great deal of \ntime, rightly so, trying to address the issue of sexual assault in the \nmilitary. The Gillibrand amendment that is on the floor doesn't only \ntake sexual assault out of the chain of command, it takes out murder, \nmanslaughter, death or injury of an unborn child, stalking, rape--we \ntalked about rape--larceny and wrongful appropriation, robbery, \nforgery; making, drawing, or uttering a check, draft or order without \nsufficient funds; maiming, arson, extortion, assault, burglary, \nhousebreaking, perjury, and frauds against the United States.\n  We need to understand that the reason we have the military justice \nsystem structured this way is because we deploy to places such as \nAfghanistan. Not only in sexual assault cases will the decision of the \ncommander--whether or not to refer the charge for a trial--be changed \nunder the Gillibrand proposal, but in all of these crimes in which we \nhave not received any testimony about. We have not received evidence \nthat the commanders are mishandling murder cases, manslaughter cases, \narson cases, extortion, assault, burglaries, fraud.\n  This is very much a fundamental change, not only in an area we all \ncare passionately about getting right, to make sure that victims of \nsexual assault are supported, but all of these crimes will now be \nremoved from the chain of command.\n\n  How will that work in Afghanistan and Iraq? I am trying to figure \nthis out. There have been over 900 cases in Iraq and Afghanistan, as I \nunderstand it, where some type of trial has had to be held because of \noffenses that were committed in Afghanistan, all different types. I am \nnot only talking about sexual assault, I am talking about all different \ntypes of crime.\n  How is that going to work? Are we going to say we will wait to see \nwhether we should bring this to trial? The lawyers are located \nsomewhere else. We don't know where; it could be in the Pentagon. So we \nwill wait for the lawyers from the Pentagon, or wherever this separate \nset of lawyers are located, until we have justice in places such as \nAfghanistan.\n  This is for all of these cases on all of these crimes about which we \nhaven't even had any testimony before the Armed Services Committee to \naddress an issue that we all care very much about.\n  There were 900 cases from Iraq and Afghanistan. As we know, Iraq \ncould have been as much of an issue in terms of having a deployable, \nmilitary justice system to ensure that victims of all types of violent \ncrimes, no matter where they are, will get justice and that \nperpetrators, no matter where they are, will be held accountable for \ntheir actions. This is what this is about.\n  I thank the Chamber for all of the work that is being done, for all \nof this work done on this important issue. I know that after we vote on \nall of these proposals--Senator Gillibrand's proposal, as well as the \nproposal that Senator McCaskill, Senator Fischer and I have--that we \nwill be working together to make sure that there is accountability on \nthis issue. Reforms have already been passed that are in the Defense \nauthorization. They are very important items such as the special \nvictims' counsel that I mentioned earlier.\n  I see Senator McCaskill, and I know that she and I, as members of the \nArmed Services Committee, are not going to let this issue go. There \nwill be follow-up to make sure that the military is held accountable. \nWe have the best military in the world.\n  This does go to the core of our readiness of good order and \ndiscipline. We can't have good order and discipline if we put \ncommanders on the sidelines. We will hold them more accountable under \nour amendment, amendment No. 2170.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak on this important \nissue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I understand Senator Lee is on his way to the floor. I \nwill yield to him when he arrives.\n  I came to the floor today to say what a good debate we are having. \nLet us be clear, there is only one amendment that puts in place a \nfundamental change; that is the Gillibrand amendment.\n  We have had 20 years of promises that this problem would be fixed. I \nhave a chart I will bring out later to show that every Secretary of \nDefense for 20 years, Republican and Democratic, has said exactly what \nSenator Ayotte has said: Oh, we are going to fix this, and it is going \nto be fine.\n  We are picking up steam in our support. I wish to state the reason we \nare picking up steam. It is because, with all due respect, every single \nvictims' organization that I know of supports the Gillibrand amendment. \nWhen victims say to me the reason I don't report is because I don't \nwant to take it to my commander, I think we ought to listen.\n  With all due respect, I love the Senators on the other side and I \nhave great respect for the people in the military, but they are not the \nvictims. The victims are standing behind the Gillibrand amendment.\n  The committee that advises the Pentagon on the treatment of women in \nthe military is called DACOWITS. This committee came out overwhelmingly \nin favor of the Gillibrand amendment.\n  My colleagues are saying don't make this fundamental change. But the \none committee that advises the military--made up of retired military \nmembers and civilians--had a chance to say go with the status quo or go \nwith the Gillibrand amendment. They voted without a single dissent in \nfavor of the Gillibrand amendment.\n  When one stands here and defends the status quo in terms of the way \nthis is decided, we have to understand they are in essence saying a 10-\npercent reporting of these incidents is OK with them. Otherwise they \nwould vote to change it.\n  They can think they know why more people aren't reporting and fix it \naround the edges. I am so pleased we have some reforms in the bill. But \nthe main, major reform and the reason the victims' rights groups are so \nbehind the Gillibrand amendment is because it is the only fundamental \nchange that is in the bill.\n  I compliment my colleagues for what they have done. It is wonderful, \nbut they don't get to the heart of it, which is why we have a 90-\npercent problem. Of 26,000 cases, only 10 percent are reported. I \nthought it was bad in the civilian world where 50 percent are reported.\n  I say to my colleagues, we all have staffs and we run a workplace. I \ndon't know how many people each of us has in their offices. I say to my \ncolleagues, suppose there was a horrible sexual assault that took place \nin our workplace. We knew the alleged perpetrator, and we knew the \nalleged victim. We would call the police. We wouldn't become the \ndecider. We wouldn't become the jury, the judge, as these commanders \ndo.\n\n  What is really interesting is Senator Gillibrand called a press \nconference, and we had a commander who commanded troops in Iraq, and he \nsaid: Honestly, the last thing I wanted as I was getting my troops \nready to fight and win battles was to deal with some horrible incident \nthat occurred among those I was commanding. I wanted to get a \nprofessional in there.\n  The Gillibrand amendment is important not only for the victims but, \nyes, for good order and discipline. How can people stand here and say \nthere is good order and discipline when there are 26,000 incidents of \nsexual assault and only 10 percent are reported? There are thousands of \npeople walking around the military not being charged, and sometimes the \ndeal they get is to get kicked out.\n  I will tell a story of one of my constituents because I think it is \ninstructive. She joined the Marines. She was out with friends, and she \nwas drugged. She was brutally raped. She was tossed on the street in \nthe early morning hours. She woke up dazed. She reported it to her \ncommander. Let me tell you what happened. The perpetrator got\n\n[[Page S8323]]\n\nout of the military--probably to continue his rampage on the streets of \nsome city we represent--and my constituent was investigated by the \nmilitary for drug use because she was drugged that night and abandoned \non the street.\n  So I hope the people who support the status quo will hear that story \nand hear the other stories. We have a 90-percent problem; 90 percent do \nnot report. We have DACOWITS advising the military it is made up of \nformer military members and civilians saying support Gillibrand. We \nhave every victims' rights group I know supporting Gillibrand. I will \njust say that if a minority of this Senate stops us today, we are going \nnowhere. We had a press conference yesterday where we revealed the new \nRepublican on our team; today, a new Democrat. We want to have the best \nservicemembers in the world. We want our commanders concentrating on \nwhat they have to concentrate on. We have men and women being \nassaulted, and we have a plan in front of the Senate, and that plan is \nthe Gillibrand amendment. It is smart, and it has strong bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Believe me, I was at a press conference with Senator Grassley, \nSenator Cruz, Senator Paul, Senator Shaheen, of course, Senator \nGillibrand, Senator Hirono, and our group is growing. So if a minority \nof the Senate stops this, I will hearken back to the many reforms that \nhave been made--whether it is don't ask, don't tell, gays in the \nmilitary--you can just name them. Yes, it may take us a time or two. I \nremember having an amendment that lost that said you can't take \nconvicted felons into the military if they have been convicted of a sex \ncrime. I lost. I lost. But years later I won, and now you cannot take \nthese felons into the military. So these reforms are hard. This one is \n20 years in the making. History will record who stood on the side of \npositive change, who stood with the victims, and who obstructed.\n  I know everybody is doing it for reasons, and I respect that, OK. \nLet's be clear. But I am passionate about this because I have been here \nbefore. I was in the Congress during the Tailhook scandal, and I said \nto myself after that was publicized: This will never happen again. We \nwon't see harassment. We will see a reduction in rapes.\n  Remember, half of the victims are men. This is a crime of violence. \nThis is a crime of terror. We have to make sure there is justice, and \nthat means trained people making the decision of whether to go forward, \ntrained people running the trial and not putting this on the \ncommanders. At the end of the day, when you talk to them--and I haven't \ntalked to all of them, but I have talked to many of them--they say the \nlast thing they want is this power.\n  No one can tell me there is good discipline when we have a 10-percent \nreporting record here--10 percent of the crimes are reported. It just \ncan't be. That isn't good discipline. That isn't good order when you \nhave rapists walking around because people are too scared to go to \ntheir commander.\n  I know my colleagues are trying to do the best for this country, but \nlisten to the victims. We don't know better than the victims. We don't \nknow better. We should be humble. We should listen to the victims.\n  Our allies have gone this way, and they have been pummeled here \ntoday, saying they have bad records and the rest of it. I think the \nreputation of the Israeli military is second to none. They have taken \nthis outside the chain of command. Many of our other allies and \nfriends--Australia. I visited there and talked about this. Frankly, \nthis is the way to go.\n  Sixty percent of the American people support the Gillibrand \namendment--60 percent in a poll that just came out. So the people are \nfor the Gillibrand amendment, the victims are for the Gillibrand \namendment, and the one committee that advises the Pentagon on women's \nrights in the military is for the Gillibrand amendment.\n  I praise everyone who has worked on so many other reforms in this \nbill. I am so proud. This is a reform bill. But I beg my colleagues to \nmake that fundamental change we need to make and have the professionals \ndecide whether there is a case from beginning to end. That is what \njustice really is.\n  I will close with this. There is a woman who has been put up for \nUnder Secretary of the Navy. I have a hold on her nomination. I don't \nbelieve in secret holds. This is from the Obama administration. She was \nasked about the Gillibrand proposal, and do you know what she said, Mr. \nPresident? Here is what she said: If you take this outside the chain of \ncommand, decisions on this crime will be made based on the evidence, \nnot on good order and discipline.\n  Can you believe that? This is the truth. We don't have decisions \nbeing made based on the evidence. This woman was honest, I give her \nthat. She said that if we took this outside the chain of command, \ndecisions on these crimes would be made based on the evidence. Well, \nshe made our case, and I am proud to stand with a very strong \nbipartisan coalition in favor of the Gillibrand amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with my colleagues for 30 minutes and that those 30 minutes \nnot count against the current 6-hour commitment to debate the \namendments on military sexual assault.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have been a member of this Chamber for a \nwhile now, and during my time here few of our colleagues have done more \nto expose waste and duplication and overspending than our colleague \nfrom Oklahoma Senator Coburn. I am, of course, cognizant of the fact \nthat Senator McCain, the senior Senator from Arizona, has quite a \nreputation himself in this area. I am pleased to join both of my \ncolleagues, along with, I anticipate, the junior Senator from Arizona, \nto talk about some very important work Senator Coburn and his staff \nhave done to help highlight the savings we can find within the Defense \nDepartment budget due to duplication and waste and failure to exercise \nreasonable management practices, such as audits. We can save money and \nreallocate that money to help our fighting men and women in uniform, \nhelp keep them safe and help maintain America's role as a preeminent \nmilitary leader in the world.\n  Senator Coburn has pointed out in a new report I am sure he will talk \nabout that we can save more than $60 billion by consolidating half the \nFederal Government's duplicative programs. Each of these programs has \nits own overhead, and through consolidation we can eliminate that \noverhead and still make sure the same amount of money is used to \ndeliver the particular service. For that matter, if we were to \nconsolidate just a third of the renewable energy programs, we could \nsave $5 billion alone. If we stop sending unemployment checks to \nmillionaires, we could save another $30 billion.\n  I am a proud defense hawk. We call it the Yellow Pages test in Texas. \nIf you can look in the yellow pages and see a service being provided by \nthe private sector, you have to ask, why is the government providing \nthat service? But there is no ability of anyone to provide national \nsecurity except for the Federal Government. It is the No. 1 reason for \nthe Federal Government's existence, and it is a tragedy to see so much \nmoney wasted when it is needed so desperately by our military during \nthese very dangerous times. It is, indeed, embarrassing that the \nPentagon cannot even conduct an audit. They do not know where the money \nis. They do not know how it is being spent, how it is being misspent. \nSo I am a proud cosponsor of my colleague's Audit the Pentagon Act. The \nPentagon isn't scheduled to actually perform an audit until 2017, and I \ndoubt they will be able to meet that deadline. I am sure we will hear \nmore about that from the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  There is no good reason why the Pentagon shouldn't be able to tell \nthe American people exactly how it is spending hundreds of billions of \ndollars in taxpayer money. Don't get me wrong. If our military needed \nthe money in order to protect the American people and to keep us safe, \nI would vote for that expenditure 10 times out of 10. But when I am \ntold there is money that should be spent helping keep us safe and \nprotecting our national security that is wasted through duplicative \nprograms, through inefficiencies, through the inability to simply \nmanage the hundreds of billions of\n\n[[Page S8324]]\n\ndollars the Pentagon manages, it makes me livid, as I think it should \nall of the American people.\n  We know DOD continues to experience serious cost overruns with major \nacquisition programs. I know Senator McCain, in his capacity on the \nArmed Services Committee, has been an eloquent critic of these cost \noverruns of various acquisition systems. A 10-percent reduction in DOD \nwaste could yield an annual savings of $60 billion--$60 billion. That \nis real money, and that is money that could either be reallocated to \npay down the debt or could be reallocated to help fund very important \noverseas operations by our military in dangerous parts of the world or \nhere at home.\n  The bottom line is that even those of us who are proud national \nsecurity hawks should be pushing first and foremost to eliminate \nwasteful defense spending and to audit the Pentagon. In my view, those \nare no-brainers. We should not continue down the path of wasteful \nWashington spending and say: Well, we don't have enough money, so we \nare just going to bust the budget caps in the Budget Control Act. We \nshouldn't say: Well, we are not going to address the hard issues of \nwasteful spending at the Pentagon; we are just going to raise taxes. \nThose are cop-outs, and we shouldn't go there.\n  With that, I yield the floor for my good friend from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Senator from Texas. I have worked on these \nareas for a long time. I too am a defense hawk. I am not often accused \nof that because I am critical of wasteful spending in the Pentagon.\n  Let me outline for my colleagues that the Pentagon's budget is near \n$600 billion, counting the extra money for overseas efforts today. Just \nby auditing the Pentagon, the GAO estimates the Pentagon itself would \nsave $25 billion. The only branch of the Pentagon that has come close \nto an audit so far is the Marine Corps. For every dollar they are \nspending now on managing, they are saving $3 in the Marine Corps.\n  So we have repeated attempts through the year to address the symptoms \nof the problems rather than the real problem. Let me outline that.\n  The Pentagon has a broken procurement system. If we think about the \nprograms which have been canceled and the penalties paid because of the \nprograms which have been canceled--and Senator McCain can talk about \nthose better than I ever could--we have never fixed the real problem, \nand the real problem is what Eisenhower warned against. It is the \ndefense industrial complex. The only way we will ever solve the \nprocurement problem of major weapons systems is to force the defense \nindustry to have capital at risk on new weapons systems. In other \nwords, they have to have money in the game.\n  What routinely happens are two things: One is they don't have money \nin the game and we start out at cost-plus programming. Then the second \nproblem--which Senator McCain identified with me today and I have long \nknown--is there is never a grownup in the room when it comes to adding \non the bells and whistles in terms of the costs. As a matter of fact, \nhalf of the major weapons systems the Pentagon is buying today are on \nthe high-risk list by GAO. So what we have to do is fix the real \nproblems, not continue to treat the symptoms.\n  Let me run through a list in terms of savings in the Pentagon. These \nare not 1-year but 10-year numbers. So if we instituted this, we would \nsave one-tenth of what I mention.\n  Just consolidation of the defense IT structure could save $160 \nbillion over the next 10 years. There are 80,000 employees working in \nIT for the Pentagon. That is twice the population of my hometown. They \nhave more data centers in the Pentagon than we have in all the rest of \nthe government combined. As a matter of fact, Senator Bennet and I have \ncoauthored a bill to reduce those data centers. They are not highly \nutilized. They are very expensive to run. They also put us at risk for \ncyber security.\n  The other thing not mentioned about IT is in weapons system \nprocurement we have other ITs that aren't even counted in this, \nmanaging those procurement programs.\n  If we took the V-22 Osprey we have on order and replaced it with MH-\n60 helicopters--which can accomplish almost exactly the same thing--we \ncan save $600 million a year, every year, over the next 10 years. \nBoeing doesn't like that--Boeing and their partner in contracting don't \nlike that. But there hasn't been a weapons systems we have deployed \nthat has had as many problems as the V-22 Osprey. Yet we are going to \nbuy more, rather than a proven vehicle transport system which can \naccomplish almost everything the Osprey can. It is not the latest, it \nis not the newest, but it actually accomplishes the goal.\n  If we reduce the spending for other procurement programs--and let me \nsay why this is important. The Defense Logistics Agency has no idea \nwhat they have in inventory. There is a public law which says they will \nhave an inventory. They have ignored it for years. So they have never \ntaken an inventory. It is ``too big'' to take an inventory. There are \nhundreds of billions of dollars of equipment and parts and supplies at \nthe DLAs, at the depots around the country, that are in excess and we \ncontinue to buy new parts for because we don't know we have them. Fix \nthe real problem. That is $52 billion over the next 10 years.\n  If, in fact, we took nonmilitary jobs at the Pentagon being filled by \nuniformed personnel today and replace them with civilian Federal \nemployees, we would save $53 billion over the next 10 years. These do \nnot require a trained soldier to do these jobs. That is $5 billion a \nyear. That is 10 percent of the sequester on the Pentagon. All we have \nto do is to decide to do it. Do it. But we will not do it.\n  If we reduced contractor support and did more stuff internally by the \nmilitary--and I will give a great story. Offutt Air Force Base in \nsouthwest Oklahoma, C-17 training. The most recent commander down there \nsaved $136 million the first year he tried in running that base. He got \nthe heck kicked out of him for doing it by the higher-ups because they \nwanted him spending all the money. But what he did is demonstrate there \nwas $136 million we could save on that one base. The question is, Where \nis the leadership to do that? So we could save that $53 billion--$37 \nbillion in terms of decreasing contract support.\n  If we just consolidated the three military health care services, we \nwould save $380 million a year. At the same facilities, at the same \nlocations we have duplicative military health care services. So we can \nconsolidate that, give more consistent care, give better care, and yet \nsave a significant amount of money.\n  The Department of Defense has over 104 science, technology, \nengineering, and math programs. Governmentwide we have 207. Over half \nof them are at the Department of Defense. Why 104 from the Department \nof Defense? Why not one that incentivizes science, technology, \nengineering, and math? If we consolidated them, we could save $1.7 \nbillion over the next 10 years. That is $170 million a year.\n  What will that do for the operations and maintenance budget? What \nwill that do for flying time for our pilots? What will it do for \ntraining that is not happening now for people deploying to Afghanistan? \nThose should all happen.\n  Domestic schools. We have 16 bases that still have domestic schools \non them, where we run schools by the Pentagon. The cost per student in \nthe United States is $50,000 per student, five times what we spend \neverywhere else in this country on elementary and high school \neducation. If we just ran those in the local school district and paid \nthem $1,000 or $2,000 more than their average cost, we would save over \nthe next 10 years $9.8 billion. We would save $1 billion a year.\n  If we consolidated the DOD-administered grocery and retail stores--\nand, by the way, Walmart has offered to do that, to offer the same \nprices--we lose money every year on those, and that doesn't include the \ncost of running them. When we have gone out to price things against the \ngrocery store or Costco or Walmart or everywhere else, we can actually \nbuy it as cheaply in the private sector as we can at a base PX. The \npoint is here is a perceived benefit which is costing us a lot of money \nbut isn't truly there.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. As my friend from Oklahoma knows well--and, by the\n\n[[Page S8325]]\n\nway, I wish every American could have a chance to read this list of \nwaste, fraud, and incredible misuse of Americans' tax dollars. But one \nof the areas not in this document that the Senator from Oklahoma and I \nhave talked about is the issue of cost overruns in our weapons systems.\n  For example, the latest aircraft carrier which was just christened \nwith great fanfare, the Gerald R. Ford, is now at a $2 billion cost \noverrun of what the original cost estimate was. That is for one ship. \nWhen I think about what the $2 billion cost overrun could do in my home \nState of Arizona, it is even more staggering. Yet somehow we let this \ncost overrun accumulate over a long period of time, and the ship still, \nby the way, was recently christened, which does not mean finished, \ncommissioned.\n  At a hearing we had in the Armed Services Committee the other day \nwhere the effects of sequestration--which I think are devastating--were \ndescribed by each of the service chiefs, the Chief of Naval Operations, \nmy old service, said: We need $500 million more for the Gerald R. Ford. \nI was stunned. I said to him: Admiral, there is a $2 billion cost \noverrun on that ship. I asked him if anyone had been fired. His answer, \nI tell my friend from Oklahoma, was he didn't know if anyone had been \nfired over the cost overrun of over $2 billion, with a request for $500 \nmillion more.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma mentioned the military industrial complex \nthat President Eisenhower so wisely spoke about. I would disagree. I \nthink it is a military industrial congressional complex because never \nhas Congress canceled a program once it has been in full production.\n  I ask my friend from Oklahoma, what do we do about what I think is \nthe No. 1 cost right now in the Pentagon; that is, cost overruns. I \ncould mention the $1 trillion F-35 and many other programs. What is to \nbe done about that?\n  Mr. COBURN. There are a lot of ideas. No. 1, our biggest problem is \nwhen we buy, we don't know what we want. So don't even start a proposal \nuntil we truly know what we want. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2 is there has to be capital at risk by the person building the \nship or building the airplane. The only way to incentivize the private \nindustry to control cost is to make sure half the cost is coming out of \ntheir hide. If we do that, what will happen is we will see real cost \ncontrol because they don't do it on the commercial side. They only do \nit on the military side.\n  The third thing is having a grownup in the room when we decide to \nmake modifications. The fact is, when we think we have an unlimited \nbudget, nobody is there to say: You don't have an unlimited budget. You \ncan't add this. It may be nice.\n  There is a great story on that. It was an Army backpack helicopter \ndeveloped by Honeywell--on time, on price. Here is Honeywell delivering \nwhat the Army wanted on time and on price, and the military buyers \nadded bells and whistles. It ended up weighing 12 pounds more, tripling \nthe cost, and delaying the onset, to where they finally cancelled it--\nnot because the supplier didn't supply it on time and on price, but the \nmilitary was out of control in terms of what they were asking for. So \nthey didn't get it. So we didn't have the availability to our troops in \nIraq and Afghanistan to look behind walls, which was available and on \ntime. But it was our purchasing system.\n  So we can't worry about the symptoms. We have to change the \nstructure. We have to change the leadership.\n  I will make one final point. Right now we have more admirals than we \nhave ships. At the end of World War II, we had 10,500,000 people under \narms, we had over 2,200 general staff officers. Today, we have half \nthat many and 1,500,000 in arms. There is one of the big problems. One \nof the biggest problems is that we have way too many staff officers--\ngeneral staff officers who each have a cadre of people and then protect \ntheir turf. They don't protect the country, they protect their turf, \nand that is not to take anything away from their service. It is human \nnature. What we need is a marked reduction in general officers.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. FLAKE. The Senator mentioned the problem we have of the Defense \nDepartment running schools which ought to be run by local school \ndistricts. It goes even beyond that.\n  Just in the past couple of years we have absorbed into the defense \nbudget a capital maintenance--new capital building and replacement of \nschools that are managed by the local district. Several hundred million \ndollars just in the past couple of years, and obligated for the next \nseveral years, will be used to rebuild or refurbish or to maintain \nschools which are the responsibility of local districts.\n  What has happened is people say the local districts may not be able \nto afford it or the Department of Education doesn't have jurisdiction. \nThere is a defense budget we can put it in. We have seen that in other \nareas as well. So the Department of Defense is assuming \nresponsibilities it just shouldn't have. When it does, typically the \ncosts are much greater as well.\n  So I take the Senator's point and just say it is worse than we know \nbecause we have added new responsibilities and new budget items just in \nthe past couple of years.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would add one thing and then yield back to my \ncolleagues.\n  Inside the Defense Department, over the next 10 years, we are going \nto spend approximately $60 billion on things that have nothing to do \nwith defense. Ten percent of that is health care research conducted by \nthe military which doesn't have anything to do with the military. We \nhave the NIH, the world's premier leading research organization, and we \nought to transfer that out of the military.\n  As a matter of fact, the guy who started that was a friend of mine, \nTed Stevens. One of the last things he told me is one of the biggest \nmistakes he ever made is putting medical research into the Pentagon, \nbecause now it gets funded, and we are duplicating things at the \nPentagon which we are doing at NIH on diseases such as breast cancer, \nprostate cancer. I happen to have a little experience with that one. \nThe fact is we are not spending the money wisely. We are spending money \nwe do not have duplicating what we are already spending money on.\n\n  I yield to my senior colleague.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask the Senator from Oklahoma, isn't it true he has the \nmaterials Senator McCain referred to posted on his Web site?\n  Mr. COBURN. If people are interested, coburn.senate.gov, and they can \nget that information. Everything we have, every study we have \npublished, all the waste, all the duplication.\n  I have one other item.\n  There is at least $200 billion a year that the GAO--not Tom Coburn--\nhas identified in waste and duplication in the Federal Government. We \nhave not acted. Only one committee of Congress, Education and The \nWorkforce, in the House, has acted on one of the recommendations as far \nas duplication. So the problem is us.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask the senior Senator from Arizona, as we discussed, \nhe has been a critic and pointed out waste in the procurement process. \nI know the military, in designing state-of-the-art weapons systems, the \nF-35, for example, built in the notion of concurrency, where they are \nactually designing it while they are building it which creates cost \noverrun challenges. But I know the Senator was also instrumental in \nfinally getting the Pentagon to negotiate a fixed-price contract. Could \nthe Senator talk a little bit about some of the challenges?\n  Mr. McCAIN. For years, I say to my colleague from Texas, the cost \noverruns went unchecked. When someone has a roof that leaks and they \nhire someone to fix the roof on a cost-plus contract, I guarantee that \nthe cost to have your roof fixed will probably exceed the initial \nestimate the roof fixer provides you. When we go into cost-plus \ncontracting, which is justified by many of the contractors saying, \nwell, we are not sure what the additional costs will be, they do not \nseem to have difficulty once those contracts are fixed cost.\n  The best example--best or worst example--I can tell my friend from \nTexas is the original effort to replace Marine One, the Presidential \nhelicopter. This helicopter, over a period of a couple of years, went \nfrom requirement to requirement to requirement, to the point where it \nwas even a requirement that\n\n[[Page S8326]]\n\nthe helicopter could withstand a nuclear blast. It ended up, before it \nwas even off the drawing board, at a greater cost than Air Force One. \nAt a greater cost than Air Force One. So finally they had the good \nsense to scrap it and we are still using the old reliable helicopter \nwhich seems to fairly suit the purpose of transporting the President.\n  Another interesting story was the Air Force now believes that one of \ntheir primary acquisitions has to be a long-range bomber. We are \nstarting in this process again. At one point there was a proposal to \nput a kitchenette--I am not making this up--a kitchenette into the \nlong-range advanced Air Force bomber. Finally someone decided maybe \nthat doesn't look too good, to have a kitchenette on this airplane. But \nthat is the case of what happens in the system we have today.\n  God knows the chairman Senator Levin and I and other members of the \nArmed Services Committee have gone time after time to try to bring \nthese costs under control. I guess one of the favorite stories is of \nthe famous Kelly Johnson of ``Skunk Works'' of the old Lockheed team. \nThey went out in the desert of Nevada and came back 7 weeks later with \nthe SR-71. Now it takes literally decades to come forward with a \nweapons system, and never once in recent years that I can recall has \nthere been a weapons system on time and on cost.\n  Then you understand, I say to my friend from Texas, where the defense \nindustry is so important and vital to the economy of his State, as it \nis with mine. The Apache helicopter, which I am very proud of, is built \nout in the east valley of Phoenix, AZ. But the American people then \nbecome cynical about defense spending. That really does erode our \nability to sponsor and support those requirements that are so badly \nneeded.\n  I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for all he has done to continue to \nbring this to the attention of the American people.\n  I want to make one additional comment about this medical research. \nThere is not a person I know in America who does not support medical \nresearch. Particularly cancer is one of the big projects we appropriate \nmoney for. But it is the classic Willie Sutton syndrome. What in the \nworld does the Defense Department have to do with cancer research? It \nis the Willie Sutton syndrome. They asked Willie why he robbed banks \nand he said: That is where the money is. So we are robbing Defense \nappropriations for programs and projects that have nothing to do with \ndefense, but because the money is there we are spending it.\n  Meanwhile, we do not have, particularly as a result of sequestration, \nadequate funding, in my opinion, that will enable us to continue to \ndefend this Nation.\n  All of us are for medical research. I do not know anybody in the \nworld who is not. But for us to take money out of Defense \nappropriations and put it into medical research is something that is \nnot any way justified except for the fact that the money is there.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 40 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I yield the remaining time to the junior Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, it is interesting in terms of the money \nbeing used where it should not be. I gave the example last week, and I \nam coming down every week and speaking at least 5 minutes on waste and \nduplication in government. I talked a couple of weeks ago about the \nDepartment of Agriculture. The Department of Agriculture--this is the \nDepartment of Agriculture, but you would not know it when you look at \nsome of the programs run by the Department of Agriculture. No. 1, they \nhave a Single-Family Housing Direct and Guaranteed Loan Program in the \nDepartment of Agriculture. It provides zero downpayment mortgage loans. \nIt has cost the taxpayer about $10 billion since 2006. That is the \nDepartment of Agriculture, running a housing program.\n  We see this all over government. It is wrong. Eliminating the \nduplication that Senator Coburn, the Senator from Oklahoma, has spoken \nof many times can save our government and the taxpayers billions of \ndollars a year.\n  I appreciate, my colleagues, this colloquy we have had, and I look \nforward to more.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we yield the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I rise to address one of the most difficult \nissues we have faced in this bill, an issue on which the Armed Services \nCommittee spent a great deal of time, in fact more time than on any \nother issue this year. It is the issue of sexual assault in the \nmilitary.\n  At our very first hearing where we were discussing this with a group \nof people, I made the observation that the only sure, long-term way to \nconfront and defeat this tragic problem is through a change in the \nculture. It has to become unacceptable in the culture of our armed \nservices that sexual assault is in any way tolerated or ignored. We \nhave to solve this. It is a problem that has been festering for years. \nI understand the impatience of those who say we have been waiting for \ntoo long, we have to take strong steps. I think it is very important to \nrealize that in the bill that is already before us are strong steps, \nthe most comprehensive package of sexual assault provisions that has \never been in any Defense bill, to my knowledge, in the history of this \ninstitution. It has been taken seriously. It has been dealt with in a \ncomprehensive way, some of the strongest changes ever.\n  I think one of the most important I want to highlight is the \ncriminalization of retaliation. A great deal of the discussion has been \nabout reporting and the reluctance of victims to report, in part \nbecause of retaliation. One of the provisions in this bill is to make \nit a crime to retaliate against a victim for reporting one of these \nhorrendous crimes. The debate today is about one particular provision, \none particular provision dealing with sexual assault that is not in the \nbill, and the question boils down to who makes the decision to refer a \nsexual assault case to prosecution.\n  I have heard the debate. I should have said at the outset, I so \nadmire Senator Gillibrand for her intellect, for her passion, for her \ndedication, for her perseverance on this issue. Everybody involved in \nthis debate has exactly the same goal, which is to get rid of this \nproblem, to diminish it, to reduce it to zero, to not tolerate it. That \nis the goal of everyone involved. The question is whether removing the \ndecision to refer to court-martial from the commander will further that \ngoal or in fact will undermine it.\n  After listening to the arguments, discussing it at length with \nSenator Gillibrand and others, I have concluded that to take this \ndecision out of the chain of command would in fact do harm to the cause \nof victims' rights.\n  The reason is simple. I want the commander to be fully responsible \nfor this problem. I don't want a commander saying: It is not my problem \nanymore; the Congress of the United States has said I don't have to \nworry about this; I will check that box.\n  I believe, going back to my original point, that the way you change \nthe culture is in a multifaceted approach, but certainly one of the \nways you do it is through the decisions that come from the commander. \nThat is what sets the tone in the unit. Leadership always infects an \nentire unit in good or bad ways, and I believe it would be a mistake on \nthe side of the victims if we change the system and allow the \ncommanders to say this is not my problem, this is not my \nresponsibility.\n  As Senator Reed mentioned on the floor earlier today, the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island, one of the most important changes is a change the \nPentagon has itself made which is to hold commanders responsible for \nthe sexual assault record in their unit as part of their evaluation for \npromotion. That is part of the way you change the culture.\n  This is a very difficult decision, but I think it is important to \nrealize that the decision on this amendment is not: Are you in favor of \nvictims' rights or are you in favor of the brass? I reject that \ndichotomy because already within the bill are these very strong \nprovisions which are directed at this serious problem. What we are \ntalking about is a fairly narrow discussion of who makes that decision. \nAs a former practicing attorney who has had experience in criminal \ncases, prosecutors I think may be more conservative and less likely, in \nsome cases, to bring cases to\n\n[[Page S8327]]\n\ntrial than the commanding officer who wants to ensure that justice is \ndone for that victim. What we want is no victims. We want this problem \nto end. We want this era to change because the culture changes within \nthe military, and that which was acceptable at one time is no longer \nacceptable.\n\n  The best example I can cite for that in my life is drunken driving--\nOUI. When I was a young man, there was an epidemic of drunken driving \nin this country, and it was considered as kind of a joke. It was \nconsidered as a sort of a rite of passage. Suddenly, through law \nchanges and societal changes over a generation, it is no longer \nacceptable or funny, and it is no longer tolerated, and as a result we \nhave seen a decline because the culture has changed. That is what has \nto happen in the military, and I think it begins with the commanding \nofficer.\n  In my opinion, to take this responsibility away from the commanding \nofficer is not siding with the brass, it is siding with the victims, \nbecause I want those commanding officers fully engaged in this \ndecision. I want them fully responsible for their decision. I want them \nto be what, in fact, they are, leaders--leaders who can make change, \nand leaders who can make change in this critical area. If it doesn't \nwork, as my father used to say, Congress is always in session. We can \ncome back and correct it.\n  I believe we are at a moment where the military is being given a last \nchance to deal with this within the chain of command. I think we have \ngiven them the tools to do so in this bill, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport Senator McCaskill's amendment and to move forward with this \nbill which we can be very proud of in terms of its recognition of this \nhorrendous issue, but also in terms of the solutions and tools it \nprovides to our military to solve this problem once and for all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from Maine \nfor his very thoughtful statement. After having several conversations \nwith him, I know he did not come to this decision easily, but I \ncertainly think he made a very strong argument for the decision he \narrived at.\n  He and I--and all of us--share a deep and abiding concern about the \nissue that is before the Senate in the form of the amendment to the \nNational Defense Authorization Act that is being debated on the floor. \nThis is a very difficult situation. It is an unacceptable situation \nwhere men and women in the military may be exposed to sexual assault \nbut, more importantly than that, the individuals who are responsible \nfor those assaults need to be held accountable.\n  What we are asking today is: Are we going to hold the people who are \nin charge accountable for bringing offenders to justice or are we going \nto farm that responsibility out to some other entity, individual, or \nsome other part of the bureaucracy? That is the question before us.\n  I trust these commanders. I have known thousands of them. I trust \nthem, and I believe in them. Has there been an insufficient effort \ndevoted to preventing these horrible crimes from taking place? Yes. I \ntrust these commanders--these men and women in command--to take the \nproper action necessary because it is their responsibility.\n  The changes that are in this legislation include removing the ability \nof commanders to overturn jury convictions, require review of decisions \nnot to reverse charges, criminalize retaliation against victims, \nprovide a special victims' counsel to victims of sexual assault, and \nsupport and assist them through all their proceedings. That is why I \nsupported Senator Boxer's amendment which reforms article 32 of the \nUniform Code of Military Justice. Her amendment will help prevent the \nabuse of victims of military sexual assault in a pretrial setting.\n  We are taking action in this legislation. Maybe we can be found \nguilty of not acting soon enough. Basically this deals with a \nfundamental question: Do we not trust the commanders--whose \nresponsibility is the very lives of the men and women under their \ncommand--to do the right thing? That is the difference between the \nGillibrand amendment and what has already been done in this \nlegislation.\n  We have had extensive hearings, debate, and discussions on this piece \nof legislation. The question is: Do we trust the commanders to do the \nright thing within the proper parameters, such as removing the ability \nof commanders to overturn jury convictions, require review of decisions \nnot to prefer charges, and criminalizing retaliation against victims?\n  As far as I can tell, we have taken significant and important steps \nthat will protect our men and women not only from assault but the \nabuses and recriminations that may be visited upon them in cases where \nthey are victims.\n  I am not saying the legislation before us will eliminate sexual \nassault, but I am saying that what we are doing is exactly what we did \nat other times when there were crises in our Armed Forces. I am \nreferring back to the post-Vietnam war era. I was a commanding officer \nin 1975, 1976, and 1977, and we had racial, drug, and discipline \nproblems. We had the post-Vietnam war syndrome where our military was \nin total disarray. We were dealing with drug abuse and racial \ndiscrimination. There were race riots on aircraft carriers.\n  What did we do? We placed the responsibility directly on the \ncommanding officer, and if they didn't take action and failed, they \nwere relieved. That is the way the military should function, and that \nis the way the military has functioned successfully. We had programs, \nadvisers, indoctrination, and punishment--punishment for those who \nrefused to adhere to the standards of conduct we expect every man and \nwoman in the military to adhere to.\n  What does the Gillibrand amendment do? It removes the commander. It \nremoves the person--the man or woman in command--who has the ultimate \nresponsibility, unfortunately, from time to time of taking these young \npeople into battle and risking their very lives. That is what makes \nthem different from any other part of America and any other part of our \nsociety.\n  The Gillibrand amendment says we don't trust these commanders. Well, \nwe trust those commanders with the lives of these young people. We ask \nthem to have the ultimate responsibility, which is that of defending \nthis Nation, but we don't trust them to prosecute and do their job and \ntheir duties? Well, that flies in the face of every encounter I have \never had with the men and women who were in command, and the senior \npetty officers, master chief petty officers, and master sergeants who \nare responsible for the good order and discipline of the men and women \nin our Armed Forces.\n  I won't go into the fact that this Gillibrand amendment includes \nmatters such as burglary, perjury, robbery, and forgery. It has been \nexpanded beyond belief in its areas that have to be referred out of the \nchain of command. I will not even bother with that.\n  I say to my colleagues as passionately as I can that if we do not \ntrust the commanding officers who take our most precious assets--the \nyoung men and women of the military--into battle, then we obviously \nneed to reevaluate our entire structure of the military. But I do trust \nthem. The finest people I have ever known in my life are those who have \nworked their way up to positions of authority in command through a very \nsevere screening process. Have they made mistakes? Can we find an \nexample or a case where the right thing was not done? Of course we can. \nThere is nowhere in our society where we can't find examples of people \nwho have not done the right thing.\n  Today I am embarrassed that it seems naval officers were involved in \nsome kind of bribery scheme about overseas ships. Sometimes we are \nembarrassed by leaders of our military, but they are the exception and \nnot the rule.\n  If the Gillibrand amendment is passed, the message we will send to \nthe men and women in command in the military is that we don't trust you \nand we don't believe in you. That is what this is all about. If we \nfollow through with the 26 changes that have been made in the Defense \nauthorization bill and ensure that if there is a wrong decision made in \nsome cases, that decision will be sent all the way up the chain of \ncommand to the service secretary.\n  This is a terrific and horrific problem in our Armed Forces today. We \nhave\n\n[[Page S8328]]\n\ndone what we believe and what our military and military leaders believe \nis right--leaving the commanding officer in the decisionmaking process \nconcerning the lives and welfare of men and women under their command. \nI hope we will realize that if we pass the Gillibrand amendment, our \nsignal to the men and women in leadership--whether they are our senior \nenlisted personnel or our officers--is we don't have any confidence in \nyou, and we don't trust you. That is the message we will send if we \npass this amendment today.\n  Are they perfect? No. Have they made mistakes? Yes. That is why we \nput provisions in this bill which would circumscribe much of the \ndecisionmaking process but still leaves final decisions in the chain of \ncommand.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Gillibrand amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the series of \nhistoric reforms adopted by the Armed Services Committee to combat \nsexual assault in the military. The women have taken the lead on this \nmatter. Sexual assault is not a gender issue, it is a violence issue.\n  I rise to voice support for a bipartisan amendment that I have \noffered with Senator McCaskill and Senator Ayotte to directly confront \nthis violence, and I urge my colleagues to oppose any radical changes \nthat would undermine justice for the victims and take away \nresponsibility from commanders.\n  I am proud to have supported several measures to strengthen the \nrights of victims, hold perpetrators accountable, and strengthen \noversight of military commanders to ensure that justice is delivered.\n  As a result of a truly bipartisan effort, the committee has put forth \na bill that takes an unprecedented step of providing victims with a \nspecial victims' counsel to make certain they are receiving unbiased, \nindependent legal advice. It strips commanders of the ability to \noverturn jury convictions, makes retaliation against victims a crime, \nrequires dishonorable discharge or dismissal for those convicted of \nsexual assault, and provides critical civilian oversight.\n  Despite achieving these unprecedented reforms in committee, my \ncolleagues and I continue to explore ways to enhance the current bill \nafter the committee's work had concluded.\n  Senators McCaskill, Ayotte, and I introduced an amendment last week \nto expand upon the committee's progress. Our proposal extends current \nprotections to service academies, boosts evaluation standards for \ncommanders, and allows victims increased input. It also eliminates the \ngood soldier defense in most cases.\n  These changes, both in our amendment and in the whole NDAA, are \nsignificant but, importantly, they are also serious and thoughtful. \nThey are based on sound policy, not on political sound bites.\n  Rather than radically remaking the entire military justice system, \nwhich would carry significant risks, our proposals improve and update \nthe current system. To do so, we applied lessons from history.\n  In 2006, Congress hastily changed portions of the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice to address instances of rape. These changes disrupted \nvictims' paths to justice, and Congress was forced to rewrite its own \nchanges a few years later.\n\n  Congress can't afford to get something this important wrong. We \ncannot let our deep desire to solve this problem lead to imprecise \nsolutions because victims suffer when we do. Any changes to the UCMJ \nshould come after a deliberate and transparent process, with feedback \nfrom all sides. The McCaskill-Ayotte-Fischer amendment is the result of \nsuch a process, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  Finally, I urge my colleagues to oppose any amendment that undermines \na commander's responsibility for his or her troops. Senator McCaskill \nput it so well when she spoke on the floor earlier today: The amendment \noffered by my friend and colleague, the junior Senator from New York, \noffers a solution that is ``seductively simple,'' but its simplicity \ncreates a host of complex policy problems.\n  In addition to technical concerns, I do not agree with the underlying \ngoal of removing commanders from the military justice system. As \nSenator McCaskill noted, we know commanders pursue courts-martial when \ntheir legal advisers recommend against doing so. We know, based on the \nexperiences of our allies, that removing commanders from that judicial \nprocess does not achieve the desired results. And we know that \ncommanders have risen to the challenge in the past to confront \ncontentious issues within their units, including integration. These \nfacts lead me to conclude that the changes in this bill, combined with \nthe reforms included within our amendment, will best serve the \ninterests of victims and punish those responsible.\n  I commend the Senator from Missouri for her leadership on this issue, \nand I am grateful for the opportunity to work closely with her, Senator \nAyotte, and many other colleagues to help our men and women in uniform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I agree with the comments of \nthe Senator from Nebraska.\n  I have to say I was a little disturbed because I have heard a couple \nof reports--one was in a news conference on November 6 and one on \nNovember 19--yesterday, I guess--that Senator Gillibrand was saying \nthat I was objecting to her amendment. Yes, I oppose her amendment but \nnot to the extent that I would hold back the bill. My gosh, there is no \none on the floor of this Senate who has been working harder to get this \nbill through--no two people more than the chairman and me. So I want to \nmake sure people understand that.\n  In terms of the alternative, I have been watching it very closely, \nand my strongest possible support is for that amendment, No. 2170, \noffered by Senators Ayotte and McCaskill, which provides additional \nenhancements to the historic enhancements for sexual assault prevention \nand response activities in our military. I commend my two colleagues on \nthe Armed Services Committee for their tireless efforts and their \nleadership, and I urge all Senators to join me in supporting this \namendment.\n  It doesn't mean that if someone is opposed to the Gillibrand \namendment, that someone is not wanting change. Yes, we do. This is \nmajor change.\n  It adds the senior trial counsel to the officers who make \nrecommendations on whether to proceed to trial and, if the convening \nauthority decides not to proceed, results in the case being referred to \nthe service Secretary.\n  It adds duties for the special victims' counsel to inform victims of \noptions for military and civilian prosecution of sexual offenses. It \ngives them a voice. They can express a preference. It requires \ncommanders to give weight to that preference and to notify the victims \nif the civilians decline prosecution.\n  These are changes. These are changes in the current system that are \ncoming with the amendment offered by Senators Ayotte and McCaskill, \namendment No. 2170.\n  It requires including written performance appraisals of every member \nof the Armed Forces--officers and enlisted people--an assessment of \nthat member's support for sexual assault prevention and response \nprograms.\n  It requires every commander to be evaluated in their performance \nappraisals on whether they have or have not established a command \nclimate where allegations of sexual assault are properly managed and \nfairly evaluated and ensures that a victim can report sexual assaults \nwithout fear of retaliation, ostracism, or any kind of group pressure \nfrom members of the command.\n  It also requires command climate assessments to be performed after a \nsexual assault incident, with copies of that assessment to be provided \nto superiors in the chain of command and the military criminal \ninvestigation organization.\n  It creates, finally, a process through the boards for correction of \nmilitary records for confidential review of discharges of individuals \nwho were victims of sexual offenses, to require consideration of \npsychological and physical aspects of the victim's experience that may \nhave had a bearing on the separation.\n\n[[Page S8329]]\n\n  So this is a major change. It is one I strongly support. I give the \nSenator from New York the benefit of the doubt that she did not mean \nwhat some people would interpret it to mean--that I would hold up a \nbill in opposing her amendment. I certainly would not do that. I am for \nreform, and we have an opportunity to do that which is bipartisan and \naccomplishes the very thing we should have accomplished many years ago.\n  I thought there were others waiting here, but let me make one \ncomment. I agree with my colleague, the junior Senator from Oklahoma. I \nknow he has worked tirelessly in trying to do something to stop waste \nin the Pentagon, and, quite frankly, I think there is some there.\n  This chart shows the devastation of sequestration. What it shows is \nthe bottom line--these are deficiencies. This is what he is talking \nabout. I want my colleagues to see this because this goes from fiscal \nyear 2014 all the way to 2023. If we take the sequestration as it is \nright now, without any adjustments--now, Senator Sessions, Senator \nMcCain, and I have tried to make adjustments so that there are greater \ncutbacks here and not so many in the first 2 years.\n  The orange--and that is where almost everything comes out--represents \nreadiness. That is readiness. Readiness is what we need to support our \nfighters in the field to save lives.\n  The green is modernization. That is not affected by these \ninefficiencies we are talking about.\n  The force structure is a major cost item, and it is demonstrated by \nthe yellow on the chart.\n  So what I am saying is I know there is room for improvement, and I \nwant Senator Coburn and others to work on areas within the Pentagon \nwhere money can be saved. But if that happens, it is still going to all \nbe found down here--everything. TRICARE and all of it is down in this \nblue line. So we can see that the devastation that comes from \nsequestration to our military is still going to take place.\n  I think if we look at the level there of the sequestration cuts that \ntake place, it is almost entirely in the readiness. ``Readiness'' is a \nterm we have used for a long time. That is our ability to save lives. \nThat is our ability to train and equip our men and women in harm's way.\n  We have testimony right now that I wish to share with my good friend \nand the Chair, who was there and heard it, from all four services \ntalking about how much more risk is involved if we have to go through \nsequestration. Risk equals lives. I agree with those who want to do all \nthey can through efficiencies. I am for them. I will do all I can to \nhelp them. That doesn't solve the problem. The problem is immediate. It \nis today. I still believe there should be something we can do to stop \ndraconian cuts in our readiness and our force structure accounts that \nwould come with sequestration.\n  It wouldn't do me any good to read all of the quotes we have from \nvarious individuals, but I can assure my colleagues that the Chair and \nanyone who sat through the Armed Services Committee hearings has heard \nall four of the chiefs talk about how devastating this will be if we \nare not able to correct this.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, there is not a single Senator here who \ndoes not acknowledge the seriousness of sexual assault in the military \nand that we must do something to prevent and prosecute these crimes. \nYes, there are differences of opinion as to what we need to do, but \nmake no mistake, we share the common goal of preventing and prosecuting \nthese crimes.\n  I thank two strong women on the Armed Services Committee, Senator \nMcCaskill and Senator Gillibrand, for their leadership in pushing for \nsolutions that will make a difference. I also thank Chairman Levin for \nhis commitment and leadership in bringing forth a bill that includes a \nnumber of important improvements to the current system. We all support \nthese changes. However, I believe there is a fundamental structural \nproblem with how sexual assault cases are prosecuted in the military. \nWe need to make the changes proposed by the Gillibrand amendment.\n  I am a cosponsor of the Gillibrand amendment. I spoke on the floor \nlast week and explained why I think we need to remove disposition \nauthority from the chain of command. I don't want to repeat everything \nI said last week, so let me make a few points.\n  First, for two decades or longer the Department of Defense has had a \nzero tolerance policy for sexual assault and sexual harassment. Yet the \nproblem persists. Servicemembers continue to be assaulted and raped, \nand in too many cases the perpetrators continue to go unpunished. Year \nafter year, Secretary after Secretary and commander after commander has \ntold us about all the efforts to correct this problem, but those \nefforts have not worked. There are probably many reasons why these \nincremental changes have not worked, but every year that these changes \ndo not work, many more of our brave men and women in the military \nendure the trauma of sexual assault. It is time to make a major change \nto the military justice system.\n  Second, too often these attacks are not reported, which allows the \nattacker to prey on more victims. The survivors tell us the biggest \nreason they do not report these crimes is because they do not believe \ntheir chain of command will ensure that justice is done. Even the \nCommandant of the Marine Corps, General Amos, has acknowledged that \nmany victims do not come forward because ``they do not trust the \ncommand.''\n  The concerns of survivors in coming forward makes sense because there \nare inherent biases and conflicts of interest in the chain of command. \nThese concerns are echoed in a letter from GEN Claudia Kennedy that was \nsigned by more than two dozen former officers from all branches of the \nmilitary. The letter states:\n\n       We know that, in too many cases, servicemembers have not \n     reported incidents of sexual assault because they lack \n     confidence in the current system. The inherent conflicts that \n     exist in the military justice system have led servicemembers \n     to believe that their allegations of sexual assault will not \n     receive a fair and impartial hearing and that perpetrators \n     will not be held accountable.\n\n  We should give weight to these concerns and act today to remove the \nchain of command from prosecutorial decisions in sexual assault cases \nand instead put these decisions in the hands of an impartial, \nexperienced military lawyer.\n  Third, removing prosecutorial decisions from the chain of command \nwill not harm good order and discipline. I have heard this concern from \nmany military leaders, as well as from others who oppose this \namendment. They say eliminating a commander's ability to decide whether \na case should go to trial would undermine the commander's ability to \nmaintain good order and discipline within the unit, and yet--and yet--\nwe have heard from many others who have command experience who support \nthe Gillibrand amendment.\n  Good order and discipline should not depend upon a commander's \nability to decide whether to prosecute a sexual crime. A commander's \nauthority and leadership must certainly be based on more than that.\n  Furthermore, the Gillibrand amendment preserves a commander's \ndisposition authority over crimes that are uniquely military--crimes \nsuch as desertion, AWOL, contempt, and noncompliance with procedural \nrules. This ensures that commanders will have the authority they need \nto maintain good order.\n  In closing, it is undeniable that the current system does not work. \nWe know it does not work because, according to the Department of \nDefense, in 2012 there were an estimated 26,000 cases--26,000 cases--of \nunwanted sexual contact.\n  We know that not all survivors report these crimes because, in the \nwords of General Amos, ``They do not trust the command.'' We know we \ncan eliminate bias and conflicts of interest by entrusting \nprosecutorial decisions to\n\n[[Page S8330]]\n\nan impartial, experienced military lawyer. We know that removing \ndisposition authority from the chain of command will not undermine good \norder and discipline.\n  We know what needs to be done. We ought to do it and do it today. We \nowe it to the men and women who serve our country in uniform. We owe it \nto the families and loved ones of those who serve because the trauma of \nsexual assault often extends beyond the trauma experienced by the \nsurvivor. I urge my colleagues to support the Gillibrand amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this year, as many others were, I \nwas shocked when the Department of Defense released a stunning report \nabout the increase in sexual assault among the branches of the Armed \nForces. Sexual assault in the military is neither a new issue, nor an \nuncommon one. It has been a problem for decades. Its occurrence is a \nstain on the honor of our military and Nation that we must all work to \neliminate. Military bases are where our troops are supposed to be safe, \nand to know that they risk being in harm's way not only when deployed \nbut among their fellow servicemembers as well is horrible.\n  I have worked hard to bring greater attention to the ongoing problem \nof sexual violence in our communities and am proud of the significant \nimprovements we made in the recent reauthorization of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act earlier this year. It is time we bring the same level \nof attention to the crisis on our military bases.\n  While this epidemic is not representative of the vast majority of our \nservice men and women, who serve honorably and conduct themselves \ncommensurate with our expectations of those in uniform, it is also not \nisolated to just a handful of bad actors. We can no longer ignore that \nthe time is long overdue for meaningful changes to help end sexual \nassault and harassment in the ranks of our Armed Forces. We must work \ntogether to protect victims and provide appropriate help and support \nand to ensure that those responsible for such crimes are held \naccountable.\n  Just as our civilian justice system is the envy of the world, our \nmilitary justice system must also meet that standard. That is why I am \na cosponsor of Senator Gillibrand's Military Justice Improvement Act, \nand why I support her amendment to the National Defense Authorization \nAct, NDAA.\n  In last year's Defense authorization bill, Congress included \nprovisions meant to address sexual assault in the military. That \nlegislation required the Secretary of Defense to prescribe standards \nfor victim support and mandated an independent review and assessment of \nthe systems used to adjudicate crimes involving sexual assault and \nrelated offenses.\n  When the Department of Defense released its fiscal year 2012 report \non sexual assault in the military earlier this year, its findings were \njarring, and for many myself included they were infuriating. To make \nmatters worse, the problem seems only to be growing.\n  The status quo for how we deal with sexual assault and unwanted \nsexual contact in the military is untenable. If we are serious about \ncuring this problem, we need to get serious about making fundamental \nchanges to how it is addressed. We cannot expect that by doing the same \nthing over and over again we will achieve different results.\n  I supported Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel's proposals this summer \nto limit a commander's authority to overturn major court martial \nverdicts, among other reforms to the system. I am pleased that the \nmembers of the Senate Armed Services Committee included this key \nprovision, as well as other measures to address the so-called ``good \nsoldier'' defense and to require commanders to immediately report \nalleged sexual assaults to the investigative office, in this year's \nDefense authorization bill.\n  Senator Gillibrand's proposal is another move in the right direction, \ntaking these reforms a step further by removing the determination to \nbring sexual assault cases from the chain of command and giving that \ndiscretion to an experienced military prosecutor. This is a commonsense \nsolution, and I commend her for her clear-eyed and energetic leadership \non this issue.\n  Senator McCaskill's proposal also includes strong protections for \nvictims so that the process of getting justice for these crimes does \nnot revictimize those who come forward to report them. I believe \nSenator McCaskill's proposal also is a step in the right direction to \nencourage victims to come forward and report these crimes. Our Nation's \ntroops should not have to fear sexual assault, and if they are victims, \nthey certainly should not fear any stigma after bringing to light \nunwanted sexual contact.\n  Surely we can all agree that we have an obligation to ensure that our \nmen and women in uniform are protected from the threats we can control. \nHolding perpetrators of sexual assault and unwanted sexual contact \naccountable and caring for, supporting, and protecting those victims is \nwithin our control. I hope Senators on both sides of the aisle will \njoin me in supporting reforms that will fundamentally change the way we \napproach this issue in order to achieve better results.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 6 of my 10 minutes.\n  One of the issues we address in this bill is the problem of sexual \nassault in the military. Too many of the men and women who volunteer \nfor our military to serve and protect us are victims of sexual assault \nand other misconduct. That is deeply offensive to our conscience and a \nstain on an honorable institution.\n  The bill that was reported by the committee includes groundbreaking \nnew measures to reduce sexual assault and misconduct. On a bipartisan \nbasis, members debated and approved more than two dozen measures \nrelated to preventing sexual assault and to delivering justice for the \nvictims of these crimes.\n  The bill that we approved, and which is now before us, would provide \nsexual assault victims a counsel, a lawyer, who works not for \ncommanders, prosecutors, defense attorneys or a court but for the \nvictim. It includes strong new protections for victims that are \ndesigned to combat the No. 1 problem we have in preventing assaults and \ndealing with perpetrators: the fact that many assaults remain \nunreported to authorities. Of great importance, the committee-reported \nbill for the first time makes it a crime under the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice to retaliate against a servicemember who reports a \nsexual assault.\n  It also requires that the Department of Defense inspector general \nreview and investigate any allegation of retaliation against those who \nmake communications regarding sexual assault or sexual misconduct.\n  Our bill includes important criminal justice system reforms, \nincluding reforms on how commanders respond to sexual assaults. Our \nbill includes a requirement that commanders who become aware of a \nreported sexual assault immediately forward that information to \ncriminal investigators. It eliminates the consideration of the \naccused's character from the factors a commander should weigh in \ndeciding whether to prosecute a sexual assault allegation. It restricts \nthe authority of commanders under Article 60 of the UCMJ to set aside \ncourt-martial verdicts in cases involving sexual assault and other \ncrimes. It requires that a decision by a commander not to prosecute a \nsexual assault complaint undergoes an automatic review by a higher \ncommand authority, in nearly all cases a general or flag officer. In \nthe case where a commander's decision not to prosecute contradicts the \nrecommendation of his or her legal advisor, that automatic review is \nconducted by the service Secretary. The committee-reported bill also \nmakes clear that we expect and demand that commanders will use their \nauthority to rein in this problem by fostering a climate of zero \ntolerance toward sexual misconduct and one in which servicemembers \nbelieve they can come forward to report cases of sexual assault.\n  These important reforms were the product of the work of almost every \nmember of the Armed Services Committee. The desire to remove this stain \nfrom our military is bipartisan and it is strong.\n  Despite widespread bipartisan agreement on significant reforms, one \nsignificant issue of dispute remains. This is the question of whether \nmilitary commanders should retain their authority to prosecute sexual \nassaults.\n\n[[Page S8331]]\n\nSenator Gillibrand proposed in committee, and proposes again here on \nthe floor, to remove our commanders' authority to prosecute. Along with \na strong majority of the Armed Services Committee, I opposed Senator \nGillibrand's proposal, which was defeated on a bipartisan 17-9 vote. I \noppose it for a simple reason: I do not believe its passage would \nstrengthen efforts to end military sexual assault and other misconduct, \nand in fact I believe it could weaken those efforts.\n  The Gillibrand amendment would uproot major portions of the military \njustice system and require the establishment of a parallel justice \nsystem within the military. Our top military lawyers have told us that \nthe amendment leaves large gaps and unexplained issues that could make \nthe new system unadministrable and bog it down in litigation.\n  Despite those problems, if I believed that the proposed amendment \nwould remove more sexual predators from the ranks and put more of them \nbehind bars, or lead more victims to report sexual assaults, I could \nsupport it. But the evidence we received in our committee shows the \nopposite.\n  First, we learned that military commanders are more likely, not less \nlikely, more likely, to prosecute sexual assaults than military or \ncivilian lawyers. The committee heard from many commanders, at all \nlevels, that they see important value in sending cases to court-martial \neven if a conviction is not a slam-dunk. But we have more than the \nassurances of commanders. We have hard data. Over the last two years, \nin nearly 100 sexual assault cases which civilian prosecutors declined \nto prosecute, military commanders stepped in and took the case to \ncourt. Trials are complete in 63 of those cases, resulting in 52 \nconvictions an 83 percent conviction rate. Those victims would not have \nseen justice if a military commander had not stepped in where \nprofessional prosecutors declined to act. The evidence before us \nindicates that commanders are ready to prosecute these cases, and that \nremoving their judgment and replacing it with career attorneys will \nresult in fewer prosecutions of these cases.\n  The evidence is that when victims do come forward, their reports are \nproperly investigated, and when commanders are presented with the \nfacts, our commanders do their job. They often send cases to trial even \nwhen professional prosecutors hesitate to do so. So why would we want \nto take that authority away?\n  Second, the supporters of this proposal have argued that it will \nincrease victims' willingness to come forward. They do not provide any \ndata to support the assertion that victims will be more willing to come \nforward in a system that is less likely to bring them justice. Why \nwould victims feel more confident in a system that is less likely to \naggressively prosecute these crimes?\n  The Response Systems to Adult Sexual Assault Crimes Panel, which was \nestablished in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2013 and has looked in depth at the experience of our allies on this \nissue, reported last week: ``We have seen no indication that the \nremoval of the commander from the decision making process has resulted \nin an increase in reporting and there is nothing in the experiences of \nour foreign Allies that suggests adopting their systems as a model will \nhave any impact on the reporting of sexual assaults.''\n  I believe the contention that this amendment would increase reporting \nstems in many cases from a fundamental misunderstanding of how sexual \nassaults are reported. One member of the Senate, in announcing his \nsupport for taking away commanders' authority to prosecute, said: ``To \nme, it's as simple as this: Should you have to report to your boss when \nyou've been abused or when you've been a victim of a crime?''\n  Well, of course you shouldn't have to. And in the military, you \ndon't. There are many different avenues by which a member of the \nmilitary may report a sexual assault. Reporting it to your commanding \nofficer is only one. Victims can report an assault to civilian police, \nto military criminal investigators, to a health care professional or to \na sexual assault response coordinator. The Gillibrand amendment does \nnot affect any of those reporting channels. Its only effect is to \nchange what happens once an assault is reported and investigated.\n  Supporters of this proposal have argued that our allies have adopted \nchanges to their military justice systems along the lines they propose, \nand that these changes have better served sexual assault victims. What \nthis argument ignores is the fact that our allies' decisions have not \nbeen aimed at protecting sexual assault victims. In fact, with allies \nsuch as Canada and Great Britain, commanders' authority to prosecute \nwas removed not out of concern for crime victims, but out of concern \nfor the rights of the accused. I have yet to hear anyone argue that the \nproblem with our handling of military sexual assault is that it is too \ntough on perpetrators. Yet that has been why allied militaries removed \nthe decision to prosecute from their commanders.\n  Perhaps the most basic reason to oppose the amendment of the Senator \nfrom New York is that it removes a powerful tool from those who are \nindispensable to turning around the problem we have. Our military \ncommanders are the indispensable tool to turn around this problem. I \nhave met at length with several groups of retired military women.\n  I specifically chose to meet with retired military personnel to \nensure that they would be free to speak their minds. These women--all \nof whom have seen cases of sexual assault and sexual harassment in the \ncourse of their military careers--told me the problem is not \ncommanders. The problem is a military culture, they told us, that \ntolerates excessive drinking and barracks banter that borders on sexual \nharassment or crosses that line. The problem is there is a failure to \nrecognize the existence of servicemembers who appear to be good \nsoldiers but in fact are sexual predators, and a culture that values \nunit cohesion to such an extent that those who report misconduct are \nmore likely to be ostracized than respected. None of these problems are \nunique to the military, but they are exacerbated in the military by the \nfrequent rotation of military assignments, which can make it easier for \npredators to hide.\n  The military has a unique tool for addressing this problem: \ncommanders who can bring about changes in command climate through \nmandatory training and by issuing and enforcing orders that are not \npossible in a civilian environment. That is what they did in addressing \nracial discrimination and in ending don't ask, don't tell. That is what \nthey can and should do here. Weeding out sexual predators and the \nclimate that makes it possible for them to hide is an essential \ningredient in any solution to the sexual assault problem. The military \nwomen whom I met with over the summer told me that our commanders are \nin the best position to make that change.\n  Weakening the authority of commanders will do serious damage to their \nability to accomplish this change. All of us seek the strongest, most \neffective response to the plague of military sexual assault. The \namendment Senator Gillibrand proposes will not strengthen our response. \nThe evidence before us shows it will, in fact, weaken our response by \nremoving the decision from the hands of commanders.\n  We have two dozen historic reforms in our bill, but a number of \nSenators, led by Senators McCaskill and Ayotte and Fischer, have \ncontinued to work on policies to strengthen our response to the \nmilitary assault problem. This has resulted in the amendment they have \nproposed.\n  Their amendment would ensure that the duties of special victims' \ncounsels include advising victims on the advantages and disadvantages \nof prosecuting a case in the civilian or military justice systems, \ngiving victims a greater voice in where a case is heard. It would \nrequire that performance evaluations of commanding officers consider \ntheir success or failure in creating a command climate in which victims \ncan report sexual assaults without fear. It would require command \nclimate assessments of any unit in which a servicemember is the victim \nof a sexual assault or is accused of committing one. It would give the \nvictims of sexual assault who leave the military the ability to \nchallenge the terms or characterization of their separation or \ndischarge. It would prohibit introduction as evidence during judicial \nproceedings a sexual assault defendant's general military character--\nthe so-called\n\n[[Page S8332]]\n\n``good soldier defense.'' In other words, the fact that a defendant \nhappens to be a good troop would no longer be allowed as evidence that \nhe or she did not commit a sexual assault. These reforms are aimed at \nthe problems we do have that is, at rooting out retaliation against \nvictims, and providing victims better support--and not at a problem we \ndon't have--that is, the decisions our commanders make relative to \nprosecution of these crimes.\n  I will conclude by saying that these additional reforms in the \nMcCaskill-Ayotte-Fischer amendment are significant additions to what is \nin the committee bill, and I support them. What I cannot support--and \nwhat I hope the Senate will not support--is legislation that will \nremove from our commanders the authority to combat this problem. The \nreal, strongest tool to combat this problem is the ability to send a \nmatter to a court-martial.\n  We cannot strengthen our efforts to prevent sexual assault by \nreducing the likelihood of prosecutions. We know from history and from \nthe facts that is the result of taking this decision away from the \nhands of the commanders. We know of the 100 cases where other \nauthorities, civilian authorities, have decided not to prosecute but \nwhere the commanders then decided to pursue it anyway. That is just \nwithin the last 2 years, and we do not know of any cases that go in the \nother direction.\n  We cannot strengthen our efforts to prevent sexual assaults by \nreducing the likelihood of prosecutions. We cannot strengthen our \nefforts by weakening the authority of our commanders to act against \nsexual assault. Commanders were tasked, again, with making those \nmonumental changes in military culture, from combating racial \ndiscrimination in the 1950s to ending don't ask, don't tell in 2011. If \nwe are to accomplish the change in military culture that we all agree \nis central to combating sexual misconduct and sexual assault, \ncommanders are essential. We cannot fight sexual predators if we make \nit more difficult to try and convict them. We cannot hold our \ncommanders accountable for accomplishing that needed change in culture \nif we remove their most powerful weapon in the fight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I wish to thank Chairman Levin for \nhis extraordinary leadership on combating sexual assault in the \nmilitary. He has led a process over the last year to ensure that our \nbase bill has a set of historic reforms that make a huge difference in \nhow cases that are actually reported are handled. In fact, the reforms \nthat Chairman Levin has put forward and that our colleagues are \ncontinuing to perfect do make the handling of the cases that are \nreported better.\n  They make sure every victim who reports has a victim's advocate to \nhelp him or her steer through the process. They also make sure that if \nthat victim is so lucky enough to get that conviction, that it cannot \nbe overturned by a commander on a second-level review.\n  They also make sure we have better recordkeeping. They make sure the \nrules of evidence are better. They make sure victims are protected \nthroughout the process. Most important, we as a committee have put \nforward in the bill a law that makes sure retaliation is now a crime.\n  Those reforms help the victims who are strong enough and able enough \nand have a command climate that is strong enough to report their cases. \nBut one thing the chairman said that is not true: Commanders do not \nneed this legal right to be able to set the command climate. In fact, \nmost commanders will never have this legal right. Just look at the Army \nrankings. Second lieutenants, they will command 16 to 44 soldiers. They \ndo not have convening authority. First lieutenant commanders--110 to \n140 personnel--do not have this authority. Captains--62 to 190 \nsoldiers--do not have this authority. Majors, lieutenant colonels, \nlieutenant colonels, who typically command battalion-sized units--300 \nto 1,000 soldiers--do not have this legal right.\n  Most commanders will never get to look at a case file and say: Are we \ngoing to trial? So I disagree that the ability to decide if something \ngoes to court-martial is necessary to set good order and discipline \nbecause almost every commander--all of them here--these commanders, \nthey all have to set good order and discipline as part of their job. \nThey have to set a command climate where the rape does not happen. They \nhave to set a command climate where that victim feels comfortable \nenough to come forward. They must, by law, now ensure that victim is \nnot retaliated against. It is their job--whether they ever have this \nright. Commanders can do this and must do this without this legal \nright. It does not weaken their ability.\n  To have one guy way up here in the Army who wears the bird--the man \nwho is the colonel, O6 level and above--he will make a legal decision, \nand he is not a lawyer. He is not trained. He does not know the ins and \nouts of prosecutorial discretion.\n  He may be biased. He may value the perpetrator more than the victim. \nHe does not need to make this legal decision. He should not be judged \non how tough he is on crime. He should not even be judged after he \nweighs the evidence if he does his job properly. He should weigh the \nevidence fairly. You can only do that if you are objective. That is why \nwe want it to go to trained military prosecutors outside the chain of \ncommand.\n  Those commanders, every single one of them, should be judged on what \nthe command climate is. Most of them will never get to weigh legal \nevidence as part of that. Chairman Levin, my colleague, has said: They \nhave never heard of examples where commanders did not go forward but a \nlawyer did.\n  I talked about one this morning. We heard from many victims. In fact, \none victim said she was on her way to trial, and the commander was \nchanged. The new commander had been in command for 4 days. He decides \nthat the trial is not going forward. He actually discontinued the \ntrial.\n  You know what he said to her? Your rape was not a crime. He may not \nhave been a gentleman. So I do not believe this legal right undermines \nour military system. I believe it strengthens our military system. I \nbelieve it gives commanders the chance to do their jobs, fighting and \nwinning wars, training men and women. Commanders are entirely on the \nhook by our base legislation. They will be judged on the command \nclimate. They will be judged on whether there is retaliation. They will \nbe able to prosecute retaliation as a crime.\n  I believe that if you create transparency and accountability in the \nsystem, we will be able to have many more cases be reported, first of \nall. More of those 23,000 cases will be reported. When you have more of \nthe 23,000 cases being reported, you will have more investigations. You \nwill, therefore, have more trials. You will, therefore, have more \nconvictions.\n  If you are ever going to change the culture, you need to do it by \nshowing there is accountability. You need to do it by showing there is \njustice. You need to show it by showing that justice can be done. We \nneed the active involvement of commanders. This is never going to \nhappen if we do not. So they need to start focusing on retaliation. \nThey need to start focusing on command climate. They need to make sure \nthese rapes are not happening.\n  They will do that whether or not they ever have this legal right. \nWhen our allies changed their laws to elevate all serious crimes out of \nthe chain of command, they did not see a falling apart of their \nmilitary. They did not see good order and discipline going out the \nwindow. They did not see any change at all, in fact. So I know our \nmilitary can do the same. I know our military can build a transparent, \naccountable system that responds to what victims have asked. They want \nto be able to have the decisionmaker be outside of their chain of \ncommand.\n  If we do that, we have a chance of building a criminal justice system \nwithin our military that is good, and it is just, as our men and women \ndeserve.\n  I am heartened by the conversation we are having on the floor today \nand I am grateful to all of my colleagues for their engagement and \ninvolvement on this critical issue. I have heard some questions about \nthe technical implementation of the Military Justice Improvement Act \nmentioned on the floor today and during the past few months and I would \nlike to address those concerns.\n\n[[Page S8333]]\n\n  First of all, thanks to feedback that we received about the MJIA, we \nmade some technical changes to the amendment that I would like to note.\n  One such concern was the omission of the Coast Guard, we have now \nincluded the Coast Guard in the amendment.\n  Another concern we heard about was how to handle attempts of crimes, \nboth in the new system and those that are excluded. In the amendment, \nconspiracies, solicitations and attempts have all been included.\n  We were also asked about crimes that happen simultaneously. For \nexample, what if during a sexual assault, crimes are also committed \nthat fall under the old system? In order to clarify any confusion about \nthis question, the amendment says that all known crimes will be charged \nunder the new system.\n  There were also questions about whether the convening authority will \nbe able to pick the judge, prosecutor and defense counsel. The newly \nfiled amendment has been clarified to ensure that it is clear that the \nnew, independent, convening authority has the same power as the \nprevious convening authority--the commander--in overseeing the process \nof convening a trial. The processes for detailing judges, prosecutors \nand defense counsels remains as they are today.\n  Other concerns we have heard seem to take as a negative the fact that \nthe MJIA leaves some issues up to the military to implement.\n  We see this as one of the strengths of the MJIA.\n  We wanted to ensure that the military had the ability to best \ninterpret and implement the legislation in a way that was effective for \nthe whole military, and for each service, each of which have slightly \ndifferent systems.\n  Let me give you an example. Some have argued that that plea \nbargaining will not work under our system. That is not true. The \namendment transfers the commander's responsibilities for convening \nauthority to the office of the Chiefs of Staff of each service; \ntherefore, the offices of Chiefs of Staff will now have the authority \nto oversee pre-trial agreements.\n  We specifically leave interpretation and implementation of the plea \nbargain up to the military to ensure that it is most expeditious--\ntherefore the military can choose to include the commander's \nperspective in the pre-trial agreement conversation and send the case \nback to him or her for non-judicial punishment or summary court \nmartial.\n  Let me give you another example. Article 32 is not explicitly \nmentioned in the amendment. This is intentional. Most if not all of the \nmembers of this body agree that the article 32 hearing needs to be \nfixed, but equally that it must be maintained. Because under the MJIA a \ntrained, independent prosecutor will now be making the decision about \nwhether to go to court martial, this may change the way that article 32 \nmay best be implemented. We want to leave the military, and these \ntrained prosecutors, with the ability to best implement the UCMJ.\n  I have also heard a lot of questions about non-judicial punishment. \nAs I have said all along, the amendment leaves all crimes with \npunishment under 1 year of confinement, and 37 military-specific crimes \nwith the commander, thereby leaving the vast majority of crimes \npunishable by courts martial in the hands of commanders.\n  However, to suggest that crimes as serious as rape and murder be \nhandled with anything but a clear look at the evidence is at the heart \nof the importance of this amendment. If evidence exists to send a case \nto court martial, there is absolutely no reason anyone should consider \nnon-judicial punishment as an option. This is exactly why this decision \nshould be in the hands of an impartial attorney.\n  Further, the amendment even allows for a failsafe if the independent \nJAG decides that there is not enough evidence to proceed to trial that \nthe charges would not be appropriately addressed at a court-martial, \nthen the commander would still be able to exercise non-judicial \npunishment. In the event that the military member demanded a trial by \ncourt martial, the decision authority would at that point still be able \nto send the charge to the convening authority for referral to trial. \nThere is nothing unique about this situation.\n  I want to assure all of my colleagues that I have spoken to military \njustice experts and to retired JAGs about how to ensure that the \nMilitary Justice Improvement Act addresses potential issues and to \nensure that the military has the ability to implement it in the best \nmanner possible.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak on the \ntragedy, on the ongoing crisis of sexual assault in our Armed Forces \nand what I believe we must do. There are several options before us, \neach of which has been the subject of lengthy and passionate debate, a \ndebate that I think is healthy, and needed, and welcome here in this \nChamber.\n  I commend my many colleagues--Chairman Levin and Senator Inhofe, \nSenator McCaskill and Senator Ayotte--for the very real progress, the \nvery significant steps taken both in the base bill, the NDAA, and in \nthe amendments to be offered by Senators McCaskill and Ayotte, serious \nand important steps forward to protect victims, to ensure that \ncommanders are held accountable and to criminalize retaliation. A wide \nrange of important and significant reforms that will make real progress \ntowards addressing the ongoing decades-old scourge of sexual assault in \nthe United States military.\n  As was said recently on the floor by another of my colleagues, this \ndisagreement today is over one of more than a dozen important and \nneeded reforms. But in the end, we have to decide. I believe the \nmeasure offered by Senator Gillibrand of New York, of which I am a \ncosponsor, is the right additional path forward. Because at the end, \nhere is the bottom line: Sexual assault has been a disease, a corrosive \nand widespread and horribly negative influence on our military that has \nsimply not been effectively treated.\n  I think this significant, dramatic step is the needed driver for \nextensive reform. I understand that the chain of command is essential, \nthat it is central to the proper functioning and order of the military, \nespecially during war time. In fact, the chain of command is nearly \nsacred.\n  But ensuring that our spouses and our siblings and our children can \nserve with honor and not have to face another enemy within our ranks is \nsacred. This is, in the end, a debate about justice--justice within our \nown Armed Forces, justice so we can fulfill that sacred duty of \nprotecting men and women in uniform as well as they protect us.\n  Despite many years of good-faith efforts by leaders in our Armed \nForces to work within the parameters of our current system, literally \ntens of thousands of sexual assaults are still occurring annually \nwithin our Armed Forces.\n  That is, frankly, unacceptable and it reflects a fundamental \nbreakdown in order and discipline that in my view we cannot tolerate \nanymore. The current system, in this important and vital way, is \nfailing. I understand the intense desire our leaders feel to fix what \nwas broken and for our military leaders to atone for taking their eyes \noff the ball, to paraphrase the testimony of the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs.\n  But, once again, this debate is not about them, about their \ncommitment or about their strategy or about their determination. It is \nabout justice. In America, justice must be blind. Whether someone \nreceives it or not should not depend on the fact of whether or not he \nor she serves in the military rather than in other workplaces. We know \nthe chilling facts, that according to the Department of Defense's own \nSexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, 50 percent of female \nvictims state they did not report the crime in the first place because \nthey believed nothing would be done, and one-quarter or 25 percent who \nreceived unwanted sexual contact indicated the offender was in their \nchain of command.\n  In my view, we strengthen our military when victims of sexual assault \nhave the confidence to come forward and to report crimes and when we \nremove fear and stigma from the process.\n\n[[Page S8334]]\n\nWe strengthen our military when we are able to deliver fair and \nimpartial justice on behalf of victims.\n  When we know the military chain of command in this one area is \nfailing, we should not continue to tolerate an exception we would not \nmake in other settings. I came to this decision with great reluctance, \nrecognizing as many in my family have, that the importance of the chain \nof command, the importance of respecting the unique and different \ntraditions and structures of the military is something that we should \nonly come to with great hesitation.\n  One of the responsibilities of serving in the Senate that I take \nseriously is my annual responsibility to review and approve candidates \nfor the military academies who are selected by my independent military \nacademy advisory board, and personally calling the top candidates to \ninform them that they will be the ones--of the dozens and dozens of \nhighly qualified competitors, they will be the ones selected to go to \nthe Merchant Marine Academy, the Air Force Academy; to Annapolis, the \nUnited States Naval Academy, or to the U.S. Military Academy, to West \nPoint.\n  This is a moving experience each of the 3 years I have had the chance \nto do this. But this past year, the three top candidates for West \nPoint, for Annapolis or for the Air Force Academy were all women--\nimpressive, compelling, determined to serve our Nation.\n  Meeting with them and their families, the nervous and proud parents \nof these confident cadet candidates is also a great annual experience. \nIt reminds me always of my responsibility to them. I promised their \nparents that we will support and respect them and their service. When \nwe speak to the cadets and thank them for their willingness to serve, I \nam reminded we have a responsibility to not send them into an \ninstitution where they will face threats that we can and should \naddress.\n  I believe I have a responsibility to send them into an institution I \nknow is well equipped to respond strongly and swiftly to threats to \ntheir safety. Yet, today, I am not able to uphold that responsibility \nbecause we have not protected our men and women in uniform from sexual \nassault.\n  I thought of my picks for the service academies when I heard another \nSenator say to General Dempsey that the Senator would not advise a \nparent to encourage his or her daughter to join the military. What made \nthis decision difficult for me to join Senator Gillibrand on this \nparticular amendment was an unfortunate, tragic case.\n  Last spring while I was trying to decide which path to follow on this \nbill, my office received a gut-wrenching call from the father of a \nyoung woman serving honorably in our military. He was calling against \nhis daughter's wishes, and only as a desperate last resort.\n  She had been the victim of sexual assault and, as so many others, \nreported it to her commanding officer up the chain of command. As so \nmany others, her case went nowhere. Her by-the-book reporting and \npatient waiting for results was met with delays, excuses, and \nnonresponse. Ultimately, during these repeated delays, she was \nphysically assaulted after she had warned leadership she feared for her \nsafety.\n  We took action and, ultimately in this instance, justice was done. A \nchain of command such as that isn't strengthening unit cohesion and \nmorale, it is harming it.\n  After this particularly troubling case, I made a decision to join \nSenator Gillibrand as a cosponsor, to say to all of us, how can we \naccept this? How can this situation that has gone on for years be \ntolerated? How can we justify the status quo?\n  I am grateful for the leadership of the many Senators on the Armed \nServices Committee and throughout this body who have taken real steps \nto add significant improvements to the UCMJ and to the code that \nunderlies our military and the requirements for leadership in the \nservice to take on and tackle these very real problems of sexual \nassault in the military.\n  In my view, taking decisions out of the chain of command should only \nbe done under the most serious of circumstances, but that is exactly \nwhat we have. We wouldn't find justice if this was the way that any \nother workplace in America operated. How can we argue that we have \njustice today for these thousands of victims in our military? The men \nand women who dedicate themselves to keeping us safe and protecting our \nrights deserve equal dedication on our part to their safety and to \nthose same rights.\n  I wish to speak about three bills I am offering as amendments to the \nNDAA that all relate to a topic I have spoken to many times on the \nfloor, to manufacturing and manufacturing jobs.\n  The first is the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act, a bill I \nintroduced last week with Illinois Senator Mark Kirk. It enjoys the \nsupport of the Presiding Officer, as well as Senator Blunt and Senator \nStabenow. It is a simple but important objective, to require the \ncreation of a national manufacturing strategy.\n  We need to know our country's direction as we try to support the \ngrowth in manufacturing. We have grown more than half a million \nmanufacturing jobs in the last 3 years, an encouraging sign, but one we \nneed to strengthen and support with a coordinated strategy between the \nFederal Government, State governments, and private sector to align all \nour investments in research and development, new skills, and new \ninfrastructure, to make sure they are all heading in the right \ndirection. Our leading competitors all have successful and well-\ndeployed national manufacturing strategies. Whether Germany, China, \nIndia, South Africa, or Russia, they have all thoroughly developed, \ndeeply researched, and prominently successful strategies, which we \nlack.\n  Our amendment would require that every 4 years the Secretary of \nCommerce, advised by a board of 15 different folks, pull together and \nthink through, research, and then deliver a national manufacturing \nstrategy.\n  This amendment is bipartisan, simple, does not cost the Federal \nGovernment a dime and doesn't create a new program, Like the next two \namendments I will speak about, it is a commonsense measure that I hope \nwe will adopt.\n  Secondly, I wish to speak to an amendment I am cosponsoring with \nCongressman Blunt to ensure small businesses are not subject to \nconflicting guidance from Federal agencies.\n  In the 1970s Congress passed a measure for the Small Business \nAdministration to ensure that small businesses that get contracts from \nthe government aren't actually fronts for much larger companies.\n  Last year we passed similar but distinctly different rules for the \nDepartment of Defense. Most of the time these two sets of rules can \npeaceably coexist, but in a few cases they come into conflict, creating \nsignificant compliance difficulties for very small business. This \namendment would say that when both sets of rules apply to a small \nbusiness contract, the SBA rules would apply, while DOD rules would \nnot.\n  This amendment is bipartisan, has no cost, and will help small \nbusinesses focus on effectively delivering products and services \nwithout worrying about compliance.\n  Last, I wish to speak about an amendment I am cosponsoring with \nSenator Booker of New Jersey to ensure that our defense and \nintelligence communities maintain their vital technological edge. This \nis an important measure that would create more opportunities to train \nAmerica's best talent and pave the way to new innovations.\n  Recently, the commission on R in the U.S. Intelligence Committee \nreviewed our current and future R capacity to support our \nintelligence community's vital work. Their unclassified report shows, \nin fact, that we have insufficient funding and a critical deficiency of \nhuman capital, of skilled workers, and the cutting-edge thinkers we \nneed in this area. Specifically, for one example it said we may not \nhave the kind and number of people we need to build the next generation \nof satellites to gather and process the intelligence upon which our \nnational security relies.\n  There is currently a program run by the Department of Defense \ndesigned to address one element of this problem. It is called the \nScience, Mathematics & Research for Transformation Scholarship Program, \nor the SMART Scholarship Program. This amendment calls on the Secretary \nof Defense to report back to Congress on two things: Whether the SMART \nScholarship Program, or similar fellowship and scholarship programs, \nare, in fact, providing\n\n[[Page S8335]]\n\nthe necessary number of undergraduate and graduate students in the \nfields of science, technology, engineering, and math to meet the \nrecommendations of the commission's report, and to recommend how those \nprograms can be concretely improved. Those amendments have already \npassed the House of Representatives by a voice vote and would be an \nimportant if small step toward paving the way toward job creation and \nensuring our national security now and into the future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these amendments.\n  I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate on \nthese important issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from South Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I wish to speak in support of the McCaskill, Ayotte, \nFischer, and Levin amendment.\n  Before we begin, I wish to thank Senators Levin, Reed, McCaskill, \nAyotte, Fischer, and others who have been trying to carry the burden \nhere to make sure that we reform the military justice system and the \nway the military operates vis-a-vis sexual assault and misconduct but \nat the same time make sure we still have a military that can continue \nto be the most effective fighting force on the planet at a time when we \nabsolutely need it.\n  If one believes, as I do, that our military is the best in the world, \nwe have to ask ourselves why. Is it because of the equipment? We have \ngreat equipment. I would argue that the reason our military has become \nthe most effective fighting force in the world is the way we are \nstructured.\n  If one is looking for a democracy, don't look to the military. The \nmilitary is a hierarchical and paternalistic organization that is \nfocused on meeting the challenges of the Nation, being able to project \nforce at a moment's notice to deter war and, if war ever comes, to \ndecisively end it on our terms.\n  I have been a military lawyer for over 30 years. I have been assigned \nas a military defense counsel for 2\\1/2\\ years and a senior military \nprosecutor in the Air Force for 4\\1/2\\ years. I have been a military \njudge, and I have served in the Guard and Reserve, and on Active Duty \nfor 6\\1/2\\ years. I have learned a lot, as a military lawyer, about the \nmilitary.\n  To my colleagues who are trying to decide what to do and what is \nappropriate, the goal should be to make sure that America remains the \nmost effective fighting force on the planet. This is the proposition: \nThey can't be an effective fighting force if they have rampant sexual \nassault or misconduct within the ranks. This idea that sexual assaults \nin the military are unacceptable, too large in number and scope--sign \nme up for that proposition. However, the problems of society don't stop \nat the gate; they continue inside the fence. I would daresay that if we \ndid surveys in South Carolina, Missouri, New Hampshire, and New York \nabout sexual assault and their frequency, we would all be disturbed.\n  The goal of our time in the Senate is to make sure that when it comes \nto our military, we turn a corner and create a legal system where \npeople feel that if they file a complaint, they are going to be fairly \ntreated and also a legal system where if one is accused of something, \nthey will be fairly treated.\n  I say to my colleagues, there is a reason that every judge advocate \ngeneral of all the services has urged us not to adopt Senator \nGillibrand's solution to this problem.\n  In the military, it is possible, in my view, to correct a problem \nwithout commander buy-in and holding commanders responsible. Military \ncommanders have awesome responsibility and almost absolute liability \nfor the job we give them. It is their job to make sure that all under \ntheir command are ready to go into combat, perform their assignment in \nthe most difficult task, make sure that medical records are up to date, \nand to make sure they are squared away when our Nation needs them.\n  This concept of the authority of the commander goes back to the very \nbeginning of this Nation. Military justice is an essential part of good \norder and discipline.\n  After 30 years of experience in this area, the number of cases where \na judge advocate recommends to a commander to proceed to trial in a \nsexual assault or, for that matter, almost any other alleged crime is a \nrounding error. Please don't suggest that under our current system \nsomeone can't get a case to trial because our commanders routinely blow \noff legal advice. That is not the case. Commanders decide as to whether \nto proceed to a court-martial, and what level of court-martial, based \nupon advice of the judge advocate community, whose job it is to provide \nprofessional advice. The commander's job is to make sure that unit is \nready to go to war. The lawyer's job is not to pick and choose who goes \ninto the battle. The lawyer's job is to give that commander the best \nlegal advice possible, including who to court-martial and who not.\n  One thing I hope people understand in this debate is that no lawyer, \nno judge advocate, is ever going to have to deal with the situation of \npicking and choosing in that unit who takes the most risk. We have for \n200 years allowed commanders the authority, under the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice since 1952 and before, and the ability to maintain \ngood order and discipline, the absolute responsibility to make sure \nforce is effective when it comes to the fight, and giving them the \ntools to make sure that happens.\n  What would bother me greatly is if this conversation occurred: Sir or \nma'am--depending on who the commander is, as there are more and more \nfemale commanders in the military--there was an alleged rape last \nnight, a sexual assault in the barracks last night, and the commander \nwould say: That is no longer my problem. Send that to Washington.\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, that is the commander's problem.\n  To those commanders who have failed to make sure we have the right \nclimate in the military when it comes to sexual assault, your job is at \nstake.\n  The military justice system, when it comes to rendering justice, I \nwill put up against any system in your State. The reforms in this bill \nare going to become the gold standard, I hope, over time, and very few \njurisdictions will be able to do what we have been able to do. With \nthanks to Senators McCaskill, Ayotte, Levin, and others, we have taken \na problem in the military and brought a good solution. Every victim \nwill now be assigned a judge advocate to help them through the legal \nprocess. I wish that were true in South Carolina, but it is not. Every \ncommander who is advised to go to trial in a sexual assault case and \nwho declines to accept the JAG's, the judge advocate, recommendation, \nthat case is automatically sent up to the Secretary of the service in \nquestion.\n  In the future, as commanders have to decide how to deal with sexual \nassault allegations, when the lawyer tells them: Sir, ma'am, this is a \ngood case, and if for some reason the commander decided: I disagree, \nthat case goes up to the highest member of that civilian service, the \nSecretary of the Air Force, in the case of my service. This, to me, is \na reform that will emphasize from the chain of command how important it \nis that we take these cases seriously.\n  If we take the chain of command out, this is what we are saying to \nevery commander in the military: You are fired. We, the Senate, have \ncome to conclude that you, the commander--all commanders of the group--\nare either intellectually insufficient to do this job or you don't have \nthe temperament or are morally bankrupt. We are going to take away from \nyou this part of being a commander. You are fired.\n\n  I will never, ever say that unless and until I am convinced that \nthere is no hope for our commanders, that our commanders are hopelessly \nlost when it comes to these types of issues. I don't believe we are \nremotely there.\n  In the 1970s we had upheaval throughout the country, particularly in \nthe military. We had race riots on aircraft carriers and tension ran \nhigh. How did we fix it? We made sure every commander was held \nresponsible for the atmosphere in their unit when it came to race \nrelations. And now I would daresay the most equal opportunity employer \nin the whole country is the U.S. military because commanders changed \nthe climate.\n  Under the approach of Senator Gillibrand, we take out a group of \nmilitary offenses. To the commander: You are fired; you can't do this \nanymore. And we send these decisions to an 06 judge\n\n[[Page S8336]]\n\nadvocate--which I happen to be one of, by the way--in Washington. I \ncannot stress to my colleagues enough how ill-conceived that system \nwould be from a military justice point of view and the damage that will \nbe done to the command and to the fighting force if we go down this \nroad. Let me tell you why.\n  A troop is in Afghanistan. There is a larceny. Senator Coons \nmentioned the workplace. A barracks thief is one of the worst things \nyou can be in the military. A soldier doesn't pick and choose whom they \nroom with; we pick whom they room with. No one gets to decide where \nthey are going to stay; we pick for them. We throw them into the most \nincredible of conditions, we don't give them the comforts of home, and \nthey have to trust their fellow soldiers in the barracks and in \ndeployment. Soldiers, like everybody else, most are great, some are \nbad. In the military the bad apples, thank God, are few.\n  Under this construct we are coming up with, if there was a barracks \ntheft case--a tent theft case--in a deployed environment, that really \ndoes hurt morale because if you have to worry about somebody stealing \nyour stuff, that is really tough given the conditions under which you \nare living. So if the commander could not deal with this, it would go \nall the way to Washington, DC, to be disposed of rather than being \ndisposed of onsite. And why does it need to be disposed of onsite? You \nneed to render justice quickly and effectively so the troops can see \nwhat you are doing. If you are the commander, they have to respect you \nand they have to understand your role.\n  So I cannot understand why the Senate, when we have been at war for \n11 or 12 years, would come up with a solution to a problem that is real \nthat does harm to the very concept of what makes our military special--\nthe ability to go to war, the ability to be effective and to have the \ncommander make decisions that only a commander should be making.\n  I am a military lawyer. I am telling you right now, don't give me \nthis decision, because I am not required to decide who goes to battle. \nDon't take away from our commanders in a theater of operation the \nability to render justice in a way the troops can see.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I want to make sure I understand something about \nnontraditional punishment. Since the Senator is discussing the barracks \nthief in Afghanistan and the notion that everything is going to stop \nand this case is going to be sent off to a lawyer half a continent away \nto make a decision, let's assume the lawyer--the colonel in \nWashington--decides there is insufficient evidence for that barracks \nthief. That might be 4 months later. Meanwhile, the barracks thief is \nstill there. And let's assume it then comes back. It is my \nunderstanding--and I think there is some confusion about this by the \npeople who are advocating this amendment--that you cannot exercise \nnonjudicial punishment on a soldier if he chooses a court-martial \nproceeding. Is that correct?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is exactly right. A nonjudicial punishment is an \nauthority the commander has to put people in confinement for up to 30 \ndays, reduce in rank one or two levels, depending on the rank of the \ncommander, and to withhold pay. It is nonjudicial punishment. You don't \nhave a trial. The person is represented by a lawyer, but there is no \njury. The commander is the jury.\n  The Presiding Officer. The Senator has spoken for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. So that commander who has to now send----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. He loses that authority.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. That case to Washington--that soldier is not going to \nagree to nonjudicial punishment. He is going to say: I will take my \nchances with the lawyers in Washington. And if the lawyers in \nWashington say no, then that commander's hands are completely tied to \neven putting him in the brig for 30 days.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Exactly right.\n  Every military lawyer who has looked at this is very worried about \nwhat we are about to do in terms of practical military justice.\n  Imagine being 18 years of age. You have too much to drink and you \nwrite a bad check. Part of being a commander and a first sergeant is \nthe paternalistic aspect of the job. How many of us have made mistakes \nat 18? Instead of going to college, you are going into a military unit. \nYou bounce four or five checks. Has that ever happened? Under this \nproposed system, the military commander no longer has the ability to \ndeal with it in the unit. He sends that case off to Washington. The \nability to give an article 15--a lesser punishment--is taken off the \ntable. So we are taking an 18-year-old's mistake and potentially \nturning it into a felony. Does that help sexual assaults?\n  Our commanders can send you to your death, but we don't trust them to \ndeal with manslaughter cases? All I can tell you is that for 30 years I \nhave been a practicing military lawyer. From my point of view, our \ncommanders take the responsibility to impose discipline incredibly \nseriously. They are skilled men and women.\n  We have let the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines down when it \ncomes to sexual assault. All of us are to blame in the military. We are \ngoing to fix that. But the problem, my colleagues, is not the military \njustice system. We don't have a military justice system where \ncommanders say to the lawyers: Go to hell; we are not going to deal \nwith that. That is not the way it works.\n  This new proposed system takes a portion of offenses out of the \npurview of the commander and sends them to somebody in Washington whom \nnobody in that unit will ever get to see. That will delay justice, and \nit will take tools off the table to make sure that is an effective \nfighting force in terms of dealing with the barracks thief, in terms of \ndealing with the bounced check, but it will also take young people who \nmake mistakes and put them in an arena where the only avenue is to \npotentially charge them with a felony.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Would the Senator from South Carolina yield for another \nquestion?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. So under the situation where the Senator says we have \ncommanders who aren't going to ignore what is brought before them in an \ninvestigation from their JAG lawyers, particularly on a sexual assault, \nlet's assume they did do that. Even though the evidence isn't there, \nthey do it. Under our proposal--the proposal of myself and Senators \nMcCaskill and Fischer--if the commander makes the decision not to bring \nthe sexual assault case and it then goes up for review before the \ncivilian secretary of whatever force is at issue--the Army, the Air \nForce, the Navy--what does the Senator think that will do in terms of \naccountability?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If you want to improve the system, and we all do--I am \nnot questioning anybody's motives--if a commander knows that when they \nturn down the JAGS's advice in one of the four situations we have \nidentified--sexual assault, the nature of the discussion here--that \ndecision will be reviewed by the Secretary of the service, I can assure \nyou that will do more good to make sure commanders understand how \nimportant this situation is to the country than taking their authority \naway.\n  We will be doing absolutely the worst possible thing to solve the \nproblem with the approach of Senator Gillibrand, in my view, although \nevery judge advocate agrees with what I am saying. You will throw the \nmilitary justice system in chaos and basically take the commander's \nauthority away in an irrational way.\n  What we should do is hold the commander more accountable by having \nwhat is the commander's worst nightmare--I guess anybody in the \nmilitary--and that is having the boss look at your homework. How do you \nget promoted in the military? People over you judge your work product.\n  Let me just say this. It is not a military justice problem here. The \nreforms we are going to engage in are historic, and they will be the \nmodel for systems in the future. Very few people can afford what we are \nabout to impose upon the military because we are going to make this a \npriority and we are going to assign judge advocates to victims. There \nis no other State in the Nation that will be able to do that. We will \nhave something of which we can all be proud. We are going to hold \ncommanders more accountable.\n\n[[Page S8337]]\n\n  Here is the essence of the argument: We have to take this out of the \nchain of command because there is something defective about the \ncommander; because the commander doesn't have the ability or they have \na bias against victims, we no longer can trust them to do the right \nthing.\n  That, to me, is an indictment of every commander in the military. \nThat, quite frankly, is not what we should be doing or saying given the \ntrack record of how our military has performed.\n  In the area of sexual assault, the problems we see in the military \nare all over the country; they are just talked about more in the \nmilitary. The people in the military should be held to the highest \nstandard, but we will fix no problem in the U.S. military if we deal \nthat commander out.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Would the Senator yield for a comment? Looking at the \nfacts, the evidence we have reflects that commanders are bringing more \ncases, are pursuing more cases than those recommended by their JAGs in \nsexual assault cases.\n  We received a letter from ADM Winnefeld, Deputy Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, basically pointing out that there were over 90 cases \nwhere commanders had a different view than their JAGs that a case \nshould go forward. Guess what. Convictions were had and people were \nheld accountable.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. There are situations where joint jurisdiction lies--the \nmilitary has jurisdiction, the civilian community has jurisdiction. \nThere have been cases where the civilian community went first. There \nwere 49 cases in the Army where the civilian community decided not to \nprosecute on a sexual assault and the Army took it up and they got an \n81-percent conviction rate. In the Marine Corps, 28 cases were turned \ndown by the civilian community where the Marine base was and they went \nto court with a 57-percent conviction rate. In the Navy and in the Air \nForce, it is the same. We see a civilian jurisdiction saying no to the \ncase and the military saying yes, we are going to go to court. And that \nis because there is a difference between what the civilian community is \ntrying to accomplish and what the military community must be trying to \naccomplish; that is, to let the troops know there is certain conduct \nthat is out of bounds, and if it is even close, you are going to pay a \npotential price.\n  Having said that, please do not blame sexual assault problems in the \nmilitary on a broken military justice system because it is not broken. \nThe commanders are not telling the lawyers to take a hike. The cases \nthe lawyers recommend to go to trial actually do go to trial.\n  Juries in the military are not juries of one's peers. This is not a \ncivilian system. Everybody who goes to trial as an enlisted man is \njudged by officers. You can request one-third of the military jury to \nbe enlisted members, but they will be the most senior people on the \nbase.\n  Please understand that military juries are not constructed the way \ncivilian juries are. They are told to be fair, and they do their best \nto be fair. But it goes into the concept of how the military works. The \nonly person in the military entitled to a trial of the equivalent rank \nis an officer. An officer cannot be tried by people of lesser rank. \nThat may sound unfair, but in the military it makes perfect sense, \ndoesn't it? Officers eat in one corner of the base and enlisted people \neat in the other corner of the base not because they hate each other. \nThey admire and respect each other. This chain of command, these lines \nof authority make us--Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. This unusual situation for most Americans works in the \nmilitary. It may not sound right to most, but it works because the \nmilitary is about when you are ordered to do something, you answer the \norder; you don't debate.\n  So if we don't elevate the commander to have the tools available to \nmake the right decisions, and if we don't instill those below the \ncommander to follow, it all breaks down. When a commander lets the \ntroops down--and they do sometimes--fire the commander. Don't take away \nthe authority of the commander to win wars that we will inevitably \nfight. This is not a civic organization. This is not a democracy. This \nis a situation where one person can choose to send another person to \ntheir death. That person is the commander, and there are plenty of \nchecks and balances.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, sexual assault is a problem. But for God's \nsake, let's not tell every commander in the military: You are fired. \nYou are morally bankrupt. You are incapable of carrying out the duties \nof making sure that justice is done in these cases.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to \nrecommit be withdrawn; the pending Levin amendment No. 2123 be set \naside for Senator Gillibrand, or designee, to offer amendment No. 2099 \nrelevant to sexual assault; that the amendment be subject to a relevant \nside-by-side amendment from Senators McCaskill and Ayotte, amendment \nNo. 2170; that no second-degree amendments be in order to either of the \nsexual assault amendments; that each of these amendments be subject to \na 60-affirmative-vote threshold.\n  I am told each side would like 10 minutes; that is, the McCaskill \nside and the Gillibrand side would receive 10 minutes to close. If \nthere are other people who wish to speak, now is the time to say \nsomething.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I understood there were 30 minutes left on the Gillibrand \ntime.\n  Mr. REID. How much time does the Senator need if I get a consent \nagreement?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. REID. So we need 10 minutes for McCaskill also. That would be 20 \nminutes on each side.\n  That the time then until 5:30 be equally divided between the \nproponents and the opponents of the Gillibrand amendment and the \nMcCaskill amendment; that the Senate proceed to vote in relation to \nGillibrand first; that upon disposition of the Gillibrand amendment, \nthe Senate proceed to vote in relation to the McCaskill-Ayotte \namendment; that there be 2 minutes equally divided between the votes; \nfinally, that no motions to recommit during the consideration of these \namendments be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would ask the leader if he would amend \nhis request to add the following language: Following the disposition of \nthe McCaskill-Ayotte amendment, all pending amendments be withdrawn and \nthe Republican manager, or his designee, be recognized to offer the \nnext amendment in order, followed by an amendment offered by the \nmajority side, and that the two sides continue offering amendments in \nalternating fashion until all amendments are disposed of.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the majority leader modify his UC?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we went through this yesterday. I \nreluctantly object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Is there objection to the \nmajority leader's request?\n  Mr. COBURN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. This is a very important bill for our country in terms of \nauthorizing the defense of this country. Many of us have relevant \namendments--not amendments outside the scope of this bill, but relevant \namendments--which will actually markedly improve the way we conduct \npolicy in the Defense Department. Without the assurance that those \namendments are going to be able to be offered--they can be tabled, but \nwithout that assurance, it makes it difficult to agree to a consent not \nknowing whether or not we will have the opportunity to represent the \npeople we represent in offering amendments which will make positive \nimprovements to this bill.\n  So I put forward that we are really not conducting the business of \nthe country if we are limiting the ability\n\n[[Page S8338]]\n\nof Members of the Senate to offer amendments. Absent that guarantee, I \nwill object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have 350 amendments which have been filed \non this bill. I know every person who has filed an amendment feels \nentitled to offer that amendment. I just think we are not in a position \nto deal with this for all the reasons we have talked about here for \nseveral months. We are not seriously legislating anymore.\n  We can pass the blame to anyone we want, but we have tried all kinds \nof things. How about so many amendments on each side? We have done that \nbefore. It is not anything unique. We have done that lots of times in \nthe past. It doesn't work. How about 13 amendments? No. It won't work \nbecause we want more amendments after that.\n  So I understand, and I am not denigrating anyone's intent. I know the \nintentions are good. The record reflects how I feel about this bill. I \nam sorry we are at the point we are. Couldn't we at least have \neverybody vote on this amendment which people have spent days of their \nlives working on? It doesn't matter how we feel about what has been \ndone, but there has been tremendously important work done on the sexual \nassault issue, and we should at least have the opportunity, with the \nwork that has been put into this, to have a vote. No one is \ndisenfranchised by doing that--or move to try to figure something else \nout after that. But, gee whiz, couldn't we do that? Otherwise, we will \nwalk away not having done anything on this. I think that is just so \nunfair to the people who worked on this.\n  I know other people have worked hard on their amendments. But I have \nto say, in the last year or two, no one has worked harder on amendments \nthan the proponents and opponents of this amendment.\n  So having said that, I ask unanimous consent that we move to a period \nof morning business for debate only until 7:30 p.m. tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is that a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, it was.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Of course, while reserving the right to object--I will \nnot, but I will say this. I can't tell everybody in this body how \ndisappointing it would be if we do not finish this bill tomorrow or \nFriday, because the issue is this, and we all ought to face it: There \nis only 1 week left where both the House and the Senate are going to be \nin session. If we don't finish this bill this week, there cannot be a \nconference report; and then, for the first time in 52 years, there will \nnot be a Defense authorization bill in the absence of some miracle.\n  I would plead with our colleagues, let us vote on this amendment. The \nalternative was a list of 13 amendments which we were willing to then \nmove to. That wasn't satisfactory. We have got to do this a step at a \ntime, and we have done it that way before. We can't even get cleared \namendments agreed to where both sides have cleared them into a \nmanager's package.\n  If Senators want to vote tomorrow or Friday against the cloture \nmotion because their amendments haven't been reached, they are free to \ndo so. That is plenty of ``leverage,'' which I guess is the currency \naround here, tragically. But I plead--and Senator Inhofe and I have \nworked so hard on this bill and I think he feels this same way--we need \nto get this bill finished this week or else we are not going to get a \nconference report.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would like to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I reserve the right to object.\n  Mr. REID. I would say, while they are reserving the right to object, \nthere is still time left. With the tentative agreement we had, which \nwas just kind of a handshake, there would be 6 hours, and there is \nstill time left on that. So that time for debate only, that time could \nstill be used.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. COBURN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. First of all, the amendment we are talking about isn't \npending because the tree has been filled. So we don't even have an \namendment pending. Seventy-six times the majority leader has filled the \ntree, more than two times all the rest of the Senate majority leaders \nin history.\n  Last year, under Senators Levin and McCain's leadership, we \nconsidered 125 amendments or thereabouts, some in a manager's package \nwith others. There were over 300 amendments offered. The average length \nof time to consider this bill is about 2\\1/2\\ weeks. We have had it up \nless than 1 week, and the fact is this is the consideration for an \nauthorization bill in excess of $500 billion, and we are not going to \nhave amendments on it.\n  So there is not a unanimous consent that I will agree to, until we \nagree to open the Senate to allow Members to offer their ideas. Table \nthem. The fact is, if we run this just like we did last year, we will \nbe through with this in 5 to 7 days. If we continue to do what we are \ndoing now, we won't finish it, and it won't be because we don't want to \nfinish it. It will be because we won't have the opportunity to have \ninput into a bill that is over 50 percent of our discretionary spending \nin this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I think when we are going through an exercise like this \nthere are some people who want to have their program placed on a must-\npass bill in order to get something through. The junior Senator from \nOklahoma made it very clear that he is talking about something he feels \nis relevant to the defense of this country, and I think that sounds \nreasonable.\n  What I would like to suggest to the majority leader and to my very \ngood friend with whom I have worked for many years, the chairman of the \ncommittee Senator Levin, is that we can qualify and work on a UC which \nwould either use the words germane, relevant or related, in some way so \nthat those amendments--which have nothing to do with defending \nAmerica--might be able to be considered in some form, maybe a limited \nform. I would like to be able to sit down and see if something like \nthat can be worked out before giving up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I know there is a unanimous consent pending. I have no \nproblem in the world with continuing to work to see if we can come up \nwith something. We have tried. It is not as if we have not tried. But \nmy disappointment is that we are just not doing any legislating here, \nand people can bring the blame to me all they want. We can get into all \nkinds of statistics that we want about what has happened in years past \nand why it has been necessary to fill the tree, but that doesn't \naccomplish anything. Everyone knows what is going on around here. So I \nam not going to get into a he said, they said situation.\n  I know the two managers of this bill want to get something done. \nLet's give them the time it takes to get that done.\n  So my consent is pending, and I would like the Chair to rule on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I renew my request that was just denied.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I also add to that that I be recognized at 7:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S8339]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/20/senate-section/article/S8339-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         THE DOOLITTLE RAIDERS\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, it is with pride and humility that I stand \nand thank my colleagues for passing S. 381 by unanimous consent last \nnight. Once passed by the House and signed by the President, this bill \nwill award Congressional Gold Medals to the surviving World War II \nheroes we know as the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders.\n  The effort to pass this measure has been a personal one to me. I \nthank 78 of my colleagues who have cosponsored the resolution. It \nproves the Senate can still reach consensus. I especially thank Senator \nBoozman, who is my original Republican counterpart, in introducing this \nbill in February. Also, original cosponsors Senator Murray and Baucus \nand Tester and Nelson and Cantwell and Schatz--original cosponsors.\n  I wish Senator Lautenberg, also an original cosponsor and close \npersonal friend, the last World War II veteran in the Senate, were here \ntoday to see its passage.\n  My special thanks to Senator Cornyn for his work on this and \nespecially Senator Ayotte. They have my personal thanks for helping to \nbring so many Republicans to sponsor this bill with us.\n  Many of you know the story of the Doolittle Raid. More than 71 years \nago, following the attack of Pearl Harbor just 4 months earlier, 80 \nbrave American airmen launched a mission that would become our Nation's \nfirst offensive action against Japanese soil in the Second World War. \nThey volunteered for what was called an ``extremely hazardous mission'' \nwithout knowing at the time what it actually entailed. Under the \nleadership of LTC James Doolittle, the raid involved launching 16 U.S. \nArmy Air Corps B-25 Mitchell bombers from the deck of the USS Hornet, a \nfeat that had never been attempted in combat before.\n  On April 18, 1942, again just a few months after Pearl Harbor, 650 \nmiles from its intended target, the Hornet encountered Japanese ships. \nFearing the mission might be compromised, the raiders decided to launch \n170 miles earlier than anticipated. These men accepted the risk that \nthey might not have enough fuel to make it safely beyond Japanese-\noccupied China. The consequences meant the Raiders would almost \ncertainly have to crash land or bail out, either above Japanese-\noccupied China or over the home islands of Japan. Any survivors would \ncertainly be subjected to imprisonment or torture or death.\n  After reaching their targets, 15 of the bombers continued to China. \nThe 16th, dangerously low on fuel, headed to Russia. The total distance \ntraveled by the Raiders averaged 2,250 nautical miles over a period of \n13 hours, making it the longest combat mission ever flown in a B-25 \nduring the war. Of the 80 Raiders who launched that day, 8 were \ncaptured. Of those eight prisoners, three were executed, one died of \ndisease, and four survived as prisoners of war and returned home after \nthe war.\n  The Doolittle Raid was a turning point for the Pacific theater and \nset the stage for Allied victory. Of the original 80 Raiders, 4 survive \ntoday. A Raider from Cincinnati, my home State, MAJ Tom Griffin, passed \naway on February 26 of this year, the very night I introduced S. 381. \nMajor Griffin was the navigator of plane No.9, the Whirling Dervish, on \nthe Doolittle Raid. He survived the mission and continued to fly until \nhe was shot down in 1943 and held in a German POW camp for 2 years.\n  When the war ended, Major Griffin returned home to Cincinnati and \nlater owned his own accounting business.\n  Similar to our veterans past and present, he asked for nothing. These \nveterans served simply because their Nation asked. For many years the \nsurviving raiders gathered to celebrate the mission and to honor their \ndeparted fellow Raiders. This year's celebration was bittersweet. It \nwas their final reunion, they decided. All the remaining Raiders are in \ntheir nineties and it is becoming hard for them to make the trip. It \nwas decided this would be their final reunion.\n  This is an article, a story in the Plain Dealer in Cleveland, of the \nfinal reunion which took place in Dayton, OH. The three remaining \nsurvivors who could make the trip called out ``here'' as a historian \nread the rollcall. They then raised a goblet inscribed with their names \nand toasted their fellow Raiders with a bottle of 1896 Cognac, a bottle \nthat Commander Jimmy Doolittle passed down for the Raiders' final \ntoast. Seventy-six other goblets were turned upside down, one for each \nof the comrades who had passed away. Hundreds of people watched the \nsolemn ceremony and offered their respects.\n  Speaker Boehner, whose district is nearby Dayton, OH, sent a letter \nin honor of the occasion.\n  In an Associated Press article on the ceremony, a 12-year-old boy \nwhose grandparents brought him to the event said, ``I felt like I owed \nthem a few short hours of the thousands of hours I will be on this \nEarth.''\n  This journey started 2 years ago for me when Brian Anderson, the \nSergeant at Arms for the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders Association, \napproached my office seeking a proclamation for the 70th anniversary of \nthe raid. We achieved that goal, passing S. 418 in August 2012 by \nunanimous consent. But that was not enough for Brian. It was not enough \nto honor these men and what they had accomplished. We set our goal of \nawarding the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award \nbestowed by Congress, limited to two a year in this body, to the \nRaiders.\n  This honor is designated to those who ``have performed an achievement \nthat has an impact on American history and culture that is likely to be \nrecognized a major achievement in the recipient's field long after the \nachievement.''\n  These 80 veterans met that description. They exemplified our highest \nideals of courage and service. They deserved to be recognized.\n  President Kennedy said ``a nation reveals itself not only by the men \nit produces but also by the men it honors and the men it remembers.''\n  We, our Nation, honor those who serve. I call on the House and I call \non the Speaker to quickly act on this legislation. Sitting in the \nChamber today is a Senator from Texas, the senior Senator from Texas, \nwho played a major role with Senator Ayotte and others in gathering \ncosponsors for this Congressional Gold Medal. I thank Senator Cornyn \nfor his work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to turn the compliment around and \nextend my appreciation to the Senator from Ohio Mr. Brown for his \nleadership on this issue. This is long overdue to these great American \npatriots, the recognition they so justly earned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/20/senate-section/article/S8339-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8339-S8340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FORT HOOD AND PURPLE HEARTS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, 4 years ago an Islamic radical who \nidentified with Al Qaeda and supported the cause of global jihad opened \nfire at Fort Hood Army base in Killeen, TX. The shooter eventually \nkilled 12 soldiers and 1 civilian, while wounding 30 others. He might \nhave killed or wounded many more but for the selflessness of a civilian \nphysician's assistant by the name of Michael Cahill and an Army captain \nnamed John Gaffaney, both of whom charged the gunman and gave their \nlives in order to save the lives of others.\n  Four years later we continue to honor their tremendous sacrifice and \nwe continue to honor the memories of all those who gave their lives or \nwere injured on that awful day. Back in August, the Fort Hood shooter \nwas sentenced to death for his crime and appropriately so. Let me be \nclear about what the nature of this crime was. This was not an ordinary \ncriminal event. This was a terrorist attack, plain and simple, \ncommitted by a man who had reportedly had at least 20 different email \ncommunications with a senior Al Qaeda figure by the name of Anwar al-\nAwlaki. The late Mr. Awlaki, who was killed by a U.S. drone strike in \nSeptember 2011, also had contacts, well documented, with the so-called \nUnderwear Bomber, who tried to blow up Northwest Airlines flight 253 \njust 7 weeks after the massacre at Fort Hood.\n  Following the Fort Hood attack, Awlaki celebrated the shooter as a \nhero. He called him a hero. He also told Al Jazeera that prior to the \nattack, the gunman had specifically asked him whether Islamic law \njustified ``killing U.S. soldiers and officers.''\n  The Fort Hood shooter had repeatedly and unapologetically said that\n\n[[Page S8340]]\n\nthese terrible atrocities which included execution-style murders were \njust part of the larger jihad against the West, which is why he shouted \n``Allahu Akbar'' just before opening fire. The shooter has said that by \nslaughtering 13 Americans, including 12 uniformed military members and \n1 civilian, he was defending ``the Islamic Empire'' and ``helping my \nMuslim brothers.''\n\n  In short, the Fort Hood massacre was not an episode of workplace \nviolence. This was a terrorist attack inspired by terrorist propaganda \nand carried out by someone who was an agent of Al Qaeda and viewed \nhimself as an Al Qaeda holy warrior.\n  Unfortunately, the U.S. Government so far has refused to give the \nkind of recognition that is deserved to the 12 uniformed servicemembers \nwho gave their lives, and those who were injured on that terrible day. \nPart of that recognition should include Purple Hearts to the soldiers \nwho lost their lives that day, and not given the civilian equivalent, \nthe Medal for the Defense of Freedom, to Michael Cahill.\n  In other words, the U.S. Government's official position is that this \nis not a terrorist attack on our own soil but instead is an ordinary \ncriminal attack. That cannot stand. We cannot denigrate the service of \nthose military members who lost their lives that day--and civilian hero \nMichael Cahill who lost his life--by saying that this is somehow \nworkplace violence or some ordinary criminal attack. We need to \nofficially recognize that this was a terrorist attack inspired by Al \nQaeda and carried out by an agent of Al Qaeda on our own soil.\n  Some will tell you that Purple Hearts can be awarded to victims of a \nterrorist attack only if the perpetrators of that attack were acting \nunder the direction of a foreign terrorist organization. In their view, \nthe Fort Hood shooter does not qualify. This argument fails to take \ninto account the evolving nature of the conflict--the global war on \nterrorism.\n  After all, Al Qaeda leader al-Zawahiri has urged his followers to \nconduct exactly the kind of deadly attacks that occurred at Fort Hood \nin 2009 and at the Boston Marathon in 2013. Al-Zawahiri believes that \nsuch ``dispersed,'' small-scale attacks will ``keep America in a state \nof tension and anticipation.''\n  As he declared a few months ago, ``These dispersed strikes can be \ncarried out by one brother, or a small number of brothers.'' In other \nwords, it doesn't make sense to distinguish so-called lone wolf \nterrorists acting on behalf of Al Qaeda from other terrorists with a \nmore explicit Al Qaeda affiliation.\n  Remember, Al Qaeda doesn't issue business or calling cards, and it \ndoesn't issue its staff IDs. What it does do is urge Islamic radicals \naround the world to pick up arms and kill Americans, and that is what \nMajor Hasan did that terrible day 4 years ago at Fort Hood in Killeen, \nTX. For that matter, Al Qaeda views American soil as a primary \nbattleground in its war against western civilization.\n  When courageous members of our military lose their lives to Al Qaeda-\ninspired terrorists, whether it is abroad or here at home, they deserve \nto receive Purple Hearts, and their grieving families deserve to \nreceive the proper benefits accorded to all men and women in our \nmilitary who lose their lives in service to their country.\n  It should not matter whether they lose their lives in America--\nwhether it is in New York on 9/11 or Killeen, TX, 4 years ago--or on \nthe battlefield in Afghanistan. It should not make any difference where \nthey lose their life as part of the effort to protect innocent life in \nthe war on terrorism. If they are killed by a terrorist committing \nviolence on behalf of foreign jihadists, then they are casualties in \nthe broader war on terrorism, and they deserve to be treated as such.\n  Earlier this year I introduced legislation that would make the Fort \nHood victims eligible for all of the honors and benefits available to \ntheir fellow U.S. servicemembers serving overseas in combat zones. My \ncosponsors in the House are Representatives Carter and Williams, and \nthey have numerous cosponsors. Today I am offering a modified version \nof that legislation as an amendment to the Defense authorization bill. \nBy enacting this amendment, Congress would honor the memories of those \nwho lost their lives at Fort Hood, and it would help their surviving \nfamily members, all of whom, as you can imagine, have experienced \ntremendous pain and hardship as a result of this terrorist act on our \nown soil 4 years ago in Fort Hood, Killeen, TX, at the hands of MAJ \nNidal Hasan, an agent of Al Qaeda, to be sure, and someone who deserves \nthe penalty of death that has been meted out by a military jury a few \nweeks ago.\n  I hope the Senate will rise up in a bipartisan way and pass this \nimportant legislation and erase these meaningless distinctions which \ndifferentiate between those who lose their lives in Afghanistan and \nthose who lose their lives here on American soil. It is a just and \nwell-deserved honor that these patriots have earned by their own blood, \nand these families deserve as a way of ameliorating some of the \nterrible loss they have suffered in their own service to our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the legislation \nbefore us, the National Defense Authorization Act, and to highlight \nsome of the many provisions in this legislation that are critical as we \nthink about our national security and the future of our military. I \nchair the Readiness and Management Subcommittee, and I understand that \none of the chief challenges which faces our military is readiness. The \neffects of nearly 10 years of warfare on our equipment and personnel, \ncoupled with the sharp budget reductions under sequestration, have made \nit more difficult for our Nation's military leaders to prepare our \nforces for combat.\n  During our markup of the Readiness and Management Subcommittee \nsections of this bill, I was pleased to work with my colleague from New \nHampshire, the ranking member of the Readiness and Management \nSubcommittee Senator Ayotte to move more than $1.5 billion from low-\npriority military construction projects into critical operations and \nmaintenance accounts for each of our military services. This move will \nhelp mitigate the worst effects of sequestration on readiness. It is \nobviously not going to address the whole problem. We have a lot more \nwork to do. Our men and women in uniform put their lives on the line \nfor us, and we need to keep the commitment we have made that they \nshould have the best possible training and best available equipment \nbefore we send them into combat.\n  I was also pleased to work with Senators McCain, Leahy, and Grassley \nto include a 1-year extension of the special immigrant visa programs \nfor both Iraq and Afghanistan. Special immigrant visas allow Afghans \nand Iraqis who worked directly with our U.S. Government and our men and \nwomen on the ground to come to the United States if their lives are in \ndanger as a result of their service. We have heard countless stories of \nhow these young brave men and women risked their lives to help the \nUnited States drive out violent extremists from their home countries of \nIraq and Afghanistan. As we wind down our military operations, we have \na responsibility to ensure that those who are in danger as a result of \ntheir faithful service to the United States are protected from harm.\n  Many of us are now familiar with one of these stories that has been \nmuch publicized, the story of U.S. soldier Matt Zeller and his Afghan \ninterpreter Janis Shinwari, who served the U.S. Government for over 9 \nyears in Afghanistan. During an attack in 2009, Shinwari not only \npulled Zeller out of a kill zone to safety, he also shot two members of \nthe Taliban who were sneaking up behind them. In doing that, he saved \nZeller's life. Following the incident, Shinwari was put on a Taliban \nkill list.\n  After many months--really years--of waiting, both Zeller and Shinwari \nrecently reunited here in the United States thanks to this special \nimmigrant visa program. I had the opportunity, with Senator McCain, to \nmeet the two of them in my office several weeks ago. Matt Zeller said \nthat Janis Shinwari is his brother. He expressed how grateful he was to \nShinwari for saving not only his life but all of the other members of \nhis unit who were helped by Shinwari.\n\n[[Page S8341]]\n\n  These stories are incredibly common, and I am grateful to all of our \ncolleagues for their assistance in reauthorizing this program, not just \nthrough the NDAA bill that is before us but the short-term extension we \nwere able to get during the government shutdown by unanimous consent in \nboth the Senate and the House. It shows just how much we appreciate, in \nAmerica, the service these men and women from Iraq and Afghanistan have \ngiven to us.\n  The bill before us also includes provisions from the Next Generation \nCooperative Threat Reduction Act, which I introduced earlier this year. \nThe Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Act is the most successful \nnonproliferation program in our country's history. The language in the \nunderlying bill would expand the scope of Nunn-Lugar to reflect the \ncurrent security environment.\n  Specifically, the bill requires the President to develop a \ncomprehensive strategy to address the rapidly growing threat of \nproliferation across the Middle East and North Africa. The spread of \nnuclear weapons is one of the gravest threats we face, both in the \nUnited States and across our international community. We need to make \nsure our efforts to combat those challenges are coordinated and reflect \nwhere the current security challenges exist.\n  I am also pleased we were able to increase funding in this bill for \nthe Department of Defense inspectors general by $35 million. This is \nimportant because investment in our Nation's inspectors general \ncontinues to be one of the most cost-effective ways the government can \nwork, particularly when it concerns the Department of Defense. In 2012, \nDOD inspectors general saved taxpayers more than $3.6 billion, and IG \nefforts have been credited with a nearly $11 return on investment for \nevery $1 spent. As the Presiding Officer knows, given our ongoing \nfiscal challenges, it is now more important than ever before we ensure \nevery dollar is spent effectively.\n  Finally, I want to address the issue of military sexual assault that \nis tackled in this National Defense Authorization Act. It makes \nsignificant progress toward addressing the crisis of sexual assault in \nour Nation's military.\n  I commend all of the members of the Armed Services Committee who \nworked to tirelessly address this issue, but I want to particularly \ncall out Senators McCaskill and Gillibrand, who have led the charge and \nworked to help ensure we include provisions in this act that can \naddress this scourge on our military. Because of their leadership, we \nare going to pass a bill that will take historic steps toward \naddressing this problem.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, we may have had different ideas about \nthe best way to address the problem, but we are united in our \ncommitment to victims of sexual assault and we will keep fighting for \nthem.\n  I certainly look forward to supporting the Gillibrand amendment, the \nMilitary Justice Improvement Act, along with the Presiding Officer, \nbecause it addresses chain-of-command issues that I believe can cause \nvictims of sexual assault in the military to refrain from reporting an \nincident because they fear either that nothing will be done or that \nthere will be retaliation from their commanders. Regardless of the \noutcome of that legislation, it is important to reflect on the \nprovisions that are already included in this bill because the bill \nbefore us today includes nearly 30 provisions that address sexual \nassault, prevention, investigation, and prosecution procedures at the \nDepartment of Defense. Almost all of these provisions were agreed to \nunanimously in the Armed Services Committee. Strong bipartisan support \nfor commonsense sexual assault prevention reforms such as those \nincluded in this bill sends a powerful message to all of the members of \nour military, including tens of thousands of victims, many of whom have \nbeen suffering quietly for decades, that what happened to them is \nunacceptable and it will no longer be tolerated.\n\n  One of the critical challenges we face in the military is changing \nthe culture surrounding sexual assault. I was pleased to work with our \ncolleagues to include provisions in the bill to help create an \nenvironment where victims can feel safe to come forward and report \nthese crimes.\n  In any organization, the best way to attract the most qualified \npersonnel is to tie an issue to career advancement. Sexual assault \nprevention and response is no different. That is why Senator Fischer \nand I included language that elevates the role of sexual assault \nprevention response officers to ensure we have the highest caliber \ncandidates assigned to those positions.\n  Also, in recent months I have held roundtable discussions with New \nHampshire law enforcement and with members of our University of New \nHampshire community who have worked on sexual assault prevention and \nwith members of the New Hampshire National Guard to discuss their best \npractices, the way in which they are working together in New Hampshire \nto address domestic violence and sexual assault. As a result of some of \nthose discussions, we have included in the bill a reform that would \nrequire the Defense Department to incorporate civilian sexual assault \ninvestigation and prosecution best practices into their military \nprocedures.\n  I wish to close this afternoon by thanking Chairman Levin and Ranking \nMember Inhofe for their leadership on this bipartisan bill. We still \nhave a lot of work to do here in the Senate, but obviously the \nfoundation has been laid by the work of the committee and by their \nleadership.\n  I also thank my staff for their incredibly hard work and dedication, \nas well as the staff of all of the Armed Services Committee, because \nwithout their contributions we would not have made as much progress as \nwe have. From the readiness subcommittee, I thank Jay Maroney, John \nQuirk, and Mike Noblet on the majority side; Lucian Niemeyer, Bill \nCastle, and Bruce Hock from the minority; and from my personal staff \nChad Kreikemeier, Josh Lucas, Joel Colony, and Patrick Day.\n  Finally, I want to say a special thank-you to CDR Tasya Lacey. Tasya \nis a graduate of the Naval Academy, and she served in my office over \nthe past year as a fellow on loan from the Department of the Navy. Her \nthoughtfulness and insight have been invaluable on a wide range of \nissues, especially during our efforts to address sexual assault. She is \nheaded back to the Navy soon, but I wanted her to know that it truly \nhas been a pleasure having her on my staff, and I wish her good luck in \nher next assignment.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I hope we can come together in \nthe next couple of days and get this bill done.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I might also add yesterday I submitted a \nresolution on the same subject and was happy to have Senator Collins as \na cosponsor, along with several other colleagues who have joined us. \nThey include Senators Mikulski, Tim Johnson, Menendez, Wicker, Moran, \nand Markey.\n  The goal--I will not go through all of the important statistics that \nhave been related during this floor presentation by my colleagues--but \nour goal is to make sure the national plan which is\n\n[[Page S8342]]\n\nbeing developed to address Alzheimer's is carried out. We want to \nreinforce the initial steps to a greater investment in finding answers, \nand I think everyone is on that same track.\n  We believe that supporting the goals and implementation of the \nNational Alzheimer's Project Act and the National Plan to Address \nAlzheimer's Disease is the right course to follow.\n  Achieving these goals means Federal funding must be there to \nimplement it. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan \nresolution and reinforce our national commitment to turning around the \nseeming inevitability of this terrible disease.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure investments \nare made in Alzheimer's research.\n  Let me just say parenthetically, if you think we can sequester funds \nfor the National Institutes of Health and honestly deal with the \nchallenge of Alzheimer's, you are wrong. You cannot cut funding at the \nNational Institutes of Health in the name of sequestration, cutting \ngrants that could find breakthrough cures for many diseases. You cannot \ncut those funds and discourage researchers from even participating in \nfuture research and expect to solve the medical challenges that face \nus, including Alzheimer's.\n  I am urging my colleagues to look at this not as just a matter of \nresolutions, which are important, but also funding which is critical so \nwe can find the solutions to these problems in a manner that is \nreasonable and quickly done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/20/senate-section/article/S8342-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ILLINOIS STORMS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before I give a statement on another \ntopic, I would like to note that we continue to focus on the damage \nthat was caused last Sunday by deadly tornadoes and storms in Illinois, \nestimated to have exceeded $1 billion in cost.\n  We have seen some scenes from that wreckage in places such as \nWashington, IL--the hardest hit in our State. They experienced an EF4 \ntornado, with wind speeds close to 200 miles an hour.\n  I can recall one news report where a man went home and could not find \nhis SUV--an indication of the ferocity and the intensity of the winds \nthat wiped a swath of devastation through this great town in central \nIllinois.\n  Power lines are still down, and there are gas leaks. There is still \ndanger there. But the first responders were there. The obvious helpers, \nthe Red Cross and Salvation Army, are on the scene. Federal, State, and \nlocal agencies are pitching in.\n  Equally important--I spoke to the mayor--the people are pitching in. \nThose who survived are helping those who have had the most damage: \nfinding them a place to sleep, making sure they have enough to eat, \ntrying to put their lives back together and go through the salvage and \nrecover the important items to their families.\n  The EF4 that tore through Washington was one of two that touched down \nin my State that day. The other one struck New Minden, which is down \nnear the metro East St. Louis area, and caused unbelievable damage.\n  All told, 84 tornadoes were reported throughout the Midwest on \nSunday.\n  We know more about the people whose lives were lost in this terrible \nevent. Three died in Massac County, in deep southern Illinois: Kathy \nGeorge, who was 58 years old, a devoted wife and mother; Robert Harmon, \nan avid motorcyclist; Scholitta Burrus, who was excited to visit her \nson for Thanksgiving. In Washington County, a brother and sister--\nJoseph and Frances Hoy--died in a tornado. They lived together on a \nfarm near New Minden.\n  Joseph Hoy was president of the Midwest Bird and Animal Breeders \nAssociation. In Tazewell County, Steve Neubauer, of Washington--he was \na mechanic and often helped his neighbors repair their tractors and \nlawnmowers.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with their families and friends. It is \nbad enough to lose your home, but someone you love is irreplaceable. I \nwant them to know we are thinking of them at this moment.\n  There is a lot to do. We have to pitch in and help the communities \nthat have been so heavily hit. I said before and I will say again that \nthere are certain occurrences that come through these disasters that \nare inspiring. I know a year from now we will go back to these \nneighborhoods and marvel at the progress that has been made as people \nrebuild their homes and their lives and their playgrounds and their \nchurches and their schools. They do not quit; they do not give up.\n  Secondly, we will have a litany of examples of people who reached out \nand helped others in a selfless, caring, compassionate way. As I said, \nit is not unique to Illinois; it is not unique to the Midwest; it may \nnot even be unique to America. But each time we go through one of those \ntests, it warms our hearts to know that people do respond so well to \nhelp one another.\n  We are going to continue to keep in touch with the Governor and local \nofficials and provide the Federal assistance on a bipartisan basis that \nwill help these communities and families get their lives back together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/20/senate-section/article/S8342-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8342-S8343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Presiding Officer knows better than most what it \nmeans for someone to enter our military, to raise their hand and take \nan oath in service to the United States. It is the giving of their time \nand their lives. Equally important, they are risking their lives. They \nknow they can be called upon in that capacity to defend this country. \nThey can be injured. They can lose their lives in the defense of this \nNation, and many have. But they still do it on a voluntary and selfless \nbasis. We realize that for most of them they have viewed their threats \nas the enemies who are going to attack the United States or their \nunits. But we have come to learn that there are other enemies within \nthe military who are equally troublesome and worrisome.\n  It is one thing to have a son or a daughter--someone you love very \nmuch--take an oath to serve in the military and run the risk of a \ndangerous encounter with an enemy. But it is absolutely unacceptable to \nthink that these men and women in the military would run the risk of a \ndangerous attack by someone else in the military.\n  Speaking to the issue of sexual assault, it is one which is topical \nbecause we have finally, finally started to come to grips with the \nreality of what it means. Our responsibility is to ensure that the men \nand women of the military have everything they need. Sexual assault \nthreatens it. It erodes the basic trust, respect, and professionalism \nthat our troops uphold and rely on to perform their duties. In a more \nfundamental sense, it also cuts to the heart of the basic questions of \nsafety, dignity, and justice as Americans.\n  However we measure it, the current system has failed our \nservicemembers. The evidence is overwhelming. It has been estimated \nthat 26,000 incidents of sexual assault occurred in the military in a \nrecent year. Only 3,400 reports were made from victims. The Institute \nof Medicine estimates that 21.5 percent of Active-Duty women and \nliterally thousands of Active-Duty men have been sexually assaulted. We \nalso know that 60 percent of the victims who do report these sexual \nassaults say they are retaliated against for doing so--60 percent. \nOverwhelming majorities of victims say they often do not report an \nincident because they do not think it will make any difference. It is a \nsweeping and comprehensive indictment of the current system.\n  I have a responsibility as chairman of the Appropriations Defense \nSubcommittee to work more closely with members of the military and \ntheir leaders than ever before. I have come to know them, to like them, \nto respect them. When they tell me, as they all have to a person, that \nthey are doing everything conceivable to deal with this problem, I \nbelieve them, but I also believe there are elements within the culture \nof some parts of our military which are almost intractable and which \nhave to be dealt with in a new and more definitive way.\n  Let me share one example. It came to light recently. I attended a \nFreedom Salute Ceremony for an Illinois National Guard unit that \nrecently returned from Theater Gateway operations in Kuwait. They had \nbeen gone a year. It was a small unit, fewer than 20. They came home, \nand their families were with him. They were out at Camp Lincoln in \nSpringfield, IL. This unit was in charge of transportation, making sure \nthat 100,000 servicemembers\n\n[[Page S8343]]\n\nwho came through that theater had what they needed to make it to their \nnext destination and ultimately back home. Some of these people were \nbeing redeployed, do not get me wrong, but many were headed home. I \nheard from these members of this unit.\n  Among the servicemembers they helped move through this hub was a \nyoung woman who had been sexually assaulted somewhere in the region. \nThat was not the first stop. The first stop for this sexual assault \nvictim was a barracks situation where she literally had to walk through \nthe men's restroom facilities to go the women's restroom facilities. \nThis is a victim of sexual assault. She told us--the person I spoke to \nin the unit--that this victim said to her that these were the first \nsympathetic faces she had seen or worked with since this terrible \nincident and she was grateful to this Illinois Guard unit for standing \nby her in this emotionally trying time.\n  I was happy to hear that this Guard unit had stepped up to give this \nyoung woman the help she needed, but it is inexcusable--in fact, it is \nshameful--that the rest of the system failed her. It is a story \nrepeated too many times across the services.\n  This current system has to change, and it will. I thank for their \nextraordinary advocacy Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Senator \nKirsten Gillibrand of New York, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, and \nmany others. They put into the pending bill on the Defense \nAuthorization Act many effective and necessary reforms.\n  I supported them. I appreciate Chairman Levin and Ranking Member \nInhofe for including 26 reforms in the underlying Defense authorization \nbill. I would like to highlight one reform in particular in which I \nplayed a small part--the special victims' counsel. I wish to highlight \nthis reform because victims need and deserve someone in their corner \nhelping them through what is probably one of the toughest moments of \ntheir lives.\n  In testimony earlier this year in the Appropriations Defense \nSubcommittee which I chair, the head of the Air Force General Welsh \ntalked about how effective this pilot program of special victims' \ncounsel has been. The bill that is pending before us would expand their \nservices. My subcommittee's appropriation spending mark ensures that it \nwill be fully funded.\n  The bills other reforms are equally powerful: improving prevention; \nholding leaders accountable for the climate in the military on this \nissue; reforming the military justice code. On these reforms, there is \nstrong bipartisan agreement.\n  Many of those reforms, including one we may vote on before we leave \nthis week, were thanks to the leadership of Senator Claire McCaskill. \nShe has been relentless in her efforts to lead on this important issue. \nToday is no different. She has an amendment which she offered which \nempowers the victims of sexual assault to have a greater voice in how \ntheir cases are prosecuted. It would require commanders' promotion \nreviews to take sexual assault climate into account. It would eliminate \nthe so-called good soldier defense by which commanders are permitted to \nconsider the defendant's overall value to the unit. I really appreciate \nSenator McCaskill's leadership. Her amendment is a positive one.\n  The crux of today's floor debate is whether the Senate pushes this \nreform even further. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York offered an \namendment that aims to give victims greater confidence that the \nmilitary justice system is free from any bias by giving the decision on \nthese cases to a senior judge advocate general outside the victim's \nchain of command.\n  However we come down on this proposal, we all know this would be a \nsignificant change for a military justice code that has only undergone \ntwo significant changes since 1950, but I believe we must go forward \nwith the Gillibrand proposal. I will vote in favor of her proposal. I \ndid not come to this decision lightly. I have discussed this issue with \nmy colleagues in the Senate, as well as every single military leader \nthey have recommended I meet with. I have met with them publicly and \nprivately. I have listened carefully. I have called the victims to hear \ntheir side as well. I considered the views of outside experts as well \nas my colleagues. Many of my colleagues have served in the military, \nand they have personal insights. After much deliberation, I have \nconcluded that every single one of those reforms, including Senator \nGillibrand's proposal, is going to be necessary if we are going to give \nvictims the confidence they need and the support they need to come \nforward.\n  I would also note that Senator Gillibrand's effort is endorsed by a \ndiverse and thoughtful range of outside groups. They include the \nNational Women's Law Center, the Vietnam Veterans of America, the Iraq \nand Afghanistan Veterans of America, the Defense Advisory Committee on \nWomen in the Services, and the Service Women's Action Network.\n  I know our senior military leaders are committed to cracking down on \nsexual assault. Many commanders around the world are just as outraged \nas Congress and just as committed to prosecuting offenders and setting \na new tone in the military. But it is the role of Congress to ensure \nthat the system those leaders implement is fair and reasonable. It must \nput the victims of assault back in control and the perpetrators of \nthese claims on notice. It must restore victims' confidence. These \nreforms accomplish this goal. I look forward to supporting them.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I am back again for now the 51st consecutive week \nthat the Senate has been in session to urge Congress to wake up to the \neffects of carbon pollution on the Earth.\n  Today I wish to talk about how climate change is taking its toll on \nan important part of our way of our life, some of our long-cherished \nAmerican pastimes that we do in the great outdoors.\n  New Englanders--and the distinguished Presiding Officer from \nConnecticut is very familiar with this--have fond memories of ski trips \nin Vermont, of ice hockey on frozen ponds in New Hampshire, and of \nfishing trips off the coast of Rhode Island. All of these activities \nare fun, they are fulfilling, and they leave us with indelible memories \nof the wonders of our natural world. But climate change is putting much \nof that at risk.\n  The New York Times records that declining snowfall and an \nunseasonably warm weather were a drag on winter sports and recreational \ntourism during the 2011-2012 winter. Before the end of the century, \nthey report the number of economically viable ski locations in New \nHampshire and Maine will be cut in half. Skiing in New York will be cut \nby three-quarters. I am sorry to inform the Presiding Officer from the \ngreat State of Connecticut that there will be no ski area left in \nConnecticut or Massachusetts. I assume from the report that means Rhode \nIsland as well, because Rhode Islanders have been skiing our beloved \nYawgoo Valley since the 1960s.\n  As drought and increasing temperatures reduce the snowpack in the \nCascade Range and the Rocky Mountains, the future of ski and \nsnowboarding there is also at risk.\n  The Park City Foundation in Utah predicts an annual local temperature \nincrease of 6.8 degrees Fahrenheit by 2075, which could cause a total \nloss of snowpack in the lower Park City resort area. Beyond the loss to \nthe skiing tradition in Park City, the report estimates that this will \nresult in thousands of lost jobs, tens of millions in lost earnings, \nand hundreds of millions in lost economic output.\n  No part of the country will be immune from these changes our carbon \npollution is driving. Studies have found that extremely warm days in \nthe Southeast are on the rise. Ice on the Great Lakes is forming later \nand disappearing earlier. Rain will continue to decrease on the Great \nPlains. Wildfire\n\n[[Page S8344]]\n\nseasons are getting worse in the West where the snowpack is melting \nearlier. Sea-level rise threatens Hawaii's famed beaches, and warming \nin Alaska is degrading the permafrost that entire communities are built \non.\n  Climate change has already changed rainfall patterns and can load the \ndice for bad weather conditions such as heat waves. This past summer a \nheat wave prompted the Kenosha public schools in Wisconsin to cancel \nall outdoor student practices and sporting events. The district stated \non its Web site: ``Keeping the best interests of our athletes in mind, \nwe are canceling/rescheduling all contests today.''\n  According to the Denver Post, this past spring a prolonged drought \nforced Denver Parks and Recreation to postpone opening of the grass \nsports fields for soccer and lacrosse, which kept thousands of children \nand adults from starting their athletic seasons.\n  For some, warmer temperatures mean more time inside because the air \nis not fit to breathe. Ground-level ozone, commonly known as smog, \nforms more quickly during hot sunny days, causing asthma attacks, \nemergency room visits, and even hospitalizations.\n  In August, I met with two Rhode Island kids: Nick Friend, a 15-year-\nold from East Providence, and Kenyatta Richards, who is an 8-year-old \nfrom Warwick. They have asthma. They have to stay indoors and avoid \nbeing too active on bad air days. We have had six bad air days from \nozone this year in Rhode Island. That is 6 days when Rhode Islanders \nsuch as Nick and Kenyatta can't enjoy the outdoor activities that are \nso much a part of our American childhoods.\n  The effects of climate change aren't limited to hotter days and smog. \nOceans are warming, ice is melting, and sea levels are rising. This \nputs coastal infrastructure such as dams, bridges, and coastal \npowerplants at risk. It also threatens many of our most beloved and \nexpensive palaces of sport. As far back as 2007, ``Sports Illustrated'' \nran a special issue on sports and global warming, saying: ``Scientists \nproject up to a one-meter increase in sea level by 2100,'' warned one \narticle, ``which will alter the shape of the land in low-lying regions \nof U.S.--including San Francisco Bay and South Florida--and swamp well-\nknown sports venues.'' Places such as the American Airlines Arena and \nSun Life Stadium in Miami and AT Park in San Francisco are at risk.\n  As Congress sleepwalks through history, blind to the harmful effects \nof carbon pollution, responsible groups are acting, including our major \nprofessional sports leagues. The NBA, MLB, NFL, and NHL are letters \nthat almost every American knows. These leagues and their teams are \ncultural institutions. They are also big business with annual revenues \nin billions of dollars. They take the threat of postponed games and \nwashed-out stadiums seriously.\n  Earlier this year, the Bicameral Task Force on Climate Change, which \nI started with Representative Henry Waxman, to keep attention focused \non climate change and what we could do to address it, asked the \nNational Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, the National \nHockey League, and the National Football League, as well as the United \nStates Olympic Committee, to tell us what climate change means for \ntheir sports. Each of these organizations is awake to the dangers of \ncarbon pollution and each is acting.\n  Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig wrote to the task force and said:\n\n       I have often said that Baseball is a social institution, \n     and to that end we recognize our responsibility to be part of \n     the national effort to preserve our environment. And that is \n     why MLB and many of our Major League Clubs have adopted \n     practices that have resulted in clean, energy-efficient \n     ballparks and environmentally friendly baseball events.\n\n  One of those practices is the partial offset of the energy used at \nall the All-Star Game events, including FanFest, the Home Run Derby, \nand the All-Star Game, by Green-e Certified energy renewable credits, \nincluding wind and solar energy.\n  On the hockey front, NHL Deputy Commissioner William Daly wrote:\n\n       Hockey's relationship with the environment is unique. Our \n     sport was born on frozen ponds, where to this day--players \n     of all ages and skill levels learn to skate. For this \n     magnificent tradition to continue, it is imperative that \n     we recognize the importance of maintaining the \n     environment.\n\n  The NHL has partnered with ENERGY STAR and the Natural Resources \nDefense Council to make its own facilities more energy efficient, and \nit has called on the U.S. Government to develop a nationwide retrofit \nstrategy to help upgrade buildings such as ice rinks and to reduce \nenergy consumption and carbon emissions.\n  Kathy Behrens, executive vice president of Social Responsibility & \nPlayer Programs at the NBA, told us:\n\n       While Professional NBA games are played inside climate \n     controlled arenas, most basketball around the world is played \n     outdoors. If air pollution, extreme heat, and other forms of \n     climate disruption make it difficult to enjoy or attend our \n     game and, of much concern, actually threatens the health and \n     safety of basketball players, fans, and business partners, \n     that matters greatly to the [NBA].\n\n  Pro basketball is working to reduce carbon emissions through improved \nenergy efficiency at its arenas. A number of NBA arenas have achieved \nLEED certifications and some have installed on-site solar panels. The \nNBA has also come out in support of standards to reduce carbon \npollution from electric powerplants, which is a cornerstone of \nPresident Obama's recently announced climate action plan.\n  On the football front, Adolfo Birch III, senior vice president of \nLabor Policy and Government Affairs for the NFL, wrote:\n\n       Twenty years ago, the NFL became the first professional \n     sports organization formally to address the environmental \n     impact of our marquee events--Super Bowl and Pro Bowl.\n\n  The program to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions during every \nSuper Bowl has resulted in the planting of more than 50,000 trees in \nthe Super Bowl host communities. The National Football League estimates \nthat the 2013 Super Bowl in New Orleans achieved a reduction of nearly \n24,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions or the equivalent of the energy \nuse of 8,000 American homes for an entire year.\n  The U.S. Olympic Committee has also joined in the fight to reduce \nharmful carbon pollution. According to USOC CEO Scott Blackmun:\n\n       The Green Ring program aims to mitigate the USOC and our \n     athletes' impact on the environment through a number of \n     sustainability efforts, an area that is a passion for many of \n     our athletes. Through Green Ring, we hope to contribute to \n     sustainability while using our platform to educate and \n     inspire our constituents to do the same. Our focus is more \n     action, less carbon.\n\n  Other international bodies have also launched aggressive plans to \nfight climate change. The 2014 soccer World Cup in Brazil is aiming to \nbe carbon neutral by offsetting 2.7 million tons of carbon dioxide \nestimated to be generated by this year's Confederation Cup tournament \nand the World Cup next year.\n  Our major sports leagues thus join a great army amassing on the side \nof climate action: virtually every major scientific body, the insurance \nand reinsurance industry, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the National \nAcademies, NASA, and the Government Accountability Office, the U.S. \nConference of Catholic Bishops, leading Americans and international \ncorporations, and the American Public Health Association. To them and \nmany others, who are all in this fight, we can add our friends in the \nworld of sports: Major League Baseball, the National Basketball \nAssociation, the National Hockey League, the National Football League, \nand the U.S. Olympic Committee. There is a growing chorus of voices \nfrom every sector of American society calling for action. Indeed, there \nis work to be done. The major sports organizations are doing their part \nbecause they know that few things define American society like the \nteams we cheer and the games we play.\n  We in Congress need to wake up and join the fight. It is time to set \naside the partisan nonsense and the polluter-fueled fantasies and at \nlast take real steps to reduce our carbon pollution and preserve our \ndistinctly American way of life.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/20/senate-section/article/S8344-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8344-S8346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise tonight to talk about the matter \nthat is before us, which is the National Defense Authorization Act. I \ndon't think\n\n[[Page S8345]]\n\nwe have to make a fulsome argument tonight that it is very important we \npass this authorization act for the fundamental purpose of making sure \nwe can, at a minimum, complete action in the very near future on \nauthorizing a whole range of programs that keep our people safe and \nensure our national security. I am confident we will do that, but that \nis vitally important.\n  I rise tonight to talk about one aspect of that challenge--and, \nagain, it is just one part of our national security interest--relating \nspecifically to what has been happening in Afghanistan over the last \ndecade, and particularly to women and girls in Afghanistan. The \namendment I have introduced and will be speaking on behalf of tonight \nis amendment No. 2172, which regards the security of Afghan women and \ngirls.\n  For the past 12 years, United States servicemembers have been \ndeployed in Afghanistan fighting the insurgency there. Their \nsacrifice--the sacrifices of our own people--have created a space for \nAfghan democracy to take root and for a civil society to develop. It is \nimperative as we draw down U.S. combat troops in Afghanistan we remain \nfocused on the United States long-term strategic interest in the \nregion. It is in the United States national security interest for \nAfghanistan to remain stable, secure, and democratic.\n  We have seen from a distance what life under the Taliban looks like \nin Afghanistan when the Taliban was in charge. We also can see with the \nperspective of recent history what it has looked like since the Taliban \nwas removed. A return to their rule, however, will not only set back \nthe progress that has been made, but it will also allow the forces of \nintolerance and extremism to triumph.\n  So 2014 marks a significant transition in Afghanistan. U.S. and \ncoalition forces will draw down while voters will go to the polls to \nchoose their second democratically elected president.\n  We are considering this year's National Defense Authorization Act \nwith just 6 weeks remaining before the beginning of 2014. Our military \nfamilies are welcoming back soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who \nhave seen more than a decade of conflict in Afghanistan. When I meet--\nas I know the Presiding Officer and other Members of the Senate do--\nwith servicemembers who have served in Afghanistan, I never forget--as \nnone of us must ever forget--their sacrifice, their determination, and \ntheir valor. Since October of 2001, Americans have fought for a stable, \nprosperous, and democratic Afghanistan.\n  On my trips to Afghanistan, which now number three, I have come to \nunderstand that women and girls often display remarkable courage but \nare often the most vulnerable targets. But great progress has been \nmade, and I will just mention a couple of examples.\n  About a decade ago, almost no girls were in school in Afghanistan--\nvery close to, if not, zero. The number of Afghan girls in school now \nis 2.4 million, and women represent more than 27 percent of Afghans \nserving in parliament. A small but brave corps of women has joined the \nAfghan National Security Forces in service to their country. None of \nthis would have been possible just a little more than a decade ago--12 \nyears ago.\n  Whenever I meet with them, Afghan women emphasize they are not \nwilling to give up--nor should they be--on the gains they have achieved \nwith help from the American people. Just yesterday I met with Nilofar \nSakhi, who is working to promote women in the workforce. Hearing her \ncommitment to advancing the role of women firsthand, as I did \nyesterday, further motivated me to introduce and advance this \namendment.\n  During my last trip to Afghanistan I met with Fawzia Koofi, who is an \ninspiring lawmaker and women's rights advocate. As a mother of two \nyoung daughters, she has worked to instill the importance of education \nand to make sure her daughters understand that. She now serves in a \nleadership role in the Afghan parliament.\n  I would also mention when we were meeting with her she talked about \nhow both her father and her husband had been killed because they were \npolitically active. Yet even in the face of that, she has put herself \nforward to serve in public office in Afghanistan.\n  A third example, another brave woman showing the people of the world \nwhat it means to serve and to act even in the face of danger, is Suraya \nPakhzad, who lives in Herat. Ms. Pakhzad recently traveled to the \nUnited States and visited not just my home State of Pennsylvania but \nliterally the county I live in and impressed the people there, as she \nalways does. Suraya is a true entrepreneur and philanthropist. With \nU.S. government support she has opened a women's shelter in Baghdis \nprovince. That is just the beginning of what we could say about her \nservice. We don't have enough time tonight to give more examples, but \nSuraya has been a great example to me and to so many others.\n  These three inspiring stories I have talked about are just a few of \nthe many, but I am deeply concerned--and I know a lot of people are--\nthat we have already begun to see the progress on Afghans women's \nrights and security being rolled back. In an effort to honor the \nsacrifice the American people have made to help women and girls in \nAfghanistan, I, along with Senator Ayotte, have introduced an amendment \nto this authorization act to ensure those gains are not degraded. The \namendment is No. 2172, and I am grateful to Senator Ayotte for her work \nand for her leadership on this issue.\n  It is clear as can be that the security of Afghan women and girls is \nnot simply about their own security and its value and importance. It is \nalso critically important to the long-term future of the country. We \nknow if more women and girls are allowed to be educated--to go to \nschool and to learn, and to grow and to achieve--that, in and of \nitself, has an economic impact, a positive impact, on a woman and her \nfamily but also on the economy of Afghanistan. The question is what \nsteps are we going to take to ensure not just their own security but \nthe security of the country. If they advance, if women and girls in \nAfghanistan advance, Afghanistan will be a safer place. It is likely \nthe threat of terrorism will be reduced because of the direct \ninvolvement of women in the economy and in the life of the people in \nAfghanistan.\n  Let me quickly summarize what the amendment does. First, it focuses \non political transition. Afghanistan will hold, as I mentioned before, \nhistoric elections in April. As the country votes for a president--a \npresident that will help Afghanistan transition from conflict--it is \ncritical that women not be disenfranchised. Therefore, this amendment \nseeks to ensure the adequate staffing of polling stations by female \nofficers.\n  Second, the other part of the transition, of course, is the security \ntransition. This bill would also improve awareness and responsiveness \namong Afghan National Security Forces personnel regarding the unique \nchallenges that women confront. It will also focus on the recruitment \nand retention of women in the Afghan National Security Forces.\n  It would be, to use just one word, unconscionable to abandon the \nwomen and girls of Afghanistan who have made such great progress. If we \ntake steps that lead to the abandonment of women and girls in \nAfghanistan during this transition--this drawdown--we will be making a \nterrible mistake, and we will not have honored the sacrifice of our own \nservice men and women, and we will be harming the important transition \nthat is taking place in Afghanistan.\n  This legislation will demonstrate not just our commitment and \ndedication to this important goal but it will also ensure a much \nbrighter future not just for that young girl or woman in Afghanistan \nand their family, but it will ensure literally a safer and more secure \nand much less extreme situation in Afghanistan, when we consider all of \nthe threats that are present there on a daily basis.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support in this authorization process \namendment No. 2172, and I again want to commend and salute the work of \nSenator Ayotte on this very important priority for the United States.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania \nSenator Casey for his leadership on amendment No. 2172, which is very \nimportant. I appreciate what he just said on the floor--the cases of \nthe bravery of Afghan women, the leadership they\n\n[[Page S8346]]\n\nhave shown under tremendously difficult circumstances, and the \nsacrifices our men and women in uniform have made to ensure that \nAfghanistan does not become a haven for terrorists again.\n  One of the keys to that is that no society can be free, no society \ncan have true safety and security unless the women in the society also \nhave safety and security. So I thank Senator Casey for his leadership \nin ensuring that we stand by the Afghan women because we cannot succeed \nin Afghanistan if women go back to what they endured under the Taliban, \nwhich was horrific and was wrong, and none of us should accept.\n  So Senator Casey really has been a leader, and I thank him for being \nso concerned about what will happen in Afghanistan and working to make \nsure it never becomes a haven for terrorists again; that women in \nAfghanistan can live with security; that women and girls can go to \nschool; that they can contribute to Afghan society and take part in \nfree elections; and that Afghanistan will be a place where women will \nno longer be brought into soccer stadiums and violated.\n  So I thank Senator Casey for this amendment and bringing it forward. \nI am very proud to cosponsor it. As Senator Casey mentioned, our \namendment would ensure adequate staffing at polling stations by female \nofficers so that when they have elections, this would improve the \nsecurity of those stations, making sure women can come forward and \nvote. It would increase the awareness and responsiveness among Afghan \nNational Army and national police personnel regarding the unique \nchallenges women confront when joining those forces. Yes, women--some \nof them--are now joining the Afghan security forces to defend their \nnation.\n  The amendment would focus on improving the recruitment and retention \nof women in Afghan security forces, and it would ensure that as we \nenter the bilateral security agreement that DOD will produce a strategy \nto promote the security of Afghan women and girls.\n  These issues are very important. I commend our men and women in \nuniform for everything they have done in Afghanistan to prevent \nAfghanistan from being a haven for terrorists and to ensure that women \nand girls can live securely and won't be violated the way they were \nwhen the Taliban was in charge of Afghanistan. The images so many of us \nsaw were beyond the word ``outrageous.'' We can't even describe the \nhorrific way women and girls were treated--worse than second-class \ncitizens--under the Taliban.\n  This amendment will ensure what we all understand to be the bottom \nline: that no strategy in Afghanistan can succeed if women are not an \nintegral part of that strategy, if women aren't allowed to have the \nsecurity, the dignity, and the freedom all people deserve.\n  I thank Senator Casey for his leadership. I hope my colleagues in the \nSenate will adopt this amendment because last year when we considered \nDefense authorization, the Senate passed a similar provision by \nunanimous consent. So I hope my colleagues will do the same and pass \nthe Casey-Ayotte amendment to promote the security of Afghan women and \ngirls; as we look to the bilateral security agreement, as we look to \nworking with our coalition partners as we are drawing down in \nAfghanistan, we will not leave the Afghan women and girls behind and we \nwill ensure that Afghanistan does not become a haven for terrorists \nagain.\n  I thank Senator Casey for allowing me to speak on this very important \nissue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, to start, I would like to pay \ntribute to my two colleagues, Senator Casey and Senator Ayotte, for \ntheir focus on human rights and particularly the rights of women \nwherever those women may live.\n  I rise tonight to talk about the rights that are enshrined in our \nBill of Rights. To that particular key concern of Americans, I wish to \ntalk about the importance of reforming our domestic surveillance laws.\n  As Senator Wyden and I both enter this discussion, we have one \ngeneral goal in mind; that is, to find a proper balance between keeping \nour Nation safe from terrorism and still protecting our cherished \nconstitutional rights.\n  Senator Wyden and I are both members of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee. We have argued for years that the government's domestic \nsurveillance authorities need to be narrowed, and we are going to keep \nleading this fight in the days, weeks, and months to come. As part of \nthis ongoing effort, we recently introduced comprehensive bipartisan \nlegislation that would end the NSA's selection of millions of innocent \nAmericans' private phone records, shield Americans from warrantless \nsearches of their communications, and install a constitutional advocate \nat the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\n  We believe that overly intrusive domestic surveillance programs, \nmisleading statements made by senior intelligence officials, and \nrevelations about how secret courts have handed down secret rulings on \nsecret law have eroded the trust and confidence of the American people. \nSimply put, we need to restore this trust, and the best way to do that \nis to carve out time and hold a vigorous and substantive debate here on \nthe Senate floor--a debate the American people have demanded and \ndeserve.\n  Senator Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, introduced his \nown comprehensive reform proposal last month with Representative \nSensenbrenner. Representative Sensenbrenner is a key figure because he \nwas the original author of the PATRIOT Act. He has had concerns. He has \njoined forces with Senator Leahy. This bipartisan plan, the Leahy-\nSensenbrenner plan, includes many of the proposals Senator Wyden and I \nhave long called for, and we are proud to support this effort.\n  Let me be clear. This issue is not going away. It will not go away \nbecause more and more Americans and more and more of our colleagues are \ncoming to understand the true overreach of our Nation's surveillance \nprograms and the effect on American privacy. This issue is not going to \ngo away because we are not going to stop shining a light on the \npotential for future abuse that comes with our government's secret \ninterpretation of its authorities under the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act.\n  I truly believe that ultimately our efforts--the efforts of Senator \nWyden, Chairman Leahy, Representative Sensenbrenner, Senator Paul, \nSenator Blumenthal, the Presiding Officer, myself, and a growing number \nof others--will lead to a majority of this Congress acting in \ncommonsense ways to protect the privacy of Americans.\n  We are here today on the floor in the midst of consideration of a \nvery critical piece of legislation for our national security and for \nthe well-being of our men and women in uniform, the Defense \nAuthorization Act. I am a member of the Armed Services Committee. I \nhave the great privilege of chairing the Subcommittee on Strategic \nForces. I know as well as anyone that this is a must-pass bill. The \nissues we debated this week related to Guantanamo Bay and the scourge \nof sexual assault on our military are matters that rightfully demand \nsignificant and thoughtful time on the Senate floor. While I think \nSenator Wyden and I would agree that this week's debate on the National \nDefense Authorization Act is not the right time for a full, \ncomprehensive debate on surveillance reform, I do believe it is the \nright time to begin that conversation.\n  Senator Wyden has introduced a smart pro-transparency, pro-\naccountability amendment, and that amendment is the right place to \nstart. His amendment is based on the work we have been doing for a \nnumber of years now. That is why I am a proud cosponsor and a strong \nsupporter.\n  This amendment would increase the transparency of domestic \nsurveillance programs, and I think it should--and I\n\n[[Page S8347]]\n\nknow it will--have broad support in this body. I am going to let \nSenator Wyden speak more extensively about our amendment, which, by the \nway, we have also introduced with the chair of the Appropriations \nCommittee Senator Mikulski.\n  Again, this is the perfect way to begin and frame what will be a more \nfulsome debate over the next few months. We are going to demand this \ndebate because Coloradans, Oregonians, and Americans across our country \ndemand that we have this debate.\n  With that, I turn to my friend and colleague Senator Wyden for his \nthoughts.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank Senator Udall for his exceptional leadership in \nour effort to put together a comprehensive bipartisan reform bill. I \nalso thank the Presiding Officer from Connecticut because, as we all \nknow, he has really been the ringleader in the effort to ensure that \nwhen there are major constitutional arguments put in front of the FISA \nCourt, there is somebody there to make the case for the other side. So \nI am very pleased that, for purposes of this colloquy, when we discuss \nthe transparency amendment we have filed today with Senator Mikulski, \nwe have Senator Blumenthal in the Chair because he has been an integral \npart of the reform effort.\n  I also appreciate what the distinguished Senator from Colorado said \nabout Chairman Leahy. We have had a real partnership with him in \nworking on these issues for a long time. We were thrilled that Chairman \nLeahy went on our bill and we went on his bill because it illustrates \nthe need to try to make common cause around these issues. And as the \nSenator from Colorado said, we are talking about bipartisan approaches \nthat help promote reform agenda.\n  As the Senator from Colorado noted, it would be pretty hard to have a \nfull debate on this legislation about surveillance reform. Suffice it \nto say that there are differing views here in the Senate with respect \nto surveillance. The Senator from Colorado and I support comprehensive \noverhaul, particularly as it relates to the collection of millions of \nphone records of law-abiding Americans, which has come to be known as \nmetadata. So we have supported restrictions on that in order to protect \nlaw-abiding Americans who have had their privacy intruded upon.\n  But having sat right next to the distinguished chair of the \nAppropriations Committee for many years--on the Intelligence Committee, \nand I think my friend from Colorado sits on the other side--we have \nheard Senator Mikulski speak eloquently about the need for transparency \nand accountability. My view is that this is something that can bring \ntogether all Senators around what really is a jump-start to the later \ndebates about intelligence reform.\n  Senator Udall and I, with the support of the chair of the \nAppropriations Committee Senator Mikulski have put together an \namendment and filed it today on this legislation which takes important \nsteps forward with respect to transparency. The amendment we have \noffered would require the executive branch to answer some of the major \nunanswered questions about domestic surveillance authorities and would \nrequire that future court opinions which find that domestic \nsurveillance activities have violated the law or the Constitution ought \nto be made public. They ought to be made public to the American people, \nand if there is some aspect that should be held back--what is called \nredaction--so be it. Under our proposal, the executive branch would \nhave the authority again to make sure that no details about secret \nintelligence methods or operations were in any way divulged as part of \nthis transparency effort.\n  While we feel strongly about protecting secret operations, we do not \nbelieve in secret law. The American people ought to always be able to \nfind out what the government and government officials think the law \nactually means. To use a basketball analogy--and folks at home know I \nam always fond of those--parts of the playbook for combating terrorism \nwill often need to be secret, but the rule book our government follows \nshould always be public. So this amendment presents a chance for \nSenators who may have differing views about surveillance policy to \nrally together behind the cause of greater transparency.\n  I would note at this time that Senator Mikulski has filed an \nadditional amendment that the Senator from Colorado and I have \ncosponsored. It would make the Director of the NSA a Senate-confirmed \nposition. This is a reform Senator Mikulski has been advocating for \nyears. I think this too allows us to have a more vigorous and more open \ndebate about these issues.\n  The reality is that the thousands of Americans who work in the \nintelligence field honor our Nation day in and day out with their \ndedication and their commitment to the security of our country. But, as \nthe Senator from Colorado has noted, too often in the past the \nleadership of the intelligence community has said one thing in private \nand another in public. If our amendment which we have put together with \nSenator Mikulski passes, there would be a new focus on transparency, \nand I think that would create some very serious obstacles to those who \nmight want to engage in the kinds of deceptions that the Senator from \nColorado noted and that we have seen in our hearings.\n  I yield back. And we will wrap up our colloquy shortly.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I thank Senator Wyden for his leadership and \nfor taking the time to join me on the floor. As the Senator pointed \nout, we have a broad coalition across both parties and across the \npolitical spectrum.\n  We also acknowledge that passing the Defense Authorization Act is \ncrucial. We have to keep our military strong in the face of limited \nresources and a security environment that is rapidly changing. That is \nwhy we are not offering a comprehensive bill today. But we will be \nback. We want to have a fulsome debate. This is a matter my \nconstituents have demanded that we address, and we are going to work to \nmake this happen.\n  I ask my colleague for any further thoughts he might have on this \nvery important matter because the Bill of Rights is our biggest, \nbaddest weapon. When we stand with the Bill of Rights, we can't go \nwrong.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague. First, let me just mention in \nclosing that this bill is directly relevant to work done at the \nDepartment of Defense, as the NSA is an integral part of the Department \nof Defense. In fact, this bill already contains half a dozen provisions \nthat affect the NSA in one way or another, so it has been our view that \nthis amendment is clearly germane to the bill.\n  It also directs the Comptroller General to conduct an assessment of \nthe economic impact of recently disclosed surveillance programs. The \nfact is that surveillance policy does not just affect foreign \nrelations--although clearly it does affect our foreign relations. We \nsee practically every day accounts of how our allies are concerned \nabout their relations with us because of questions with respect to \nwhether the privacy of their citizens are affected.\n  When we are talking about allies, we are talking about partnerships \nwe need to protect America in a dangerous world. Of course, at the same \ntime we are talking about how in a fragile economy, some of America's \nleading companies, those on the cutting edge of our future--for \nexample, with cloud technology that the distinguished Presiding Officer \nand I have talked about. This is an area where Americans have a big \nlead. We do not want to fritter it away, as we also suffer in terms of \nour national security, in terms of our relationships with allies. There \nare high stakes here. I am very hopeful we will have a chance to get a \nvote on this legislation.\n  As I say, with Senator Mikulski particularly, the role that she has \nplayed as chair of the Appropriations Committee, I think we have a \nchance to jump-start the broader debate about intelligence. We have a \nchance to set the record straight about some of the comments that the \nintelligence leadership has made in the past that are either wrong, \nmisleading or kind of shrouded in intelligence-speak. This is almost \nincomprehensible lingo that we try to sort through in terms of what \nthey have to say.\n  I am very hopeful the Senate will want to join Senator Udall, Senator \nMikulski, myself--I know Senator Blumenthal and others are interested \nin it--in taking the next logical, commonsense approach in terms of \nintelligence reform; that is, to come out\n\n[[Page S8348]]\n\nfoursquare for this approach, which I would like to state does not ban \nany collection tool at all that is now used by the government, but it \ndoes require that there be basic transparency and accountability in how \nthey are used.\n  (Mr. HEINRICH assumed the Chair.)\n  That is long overdue. Let me have my friend and colleague from \nColorado wrap up and express to him how much I appreciate it.\n  I note somehow the Presidency of the Senate seems to be passed from \none supporter of intelligence reform to another, since the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut was just there. We have just \nbeen joined by Senator Heinrich, who has been a very valuable partner \nin these efforts as well.\n  I thank him and allow the last word to be offered by the Senator from \nColorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Again, you cannot go wrong with transparency. \nTransparency is a central tenet of America. In that spirit, I wish to \nrecognize the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Blumenthal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues who led this \neffort. Well before I became involved, Senator Udall and Senator Wyden \nhave helped to lead this effort before there was any real disclosure \nabout some of the excesses that have been so dramatically revealed over \nthe recent past. As a colleague in this effort, I thank them for their \nrelentless courage in blowing the whistle, quite bluntly, telling \nAmerica there was something wrong, even when they could not reveal \nexactly what was wrong, saying the American people would be outraged if \nthey knew, if only they could be told. That kind of bravery and \nstrength has given energy and momentum to this debate.\n  I am chagrined that we will not be debating and acting on it in \nconnection with the National Defense Authorization Act if the present \ncircumstances prevail and amendments are limited. I do believe it is \npast time to be talking about and acting on those issues, to move for \ngreater accountability and transparency.\n  One of the amendments I have sponsored would call for a more \nadversarial process, to expose more of the truth before the judges who \nmake these decisions through the appointment of a constitutional \nadvocate.\n  The hour is late today. I hope at another time to talk about these \nissues in greater detail. But the time now is more urgent than ever to \nconfront and address these shortcomings in the present system. I think \nthe intelligence community itself will help us greatly and it has \nrecognized this and all of America will benefit greatly, including \ntheir work.\n  I salute the talented and dedicated members of that intelligence \ncommunity who have done their work literally in secret for so long, \nhelping to save Americans around the globe from terrorism and other \nthreats. I think we need to change the system in ways that are worthy \nof the challenges they confront everyday, while at the same time making \nsure we have trust and confidence in America, trust and confidence in \nthe system, trust and confidence in both the need for and the tools and \nweapons we use to further American intelligence in the combat against \nterrorism.\n  I again thank my two colleagues who are on the floor and tell them I \nlook forward to working with them in the next few days. If it is \npossible to achieve these reforms, so be it; if not, we will continue \nto work.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I thank the Senator from Connecticut and \nSenator from Oregon, the Presiding Officer who has been engaged in this \nand I know the Senator from Arizona who is here is interested in these \ndiscussions as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are now at the halfway point in the \ncountdown to the next budget deadline. By December 13 the budget \nconference committee has to report its plan for the remainder of this \nfiscal year 2014 and beyond. We are already 2\\1/2\\ months into the \nfiscal year. It is critical the conferees agree on funding government \nwithin the framework of the Budget Control Act.\n  As I have mentioned before on the Senate floor, the BCA, which places \ncaps on discretionary spending, has provided us with a necessary dose \nof fiscal discipline. While the BCA is not a silver bullet which fixes \nall of our problems, it represents $2 trillion in projected deficit \nsavings that improves the Nation's long-term fiscal outlook. Without \nit, Federal spending would go unchecked, allowing the deficits to be \neven higher.\n  In 2013 the deficit reached $680 billion; in 2014 it is estimated to \nbe $750 billion. Should Congress ignore the BCA, we will find ourselves \neven deeper in the red. In fact, some across the aisle have indicated \nthat they want to spend a whopping $91 billion more than the BCA \nmandates in 2014 alone.\n  Instead of offering smart spending cuts to eliminate waste and \nprioritize funds, many are compiling a list of their favorite tax hikes \nto replace the sequester. That action fails to recognize one simple \npoint, a point I made on the floor last weak and one I will make over \nand over. Washington has a spending problem, not a revenue problem. In \nfact, 2013 set a record for the most taxes ever collected, $2.77 \ntrillion. That is a 13-percent increase from 2012. Yet some of my \ncolleagues want taxpayers to shoulder the burden of their plans to \nincrease Federal spending.\n  While the BCA has proved to help moderate the Federal budget's hunger \nfor taxpayer dollars, make no mistake this budget is still bloated. \nAnyone who says there is nothing left to cut simply is not looking hard \nenough.\n  Last week I offered my suggestion for cutting waste at the Department \nof Agriculture. Just the programs I highlighted--and there are surely \nothers--would save $5 billion when compared with the President's \nbudget. Today I wish to share some similar fiscal follies at the \nDepartment of Energy.\n  The Department of Energy spends an astonishing amount of taxpayer \ndollars on industries and technologies that are already well \nestablished in the public marketplace. But few examples stand out more \nthan the agency's growing role in the automotive industry. Take the \nVehicle Technology Program which is slated to receive $575 million \nunder the President's 2014 budget. This program conducts research and \ndevelopment into seemingly every facet of vehicle manufacturing from \nhybrid technologies to engine efficiency to advanced lightweight \nmaterials. It even goes so far as to draw marketing strategies to \npromote consumer acceptance of products such as electric vehicles and \nrenewable fuels.\n  Is there anyone in America who does not know what an electric vehicle \nis or what it does? Yet we are supposed to spend money to improve \nconsumer acceptance for these products. The Vehicle Technologies \nProgram has also awarded hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to \nautomakers, including Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors. Since 2010, \nthe program has received $1.2 billion in taxpayer funds. Curiously, the \nVehicle Technology Program's official online listing of goals and \naccomplishments has not even been updated for 2010.\n  Another well-established industry benefiting from taxpayer largesse \nis wind energy. Read DOE's budget request which prominently highlights \nthe wind industry's ``great success in deploying planted-based \ntechnologies over the past 5 years.'' You may recall recently retired \nenergy Secretary Steven Chu's admission that he considers wind a \n``mature'' technology. Why then are we pumping money into a technology \nthat even DOE indicates should be able to stand on its own?\n  A recent Navigant Research study made headlines when it reported that \nthe United States is both the world's largest wind power market and \nhome to the world's No. 1 wind power supplier, General Electric. A \nrecent GAO report found that 82 Federal wind-related initiatives funded \nacross 9 agencies cost $2.9 billion in fiscal year 2011. This is for \nwhat we have been told is a mature technology.\n  What is more troubling than the sheer cost of the Federal \nGovernment's fragmented Wind Program is GAO's finding that more than 80 \npercent of those programs have overlapping characteristics. GAO's \nsubsequent recommendation seems reasonable enough; that the DOE should \nformally\n\n[[Page S8349]]\n\nassess and document whether Federal financial support of its \ninitiatives is actually needed. Yet the President's budget, released 1 \nmonth later, recommends an unprecedented level of $144 million for the \nDOE wind energy program, just in 2014.\n  Wind's windfall from DOE comes on the heels of yet another extension \nof the multibillion dollar wind production tax credit. This tax credit \nwas temporarily established more than two decades ago to encourage \ninvestment in the then-fledgling wind industry. This is two decades \nago. Congress gave energy a 7-year window to take advantage of and \nprepare for the expiration of the original PTC in 1999--given 7 years.\n  But to the surprise of no one, parochial interests and a host of \nextensions continue to keep this zombie subsidy from expiring as \ndesigned. Today, as the credit supporters repeat their plea for just 1 \nmore extension, they ignore America's debt-ridden reality and so the \nwalking dead wind production tax credit, which is little more than a \ntaxpayer-funded entitlement program, lives on. While I have singled out \nautomotive and wind programs at DOE, similar arguments could be made \nfor reducing or eliminating the Department's support for other \nestablished industries, including oil, natural gas, solar, and nuclear. \nMany of these programs are both unnecessary for further development of \nthese technologies and are blatantly duplicative.\n\n  In fact, another GAO study identified a mind-boggling 679 renewable \nenergy initiatives across 23 agencies in fiscal year 2010. Prominently \nfeatured in a report by my colleague from Oklahoma Senator Coburn, \nthese redundant programs cost $15 billion in 2010 alone.\n  Instead of continuing to pick winners and losers, Congress needs to \nreduce its footprint in well-established areas of the energy sector. \nNot only will this help level the playing field for emergency energy \ntechnologies that are actually preparing to compete in the marketplace, \nit would save taxpayers untold billions of dollars.\n  With just 1 month to go before the budget deadline, I urge my \ncolleagues to reject the urge to fixate on raising taxes and instead \nhelp focus negotiations on smart, achievable spending reductions. By \neliminating waste and prioritizing spending within the BCA framework, \nwe can shore up this country's fiscal future. Turning out the lights on \nwasteful programs at the Department of Energy would be a step in the \nright direction.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, all of us have been touched by this \ndread and pernicious disease. Alzheimer's strikes families, loved ones, \ncolleagues, coworkers, friends, acquaintances--literally all of us--\nincreasingly so because the numbers are multiplying almost epidemic-\nlike across the country. Of course, classifying it as an epidemic is \ndifficult to do because we scarcely understand this disease. We are \nonly beginning to comprehend the cause and modus operandi of this \npernicious ailment.\n  I am joining on these resolutions because of the need to express and \ncall attention to the deadly and insidious spread of Alzheimer's and \nthe Nation's failure to effectively address it. We know that the \nnumbers of people suffering from Alzheimer's are increasing drastically \nand this resolution rightly calls attention to the dimensions of the \nproblem. But as important as those numbers are, even more so are the \nnumbers of dollars that reflect the Nation's failure to take action \nthat is so desperately needed.\n  As my colleague from Maine highlighted earlier, we spend $500 million \nin research for Alzheimer's compared to $6 billion for cancer, $3 \nbillion for HIV, and $2 billion for cardiovascular efforts. These \nnumbers do not reflect any excess spending on cardiovascular or cancer \nor other kinds of medical problems for which the National Institutes of \nHealth does such great work, as well as others in the private sector, \nand philanthropic donations as well. If anything, perhaps we should be \nconsidering expanding those efforts. But the numbers do reflect the \ndisproportion and inadequacy of what we as a nation are spending on the \nresearch of Alzheimer's. The estimate, according to the National \nAlzheimer's Project Act and its representatives, is in the neighborhood \nof $2 billion a year, as a minimum, that we should be spending to \ndevelop diagnoses, cures, and treatment. We should be doubling or \ntripling funding. Yet even this minimal funding is in danger due to the \nsequester, which has also jeopardized many other research projects \nsupported by the National Institutes of Health. This abdication of \nresponsibility is a tragedy for us as a generation who will suffer from \nit in untold numbers, and for the next generation that could be saved \nfrom this disease.\n  I am proud to join in this effort to match the severity of the \nchallenge with public consciousness and awareness and, even more \nimportantly, public dollars and resources that are vitally important to \nensure we conquer and cure as many Alzheimer's patients as we can as \nquickly as possible. We owe it to ourselves and our children.\n  There are many ways in life to feel alone. There are many forms of \nisolation. Even in this body, surrounded by people, Members can be \nalone at points--alone in championing causes or alone in thought, but \nthere are few conditions that match the aloneness of an Alzheimer's \npatient. They are often cut off from the world by an inability to \ncommunicate, and we must reach out to those patients who cannot let us \nknow and describe, as they might want to do, their aloneness and their \nresolve.\n  So for them and all of our loved ones--friends, family, and \ncoworkers--who now and in the future will suffer from the disease, let \nus resolve to do more through this resolution, and as a nation we will \nconfront this challenge.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this has been a long process and a \ndifficult one for me to go through. Being the ranking member on the \nArmed Services Committee, I have had constant contact with both the \nDemocrats and Republicans on this bill. I consider this bill to be the \nmost important bill of the year, and I have said that several times. I \nhave given several speeches up here in the last week. I had about \ndecided with the last offer that was made by our side, which was to \ncome up with 50 amendments, limit it to 50 amendments, the argument \nthere is that would not be 50 votes. If you look at it historically--\nand I have the numbers going all the way back for the last 15 years--\nfor last year, for example, we had 106 amendments, and only 34 were \nvoice-voted and only 8 were recorded votes. So when we say 50, we are \nonly talking about probably 20. Now, of course, the Democrats would \nonly have 50 also.\n  So what I have decided I am going to do--because I have to decide \nwhat I am going to do with my vote--I am either going to vote for or \nagainst cloture on my own bill.\n  That would be very awkward for me to have to determine. But I have \ntried to get ahold of Senator Pat Toomey, who is kind of the lead \nperson on the steering committee and the one where most of the \namendments would come from, most of the objections have come\n\n[[Page S8350]]\n\nfrom. I have said: If you will pare that down from 50 to 25, then I am \nsure it would be reasonable for the Democrats to have 25. That is a \ntotal of 50. Probably it would end up being maybe 20 recorded votes if \nyou, our Republicans, are willing to bring that number down and say: \nYes, we will go forward with this bill if we can have 25--move it down \nfrom 50 to 25. Now, if we refuse to do that, I am going to go ahead and \nvote to support cloture and to support our bill.\n  On the other hand, if Senator Toomey and the rest of the Republicans \nsay: No, we want to have all 50--and I look at this list, and I see we \nhave some Members who have as many as 9, and I do not think that is \nbeing totally reasonable--so if they say: No, we are not going to bring \nour number down to 25, then I am going to support the bill. However, if \nthey do agree to bring it down--and I have already talked to the \nmajority side about this--and they refuse to come down to 25, then I \nwould join in opposing cloture on the bill when it comes up.\n  So I want to make sure there is no misunderstanding right now. I \nwould like to say that I could get ahold of everyone tonight. I have \ntried. They said at 7:30 they are going to make a decision. It is 7:29 \nnow, so I had to get on record. I do not have time.\n  I will repeat it one more time. If the Republicans refuse to bring \ntheir number down to 25, then I will go ahead and support the bill and \nsupport passage of the bill through cloture. If they do agree to do it \nand the Democratic side, the majority side, decides they are not going \nto accept the 25 offer, then I will oppose and vote against cloture on \nthe bill.\n  There you have it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it has been only a few short weeks since \nthe needless government shutdown that cost the Treasury more than $20 \nbillion, disrupted the lives of hundreds of thousands of Federal \nworkers and their families in every State, threatened to wreak havoc \nwith the world's financial markets, and accomplished nothing.\n  But an important deadline, one critical to determining how we resolve \nthe current budget crisis, is just a few days away. While this \napproaching deadline does not come with the threat of another \ngovernment shutdown, if Congress is going to complete work on \nappropriations bills before the continuing resolution expires on \nJanuary 15, we need a top-line number from the budget conferees by the \nend of this week.\n  By Friday, the budget conferees need to find enough common ground to \nagree on a level to fund the Federal Government for the remainder of \nthe fiscal year. While many have expressed their doubts, there is no \nreason this cannot be done. People are fed up with putting the process \nof setting and funding our national priorities on autopilot. It is an \nabdication of responsibility and a wasteful way to do business.\n  It is equally important that the level of funding replace \nsequestration. A long-term continuing resolution that funds the \ngovernment at the House level of $967 billion would be a disaster. \nSequestration would become the new normal, funding programs and \nagencies at levels far below those passed by the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee and below fiscal year 2013.\n  It is stunning--and frightening--that instead of looking to replace \nsequestration's devastating cuts, we hear from some Members that it is \n``working.'' If their intention is to stunt the economic recovery and \nindiscriminately slash services upon which American families and \nbusinesses depend, then I guess they are right. But I don't think most \nMembers of Congress, or most Americans, see it that way.\n  For those of us who want to support our communities and invigorate \nand sustain our economic recovery, another year of sequestration would \nbe catastrophic. While we are still trying to gauge the full impact of \nthe first round of cuts this year, one thing is clear--another year \nwould be far worse.\n  Agencies have exhausted their carryover funds and creative budgeting \noptions to avoid layoffs, furloughs, and eliminating programs.\n  Absent a budget agreement, the entire Federal Government, from the \nDepartment of Defense to the Department of Labor, will suffer \nsignificant, mindless cuts. I have spoken several times about the \nimpact of another full year continuing resolution at the House's \nfunding level.\n  I want to take a minute to describe what it would mean for America's \nchildren, teachers, and families. LIHEAP, which provides lifesaving \nhome energy assistance, would not receive the $325 million increase \nover the level included in a continuing resolution, cutting off \nassistance to about 760,000 more households this winter and next \nsummer. Nearly 40,000 Vermont families rely on LIHEAP in the cold \nVermont winters.\n  Early Head Start Programs won't be expanded as the Senate \nappropriations bill intended, and the 177,000 children who would have \nreceived Head Start services will be turned away. Nearly 1,600 Vermont \nchildren depend on this assistance every year.\n  Schools around the country already facing budget shortfalls look to \nthe Federal Government to fund services to disadvantaged children \nthrough title I grants. Those schools would not receive the $852 \nmillion included in the Senate appropriations bill. They would have to \nlook elsewhere for money to provide those services to 1.3 million \nstudents in need.\n  Schools would also lose $748 million in grants for special education \nthat were included in the Senate appropriations bill, to help cover the \ncosts of employing more than 9,000 additional special education aides \nin our schools.\n  NIH would not receive the $2 billion in additional funds included in \nthe Senate appropriations bill and instead would not be able to award \n1,300 new research grants. This means that 1,300 additional \nopportunities to achieve scientific advances that could lead to \nlifesaving treatments and cures would be missed opportunities.\n  Under a continuing resolution, 159,000 families looking for \nassistance through the section 8 housing program to help keep a roof \nover their heads will be turned away because the funding won't be \nthere. In Vermont, 774 families would face losing their housing \nassistance.\n\n[[Page S8351]]\n\n  The WIC Program won't be able to provide food to the nearly 500,000 \ninfants, children, and families the Senate appropriations bill would \nhelp, and working families won't receive the $291 million in additional \nfunding the Senate provides for childcare subsidies.\n  Beyond our borders, we would lose the additional $389 million \nincluded in the Senate appropriations bill for global health programs \nto combat HIV/AIDS and other preventable infectious diseases like \nmalaria, tuberculosis, and pneumonia, as well as malnutrition.\n  The consequences of such a cut can be measured in lives. Tens of \nthousands of additional deaths would result from these diseases, tens \nof thousands of additional children would be orphaned by AIDS, and \nthere would be millions fewer lifesaving immunizations for children, \nresulting in tens of thousands of deaths that could have been \nprevented.\n  A full-year continuing resolution would cut the international \ndevelopment assistance account that supports the basic needs of people \nin the poorest countries by nearly $115 million, including for primary \neducation, food security, and clean water and sanitation programs.\n  The examples go on and on. What we face is, in fact, not a hard \nchoice. It is a choice between doing what is right or scoring political \npoints. The budget conferees have an opportunity to reach meaningful \ncompromise, to replace the ``never supposed to happen'' sequester, and \nto prove to the American people that they can put partisanship aside \nwhen it is in the national interest.\n  That is what is at stake, and I commend the chairwoman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Mikulski, and her counterpart in the \nHouse, Chairman Rogers, for the united stand they have taken for the \ngood of the country. I hope the budget conferees follow their example.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/20/senate-section/article/S8351-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8351-S8352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ROBERT ROSSI\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is a great pleasure to tell the Senate \nabout Mr. Robert Rossi, a Vermonter who captures the distilled essence \nof Vermont, and who will be celebrating his 100th birthday this Friday, \nNovember 22, 2013. Mr. Rossi represents an inextricable link between \nwhere my State, and our country, was, and what it has become, over this \nmost remarkable century. Mr. Rossi was born and has always lived in \nBarre, VT, the same city where my father was born. Even while defending \nAmerica in Normandy, or honeymooning with his wife in New York City, \nhis home and his heart were always in Barre.\n  Mr. Rossi grew up in Barre and his father, like my maternal \ngrandparent, immigrated to the United States and Vermont from Italy. He \nwas a product of the Barre school system, and had a football \nscholarship to Green Mountain Junior College. Shortly after that he was \ncalled for service by the United States Army.\n  He arrived at Camp Edwards on Cape Cod the same day Pearl Harbor was \nattacked, and he then was stationed in Northern Ireland just before his \ndeparture to Normandy on that fateful day in the summer of 1944. When \nhe returned stateside, he did not dwell on his experiences abroad, but \nrather returned to his beloved home, where he was instrumental in one \nof Vermont's leading industries for nearly four decades of his life: \nthe Barre granite and stone carving industry. It has been estimated \nthat one-third of all public and private monuments in the United States \nwere crafted from or by Barre's quarries and its international \nassociation of sculptors and artisans. Mr. Rossi is a man of true \ncharacter, and it is my pleasure to call the Senate's attention to this \nnotable citizen of the Green Mountain State.\n  I join all Vermonters in offering my sincerest congratulations to \nRobert Rossi for his genuine lifetime of achievement. I would also like \nto share a recent article from the Rutland Herald and Times Argus that \ntold his remarkable story and captured many accolades about his \nillustrious life.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Rutland Herald, Nov. 18, 2013]\n\n          Robert Rossi, at 100, Has Always Known Where Home Is\n\n                           (By David Delcore)\n\n       Robert Rossi remembers Barre.\n       Sure the Granite City native, who is now days away from his \n     100th birthday, will tell you he spent two years at Green \n     Mountain Junior College in Poultney, 20 winters in Tucson, a \n     honeymoon in New York City, and a memorable World War II tour \n     that was highlighted by his mercifully belated arrival at \n     Omaha Beach during the Normandy Invasion. But, if you ask \n     Rossi where he has ``lived'' for the last 99 years, 360-plus \n     days, you'd better be ready for a one-word reply.\n       ``Barre,'' he said Sunday as if surprised by the question. \n     ``I've never lived anywhere else.''\n       Born on High Holburn Street, Rossi is the son of an \n     immigrant stonecutter who he'll proudly tell you was `` the \n     first alderman of Italian descent ever elected in Barre.'' \n     He'll also tell you that his dad, Antonio Rossi, was \n     influential in acquiring Barre's first fire engine.\n       Why?\n       Because while his dad died during the influenza outbreak in \n     1918, Rossi, who was five at the time, remembers the city's \n     old fire wagons.\n       ``They were pulled by horses,'' he said. ``I remember the \n     horses.''\n       Rossi also remembers the old city stables that were once \n     located on Burnham Meadow--not far from where Capital Candy \n     now does business. He remembers the city Cow Pasture, but not \n     just as the place where the city's workhorses spent some of \n     their spare time, or where folks now like walking dogs.\n       ``There used to be a nine-hole golf course there,'' he \n     said, crediting the Meadow Brook Golf Club for creating and \n     maintaining it.\n       Rossi, who has moved only twice in his life--from High \n     Holburn Street where he was born to the Cleary Street home \n     where he has lived, with occasional interruption, since he \n     was 12--is a product of Barre schools, though none of the \n     ones he attended are schools anymore.\n       Rossi started out at Ward 5, a now-vacant neighborhood \n     school that the High Holburn Street gang, which included a \n     boatload of the Rossi clan, fondly referred to as ``Woodchuck \n     Knoll School.'' Following the death of his dad, his mother's \n     remarriage and the move to Cleary Street, Rossi attended the \n     old Brook Street School, which is now home to the Learning \n     Together Center, for both fifth- and sixth-grades. He spent \n     seventh grade at the old North Barre School, which has since \n     been converted to apartments, and eighth grade in the ground-\n     floor of what used to be Spaulding High School, but is now \n     the Vermont History Center.\n       Rossi graduated from the original Spaulding High School in \n     1931, and while he would eventually head off to Green \n     Mountain Junior College thanks to a football scholarship that \n     limited his tuition payment to $100 a semester, the Great \n     Depression delayed the start of his post-secondary education \n     for a few years.\n       Rossi remembers the Depression, which hadn't yet ended when \n     he started taking classes in Poultney.\n       ``I remember getting letters from my mother with 25 cents \n     taped to them,'' he recalled.\n       A quarter went a long way back then, according to Rossi, \n     who remembers when cigarettes cost 10 cents a pack, you could \n     get a good ice cream bar for a nickel, and $20 was more than \n     enough to pay for a weekend in Montreal--food, lodging and \n     transportation included.\n       Rossi also remembers getting drafted, though he prefers the \n     old-school term ``conscripted.'' He was `` 27 and single'' at \n     the time, it was 1940 and he was a whole lot closer to going \n     to war than he realized at the time.\n       Rossi remembers the day Pearl Harbor was bombed, and not \n     just because it was the very same day he arrived at Camp \n     Edwards on Cape Cod fresh from Fort Devens.\n       ``That's when we knew we were going to war,'' he said.\n       Rossi was right, though his overseas tour didn't start \n     until after a trip through officer training school and a \n     brief stint at Camp McCoy in Wisconsin.\n       From there it was off to Northern Ireland, where in the \n     run-up to D-day and the invasion of Normandy in the summer of \n     1944, Rossi, a second lieutenant in the Army, remembers \n     getting a pass to go to London. That's where he spotted a \n     street sign that reminded him of home and tracking down his \n     brother, an Air Force pilot, to borrow a little spending \n     money.\n       ``The sign said: High Holburn Street,''' said Rossi, who \n     recalls finding his brother, Antonio, between air raids.\n       According to Rossi, his brother's commander was Jimmy \n     Stewart.\n       ``The actor,'' he said.\n       Asked about Omaha Beach, Rossi said he didn't need to check \n     a history book to know it didn't go according to script.\n       The date was delayed, his platoon was divided, and while \n     one of the landing crafts made it to shore, the propeller on \n     the one he was on was fouled by rope floating in the debris \n     just off the coast of France.\n       Frogmen were summoned to ``un-jam'' the propeller of a \n     craft that sat ``becalmed'' for four hours.\n       Rossi remembers eventually making it to shore, though it \n     wasn't until the next day that his platoon was reunited and \n     he learned that all of the officers in that first wave were \n     either killed or injured.\n       ``I guess I was lucky,'' he said.\n       Rather than dwell on the experience Rossi turned his \n     attention back to Barre, where he\n\n[[Page S8352]]\n\n     spent 39 years working in the granite industry as a shipper, \n     a boxer and an expediter.\n       Rossi prefers to remember Barre.\n       It's where he once played quarterback for the Spaulding \n     football team, sipped Seal's soda, ordered western sandwiches \n     at the New Moon Diner, and played pool in Merlo's pool room.\n       It's also where he met his wife, Beverly Silver, a South \n     Barre schoolteacher with whom he happily spent more than \n     half-a-century before she died in 2004.\n       ``We had a good life,'' said Rossi, who is still living \n     his.\n       Technically Rossi will turn 100 on Friday, but, he said, he \n     recently celebrated the milestone at a lunch with family at \n     the Cornerstone Pub & Kitchen.\n       It was the latest in a long line of Barre memories for a \n     man who wouldn't think of living anywhere else.\n       ``Barre is home,'' he said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/20/senate-section/article/S8352-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO NANCY KASSEBAUM\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I read with interest an article this week \npenned by the senior Senator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski, about a dear \nfriend, Senator Nancy Kassebaum. Amidst the partisan gridlock of \ntoday's Congress, it is hard to remember a time when Members from both \nsides of the aisle routinely came together for the common good, rather \nthan for the sake of political ideology. As a daughter of a public \nservant, Nancy Kassebaum had civic duty in her blood and represented \nthe State of Kansas for nearly two decades. During her time in the \nSenate, Nancy's leadership, and determination to fight for those who \nneeded it most, was exemplary.\n  Her ability to put politics aside and work across the aisle has had a \nlasting impact on millions of women and children today. Nancy became \nthe first woman to serve as Chair of the Senate Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources. Here she worked to create the Office of Women's Health \nResearch within the National Institutes of Health, and she fought \ntirelessly alongside Senator Ted Kennedy to protect abused and \nneglected children. Nancy was an invaluable resource as chair of the \nSubcommittee on African Affairs, and a strong champion condemning the \napartheid atrocities during Nelson Mandela's incarceration. Nancy \nKassebaum exemplified the determination and leadership it takes to make \na remarkable legislator and I am equally proud to call her my friend.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Politico article, ``Friendship \nwithout Ideology'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows\n\n                     [From Politico, Nov. 13, 2013]\n\n                      Friendship Without Ideology\n\n                         (By Barbara Mikulski)\n\n       (The following essay is part of a series in which dozens of \n     women will reveal what women they most admire. The series is \n     part of ``Women Rule,'' a unique effort this fall by \n     POLITICO, Google and The Tory Burch Foundation exploring how \n     women are leading change in politics, policy and their \n     communities.)\n       Few senators have left such a mark on the Senate as Nancy \n     Kassebaum. She was a dedicated and determined public servant \n     who always put people above politics. In the decade we served \n     together, I saw her advocate every day for her home state of \n     Kansas--whether it was in the committees or on the Senate \n     floor.\n       When I was first elected to represent Maryland in the \n     Senate, I was the only Democratic woman and Nancy was the \n     only Republican woman to serve in that chamber. In those \n     days, because there were so few of us, there was pressure for \n     us to act like celebrities instead of senators. Not only did \n     Nancy resist that pressure--it didn't even cross her mind.\n       Nancy accomplished tremendous things in her years as a \n     senator. But it wasn't just what she did, it's how she did \n     it. When I became a senator, she was so welcoming to me, \n     offering tips and insights in my early days navigating the \n     Senate. It's a tradition I have tried to honor as Dean of the \n     Senate Women, where I mentor and advise women who currently \n     serve as senators.\n       She was an inspiration, teacher, mentor and good friend--\n     and she still is.\n       The daughter of the governor from Kansas, Nancy came from a \n     family of public servants. In her first campaign, she used \n     the slogan, ``A fresh face, a trusted Kansas name.'' Yet \n     Nancy was a trailblazer in her own right, and a woman of many \n     firsts. She is the first woman to have represented Kansas in \n     the Senate; the first woman to have chaired a full \n     committee--the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, \n     where we served together. We always agreed that it wasn't \n     about gender--it was about having an agenda.\n       She was independent minded. But she always voted with her \n     principles, and Kansas, first.\n       Nancy was an important leader in foreign affairs. As chair \n     of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on African Affairs, her \n     expertise in African affairs was significant. In the mid-\n     1990s, with Nelson Mandela confined in jail, she was an early \n     and outspoken supporter of anti-apartheid measures in South \n     Africa. Above all, she advocated peace around the world, once \n     saying, ``Hatred and anger can destroy a nation, but they \n     cannot build a just and prosperous one.'' Her poignant words \n     still ring true today.\n       Yet while she was working to make the world a better place, \n     she never strayed from home.\n       As chair of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human \n     Resources, Nancy championed American families and children. I \n     loved working with Nancy on that committee, alongside \n     legislative legends like Sen. Ted Kennedy. As a social \n     worker, I was proud to serve as partners to make life better \n     for so many. We fought to protect abused and neglected \n     children, to increase the availability of child care for low-\n     income families and to preserve child care health and safety \n     standards. Because of her work, our most vulnerable \n     Americans--our children--are safer and healthier. And for \n     millions more, Nancy brought improved access to better health \n     care with the bipartisan Kennedy-Kassebaum Act in 1996. \n     Whatever the bill, she always offered pragmatic, affordable \n     solutions to pressing problems that affect American families. \n     I was proud to join her on many of those issues.\n       Together, we fought for groundbreaking research to help \n     understand devastating diseases. We founded the Office of \n     Women's Health Research at the National Institutes of Health, \n     so women could be included in medical research. It led to the \n     historic study on hormone treatment for women, which led to a \n     drop in breast cancer rates by 15 percent. Since then, the \n     Office of Women's Health Research has continued to publish \n     vital findings--on everything from symptoms of heart attacks \n     to the likelihood of osteoporosis. I'm proud to know that the \n     work Nancy and I did together has helped save lives, millions \n     at a time.\n       Nancy considered every vote with intellect and integrity. \n     She showed that a woman with voice and volition could be \n     formidable. Above all, she won the heart of Kansans as their \n     down-to-earth, but determined senator.\n       In 1996, she won the heart of Sen. Howard Baker as well. I \n     was delighted to be at her wedding to Howard, where Kennedy \n     and I joined them on the dance floor for the ``Bipartisan \n     Boogie.''\n       At one time, a Kansas newspaper claimed, ``the only thing \n     more popular than Nancy is wheat.'' For Nancy, it was never \n     about being first. It was about serving the people. And \n     Kansas couldn't have asked for anyone better.\n       (Barbara Mikulski is a Democratic senator from Maryland, \n     chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee and Dean of the \n     Senate Women.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/20/senate-section/article/S8352-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8352-S8353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PETER MILLER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for generations, Vermonters have \ncontributed to our national culture, through art, music, film and \nprose. Peter Miller is one such artist whose impressive work throughout \nhis life as both a photographer and author has showcased Vermont and \nits residents and enriching us all.\n  As an amateur photographer, I have followed Peter's work for decades \nwith admiration. From his early beginnings as a U.S. Army photographer \nto his travels across Europe with Yousuf Karsh, he has channeled his \npassion and energy into a remarkable art. Over the past 20 years, his \nunique ability to capture the Vermont spirit has been well documented \nand his consistent approach to producing authentic depictions of the \nVermont way of life is unparalleled. He shuns the commercialization of \nart and instead creates his work solely to share and promote the values \nof our small and community-based State. This attitude was evident more \nthan ever when, being honored as the Burlington Free Press ``Vermonter \nof the Year'' in 2006 for his book ``Vermont Gathering Places,'' he \nfrankly said ``I don't shoot for galleries. I shoot for myself and the \npeople I photograph.''\n  His appreciation and respect for the traditional culture that defines \nVermont is readily evident in his work. He has photographed farm-dotted \nlandscapes, village communities, and generations of Vermont families. \nWhen writing the forward to his 2003 book ``Vermont People,'' I noted \nthat ``the Vermont faces in this book speak worlds about living in the \nState that gave them character, wrinkles and wisdom . . . through their \nfaces, you can see Vermont.'' Peter's most recent work, ``A Lifetime of \nVermont People,'' is another testament to his tenacity and tact as a \nVermonter. A product of over a year's worth of photography, \nfundraising, and self-publishing, this\n\n[[Page S8353]]\n\nbook is truly a labor of love. His addition of background stories helps \nprovide greater insight and meaning to the photographs included and \nthrough his photography and the recent addition of writing to his \nrepertoire, he gives a face, and a voice, to Vermonters.\n  Peter lives the lifestyle he captures in his photography. A Vermonter \nfor over five decades, he has embraced the way of life that makes the \nState so special. Like his black and white photographs that draw focus \nsquarely on the subject of the piece, rather than relying on flashy \ncolors to convey a message, he is not interested in glitz and glam. His \nbooks have themes that exemplify Vermont: farm women, gathering places, \nsmall communities. He laments the waning of iconic farms, the erosion \nof small town values, and the fading of the once impermeable Vermont \nway of life. His resiliency is remarkable and his uncanny ability to \ndisplay the beauty of Vermont in a way words cannot do justice serves \nas an inspiration for photographers everywhere. I ask unanimous consent \nthat an article in the VT Digger that highlights the lifetime of \naccomplishments of this extraordinary man be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From VT Digger, Nov. 10, 2013]\n\nIn This State: For photographer Peter Miller, a Wonderful Life in Black \n               and White, and a Future Colored with Gray\n\n       Photographer Peter Miller has spent a lifetime seeing the \n     world in black and white while portraying it in all its \n     colors, both with his pictures and writing.\n       It's a mysterious gift that has blessed him with a \n     distinguished, adventurous career that spans close to 60 \n     years. His latest book, ``A Lifetime of Vermont People,'' is \n     a 208-page paean to the art of black and white portraiture, \n     capturing not only remarkable faces and places, but through \n     sheer passage of time, vanished landscapes and passing eras \n     in the Green Mountains.\n       Published in June, the cloth-bound coffee-table book and \n     its impeccably printed photos should be the capstone of his \n     illustrious life. But as he wanders closer to the threshold \n     of 80, Miller acutely feels part of a vanishing era himself, \n     his view of the world not unlike an old snapshot: a bit faded \n     and worn, its luster dimmed by the years.\n       After putting his heart and soul and significant money into \n     his latest book, he honestly admits he's at loose ends: \n     filled with ideas, beset with projects left to do, wondering \n     how he's going to find energy to do them, let alone pay for \n     them. ``Lifetime,'' for all its striking portraits, just \n     about killed him. It sapped his strength, and if you talk \n     with him a while, you sense, some of his spirit.\n       ``Sitting behind that computer for a year, seven days a \n     week, finished me. I had a lot of stress. I put on weight. My \n     right leg swelled up because I was in the same position, and \n     I could hardly walk,'' he says. He also had to raise the \n     money to self-publish and print 2,500 copies of the book, \n     using his own funds and a Kickstarter campaign.\n       ``I ended up with $2,000 to my name, and I said to myself, \n     `I'm getting awfully close to the edge','' he says.\n       Having put some distance between the book's release and \n     having sold around 1,000 copies, he can now breathe a little \n     easier and look back on the past 18 months with a sense of \n     perspective.\n       ``I'm not depressed about life,'' he says, but there's no \n     doubt he feels things have changed in ways he doesn't like \n     and doesn't respect--Ben & Jerry's, gentrification, Stowe-\n     style luxe tourism and massive trophy houses are ripe topics, \n     for starters.\n       In looking askance at change, Miller is not unlike many \n     others whose life trajectory has spanned 79 years. But it \n     seems particularly poignant irony that after six decades of \n     exceptional artistry, painting lives in film and then digital \n     pixels, he's come to feel as much a historical artifact as \n     his portrait subjects--trappers, farmers, hunters, lawmakers, \n     auctioneers, iconic Vermonters all--who have now passed on.\n       What chafes most is that his old life, where you could make \n     a living as a ``stock'' photographer selling your work, is no \n     longer possible. People tell him his photos are in calendars \n     and are even used as screensavers in Russia, yet he never \n     sees a penny. He is miffed at markets that have vanished. \n     Recalling an interview request with the Associated Press, he \n     told them, ``I don't know if I want to talk to you people, \n     all you do is steal stuff.''\n       It's tempting to wield the label curmudgeon after talking \n     with Miller, but if you listen a little harder, more likely \n     words like honest, opinionated, frustrated and baffled come \n     to mind.\n       ``All these things are being taken, and frankly, I don't \n     know how to make a living,'' he explains.\n       He was raised in Weston, where his passion for photography \n     blossomed in 1950 as a 17-year-old, when he started capturing \n     the way of life he saw around him. After school at Burr & \n     Burton and college in Toronto, he became a carefree U.S. Army \n     photographer, footloose in Paris with a 35mm Leica, a \n     Rolleiflex twin-lens camera, and a young man's energy and \n     budding sharp eye. Then came travels across Europe in the \n     mid-1950s as the set-up man for famed Canadian photographer \n     Yousuf Karsh, meeting people like Pablo Casals, Picasso, Pope \n     John XXIII, Christian Dior, and Albert Schweitzer, soaking up \n     culture and the good life with food and wine.\n       Wanting to write, he then had a dream stint as a reporter \n     for Life magazine, but disliked the constraints of corporate \n     life--he's kind of a ``loner,'' he admits--and struck out on \n     his own path. It took him all over Vermont and America, \n     producing acclaimed books such as ``People of the Great \n     Plains,'' and ``Vermont People,'' which was rejected by 13 \n     publishers. So he took a radical, then almost unheard of step \n     and self-published it in 1990. It eventually sold 15,000 \n     copies.\n       His ``Lifetime of Vermont People'' expands on the idea, \n     with 211 photos and 60 profiles of ordinary and extraordinary \n     Vermonters.\n       Why use black and white?\n       ``I think you can get inside a person more in black and \n     white,'' he explains, saying it's more abstract. and not \n     having a color background distracts less. His talent in \n     distilling the essence of a person in a photo is something \n     that he still doesn't completely understand, along with where \n     his ``drive'' and persistence comes from. He does know he \n     doesn't just shoot, but ``visits'' with people, putting them \n     at ease, which is something he learned from his mentor, \n     Karsh.\n       ``I don't quite understand the whole process,'' he admits, \n     calling it ``something magical.'' Miller is gracious and full \n     of tales as he ambles about the second floor of his pale \n     yellow, rambling, much-bigger-than-he-needs and way-too-\n     trafficked house. It's in Colbyville, a Route 100 hamlet \n     swallowed up and masticated into something indistinguishable \n     by the voracious maw of tourism development at the I-89 \n     interchange in Waterbury. What got lost animates ``Nothing \n     Hardly Every Happens in Colbyville, Vermont,'' a book of \n     essays that riffs with trenchant humor on bird hunting, \n     tourism and life before and after the Ben & Jerry's ice cream \n     theme park up the street.\n       The smell of smoke from two wood stoves permeates the \n     slope-roofed rooms as he shows a visitor around his house, \n     its walls rich with photos he's taken and art--especially \n     paintings and sculptures of woodcock, a bird he loves to \n     hunt. Are they good to eat? Oh yes, wonderful, he says.\n       With a ruddy square face younger than his years, a still-\n     full mop of white hair and small round eyeglasses that gives \n     him a look of constant curiosity, Miller moves more \n     cautiously than the vigorous outdoorsman he once was.\n       ``I went out bird hunting yesterday,'' he says. ``I was \n     slow, man. I wasn't too stable in the woods.''\n       A self-admitted ``loner'' with two daughters (in England \n     and Peru) from a former marriage, he lives by himself moving \n     between an airy studio, a bedroom, small office, living room \n     and kitchen. Downstairs is a little-visited gallery and \n     sparsely heated shipping room stacked with boxes that hold \n     just under 1,400 copies of his latest book.\n       ``I hope to sell a lot over Christmas,'' he says, noting he \n     still has a living to make. Despite the ordeal of his last \n     book, he has more he wants to do, like an exhibit or book of \n     photos he took in the 1950s of Margaux, France, in the famed \n     Bordeaux wine region.\n       That period, that landscape, he says, ``is completely gone \n     now.'' But he wonders if he can find the time and energy and \n     if there is a market for the photos. After a lifetime of \n     black and white, life seems to offer only a lot of gray \n     areas.\n       ``I don't know what I am anymore,'' he says.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/20/senate-section/article/S8353-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8353-S8354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ROGER SANT\n\n  Mr. REED.

Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate a great \npublic servant from my home State, the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Dennis \n``Pat'' Wooton has devoted his life to service--service of his country \nin the Vietnam war, service of schoolchildren as a teacher in the \nBuckhorn school system, service of his State as Congressman Hal \nRogers's field representative, and now service of his hometown of \nBuckhorn as the city's newly appointed mayor.\n  Mayor Wooton was born 66 years ago in the same Kentucky town he now \nserves. After graduating from Buckhorn High School in 1963, he worked \nhis way through Berea College, graduating in January of 1968.\n  In the same year of his graduation from Berea, Mr. Wooton was drafted \ninto the U.S. Army and began his basic training at Fort Knox. After \ncompleting infantry training at Fort Polk, LA, he was assigned to the \n1/5 Mechanized Infantry, 25th Infantry Division. Mr. Wooton bravely \nserved his country in Vietnam from November 1968 to January 1970. A \nlitany of medals and citations, including the highly revered Bronze \nStar, serve as testaments to his distinguished service.\n  Mayor Wooton returned from Vietnam in January 1970, but this did not \nmark the end of his military service. In 1976 he joined the Army \nReserves, where he served as a drill sergeant until 1987.\n  Before reenlisting to train the next generation of American soldiers, \nMr. Wooton returned to his alma mater in 1970 to teach the next \ngeneration of Buckhorn High School students. Over the next three \ndecades he became a Buckhorn institution, serving as the school's \nprincipal for 14 years and being inducted into the Kentucky High School \nBaseball Coaches Hall of Fame. He retired in 2000 after 32 years of \ndedicated service.\n  But retirement from Buckhorn High School did not mean retirement from \na life of service. In the intervening 13 years, Mayor Wooton continued \nto add to his already impressive record of public service. This \nincludes his election as Perry County sheriff, a post he served in from \n2003 to 2006. Following his stint as sheriff, he served as Congressman \nHal Rogers's eastern Kentucky field representative from 2007 until \nApril 2013. All of this in addition to his long list of volunteer \nactivities which include, but are not limited to, training the Buckhorn \nVolunteer Fire Department and serving on the Governor's Smart Growth \nTask Force.\n  Now, Mr. Wooton has found yet another way to serve his community. \nAppointed as mayor of Buckhorn by the city council in June 2013, Mayor \nWooton is already hard at work to better the lives of Buckhorn \nresidents. In his first year, he is set his sights on expanding \nBuckhorn's water lines in an effort to remedy the city's water supply \nproblems.\n  Pat Wooton's lifetime of service to his country, Commonwealth, and \ncommunity embodies our great Kentucky motto, ``United we stand, divided \nwe fall.'' I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in recognizing an \nexemplary citizen.\n  The Hazard Herald recently published an article highlighting Pat's \nappointment as mayor of Buckhorn. I ask unanimous consent that the full \narticle be printed the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From The Hazard Herald, June 11, 2013]\n\n              City Council Appoints New Mayor in Buckhorn\n\n                           (By Chris Ritchie)\n\n       Buckhorn--A new mayor has taken office in the city of \n     Buckhorn.\n       It was last month when former Mayor Veda Wooton opted to \n     resign as the city's mayor, a position which she had held for \n     several years. Her vacancy was filled when the council voted \n     to appoint her husband, Pat Wooton, who was elected to the \n     council last year, as the new mayor. Veda Wooton, \n     subsequently, was expected to be appointed to the council \n     during a special-called meeting this week.\n       Mayor Pat Wooton, who most recently served as a field \n     representative for Congressman Hal Rogers and also served a \n     term as Perry County's sheriff from 2002 to 2006, noted the \n     city essentially exists as a water company to provide service \n     to area residents. But there are other projects he expects to \n     continue working on while in office, including one which will \n     extend waterlines in the area.\n       The Kentucky Division of Abandoned Mine Lands has approved \n     funding for one waterline project at Cams Branch, Wooton \n     said, while also approving the extension of new lines to \n     serve a few more homes on Otter Creek Road. Buckhorn, which \n     in the 2010 census recorded a population of 163 people, \n     purchases water from the city of Hazard to supply its system.\n       The city, in conjunction with the fiscal court, has also \n     taken what Wooton described as the ``first few small steps'' \n     in what ultimately could be a 10-year project to build a \n     water treatment plant at Buckhorn Lake. The plant, he said, \n     would have to be a regional facility that could serve the \n     surrounding area, including parts of other counties such as \n     Breathitt and Clay.\n       An engineering company is currently working on a study for \n     the project, and if the\n\n[[Page S8355]]\n\n     plant is eventually constructed it would play a role in \n     alleviating issues that Wooton said exist with potential \n     water supply issues in eastern Kentucky.\n       ``In the work that I've done, that's one of the things I \n     came to notice real soon,'' he said. ``We're on the cusp of a \n     water supply problem in our region.''\n       Though Wooton reiterated that this project remains in the \n     very early stages, he envisions a treatment plant that could \n     hook into other systems that could in turn supply areas in \n     times of emergency, such as one Buckhorn experienced in 2010 \n     when a waterline break shut down service in the area for over \n     a week.\n       ``We need to get all of our systems linked together, \n     because sooner or later everybody has some kind of problem \n     and will need supplies, at least for a while,'' he said.\n       Also in conjunction with the fiscal court, the city is \n     working on a horse trail that would begin at the new Eagles \n     Landing campground in Gays Creek and wind along the lake to \n     the lodge, and perhaps with further development tie in with a \n     trail in nearby Leslie County. Wooton said plans are being \n     drafted, and he expects a company working on the project to \n     give the council a progress report at their next regular \n     meeting.\n       ``We think that will be a nice addition to the area,'' he \n     said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/20/senate-section/article/S8355-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8355-S8357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOMINATION OBJECTION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, I am announcing my intention to \nobject to any unanimous consent request to call up and confirm the \nnomination of Mr. Jeh Johnson to be the Secretary of the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  As ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I, along with \nother Senators on the committee, wrote a letter to Mr. Johnson last \nFriday and asked his views on a number of important matters, including \nour Nation's immigration policies and the fair treatment of \nwhistleblowers. We asked if he would cooperate with us on oversight \nmatters and work with us to improve immigration policies going forward. \nWe have not yet received a response from Mr. Johnson.\n  Because the Judiciary Committee has primary responsibility over \nimmigration matters, it is necessary to know any nominee's position on \nimmigration policies before we can consent to the confirmation of a \nSecretary to head this very critical department. So, until we receive \nresponses from Mr. Johnson to our letter, I will object to any \nunanimous consent agreement to move his confirmation.\n  I ask that a copy of the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 15, 2013.\n     Mr. Jeh Johnson,\n     2001 K Street NW.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Johnson: As members of the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, we have an important responsibility to conduct \n     oversight of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which \n     has a broad and critical mission and houses several different \n     agencies with varying functions. Our committee has primary \n     responsibility over immigration matters, and we believe it \n     necessary to know any nominee's position on immigration \n     policies before we can consent to the confirmation of a \n     Secretary to head this very critical department We also seek \n     your commitment in cooperating on oversight matters and \n     working with us to improve immigration policies going \n     forward.\n       At your confirmation hearing, you stated that, ``[i]f \n     confirmed, I will work to implement all legislation enacted \n     into law.'' While we may have different views than President \n     Obama on how to reform our immigration system, we have all \n     repeatedly expressed our strong disapproval of the refusal of \n     this administration--and DHS in particular--to enforce our \n     immigration laws, contradicting duly enacted federal law \n     through administrative orders and internal memoranda. These \n     actions have eroded the rule of law and undermined Americans' \n     confidence in their government. We hope that you will commit \n     to discontinuing these lawless policies if confirmed.\n       So that we may properly carry out our constitutional duty, \n     we request that you provide answers to the questions below on \n     the important issues that you will confront if confirmed as \n     Secretary of DHS.\n\n                                General\n\n       1. In what ways, if any, would you depart from former \n     Secretary Napolitano's policies?\n       2. Do you find any of former Secretary Napolitano's \n     actions, or any current DHS policies, to be objectionable? If \n     so, what? What would you do differently?\n       3. Will you pledge to cooperate with congressional \n     oversight efforts and be responsive to all congressional \n     requests for information in a timely manner?\n       4. Do you believe whistleblowers who know of problems with \n     matters of national security should be prevented from \n     bringing that information to Congress?\n       5. Will you commit to ensuring that every whistleblower is \n     treated fairly and that those who retaliate against \n     whistleblowers are held accountable?\n       6. Given your past involvement in President Obama's \n     political campaigns, how would you maintain your independence \n     from the White House as one of our nation's top law \n     enforcement officers?\n\n                              Immigration\n\n       1. If confirmed as the head of the Department, you will be \n     responsible for the enforcement of the country's immigration \n     laws. Do you have any background or leadership experience in \n     the area of immigration law or immigration policy?\n       2. If confirmed, it will be your job to implement our \n     nation's immigration laws. In your testimony before the \n     Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, \n     you stated that you support ``comprehensive, common-sense \n     immigration reform.'' Accordingly, we would like to know your \n     position regarding the following:\n       a. Should people here illegally be eligible for immigration \n     benefits, including legal status? If so, should those \n     individuals be responsible for all costs associated with it? \n     Should taxpayers shoulder any of the burden?\n       b. Should people here illegally who are in removal \n     proceedings be eligible for immigration benefits, including \n     legal status?\n       c. Should people who are subject to an order of removal \n     from the United States by the Department of Homeland Security \n     be eligible for immigration benefits, including legal status?\n       d. Should an illegal immigrant convicted of a felony \n     criminal offense be eligible for immigration benefits, \n     including legal status?\n       e. Should an illegal immigrant convicted of multiple \n     misdemeanors be eligible for immigration benefits, including \n     legal status?\n       f. Should illegal immigrant gang members be eligible for \n     immigration benefits, including legal status?\n       g. If an illegal immigrant provides information in an \n     application that is law enforcement sensitive or criminal in \n     nature, should that information be used by our government and \n     not be protected under confidentiality provisions? If an \n     illegal immigrant provides information in an application that \n     clearly renders him ineligible and commits a serious crime \n     that would warrant his immediate removal, shouldn't the \n     government be able to use that information to place him in \n     removal proceedings?\n       h. Should people here illegally be required to submit to an \n     in-person interview with adjudicators when applying for \n     immigration benefits, including legal status?\n       i. Should people here illegally that have been denied legal \n     status be placed in immigration proceedings and removed? If \n     not, why not?\n       j. If the Secretary of Homeland Security must revoke a visa \n     for someone on U.S. soil, should that decision be reviewable \n     in the U.S. courts?\n       k. In 1996, after the 1993 World Trade Center attack, \n     Congress mandated that the immigration service, with \n     cooperation from schools and universities, collect \n     information on foreign students. This system took years to \n     get up and running. In fact, it still wasn't in place on 9/\n     11. While it is operational today, there is still work to be \n     done to make that system effective. Most recently, the \n     Department stopped all efforts to upgrade the system. Do you \n     intend to make SEVIS upgrades a priority, if confirmed?\n       3. As a result of some of the actions of Secretary \n     Napolitano, particularly her Directive entitled ``Exercising \n     Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came \n     to the United States as Children,'' several ICE agents, \n     including the President of the ICE agents and officers union, \n     the National ICE Council, Chris Crane, filed a complaint \n     against Secretary Napolitano stating that ``the Directive \n     commands ICE officers to violate federal law . . . violate \n     their oaths to uphold and support federal law, violates the \n     Administrative Procedure Act, unconstitutionally usurps and \n     encroaches upon the legislative powers of Congress, as \n     defined in Article I of the United States Constitution, and \n     violates the obligation of the executive branch to faithfully \n     execute the law, as required by Article II, Section 3, of the \n     United States Constitution.'' Moreover, Kenneth Palinkas, the \n     president of the National Citizenship and Immigration \n     Services Council, has likewise charged that USCIS employees \n     are required by the agency ``to grant immigration benefits to \n     those who, under law, are not properly eligible.'' In short, \n     her actions have caused a great deal of discontent among \n     immigration officers and agents, to say the least. \n     Accordingly, if confirmed, what will you do to improve the \n     morale of immigration officers and agents who are concerned \n     about these non-enforcement protocols issued by Secretary \n     Napolitano?\n       4. In the more than four years that she served as Secretary \n     of the DHS, Secretary Napolitano never agreed to meet with \n     the National ICE Council, the union that represents more than \n     7,000 agency employees, or the National Citizenship and \n     Immigration Services Council, the union that represents \n     12,000 agency employees. Will you meet with representatives \n     from these unions and, if so, when?\n       5. During the first five years of the Obama administration, \n     Secretary Napolitano and former ICE Director John Morton \n     issued numerous policy memoranda that order ICE\n\n[[Page S8356]]\n\n     agents to restrict their enforcement of immigration laws to \n     illegal immigrants who have been convicted of violent crimes. \n     If confirmed, will you continue that policy?\n       6. Do you agree that a person who is in the United States \n     in violation of U.S. immigration law is subject to removal?\n       7. Among the aforementioned memoranda issued by former ICE \n     Director Morton, the memo dated March 2, 2011, designates \n     immigration fugitives as a priority for removal. Do you agree \n     that illegal immigrants who ignore deportation orders should \n     be removed from the United States?\n       8. Among the aforementioned memoranda issued by former ICE \n     Director Morton, the memo dated November 17, 2011, identifies \n     an illegal immigrant with a conviction for drunk driving as a \n     priority for removal. Do you agree that an illegal immigrant \n     who has been convicted of a drunk driving offense should be \n     removed from the United States?\n       9. All federal employees take an Oath, codified at 5 U.S.C. \n     3331, to ``support and defend the Constitution of the United \n     States . . . and that [they] will well and faithfully \n     discharge the duties of the office on which [they] about to \n     enter.'' How can an employee fulfill his or her oath if such \n     an employee is threatened with reprisal for executing the \n     laws enacted by Congress to which they are entrusted to \n     administer, and for not complying with an administratively-\n     created command to the contrary?\n       10. In June 2012, Secretary Napolitano issued a memorandum \n     ordering the implementation of the Deferred Action for \n     Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n       a. If confirmed, will you continue this program?\n       b. Do you believe that the President has the legal \n     authority to expand DACA through executive, regulatory or \n     policy prerogatives?\n       11. Do you believe that the issuance of prosecutorial \n     discretion directives, such as those mentioned above, is \n     within the legal authority of the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security?\n       12. Since Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001), Congress \n     has attempted to pass legislation that would amend the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act to authorize DHS to detain \n     criminal aliens beyond six months. Would you support such \n     legislation?\n       13. In September 2011, Secretary Napolitano suspended the \n     Border Patrol's practice of routinely screening mass \n     transportation vehicles and transportation hubs near U.S. \n     borders, which prompted a strong objection by the National \n     Border Patrol Council. If confirmed, would you reverse this \n     policy? If not, why?\n       14. Beginning in 2010, DHS has included in its statistics \n     for ICE removals the number of illegal immigrants apprehended \n     by the Border Patrol and then transferred to ICE for \n     processing. Do you support this policy?\n       15. In January 2012, the DHS Inspector General released a \n     report criticizing USCIS for pressuring its employees to \n     rubberstamp applications for immigration benefits. In that \n     report, nearly 25 percent of USCIS officers surveyed said \n     supervisors had pressured them to approve applications that \n     should have been denied.\n       a. Do you believe that current USCIS screening procedures \n     are sufficient to prevent fraud and threats to public safety \n     and national security?\n       b. If confirmed, would you change these policies? If so, \n     how?\n       c. Will you commit to ensuring that USCIS background checks \n     for every applicant for immigration benefits are properly and \n     effectively conducted?\n       d. Should employee performance evaluations at USCIS be \n     linked to the number of applicants for benefits approved, or \n     adjudicated?\n       16. Recently, the U.S. arrested a legal immigrant in \n     Illinois who had been convicted and served ten years in an \n     Israeli prison for her role in two terrorist bombings. \n     According to press reports, she was able to obtain both a \n     green card (in 1995) and citizenship (in 2004) by simply \n     omitting her conviction on her applications. She continued to \n     live in the U.S. for years despite the fact that the \n     conviction was public knowledge. Are you confident that the \n     current processes for screening applicants for immigration \n     benefits are able to identify and keep out criminals and \n     individuals who pose a threat to national security?\n       17. Some have argued that immigration judges should be \n     granted broad discretion to allow an illegal immigrant who \n     should be removed from the country to stay by waiving current \n     bars to admission and removal grounds for numerous crimes \n     (such as drug crimes, firearms offenses, domestic violence, \n     fraud, high speed flight at a checkpoint, and crimes \n     involving moral turpitude) if the judge finds that the \n     illegal immigrant's removal will cause hardship to a citizen \n     or lawful permanent resident or if the judge believes it is \n     in the public interest. Do you agree with this approach? If \n     so, please explain why and specifically, whether you believe \n     current immigration law is too harsh with respect to illegal \n     immigrants who engage in this type of criminal conduct.\n       18. On December 21, 2012, ICE announced that it decided not \n     to renew any of its agreements with state and local law \n     enforcement agencies that operate task forces under the \n     287(g) program, stating that ``other enforcement programs, \n     including Secure Communities are more efficient use of \n     resources.'' However, Secure Communities serves a completely \n     separate and distinct function. The 287(g) program trains \n     local officers to determine whether an individual is lawfully \n     present, including those with no prior contact with \n     immigration services. Secure Communities allows local law \n     enforcement to identify illegal immigrants only after they \n     have been booked into jail and if their fingerprints are \n     already in immigration databases. Moreover, ICE's own website \n     touts the 287(g) program as ``one of ICE's top partnership \n     initiatives.'' The website used to advertise the success of \n     the program: ``Since January 2006, the 287(g) program is \n     credited with identifying more than 304,678 potentially \n     removable aliens--mostly at local jails.'' Such statistics \n     appear to have since been removed. If confirmed, will you \n     commit to enter into 287(g) agreements with a qualified \n     requesting state or local jurisdiction?\n       19. After being criticized by certain special-interest \n     groups, the administration essentially halted all worksite \n     enforcement actions. According to the non-partisan \n     Congressional Research Service, in 2011, worksite enforcement \n     actions resulted in the arrest of 1,471 illegal workers out \n     of an estimated 8 million--.0001 percent. In the same year, \n     only 385 employers out of 6 million were fined for hiring \n     illegal workers. If confirmed, will you commit to reinstating \n     worksite enforcement, including enforcing immigration law \n     with respect to illegal alien employees?\n       20. If confirmed, what specific measures will you implement \n     to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security is in \n     compliance with all legal requirements of the Secure Fence \n     Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-367)?\n       21. In 2010, Secretary Napolitano suspended our nation's \n     only comprehensive border security measurement, known as the \n     operational control metric. More than three years have \n     passed, and the Department of Homeland Security has failed to \n     replace this metric. If confirmed, would you hold your \n     department accountable by regularly releasing a comprehensive \n     border security metric that measures the percentage of \n     illegal border crossers that escape apprehension by the \n     Department of Homeland Security?\n       22. Do you believe that the Department of Homeland Security \n     has the ability to achieve operational control of every \n     sector of our Southern border? If confirmed, would you commit \n     your department to achieving this standard?\n       23. Do you support the transfer of unused and unarmed \n     Department of Defense assets, such as detection and \n     communications equipment, to the Southern border in order to \n     help DHS achieve operational control of every sector of the \n     Southern border?\n       24. Our Southern border ports of entry are outdated and in \n     a state of disrepair--harming legitimate trade and travel, \n     while making our nation more vulnerable to sophisticated \n     criminal and terrorist organizations. If confirmed, what \n     specific measures would you take to revitalize and improve \n     security at our Southern border ports of entry?\n       25. Do you support making E-Verify permanent and mandatory \n     for all employers?\n       26. Serious national security issues have come to light in \n     recent months with respect to the EB-5 Regional Center \n     program, which allows foreign nationals to obtain a green \n     card if they invest in the United States.\n       a. Do you concur that more needs to be done to reduce \n     national security risks and to prevent fraud and abuse in the \n     program?\n       b. Do you have any plans to administratively improve the \n     program?\n       c. Will you make it a priority if you are confirmed?\n       27. DHS currently receives a portion of funds from each H-\n     1B visa application and provides these funds to USCIS for \n     fraud and abuse prevention efforts. However, ICE has a \n     responsibility to prosecute the cases but does not receive \n     any of these funds. Will you\n       28. Oversight conducted by the Judiciary Committee has \n     revealed that DHS is not enforcing the law prohibiting the \n     admission into the country of those who would be a public \n     charge. This has been confirmed by ICE and USCIS officers and \n     data on both admissions and removals. Oversight also \n     discovered a number of administration activities, including \n     advertisements in immigration materials and at foreign \n     embassies, encouraging foreign nationals to use federal \n     welfare programs. Can you please describe, in detail, how you \n     would restore vigorous enforcement of the public charge law \n     to protect taxpayers, including what efforts you would \n     undertake to reduce noncitizen enrollment in means-tested \n     welfare programs? Please be specific in your answer.\n       29. Dating back to 1996, Congress has mandated in six \n     statutes that a biometric entry-exit system be implemented. \n     In 2012, Rebecca Gambler, GAO's Director of Homeland Security \n     and Justice Issues, testified before the Judiciary Committee \n     that ``DHS faces challenges in identifying overstays due to \n     its general reliance on biographic entry and exit \n     information, rather than biometric information, hindering \n     DHS's efforts to reliably identify overstays. . . . Without \n     [biometric] exit capability, DHS cannot ensure the integrity \n     of the immigration system by identifying and removing those \n     people who have overstayed their original period of \n     admission--a stated goal of US-VISIT.'' For precisely that \n     reason, a biometric--and not a biographic--exit system must \n     be implemented to achieve real border security. Secretary \n     Napolitano refused to implement such a system, variously \n     claiming it was too expensive and/or that the technology did \n     not exist. However, an internal 2009 DHS report found \n     conclusively that biometric exit is effective and efficient, \n     and current data from industry demonstrates that the \n     technology is affordable.\n\n[[Page S8357]]\n\n       a. Do you disagree with GAO or that a biometric exit system \n     must be implemented to ensure real border security?\n       b. Do you acknowledge that federal law requires DHS to \n     implement a biometric entry- exit system?\n       c. If confirmed, will you commit to implementing this \n     system within one year?\n       We appreciate your pledge of ``transparency and candor with \n     Congress,'' and look forward to your prompt response.\n           Sincerely,\n     Chuck Grassley.\n     Jeff Sessions.\n     Michael S.

BYRD\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, today I wish to observe the birthday of \none of the greatest Americans to grace these Chambers--Cornelius Calvin \nSale Jr., better known to us--and to history--as Robert C. Byrd of West \nVirginia.\n  Robert C. Byrd was born Cornelius Calvin Sale Jr. in North \nWilkesboro, NC. He was 10 months old when his mother died from flu, and \nhe was adopted by his aunt and uncle, Titus and Vlurma Byrd. They \nchanged his name to Robert Carlyle Byrd and raised him in the coal-\nmining Appalachian region of West Virginia.\n  And in the 150 years of West Virginia's history, our State has had no \ngreater advocate than Robert C. Byrd. Many in the Senate today served \nwith Robert C. Byrd, and they can bear witness to the fact that the \nSenate, like the State of West Virginia, also had no greater advocate \nthan Robert C. Byrd. Today would have been the Senator's 96th birthday, \nand every day since his passing in 2010, the people of West Virginia \nfeel the loss of this great man.\n  The Senate also feels his loss because no one knew the Senate--its \nhistory, its traditions, its precedents--better than Robert C. Byrd.\n  He made it a point to meet with every new Senator and to impress upon \nthem the fact that they were to be caretakers of this institution--an \ninstitution he regarded as both the morning star and the evening star \nof the American constitutional constellation. He also impressed upon \nthem that they did not serve ``under'' any president, but that as a \nseparate but equal branch of the government, they served ``with'' \npresidents, acting as a check on the executive's power. When he passed \naway, he was the longest serving member of Congress in our Nation's \nhistory and, as such, served with 11 Presidents.\n  In his long life, Robert C. Byrd had three great loves--his wife \n``fair'' Erma, as he called her; the State of West Virginia; and the \nUnited States Senate. But he also had a great passion for the document \nfrom which the Senate and this great country sprang--the U.S. \nConstitution. I have always thought that is why he kept a copy of the \nConstitution in his coat pocket--it was easy to reach for quick \nreference, but in his coat pocket, it also was close to his heart. Even \nthough he could recite most of it by memory, he consulted his dog-eared \ncopy of the Constitution often and without hesitation. In its words, he \noften said, he always found wisdom, truth and excitement--the same \nexcitement he felt as a boy in Wolf Creek Hollow, WV, reading by \nkerosene lamp about the heroes of the American Revolution and the birth \nof our Nation. And those words guided him every day of the 58 years he \nspent in Washington as a member of Congress and as a Senator.\n  Robert C. Byrd cast more than 18,500 votes in the Senate--a record \nthat will never be equaled. Whether he voted with others or against \nthem, it was never hard ideology with Robert C. Byrd. He had no use for \nnarrow partisanship that trades on attack and values only victory.\n  Any time Robert C. Byrd spoke, the Senate came to a halt and Senators \non both sides of the aisle leaned forward--to listen and to learn.\n  He ran for public office 15 times--and he never lost. He was first \nelected to the West Virginia legislature in 1946 and then was elected \nto three consecutive terms in the U.S. House of Representatives before \nhis election to the Senate. He was a keen observer of politics--he \nadvised more than one Presidential candidate to go to West Virginia, \n``get a little coal dust'' on their hands and ``live in spirit with the \nworking people.''\n  He was deeply proud of West Virginia and its people. He proudly \ndefended his work to invest Federal dollars in his State.\n  He breathed new life into many communities with funding for highways, \nhospitals, universities, research institutes, scholarships and \nhousing--giving West Virginians the opportunities he himself never had.\n  Robert C. Byrd's journey was, in many ways, America's journey. He \ncame of age in an America segregated by race, which he eventually said \nwas one of our country's greatest mistakes. And, as did America itself, \nhe repented and made amends.\n  The moments that define the lives of most men are few. Not so with \nRobert C. Byrd. He devoted his life to his beloved Erma and his family \nand to public service. He was a major figure in the great panorama of \nAmerican history for more than half a century. His devotion to the \nSenate and his colleagues was unequaled. His mastery of Senate rules \nand parliamentary procedures was legendary. And his contributions to \nWest Virginia and to this Nation were monumental. He was a true giant \nof the Senate. He is as much a part of this Chamber as these 100 \nhistoric desks, these galleries, and these busts of Senate presidents.\n  Robert C. Byrd revered the Senate and the Senate revered Robert C. \nByrd. It is for this reason that I wish to observe the anniversary of \nthe birth of a great West Virginian and great American--Robert Carlyle \nByrd.\n  May God bless his memory and his great spirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/20/senate-section/article/S8357-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, with the Thanksgiving holiday, November is \na time for many of us to enjoy time with our loved ones and reflect on \nour futures together. With so many family gatherings, many retirement \nexperts also encourage us to use this time to talk with family about \nour long-term needs.\n  In addition to thinking about financial needs for retirement, it is \nimportant to also address our health as we age. According to the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, an individual turning 65 today \nhas almost a 70 percent chance of needing long-term care in the future, \nand 1 in 5 will need long-term care for more than 5 years. \nConversations about long-term care and advance care planning can be \nunderstandably difficult, but they are necessary to ensure our loved \nones receive the care they want if they are no longer able to speak for \nthemselves.\n  Thinking about long-term care means recognizing the invaluable--but \ntoo often unrecognized--contributions made daily by family caregivers. \nOver 65 million Americans provide $450 billion worth of unpaid care \nevery year, twice as much as homecare and nursing home services \ncombined, and these numbers are increasing. More than one-half of \nfamily caregivers perform intensive activities such as bathing, \nfeeding, and medication management. However, these services often come \nwith a cost to the caregiver, such as financial burdens and a toll on \nphysical and mental health.\n  As the chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, I want to help \nmiddle-class families struggling to provide necessary care for their \nloved ones. This year, the committee has examined the importance of \nadvance care planning as well as why a majority of Americans have done \nlittle to no planning for future long-term care needs. Next month, we \nwill continue this series of hearings by looking at expert \nrecommendations for reforming our long-term care system. Lastly, \nSenator Baldwin and I penned a column in recognition of the critical \nneed to address the long-term care inadequacies in this country, and I \nask unanimous consent that a copy be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n\n[[Page S8358]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort. As our Nation \ncontinues to grow older, this problem will continue to grow worse, and \nthe current system must change to meet these needs.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From The Hill, Oct. 29, 2013]\n\n       Time Has Come To Address the Challenges of Long-term Care\n\n                (By Sens. Bill Nelson and Tammy Baldwin)\n\n       As Congress embarks on a new venture to create a bipartisan \n     budget that would strengthen the economic security of \n     families and reduce the deficit without shortchanging our \n     future, it's our hope that both parties will also work \n     together to find viable ways to help families pay for long-\n     term care.\n       With the aging of the baby boomers, our country finds \n     itself in the midst of one of the most dramatic demographic \n     shifts in our history. And, as the aging population grows, so \n     too will the long-term-care needs of many in our society.\n       Providing assistance to family members who can no longer \n     care for themselves can be taxing for all involved.\n       In fact, the Senate Special Committee on Aging held a \n     hearing last month to examine a myriad of challenges facing \n     seniors today, and found many were unprepared.\n       So, later this year, we're going to hold another hearing to \n     see what we can do to help. Some of the things we're going to \n     look at include the possibility of expanding Medicare to \n     cover long-term care, and other various ways to possibly make \n     private long-term care coverage more affordable for those who \n     need it.\n       Currently, about 12 million Americans have long-term-care \n     needs--a number that's rising rapidly. While most receive \n     care from family and friends, an increasing number depend on \n     costly in-home care or end up in assisted living facilities \n     or nursing homes, where the median annual costs range from \n     $40,000 to $80,000, respectively.\n       Most middle-class families in this country simply can't \n     afford the expense of providing long-term care for a loved \n     one. And there are few viable options available to help them \n     pay for the services they would need. Medicare and most \n     traditional health insurance plans don't cover long-term-care \n     expenses. And while private long-term-care insurance is \n     available, most people don't have it because they see long-\n     term care as something they'll never need.\n       In fact, according to a recent study from the SCAN \n     Foundation, most Americans have done little or nothing to \n     prepare for their future long-term-care needs. This is \n     despite research that shows that 70 percent of people 65 or \n     older will eventually need some form of assistance.\n       Clearly, our current system of providing long-term care is \n     unsustainable. And, that's why we shouldn't wait much longer \n     to address it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/20/senate-section/article/S8358-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, with November being National Adoption \nMonth and this Saturday being National Adoption Day, I would like to \ntake a moment to highlight the issue of adoption--an issue that is near \nand dear to my heart. Earlier this month Senator Landrieu and I \nintroduced our annual National Adoption Day and Month Resolution which \nwas agreed to on November 13 by unanimous consent.\n  The importance of family in the growth and development of a child can \nnever be overstated. There are millions of children worldwide who are \ngrowing up without the love and support of a family. It is my hope that \nthrough National Adoption Day and our work on the Congressional \nCoalition on Adoption, we can one day make the dream of every child \nhaving a permanent and loving family a reality.\n  Like Senator Landrieu, I have seen first-hand the many blessings that \ncome from the adoption of a child. My daughter Molly adopted my \ngranddaughter, Zegita Marie, from an orphanage in Ethiopia. Z-girl, as \nI like to call her, is such a smart and confident young girl and I know \nit is because of the support and love of her family she is able to \nthrive. More so, Z-girl has been a huge blessing to our family and one \nthat I am forever grateful for.\n  National Adoption Month is about recognizing those who have made the \nsacrifices to make a child's life better, and encouraging those who are \nthinking about adopting to take that step and make a real difference in \na child's life. In that spirit, I want to take a moment to recognize a \nyoung woman that has taken the step to be a difference in a child's \nlife. As many of my colleagues know, each October the Congressional \nCoalition on Adoption Institute hosts its annual Angels in Adoption \nGala here in Washington. Every year Senators and Representatives \nnominate an individual or a family who has made a significant \ndifference in the area of adoption and foster care, and I have had the \nhonor of nominating individuals from my home State of Oklahoma. \nUnfortunately, circumstances did not allow my nominee, Kate Arnold of \nOklahoma City, to come to the event, so I would like to take a moment \nto recognize her and share her wonderful story.\n  In 2003, Kate Arnold was volunteering at a San Francisco Bay Area \nhome for teenage mothers when she met Miriam, a mother to 2 boys. Over \nthe course of years Kate developed a relationship with Miriam, her \nboys, and a daughter born during that time. Kate became a constant \npresence in their lives, frequently taking the children out for the day \nor overnight, while Miriam struggled to care for them.\n  In March of 2011, Child Protective Services removed Miriam's children \nfrom her care and over the next several months Miriam continued her \nstruggle with addiction. In October of that year, a social worker asked \nher to name who her children should go to if she lost them permanently. \nMiriam named Kate.\n  At the time Kate was here in D.C. attending Georgetown University \nSchool of Medicine. However, she did not let that stop her and \nimmediately petitioned Georgetown for the ability to complete her \nfourth year of medical school in California so that she could become \nthe children's foster parent and begin adoption proceedings.\n  In July 2012, Kate returned to California and by August the children \nwere living with her. This year she graduated from Georgetown and the \nfamily moved to Oklahoma City so Kate could begin her residency at the \nUniversity of Oklahoma.\n  Kate reflects the spirit of National Adoption Month and Day, not only \nin her decision to foster and adopt Miriam's children but also through \nyears of prior work and commitment to the foster care community. Kate \nis a great example of what one person can do to become a blessing to \nthe millions of children throughout the world that are in need of a \nfamily. I hope that others will join Senator Landrieu and myself this \nmonth of November and recognize the great need that exists for families \nto open their arms to children, both here in the United States and \nabroad, and take the leap of faith that will change a child's life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/20/senate-section/article/S8358-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8358-S8359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JON E.

Zufelt for his exceptional contributions to the \nNation as he retires after 30 years of service in the U.S. Army Corps \nof Engineers. Dr. Zufelt's dedication as a civil engineer with the U.S. \nArmy Engineer Research and Development Center's Cold Regions Research \nand Engineering Laboratory has resulted in the transfer of knowledge on \na global scale.\n  As a research hydraulic engineer, Dr. Zufelt's career focused on \nsolving tough problems in cold regions hydraulics and hydrology, ice \njam processes, erosion and bank protection, ice mitigation, permafrost \ndynamics, seasonal water quality issues, environmental remediation, and \nArctic coastal processes affecting military lands. Dr. Zufelt spent his \nentire 30-year career with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, \nculminating in the management of the Anchorage Office of the Cold \nRegions Research and Engineering Laboratory, primarily in support of \nprojects in Alaska.\n  Dr. Zufelt came to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in April of 1983 \nas a civil engineer working in Vicksburg, MS.

Mr. President, so many of our Nation's small \nbusinesses started with nothing more than an idea and the determination \nto see that idea grow; to see a need and fill it. From a small backyard \nor garage, small businesses can become the providers of a local \nsolution. From humble beginnings, companies grow and expand to reach \nnew customers and broader regions. I rise today to recognize WestOne \nLogistics, a small business in my home State of Idaho that has quickly \ngrown from that small, family business into one of the region's leading \nproviders of third-party relocation services.\n  Founded 8 years ago by Kendra Keim, WestOne Logistics saw the need \nfor highly efficient and reliable logistical services in our region and \nhas striven to provide superior service to local companies. A woman-\nowned, family-run business, WestOne Logistics is a third-party \nlogistics provider that works with companies to provide part or all of \ntheir supply chain management and relocation. This company exemplifies \nthe problem solving and can-do attitude so characteristic of Idaho's \nsmall business culture. The team at WestOne Logistics, through \nefficiency and customization, continues to grow and expand their \nservices. Even through the depths of this recent economic recession, \nthe team at WestOne Logistics has seen an incredible increase in \nbusiness, growing over 200 percent in revenues in the past 5 years. It \nis encouraging to see this level of growth in the small businesses of \nmy home State, despite the tumultuous economic landscape.\n  With an eye for specifics and adaptability for new, specialized \nproducts, WestOne Logistics is able to accommodate environment \nsensitive products in the largest common warehouse in the State of \nIdaho. Their facilities offer 108,000 square feet of secured, fully \nsprinkled, climate-controlled space with an additional 70,000 square \nfeet of food-grade warehouse storage space.\n  Not only is this team dedicated to hard work and quality in their \ncompany but they also are active in their community and are always \nlooking for ways to give back. For example, 22 of their 35 total \nemployees are Red Cross ``ready when the time comes'' certified in \norder to respond to local crises through a corporate partnership \nprogram.\n  WestOne Logistics is another prime example of the hard work and \ndedication of the small businesses of my home State. It is imperative \nto our national economy that businesses such as these continue to grow \nand thrive. I congratulate the team at WestOne Logistics on their \nsuccess and wish them the best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/20/senate-section/article/S8359-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:11 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hanrahan, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nhas passed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1545.

    \n\n[Page S8365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. KAINE:\n  S. 1742. A bill to temporarily suspend the collection of entrance \nfees at units of the National Park System and the National Wildlife \nRefuge System; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, Ken Burns, paraphrasing Wallace Stegner, \ncalled the national parks ``America's best idea.'' This is true not \njust for the intrinsic value of these lands, but also for the economic \nimpact on rural communities across the country. Countless small \nbusiness owners rely on outdoor recreational visitors for their \nlivelihood.\n  Unfortunately, last month's government shutdown caused the visitors \nto stop. For 16 days this year, at the peak of the fall color season \nrestaurants and hotels were empty. Roadside stands had no passers-by. \nCanoes and kayaks, hiking maps, and bait-and-tackle sat unsold on store \nshelves. One of my favorite places in Virginia, Chincoteague National \nWildlife Refuge, saw not one but two major events cancelled: the \nreopening ceremony of the historic Assateague Lighthouse and the \nChincoteague wild pony roundup. These events usually draw thousands of \nvisitors. The pony roundup, in particular, also serves as a fundraiser \nfor the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company. Unlike park rangers, the \nlocal businesses that rely on visitors got no backpay.\n  That is why I am introducing this legislation to suspend entrance \nfees at national parks and wildlife refuges for a period of 16 days, \nequal to the duration of the shutdown. The fee suspension leads up to \nNational Park Week in April 2014. This will encourage more visitors to \nturn out to the parks and give area establishments time to publicize \nthe free days and to drum up more business. The bill is deficit-\nneutral, and considering the breadth of the national park presence \nacross the nation, I hope it will garner bipartisan support.\n  We must negotiate a workable path forward on the federal budget so \nthat the American people are never again caught up in the middle of \nbattles in Washington. No act of Congress can reimburse the hard-\nworking business men and women around the nation who got hit by the \nshutdown, but I believe this bill will nudge a few more vacationers out \nof town to take in the natural beauty of our country and support the \nlocal economies while they're at it. Given the attention that national \nparks got during the shutdown, I also believe the American people \ndeserve a larger conversation about the importance of maintaining our \nnatural resources for future generations. I hope this bill will spur \nthat discussion.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. \n        Whitehouse):\n  S. 1747. A bill to provide for the extension of certain unemployment \nbenefits, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Emergency \nUnemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2013 to ensure that 1.3 \nmillion unemployed Americans, including 4,900 Rhode Islanders, will not \nlose unemployment insurance at the end of the year.\n  Unemployment insurance, UI, is a vital lifeline for individuals and \nthe economy. It provides a temporary weekly benefit t5o those who are \nlooking for work and were laid off through no fault of their own.\n  Economists across the spectrum agree that maintaining unemployment \ninsurance will grow our economy, spur consumer demand, and help \nbusinesses, States, and job seekers. Alternatively, according to the \nEconomic Policy Institute, the failure to renew UI could cost our \neconomy 310,000 jobs in 2014.\n  Extending unemployment insurance is a key part of keeping our economy \nmoving forward. Indeed, continuing UI is part of a broad range of pro-\ngrowth and pro-jobs policies we should be enacting. I am pleased to be \njoined in this effort by Senators Stabenow, Harkin, and Whitehouse, and \nI urge our colleagues to join us in cosponsoring and pressing for \naction on this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/20/senate-section/article/S8365-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 302--DESIGNATING DECEMBER 1, 2013, AS ``DRIVE SAFER \n                                SUNDAY''\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON (for himself, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Pryor, and Ms. Collins) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

and\n       (4) strives to--\n       (A) double the amount of funding the United States spends \n     on Alzheimer's research in fiscal year 2015; and\n       (B) develop a plan for fiscal years 2016 through 2019 to \n     meet the target of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's \n     Research, Care, and Services for the United States to spend \n     $2,000,000,000 each year on Alzheimer's research.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be here on the \nSenate floor with my friend and colleague from Minnesota Senator \nKlobuchar as we submit an important resolution.\n  This month is National Alzheimer's Awareness Month. Alzheimer's is a \nterrible disease that exacts a tremendous personal and economic toll on \nboth the individual and the family. As have many families, mine has \nexperienced the pain of Alzheimer's. I know there is no more helpless \nfeeling than to watch the progression of this devastating disease. It \nis equally painful to witness the emotional and physical damage \ninflicted on family caregivers exhausted by an endless series of 36-\nhour days.\n  Moreover, Alzheimer's disease is the only cause of death among the \ntop 10 in our Nation without a way to prevent it, to cure it, or even \nto slow its progression. More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's \ndisease--more than double the number in 1980. Based on current \nprojections, as many as 16 million Americans over the age of 65 will \nhave Alzheimer's by the year 2050.\n  In addition to the tremendous human suffering it causes, Alzheimer's \ncosts the United States more than $200 billion a year, including $142 \nbillion in costs to the Medicare and Medicaid Programs. This price tag \nwill increase exponentially as the baby boom generation ages. If we \nfail to change the current trajectory of Alzheimer's disease, our \ncountry will not only face a mounting public health crisis but an \neconomic one as well. If nothing is done to slow or stop this disease, \nthe Alzheimer's Association estimates that Alzheimer's will cost our \ncountry an astonishing $20 trillion over the next 40 years.\n  It is estimated that nearly one in two baby boomers reaching the age \nof 85 will develop Alzheimer's. As a consequence, chances are the \nmembers of the baby boom generation will either be spending their \ngolden years suffering from Alzheimer's or caring for someone who has \nit. In many ways, Alzheimer's has become the defining disease of this \ngeneration.\n  If we are to prevent Alzheimer's from becoming the defining disease \nof the next generation, it is imperative that we dramatically increase \nour investment in Alzheimer's disease research. According to a study \ncommissioned by the National Institute on Aging, Alzheimer's and other \ndementias cost the United States more than cancer and heart disease. \nThis study finds that both the costs and number of people with dementia \nwill more than double within 30 years--skyrocketing at a rate that \nrarely occurs with a chronic disease.\n  At a time when the cost to Medicare and Medicaid of caring for \nAlzheimer's patients exceeds $140 billion a year, we are spending only \nslightly more than $500 million on Alzheimer's research. We are \nspending $142 billion under Medicare and Medicaid, more than $200 \nbillion overall, and yet only $500 million on research. We currently \nspend $6 billion a year for cancer research, $3 billion a year for \nresearch on HIV/AIDS, and $2 billion for cardiovascular research. And I \nwish to emphasize that those are always worthy investments--investments \nthat have paid dividends in terms of better treatments, cures, and in \nsome cases prolonged lives. Surely we can do more for Alzheimer's given \nthe tremendous human and economic price of this devastating disease.\n  The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease was authorized by a \nbipartisan law passed in 2010 called the National Alzheimer's Project \nAct, which I authored with then-Senator Evan Bayh.\n  The national plan has as its primary goal to ``prevent and \neffectively treat Alzheimer's disease by 2025.'' The chairman of the \nAdvisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services, which was \ncreated by the National Alzheimer's Project Act, has testified before \nCongress that the United States must devote at least $2 billion a year \nto Alzheimer's research to achieve that goal.\n  I am therefore joining with my colleague from Minnesota Senator \nKlobuchar in submitting this resolution declaring that the goal of \npreventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's by 2025 is an urgent \nnational priority. Our resolution recognizes that dramatic increases in \nresearch funding are necessary to meet that goal and resolves that the \nSenate will strive to double the amount of funding the United States \nspends on Alzheimer's research in fiscal year 2015 and then develop a \nplan to meet the target of $2 billion a year over the next 5 years.\n  Just think of the figures. We are spending some $212 billion a year \ntreating, caring for people with Alzheimer's.\n\n[[Page S8367]]\n\nAll we are asking is that over the next 5 years we achieve the goal \nthat the Alzheimer's Council--a council of experts in Alzheimer's--\nincluding experts from the Mayo Clinic in Senator Klobuchar's home \nState, have recommended that we spend $2 billion. Mr. President, $2 \nbillion is such a tiny percentage of the amount we are spending.\n  So this is a worthy investment. It is one that will not only relieve \nsuffering, save lives, potentially, but it will also more than pay for \nitself.\n  I urge our colleagues to join us as cosponsors.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters from the Alzheimer's Association \nand the UsAgainstAlzheimer's group--both predominant national advocacy \ngroups endorsing our resolution--be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Alzheimer's Association,\n\n                                                November 19, 2013.\n     Senator Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Senator Amy Klobuchar,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins and Senator Klobuchar: On behalf of \n     the Alzheimer's Association and its nationwide network of \n     advocates, thank you for your continued leadership on issues \n     and legislation important to Americans with Alzheimer's and \n     their caregivers. The Alzheimer's Association proudly \n     endorses your most recent Alzheimer's resolution, which \n     supports the goals of the National Plan to Address \n     Alzheimer's Disease and increased funding for Alzheimer's \n     research at the National Institutes of Health.\n       The Alzheimer's Association is the world's leading \n     voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care, support \n     and research. Our mission is to eliminate Alzheimer's disease \n     and other dementias through the advancement of research; to \n     provide and enhance care and support for all affected; and to \n     reduce the risk of dementia through the promotion of brain \n     health. Our vision is a world without Alzheimer's.\n       As two of our nation's strongest voices on behalf of \n     Americans living with Alzheimer's, you know that more than 5 \n     million Americans are living with the disease, and without \n     significant action, as many as 16 million Americans will have \n     Alzheimer's by 2050. A recent study funded by the National \n     Institutes of Health and published in the New England Journal \n     of Medicine further confirmed that Alzheimer's disease is the \n     most expensive disease in America. Additionally, as the baby \n     boomer generation ages, one in eight will develop \n     Alzheimer's. This explosive growth will cause Alzheimer's \n     costs to Medicare and Medicaid to increase from $142 billion \n     today to more than $800 billion in 2050 (in today's dollars) \n     and threatens to bankrupt families, businesses and our health \n     care system. Unfortunately, our work is only growing more \n     urgent.\n       The passage of the National Alzheimer's Project Act in \n     2010, and the subsequent release of the National Plan to \n     Address Alzheimer's Disease, marks a new era for Alzheimer's \n     disease and other dementias. Achieving the first goal of the \n     National Plan, to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's \n     disease by 2025, and supporting individuals with the disease \n     and their caregivers are critical to the success of this \n     legislation. The Alzheimer's Association strongly supports \n     efforts to increase funding for Alzheimer's research at the \n     National Institutes of Health, and we applaud you for your \n     efforts.\n       The Alzheimer's Association deeply appreciates your \n     continued leadership on behalf of all Americans living with \n     Alzheimer's. If you have any questions about this or any \n     other legislation, please contact Rachel Conant, Director of \n     Federal Affairs, at rconant@alz.org or at 202.638.7121.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Robert Egge,\n     Vice President, Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       US Against Alzheimer's,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 19, 2013.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Amy Klobuchar,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sen. Collins & Sen. Klobuchar: On behalf of the more \n     than five million Americans currently struggling with \n     Alzheimer's disease and the millions of family caregivers \n     working each and every day to care for their loved ones, I am \n     writing to thank you for your powerful resolution declaring \n     our national goal of preventing and effectively treating \n     Alzheimer's disease by 2025 an urgent national priority. I \n     also applaud you for including in this resolution the call to \n     double the National Institutes of Health (NIH) research \n     commitment to Alzheimer's disease in Fiscal Year 2015 and to \n     meet by FY 2019 the $2 billion in annual Alzheimer's research \n     funding metric called for by the Advisory Council on \n     Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services. USAgainstAlzheimer's \n     is pleased to endorse your resolution and to commit to \n     working with you to build cosponsors.\n       Three years ago, Congress took the bold action of enacting \n     the National Alzheimer's Project Act which led to the \n     development of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's \n     Disease and the 2025 goal. Much has occurred in the ensuing \n     period, including the reallocation of some NIH research \n     dollars to focus on Alzheimer's disease. But despite these \n     efforts, our annual Alzheimer's research budget remains at \n     about $500 million--one quarter of the $2 billion in annual \n     funding leading Alzheimer's researchers and the advisory \n     council have deemed the minimum necessary to enhance our \n     chances of achieving the 2025 goal.\n       As your resolution so ably notes, the United States does \n     not have a choice as to whether or not we will pay for \n     Alzheimer's disease. We are paying today, dearly, in the more \n     than $140 billion in annual costs of care borne by the \n     taxpayers through Medicare and Medicaid, an amount that will \n     escalate sharply over the years if the current trajectory of \n     the disease is left unchanged. The amount we invest annually \n     in Alzheimer's research today is but a fraction of 1 percent \n     of this total care burden, an amount that is simply \n     insufficient given the enormity of the task at hand. While a \n     bold and visionary plan and 2025 goal are important political \n     statements, absent commensurate resources and the necessary \n     focused national leadership, the plan and goal will be worth \n     precious little.\n       By urging that our 2025 goal be viewed as a national \n     priority and setting the $2 billion goal over the next five \n     years, you have provided our nation--and your fellow \n     appropriators--with a clear goal at which to aim. I applaud \n     you for recognizing the plight of our current patients as \n     well as caregivers the need to similarly bolster patient and \n     caregiver support initiatives. We look forward to working \n     with you to engage the Senate Appropriations Committee to \n     ensure that your call for a doubling of Alzheimer's research \n     funding at the NIH in FY 2015 is reflected in key spending \n     bills.\n       I thank you, again, for your leadership and for all you do \n     to stop Alzheimer's disease.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                George Vradenburg,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am very pleased that my colleague \nSenator Klobuchar, who has been such a leader in this area, has joined \nme on the Senate floor and I yield the floor to her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague Senator Collins \nfor her great leadership for so long on this issue. We have together \nauthored this resolution, and she has been a true champion for those \nsuffering from this debilitating disease.\n  Our resolution builds on the legacy of work and research that has \nbeen done in America. It declares the prevention and effective \ntreatment of Alzheimer's by 2025 an urgent national priority and calls \nfor enhanced resources necessary to achieve this goal.\n  There is no better time than now to discuss this critical issue and \ndraw attention to this disease because, as my colleague from Maine \nnoted, November is Alzheimer's Disease Awareness and Family Caregivers \nMonth. President Reagan made this designation back in 1983 to raise \nawareness about the devastating impacts of Alzheimer's disease on \npatients and their caregivers.\n  Alzheimer's presents one of the toughest medical, economic, and \nsocial challenges of this country. We all know we are seeing a doubling \nof the senior population in this country--some call it a silver \ntsunami, and, of course, it is a positive. More and more people are \nliving long and longer. But we also know we are seeing more and more \npeople who are living with very difficult diseases, and one of them, in \nfact the leading one, is Alzheimer's.\n  This disease takes an incredibly enormous toll, both on patients as \nwell as those who must sit helplessly by and watch as the disease \nprogresses and slowly takes away a loved one.\n  Right now close to 5.2 million Americans are living with this \ndisease, including nearly 100,000 people in my home State of Minnesota.\n  These numbers will grow dramatically. If we continue on the same \ntrajectory we are on now, by 2050 an estimated 16 million Americans \nwill be living with this disease. That is an increase of almost 320 \npercent over what we see today--320 percent over what we see today.\n  The financial cost of providing care for people afflicted by the \ndisease is staggering for families, for our health care system, and of \ncourse for the Federal budget.\n  In 2013 we will spend $203 billion caring for individuals with \nAlzheimer's. Medicare and Medicaid will bear about 70 percent of these \ncosts. By 2050 we will be paying more than $1.2 trillion to care for \npeople with Alzheimer's.\n\n[[Page S8368]]\n\n  We also know it is tough on caregivers. They suffer an emotional and \nphysical toll that results in a higher incidence of chronic conditions \nfor themselves.\n  In 2012 more than 15 million family members, spouses, children, and \nfriends in the United States provided care to an adult with \nAlzheimer's. The unpaid care is valued at more than $216 billion.\n  So many of the people, friends of mine, who are involved in this care \nalso have their own children. That is why we call them the sandwiched \ngeneration. They are literally sandwiched in between caring for their \naging parents and caring for a child.\n  Just as the country addressed the needs of working moms and dads in \nthe 1970s, we must now address the needs of working sons and daughters. \nThis is a critical piece of the puzzle in taking on the Alzheimer's \nchallenge.\n  Most important, our resolution is about the lives that could be \nimproved with better treatments and cures. Earlier this year I met with \n30 Minnesotans who were here in Washington, DC, each having been \ntouched by Alzheimer's. I have been at rallies. I have seen those \npurple shirts in our State. Thousands and thousands of people gathered \nto say: We want a cure. We want better treatments. We do not want to \nlose our loved ones like this.\n  One way we can help stem the tide of this devastating disease is \nthrough research. As my colleague from Maine mentioned, the Mayo Clinic \ndoes fine research in this area. They have found ways to identify \nAlzheimer's earlier through testing. At first you might say: How does \nthat help to get a cure? How are we ever going to know what treatments \nwork best and what a cure is if we cannot first identify it at early \nstages so we can then see improvements? Because if we identify it too \nlate, you are never able to test to see if treatments work. The \nUniversity of Minnesota is also doing outstanding research on mice--\nprize-winning research.\n  Here is the fact of any of these numbers. We all remember this is not \njust about the numbers; it is about the people. But if there is any \nnumber to remember, it is this: If we were able to delay the onset of \nAlzheimer's by just 5 years--5 years--we would be able to cut the \ngovernment spending on Alzheimer's care by almost half in 2050--almost \nhalf.\n  I see Mr. Durbin, also a leader in this area, the Senator from \nIllinois, out on the floor. He knows what we are talking about with the \nbudget, the kind of money we are going to need to help our kids to make \nour country a better place. Just think of what we could do with that \nmoney if we could reduce the spending on this debilitating disease by \nhalf by 2050.\n  The answers on Alzheimer's will not just drop from the sky. It will \ntake dedicated scientists, advanced research initiatives, and skilled \ndoctors to conduct the trials and care for as many patients as possible \nuntil we finally put an end to the disease.\n  That is what this is about. A friend of mine is in town today, \ncommissioner Mike Opat from Hennepin County. Hennepin County has the \nbiggest public hospital in Minnesota, and as county attorney I used to \nrepresent that hospital. I know what this means for their budget every \nsingle day, as people who could have been cured or people who could \nhave had the onset of the disease be delayed have suffered and have \nbeen in the hospital and have been on the taxpayer dime. Of course we \nare going to take care of them, but there are so many other things this \nmoney could be used for.\n  The Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services--\nwhich is led by Dr. Ronald Petersen, a Minnesotan and a leading \nresearcher on Alzheimer's--has acknowledged that in order to reach the \ngoal of effectively treating Alzheimer's disease by 2025, our country \nmust invest $2 billion per year. It sounds like a lot of money but not \nwith these other figures I just put out there; that $1.2 trillion in \ntreatment, the doubling of the number of seniors whom we are seeing by \n2030--$2 billion per year.\n  That is why Senator Collins and I have joined together to submit this \nresolution which resolves that the Senate will strive to double the \nfunding the United States spends on Alzheimer's research in 2015 and \ndevelop a plan to meet the target of $2 billion a year over the next 5 \nyears.\n  Today we spend approximately $500 million per year on Alzheimer's, as \nnoted by my colleague.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON COMMERCIAL IMAGERY \n                   CAPABILITIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the current constrained budget environment, \n     leveraging the commercial satellite imaging industry by \n     sharing investment and operating costs with the private \n     sector helps reduce the costs of acquiring electro-optical \n     satellite imagery to satisfy the requirements of the leaders, \n     intelligence agencies, and Armed Forces of the United States, \n     while supporting United States industry in a competitive \n     international market.\n       (2) Commercial imagery can be easily and securely used by \n     the Armed Forces, shared readily with allies of the United \n     States, and provided quickly to first-responders during \n     natural disasters.\n       (3) The United States Commercial Remote Sensing Policy \n     states that the United States Government will rely ``to the \n     maximum practical extent on U.S. commercial remote sensing \n     space capabilities for filling imagery and geospatial needs \n     for military, intelligence, foreign policy, homeland \n     security, and civil users''.\n       (4) The National Space Policy directs the executive branch \n     to ``[p]urchase and use commercial space capabilities and \n     services to the maximum practical extent when such \n     capabilities and services are available in the marketplace \n     and meet United States Government requirements'' and to \n     ``[m]odify commercial space capabilities and services\n\n[[Page S8373]]\n\n     to meet government requirements when existing commercial \n     capabilities and services do not fully meet these \n     requirements and the potential modification represents a more \n     cost-effective and timely acquisition approach for the \n     government''.\n       (5) Since regulations on commercial imagery providers were \n     put into place in 1999, the global marketplace for space-\n     based imagery has been transformed by--\n       (A) the growth of foreign competition;\n       (B) the emergence of unclassified commercial imagery as a \n     critical element of support for the Armed Forces, coalition \n     intelligence sharing, and civil and humanitarian missions; \n     and\n       (C) the availability of high-resolution aerial images.\n       (6) Airborne imaging companies and foreign providers have \n     no restrictions on the image resolution they can offer, \n     including on images anywhere in the United States, and the \n     market share such companies and providers are capturing will \n     continue to fuel advancements in their capabilities.\n       (7) Foreign commercial imagery providers may soon be able \n     to provide imagery at or better than the currently allowed \n     commercial United States resolution limit of 0.5 meters. As \n     foreign companies approach or surpass that level of \n     resolution, current restrictions on United States satellite-\n     based commercial imagery data providers put the United States \n     at a competitive disadvantage and may harm an industrial base \n     that is important to national security.\n       (8) The congressionally mandated GEOINT Commission \n     recommended that the United States Government increase its \n     use of commercial imagery for intelligence missions and urged \n     relaxation of current resolution restrictions.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) United States commercial imagery providers have the \n     ability to contribute more substantially to the national \n     security mission at a lower cost and in a manner consistent \n     with the policy of the United States to enable United States \n     companies to maintain a leadership position in the commercial \n     satellite imaging industry;\n       (2) the United States Government should relax restrictions \n     on the resolution of images that can be sold on the \n     commercial market, without abandoning prudent limits on the \n     sale of images that could compromise sensitive sites or \n     operations; and\n       (3) relaxing those restrictions while maintaining \n     appropriate protections safeguards the investment the United \n     States has made to support the commercial satellite imaging \n     industry at a time when the United States must maximize every \n     resource to meet emerging threats.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2357.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON BENEFITS OF USING SIMULATORS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The use of technologies such as virtual reality and \n     modeling and simulation tools provides cutting-edge, cost-\n     effective training and technology development for members of \n     the Armed Forces.\n       (2) Leveraging such technologies is an especially relevant \n     supplement to live training given the future of declining \n     defense budgets.\n       (3) The implementation by the Air Force Agency for Modeling \n     and Simulation of virtual reality centers is part of a \n     coordinated effort to broaden the use of virtual training \n     methods.\n       (4) Those centers use of a variety of training tools that \n     give members of the Armed Forces and developers alike a \n     realistic training experience that contributes to improved \n     readiness and system effectiveness.\n       (5) Organizations like the United States Army Program \n     Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and \n     Instrumentation would benefit from increased utilization of \n     virtual reality and modeling and simulations tools.\n       (6) Modeling and simulation tools can provide powerful \n     planning and training capabilities to expose a member of the \n     Armed Forces to the complexities and uncertainties of combat \n     before ever leaving the member's home station. For example, \n     the Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division \n     integrates the science of learning with performance-based \n     training focused on improving the performance of members of \n     the Army and Marine Corps and measures the effectiveness of \n     such training. The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems \n     Division continually engages members of the Army and Marine \n     Corps to understand challenges, solve problems, create new \n     capabilities, and provide essential support.\n       (7) The use of simulation training has yielded military \n     units that are better trained, more capable, and more \n     confident when compared to units that do not have access to \n     modern simulation training devices.\n       (8) Simulation training can be a cost-effective means for \n     units to improve combat readiness and tactical decisionmaking \n     skills and ultimately to save lives.\n       (9) The Department of Defense could meet the training \n     challenges of the future in a fiscally austere environment by \n     leveraging simulation training that uses simulators owned and \n     operated by the Federal Government combined with simulation \n     training services provided by universities and industry.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the use of simulators offers cost savings and provides \n     members of the Armed Forces exceptional preparation for \n     combat; and\n       (2) existing synergies between the Department of Defense \n     and entities in the private sector should be maintained and \n     cultivated to provide members of the Armed Forces with the \n     best simulation experience possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2367.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON NATIONAL SECURITY \n                   IMPLICATIONS OF CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Former National Security Advisor to the President, Tom \n     Donilon, stated in April 2013 there is ``a transformation in \n     the global climate, driven by the world's use of energy, that \n     is presenting not just a transcendent challenge for the world \n     but a present-day national security threat to the United \n     States''.\n       (2) The Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, \n     testified before the Select Committee on Intelligence of the \n     Senate in March 2013 that--\n       (A) shifts in human geography, climate, disease, and \n     competition for natural resources have national security \n     implications; and\n       (B) ``there will most assuredly be security concerns with \n     respect to health and pandemics, energy and climate change. \n     Environmental stresses are not just humanitarian issues. They \n     legitimately threaten regional stability.''.\n       (3) Leading United States national security experts, \n     including 17 former Senators and Representatives, nine \n     retired generals and admirals, both the Chair and Vice Chair \n     of the 9/11 Commission, and Cabinet and Cabinet-level \n     officials from the Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, George H.W. \n     Bush, Clinton, and George W. Bush administrations, signed an \n     open letter in February 2013, stating, ``The effects of \n     climate change in the world's most vulnerable regions present \n     a serious threat to American national security interests. As \n     a matter of risk management, the United States must work with \n     international partners, public and private, to address this \n     impending crisis. Potential consequences are undeniable, and \n     the cost of inaction, paid for in lives and valuable U.S. \n     resources, will be staggering. Washington must lead on this \n     issue now.''.\n       (4) The Commander of the United States Pacific Command, \n     Admiral Samuel J. Locklear, stated in March 2013 that, when \n     the effects of climate change start to impact massive \n     populations, ``you could have hundreds of thousands or \n     millions of people displaced and then security will start to \n     crumble pretty quickly''.\n       (5) A January 2013 report prepared by the Strategic \n     Environmental Research and Development Program for the \n     Department of Defense states, ``The effects of climate change \n     will adversely impact military readiness and Department of \n     Defense (DoD) natural and built infrastructure unless these \n     risks are considered in DoD decisions. Considerations of \n     future climate conditions need to be incorporated into the \n     planning, design, and operations of military facilities, as \n     well as into the strategic infrastructure decisions facing \n     the military Services and DoD as a whole.''.\n       (6) Former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta stated in May \n     2012 that ``[t]he area of climate change has a dramatic \n     impact on national security''.\n       (7) The Defense Science Board issued a report in October \n     2011 entitled, ``Trends and Implications of Climate Change \n     for National and International Security'', which stated that \n     ``the effectiveness of adaptation will have significant \n     national and international security implications''.\n       (8) The Department of Defense FY2012 Climate Change \n     Adaptation Roadmap interprets the 2010 Quadrennial Defense \n     Review as recognizing that climate change--\n       (A) will shape the operating environment, roles, and \n     missions that the Department undertakes;\n       (B) may have significant geopolitical impacts around the \n     world, contributing to greater competition for more limited \n     and critical life-sustaining resources like food and water; \n     and\n       (C) may also lead to increased demands for defense support \n     to civil authorities for humanitarian assistance or disaster \n     response, both within the United States and overseas.\n       (9) The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review describes long-term \n     strategies and initiatives for the Department of Defense and \n     states that ``[c]limate change and energy are two key issues \n     that will play a significant role in shaping the future \n     security environment''.\n       (10) The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review also notes that a \n     2008 assessment by the National Intelligence Council found \n     ``more than 30 U.S. military installations were already \n     facing elevated levels of risk from rising sea levels''.\n       (11) The 2010 National Security Strategy states that ``the \n     danger from climate change is real, urgent and severe''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that it \n     is in the national security interests of the United States to \n     assess, plan for, and mitigate the security and strategic \n     implications of climate change.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2371.

REPORT ON THE READY RESERVE FORCE OF THE MARITIME \n                   ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is in the interest of United States national \n     security that the United States merchant marine, both ships \n     and mariners, serve as a naval auxiliary in times of war or \n     national emergency.\n       (2) It is important to augment the readiness of the United \n     States merchant fleet with a Government-owned reserve fleet \n     comprised of ships with national defense features that may \n     not be available immediately in sufficient numbers or types \n     in the active United States-owned, United States-flagged, and \n     United States-crewed commercial industry.\n\n[[Page S8397]]\n\n       (3) The Ready Reserve Force of the Maritime Administration, \n     a component of the National Defense Reserve Fleet, plays an \n     important role in United States national security by \n     providing necessary readiness and efficiency in the form of a \n     Government-owned sealift fleet.\n       (4) By 2025, 7 out of 27 standard-speed roll-on/roll-off \n     vessels in the Ready Reserve Force will have reached their \n     end of service life. Only 5 of such vessels will still be \n     within their service life by 2030.\n       (5) The Ready Reserve Force could avoid at least \n     $463,000,000 in costs over the next 20 years through a pilot \n     program involving 5 dual-use vessels.\n       (6) A successful dual-use vessel program could provide--\n       (A) private sector benefits for the domestic shipbuilding \n     and maritime freight industries; and\n       (B) an opportunity to outfit vessels with natural gas \n     engines, lowering long-term fuel costs and emissions.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should maintain a shipbuilding base \n     to meet United States national security requirements;\n       (2) the Ready Reserve Force of the Maritime Administration \n     should remain capable, modern, and efficient in order to best \n     serve the national security needs of the United States in \n     times of war or national emergency;\n       (3) Federal agencies should consider investment options for \n     replacing aging vessels within the Ready Reserve Force to \n     meet future operational commitments; and\n       (4) investment in recapitalizing the Ready Reserve Force \n     should include--\n       (A) construction of dual-use vessels, based on need, for \n     use in the America's Marine Highway Program of the Department \n     of Transportation, as a recent study performed under a \n     cooperative agreement between the Maritime Administration and \n     the Navy demonstrated that dual-use vessels transporting \n     domestic freight between United States ports could be called \n     upon to supplement sealift capacity;\n       (B) construction of tanker vessels to meet military \n     transport needs; and\n       (C) construction of vessels for use in transporting \n     potential new energy exports.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of the Navy, shall submit to \n     the congressional defense committees a report on the cost-\n     effectiveness of the recapitalizing methods for the Ready \n     Reserve Force described under subsection (b)(4) that includes \n     an assessment of the risks involved with Federal financing of \n     dual-use vessels.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2407.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Somalia Stabilization \n     Act of 2013''.\n\n     SEC. 1242. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since the collapse of the Siad Barre regime in 1991, \n     Somalia has struggled to rebuild a government and assert \n     order and control over warlords, clan militias, and extremist \n     groups.\n       (2) The lack of functioning state and governing structures \n     led to chronic humanitarian need within Somalia and enabled \n     terrorist groups, maritime crime, illicit trafficking, and \n     mass refugee flows to flourish.\n       (3) In 2007, the Ethiopian military ousted the Islamic \n     Courts Union and the United Nations authorized the African \n     Union to deploy a peacekeeping force to Somalia-the African \n     Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM), in order to support the \n     Transitional Federal Government to establish order in \n     Somalia. AMISOM currently consists of troops from Burundi, \n     Djibouti, Kenya, Sierra Leone, and Uganda.\n\n[[Page S8399]]\n\n       (4) In 2008, Harakat al-Shabaab al-Mujahideen (al-Shabaab) \n     was designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization and a \n     Specially Designated Global Terrorist entity by the United \n     States Government.\n       (5) In 2010, al-Shabaab took control of southern and \n     central Somalia and instituted strict Sharia law.\n       (6) In July 2010, Al-Shabaab retaliated against a \n     contributor to AMISOM by carrying out an attack in Kampala, \n     Uganda, which killed 74 people and injured 70 others.\n       (7) In 2010, in response to growing al-Shabaab dominance \n     and brutality, the AMISOM mandate was expanded to directly \n     target and counter al-Shabaab in Somalia.\n       (8) In 2011 and 2012, when many parts of the country were \n     suffering from severe food insecurity and famine, al-Shabaab \n     denied humanitarian access to its residents, resulting in the \n     death of close to 260,000 people and acute food insecurity \n     for millions.\n       (9) In 2011, the Kenyan Defense Force joined AMISOM, to \n     help take control of urban areas like Mogadishu and Kismayo \n     from al-Shabaab control.\n       (10) In 2012, improved security in much of urban Somalia \n     enabled the Transitional Federal Government to complete a \n     draft constitution and end its transitional term.\n       (11) In 2012 a regionally-representative Somali constituent \n     assembly elected a new Federal parliament, which in turn \n     elected President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud.\n       (12) The United States, Arab and European countries, the \n     United Nations, and the African Union officially recognized \n     the new Somali government, citing the process that created it \n     as being the most credible and inclusive process to date.\n       (13) On March 6, 2013, the United Nations Security Council \n     passed Resolution 2093, creating a new exemption to the 21 \n     year-old arms embargo for a period of 12 months, to allow for \n     ``deliveries of weapons or military equipment or the \n     provision of advice, assistance or training, intended solely \n     for the development of the National Security Forces of the \n     Federal Government of Somalia'', and calling for the \n     training, equipping, and capacity-building of Somalia \n     Security Forces, including both its armed forces and police, \n     with special focus on the development of infrastructure to \n     ``ensure the safe storage, registration, maintenance and \n     distribution of military equipment,'' and ``procedures and \n     codes of conduct. . .for the registration, distribution, use, \n     and storage of weapons''.\n       (14) On May 2, 2013, the United National Security Council \n     passed Resolution 2102, establishing the United Nations \n     Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM) under the leadership of \n     a Special Representative of the Secretary-General to support \n     the Government of Somalia with peace-building, state-building \n     and governance, as well as the coordination of international \n     assistance.\n       (15) Though greeted with great optimism, the Government of \n     Somalia has run into many challenges, which has stalled its \n     efforts to finalize the constitution, guide the structure of \n     the new state, or provide services to the population.\n       (16) President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and his government \n     have committed to the completion of these tasks and to \n     holding a constitutional referendum and national election by \n     2016.\n       (17) On September 16, 2013, the international community and \n     a high level Somali delegation endorsed a compact based on \n     the ``New Deal Strategy for Engagement in Fragile States.'' \n     Donors pledged $2,400,000,000 over three years to support \n     Somali development priorities, including $69,000,000 from the \n     United States.\n       (18) Al Shabaab continues to use terrorist tactics to \n     attack soft targets. On September 21 through the 24, 2013, \n     al-Shabaab perpetrated an attack on the Westgate mall in \n     Nairobi, Kenya, killing at least 67 people.\n\n     SEC. 1243. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the United States should--\n       (1) support the Somali Federal Government, regional \n     administrations, Federal units, and people in their ongoing \n     efforts to consolidate political gains and develop credible, \n     transparent, and representative government systems and \n     institutions, and foster complementary processes at the \n     local, regional, and national levels;\n       (2) continue to support African-led regional efforts to \n     improve security and stability in Somalia, including through \n     the African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM) and the United \n     Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM);\n       (3) support the people and Government of Somalia to develop \n     professional and regionally and ethnically representative \n     Somali security forces that are capable of maintaining and \n     expanding security within Somalia, confronting international \n     security threats such as terrorism, and preventing human \n     rights abuses;\n       (4) continue to provide lifesaving humanitarian assistance \n     as needed, while bolstering resilience and building a \n     foundation for sustained, inclusive development for the \n     people of Somalia; and\n       (5) carry out all diplomatic, economic, intelligence, \n     military, and development activities in Somalia within the \n     context of a comprehensive strategy coordinated through an \n     interagency process.\n\n     SEC. 1244.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON BENEFITS OF USING SIMULATORS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The use of technologies such as virtual reality and \n     modeling and simulation tools provides cost-effective \n     training, operational simulation, and mission rehearsal for \n     members of the Armed Forces.\n       (2) Leveraging such technologies is an especially relevant \n     supplement to live training given the future of declining \n     defense budgets.\n       (3) The implementation by the Air Force Agency for Modeling \n     and Simulation of virtual reality centers is part of a \n     coordinated effort to broaden the use of virtual training \n     methods.\n       (4) Those centers use a variety of training tools that give \n     members of the Armed Forces and developers alike a realistic \n     training experience that contributes to improved readiness \n     and system effectiveness.\n       (5) Organizations like the United States Army Program \n     Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and \n     Instrumentation would benefit from increased utilization of \n     virtual reality and modeling and simulations tools.\n       (6) Modeling and simulation tools can provide powerful \n     planning and training capabilities to expose a member of the \n     Armed Forces to the complexities and uncertainties of combat \n     before ever leaving the member's home station. For example, \n     the Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division \n     integrates the science of learning with performance-based \n     training focused on improving the performance of members of \n     the Army and Marine Corps and measures the effectiveness of \n     such training. The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems \n     Division continually engages members of the Army and Marine \n     Corps to understand challenges, solve problems, create new \n     capabilities, and provide essential support.\n       (7) In an era of decreased live training, the use of \n     simulation training can help ensure that military units are \n     better trained, more capable, and more confident when \n     compared to units that do not have access to modern \n     simulation training technologies.\n       (8) Simulation training can be a cost-effective means for \n     units to improve combat readiness and tactical decisionmaking \n     skills and ultimately to save lives.\n       (9) The Department of Defense could mitigate many of the \n     training challenges of the future in a fiscally austere \n     environment by strengthening collaboration between \n     government, industry, and academia.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the use of simulators offers cost savings to the \n     Department of Defense and can contribute to training members \n     of the Armed Forces for combat; and\n       (2) existing synergies between the Department of Defense \n     and entities in the private sector should continue to provide \n     members of the Armed Forces with the best simulation \n     experience possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2436.

To date, the Federal Government \nrecognizes 566 distinct tribal nations across the country. While these \nIndian tribes share many attributes, each tribe is unique. The \ncontributions American Indians have made to the foundation of the \nUnited States are significant and continue today. From influencing the \ndocuments that founded our Nation to serving in World War II as code \ntalkers, American Indians have helped shape the face of our Nation. It \nis fitting that we are honoring the Code Talkers this week with a \nCongressional Gold Medal Ceremony, as Native Americans have served in \nthe military at a higher rate per capita than any other group in the \ncountry.\n  Native American heroes played a significant role in World War II. \nAmong them was Charles Chibitty of the Comanche Nation, who aided the \nsuccessful landing at Normandy and the capture of an enemy flag in a \nFrench village, for which he was recognized by the French Government. \nThe Code Talkers came from many tribes, including the Navajo, who \nplayed a crucial role in the Pacific. The Choctaw, Sioux, Assiniboine, \nApache, Hopi, Mohawk and many other tribes gave this Nation their \ndedication, determination, and courage. They will never be forgotten.\n  I am honored to represent the 29 tribes in my home State of \nWashington. Tribal culture is woven into the fabric of our State as a \ncritical part of not only the State's history but also its modern-day \neconomy and governance. In 2012, Washington State tribes purchased more \nthan $2.4 billion in goods, paid $1.3 billion in wages, and spent $259 \nmillion on construction activities. The tribes and the State are \npartners in virtually every aspect of governance, from natural resource \nmanagement to tax collection.\n  Many of the tribes in my State entered into agreements with the U.S. \nGovernment over the last two and a half centuries for cessions of land \nand natural resources. In exchange for these lands, the United States \npromised essential services to American Indians. As the trustee for \nIndian nations across the United States, the Federal Government has \nmuch work to do. I am encouraged by events like the Tribal Nations \nConference, which has been convened annually since the election of \nPresident Obama. While this is a step in the right direction, we must \ndo more to ensure that our Indian communities are thriving.\n  As we celebrate National Native American Heritage Month, I encourage \nmy colleagues to take some time and think about the Federal \nGovernment's responsibilities to our first people. I ask my colleagues \nto support this resolution designating November 2013 as National Native \nAmerican Heritage Month and November 29 of this year as Native American \nHeritage Day, and I encourage all Americans to recognize the important \ncontributions American Indians have made to this great Nation.\n\n\n                              S. Res. 308\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I applaud the Senate's adoption today of a \nresolution Senator Hatch and I submitted supporting the goals and \nideals of runaway prevention month. It is a sad reality that millions \nof young people are living on the streets. We as legislators must do \nall we can to prevent homelessness and support youth who find \nthemselves without a place to call home.\n  Every child in America deserves a fair shot. This is why I championed \nthe Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, RHYA, reauthorization in 2008 and \nwhy I continue working to improve and to extend this important law this \nyear. Under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, every State receives a \nbasic center grant to provide housing and crisis services for children \nand their families. Community-based groups around the country can also \napply for funding through the Transitional Living Program and the \nStreet Outreach Program. These programs and others authorized by RHYA \nhave helped countless runaway and homeless youth and their families in \nVermont and across the Nation over the last 30 years. We must continue \nthese essential programs, too many of which are now unfunded or \nunderfunded due to sequestration and other fiscal constraints.\n  We must recognize the importance of investing in our Nation's youth \nand direct resources where they are needed most. It is just not \nacceptable that homeless children are turned away from shelters due to \na lack of beds or that services providers are being forced to downsize. \nWe can and must do more.\n  The RHYA's most recent charter expired at the end of September. I \nhope that we can work to reauthorize and improve this vital law by \nensuring it meets the needs of children in our most vulnerable \ncommunities. Too often LGBT youth find themselves in need of shelter \nand support because their families are unaccepting. Programs authorized \nby RHYA should be trained to respond to LGBT youth and, when possible, \nstrive to reunite them with their families through counseling. We must \nalso update the statute to reflect the tragic reality that runaway and \nhomeless youth are vulnerable to trafficking and sexual exploitation. \nWe should ensure grantees are able to meet the needs of young victims \nof trafficking or exploitation or offer referrals to other qualified \nservice providers. We need smarter training and more resources to help \nour grantees meet the needs of young victims, and that is exactly what \nthe Runaway and Homeless Youth Act provides.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolutions \nbe agreed to, the preambles, where applicable, be agreed to, and the \nmotions to reconsider be laid upon the table en bloc, with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolutions were agreed to.\n  The preambles were agreed to.\n  (The resolutions, with their preambles, are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n\n[[Page S8411]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/20/senate-section/article/S8411-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 1752\n\n  Mr. REID.
