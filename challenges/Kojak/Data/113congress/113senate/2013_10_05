Madam President, Senator Schumer yesterday on the floor \ntalked about what the House is doing, and he described it as ``Alice in \nWonderland.'' I don't know if that is an apt description. Maybe it is \nbeyond that.\n  Here is where we are. The House has passed a bill to pay furloughed \nFederal employees--now, listen to this--once the government opens. \nWell, why wouldn't we do that? But the problem is that this \nuncontroversial legislation is kind of unique, isn't it?\n  So now what the Republicans in the House are telling--because they \nare the ones who set the agenda--they are telling all these Federal \nworkers: What we are going to do for you now--even though we don't like \nFederal workers and we haven't given you a raise in 3 years--what we \nare going to do now is give you a paid vacation.\n  That is what it is. These people who want to go to work can't go to \nwork, but they are going to get paid, they know, when they leave here, \nand we knew that anyway. We heard today that a number of Federal \nemployees are applying for unemployment benefits. So it is really cruel \nto tell workers they will receive backpay once the government opens and \nthen refuse to open the government.\n  Let's open the government. Hundreds of thousands of furloughed \nFederal servants want to work. They should be allowed to work. We have, \nfor example, right now in our National Security Agency, 1,000 \nmathematicians--the numbers may be a little bit wrong but very close--\nwe have 2,500 computer scientists, and 940 Ph.D.s who are home. They \ncannot work. They cannot get paid. It is not fair to them or our \ncountry. Let them work.\n  We get these little piecemeal bits of legislation from the House--for \nexample, open the Park Service. In Nevada, that is great because we \nhave some national forests there. But 87 percent of the land in the \nState of Nevada is owned by the Federal Government. The vast majority \nof that land is Bureau of Land Management. We have some beautiful \nconservation areas. One is called Red Rock, which over 1 million people \nvisit every year. It is closed. So opening the Park Service does not \nhelp a place 8 or 9 miles out of Las Vegas where 1 million people come \nto visit. They come there to do that. Some of the best rock climbing in \nthe world is there.\n  These are ordinary Americans who have not been treated very well \nduring the last several years by the Republicans anyway. No pay raises. \nThey treat Federal employees as if they are a lower class of worker \nthan other people.\n  Now, remember, Federal workers work really hard. The Presiding \nOfficer works hard. All 8 million Federal employees work hard. There \nare exceptions, just like anyplace else.\n  I met two people yesterday. This hurts. Federal employees not being \nable to work hurts others. Lockheed announced today that they are \nlaying off 3,000 people. They cannot get inspections done. I was with \nsomeone yesterday evening from US Air. They cannot take custody of a \n$180-million airplane, a brandnew airplane. It is just sitting there. \nThey cannot take custody of that airplane. Why? Because they need a \nfinal inspection. This is all throughout America. The Federal \nGovernment is involved in aspects of life that everyone has here in \nAmerica--food inspectors, inspectors for making sure there is safety \nfor a $180 million airplane. Lockheed has things they are building. \nSome of them are missiles. They have to make sure they are safe and \nreliable. One man told me that they must, for the warheads in these \nnuclear weapons, test them after they have been here in service. They \njust cannot leave them here, they need to test them. The time is here \nfor them to be tested. The safety and reliability of our nuclear \nweapons--there is nobody to do it.\n  Now we are saying to the Federal employees: We are going to pay you \nwhen this is all over, but right now you just\n\n[[Page S7216]]\n\nstay home. You 1,000 mathematicians, you 940 P.H.Ds, 2,500 computer \nscientists who work for the National Security Agency: Stay home. Watch \nTV. Play chess. Do whatever you want to do because we will not let you \nwork. But look ahead; you are going to get paid.\n  On this side of the aisle, we like Federal employees. I like Federal \nemployees. I look with great satisfaction at someone who works for the \nFBI or the Park Service. I want them to work.\n  This is really an important time for people to visit our monuments, \nour national treasures, but they cannot do that. So not only does it \nhurt people who want to go see the Washington Monument up close, but \nalso--not in Washington as much--take the places around our national \nparks. There are little motels and restaurants that depend on those \nparks to make a living. Wintertime is coming. The ability to visit \nthese parks is now very limited.\n  I have always cared about Federal employees. They do these jobs. Take \nthe people who work for me and all Members of Congress. I have a Rhodes \nScholar. She is a lawyer. She could go out in the private sector and \nmake 10 times more money than she makes here. Why is she not doing \nthat? She has two children. Why does she not do that? Because she cares \nabout public service. I have people who work for me who are graduates \nof the best schools in America. They are here because they believe in \npublic policy. They believe in being public servants. They are being \ntold they are nonessential.\n  Some Members of Congress are kind of showing off, saying: Well, I am \nnot closing my office.\n  I have closed my office because I do not think my employees should be \ntreated any differently than someone who is working for the Bureau of \nLand Management or the FBI. They are home.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield for a question from the senior \nSenator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the distinguished leader had the \nopportunity to serve in both bodies. I appreciate what he said about \nhis staff and the other staff.\n  Is it not the leader's observation that these staff people come here \nbecause of their love of this country, love of this government, and \nwithout a doubt they put in extraordinary hours--far more hours than \nthe public might realize? Is that not a fact?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is so true. These men and women, for \nexample, who are assistant U.S. attorneys, they do not punch a time \nclock. They do not bill hours, how much they can make an hour. They \ntake care of the needs of this country. If there are bad guys out \nthere, they prosecute them. FBI agents, people who work for the U.S. \nMarshal Service--they serve warrants to some of the most dangerous \npeople in the world. They are home now. They are home. They do those \njobs, I say to the distinguished President pro tempore of the Senate, \nbecause they chose public service.\n  I will be a little bit personal here. I have four boys and a girl, a \ndaughter. I love my children as only a father could love his children. \nMy daughter is married to a lawyer. She is a schoolteacher. My four \nboys are all lawyers. My next youngest gave up a job and took a pay cut \nof $200,000 a year so he could go to work as a city attorney in \nHenderson, NV. That is what public servants are all about. They are not \nin it for the money. They are not in it for the glory. They are in it \nbecause it is the right thing to do.\n  As I look over this Chamber, I see two of my staff in the back row. I \nlook at one young man who is a graduate of Stanford Law School. It is \neither the first, second, or third best law school every year in \nAmerica. Could he go someplace else and make more money? You bet he \ncould. He is an expert. He is an expert in finance, the budget process.\n  Mr. NELSON. Would the Senator yield for a quick comment?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield to the senior Senator from the \ngreat State of Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, since our leader is a former Capitol \npoliceman, might it be noted that all of the Capitol Police Force that \nis protecting us and protected us the other day with the incident that \noccurred here--they are still here protecting us, and they are not \nbeing paid?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, to my friend, I have given a couple of \nstatements the last 2 days about the Capitol Police, but I never \nbrought up the fact that I was a police officer. I was a police officer \nhere in this building. My badge number is 364. I was an original. I \nstill have it in my office here. I am proud of that. I did not have to \ndo the dangerous things these young men and women do here. Some of them \nare not so young. They are really senior officers. But I carried a gun. \nI did some of what police officers do.\n  To think, as we look around this room--plainclothes officers are \nhere, not getting paid. One of the officers was hurt and was \nhospitalized in that accident. He wasn't getting paid.\n  Tell me, I say to anyone who will listen or answer this question, why \ndon't we open the government and let people go to work and do their \njobs.\n  Public service is a calling--I won't say it is a calling, but some \npeople feel it is.\n  I see the Senator from Maine. He and I worked in this building, the \nCapitol complex. Maybe that is where we developed our love of public \nservice. I don't know where we developed it, but we both have it. Here \nis a man who has done such remarkable things.\n  He not only worked in the Senate many years ago, he was in the march \nfor which we celebrated the 50-year anniversary. From a tree, he \nwatched Dr. Martin Luther King give a speech. He loves public service, \nand he has a career that proves that.\n  The junior Senator from the State of Maine is one of the most \ndignified, experienced Senators that this body has ever had. That is \nthe way it is with everybody.\n  The junior Senator from North Dakota has dedicated her life to public \nservice. She held many elected offices in the State of North Dakota. \nShe was a tax collector and attorney for Kent Conrad when he was tax \ncollector. She was attorney general, ran for Governor, and would likely \nhave been elected, but she was stricken with breast cancer. She came \nback.\n  She came back because public service is in her blood. She ran against \ngreat odds to become a Senator, and she is a Senator--not for the money \nbut because she is contributing to the welfare of this country.\n  We are having these people stay at home? It is hard for me to \ncomprehend.\n  It has been 1 week since the Senate passed a bill to reopen the \nFederal Government--1 week. For 7 days the Senate has been waiting for \nthe House of Representatives to act.\n  Speaker Boehner has refused to allow the vote on the one bill that he \nsaid would reopen the government. It would open the government and keep \nit open. It has been all over the press the last few days.\n  He came to me and said: We can do a clean CR.\n  I said: What are the terms of that clean CR?\n  He said: It has to be at this year's level.\n  I said: We can't do that. We passed a budget here and we are $70 \nbillion above that.\n  We talked and we talked. He said that is how we can get a clean CR. \nWhat does that mean? It means we can just get it done quickly. I, as \nthe press has indicated, talked with Senator Murray. She may be small \nin stature, but she is one tough Senator, the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee.\n  I also had to talk to Barbara Mikulski, the senior Senator from the \nState of Maryland. It wasn't easy to get those two chairs to agree to \ndo $988 billion. Once we got that done, I had to go to my caucus and \nsell that. I did it upon the representation that they would pass that \nand send it over to us. They sure didn't do that.\n  The bill we are asking the Speaker to vote on is the one he told me \nhe wanted.\n  An economist who was John McCain's chief economic adviser during his \ncampaign, who has admiration for Democrats and Republicans, said if the \ngovernment shutdown drags on for 3 weeks, it will cost the economy $55 \nbillion.\n  It is already 1 week. We can all do that math. That cost is on par \nwith the economic damage caused by Superstorm Sandy.\n\n[[Page S7217]]\n\n  What the House has done with their ``Alice in Wonderland'' operation \nis they created another Sandy. It could be $55 billion.\n  Although this is not an act of nature; this is a manmade disaster. It \nis a manmade disaster waiting to happen for national security.\n  The tea party shutdown is hampering our ability to enforce sanctions \non Iran, just when they are beginning to bite hard.\n  The tea party shutdown is hurting our ability to gather intelligence. \nI spoke about that today. According to the Chief of Staff of the Army, \nthe tea party shutdown is impacting the day-to-day operations of the \nUnited States Armed Forces. If the chief of the Army were not enough, \nthe Secretary of Defense ridiculed what the House is doing. By the way, \nSecretary Hagel is a Republican.\n  I know my Republican colleagues are as concerned about the safety and \nsecurity of the United States as I am. But they need to take a look at \nthemselves and ask are they doing what is right for the safety and \nsecurity of our country.\n  I am confident if they thought about it for a minute, they would like \nto mitigate the impact of the shutdown on intelligence gathering, the \nmilitary, and a dozen other government agencies, as much as I do. A \npiecemeal approach to funding the government bit by bit is simply not \nthe answer. Saying: We are going to pay you when we open this place is \nnot the answer. Let them go to work.\n  No matter how many bites the Republicans take at the apple, there is \nonly one bill that ensures every priority is met: the Senate bill to \nfully reopen the Federal Government.\n  Why are they doing this?\n  The Presiding Officer is a distinguished attorney from the State of \nHawaii.\n  One does not need to be a distinguished attorney from any place to \nunderstand how brazen what they are doing is. They are saying: We are \nnot going to do anything until you let us hamper a bill that has \nalready been around for 4 years.\n  Hamper is an understatement. They are not willing to do anything \nunless they take a big whack with a meat-ax on ObamaCare. Already, \nsince ObamaCare has been open, only on the Federal Web site, there have \nbeen 9 million hits in 4 days.\n  The priorities the Republicans have addressed so far are: Veterans, \nnational parks, National Guard, and the National Institutes of Health \nare worthy. But there are many other needs that will go unmet and \npriorities that will be ignored without fully reopening the government.\n  Take, for example--I haven't heard any speeches on the floor from my \nRepublican colleagues about 1,300 rape crisis centers which rely on \nFederal funding to support victims of crime. They are losing their \nability to stay open.\n  Unless the Federal Government reopens, organizations that advocate \nfor victims of violence will be forced to close their doors or work \nwithout pay, and that is in a matter of a few days. Will the House \nRepublicans pass a bill to help them?\n  I remember when we didn't have all the domestic shelters we have now. \nI remember these women as I did domestic relations work. Oh, how sad. \nThey had no place to go. Now they have a few places to go. We have \ndomestic crisis shelters, and we have rape crisis centers, but the \nFederal Government is the one that supports those. The piecemeal \napproach of the House indicates that the needs of the people I just \ndescribed would not be met.\n  The commander in chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, William \nThein--I hope everyone here understands this is not some leftwing \norganization out there demonstrating against Democrats. The Veterans of \nForeign Wars is what I have described it as, veterans of foreign wars. \nThey try to stay as neutral politically as any organization in America.\n  William Thein, commander in chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, \nwrote to leaders in Congress this week and said:\n\n       We expect more from our elected leadership, and not a \n     piecemeal approach that would use the military or disabled \n     veterans as leverage in a political game.\n\n  He is right. Neither veterans, the military, hungry infants nor \nchildren with cancer should be used as political pawns. They should not \nbe left out in the cold.\n  There is only one bill. It is the bill that Speaker Boehner asked me \nto get out of this Senate, and we did that. He needs to allow the House \nof Representatives to vote, and it would pass by a huge margin. That \nbill would fund all public priorities I have talked about, both to \nprotect and economy and national security.\n  The Senate's clean bill to reopen the government--the one the Speaker \nsaid he wanted me to get out of here--and I did it, but it was not \neasy. We have been waiting 1 week, but the Speaker could end this \ngovernment shutdown before they go home Sunday. It was the Speaker's \nintention all along to pass a clean continuing resolution. I believe \nthat. But instead he was waylayed by this tea party-driven nonsense in \nthe House of Representatives. He has refused to allow a vote on a bill \nthat he proposed.\n  Republican Congressman Charles Dent said last night:\n\n       I do believe it's imperative that we have a clean funding \n     bill to fund the government. That was the intent of the \n     Republican leadership all along, but obviously there were a \n     few dozen folks in the House Republican Conference who \n     weren't prepared to vote for a clean bill, and that's why \n     we're in the situation we're in right now.\n\n  I say to the Speaker: Go with your first instinct. Pass a clean \ncontinuing resolution.\n  Charlie Dent said it was to pass and fund the government.\n  Here is what one House Republican, Devin Nunes of California said: \nThe Speaker is taking his orders straight from the junior Senator from \nTexas. But the next move would be--and this is what is Congressman \nNunes said yesterday:\n\n       You really have to call Cruz. I'm not even joking about \n     that. That's really what you have to do, because he is the \n     one that set up the strategy. He's the one that got us into \n     this mess, and so we've got to know what the next move is.\n\n  Stop taking marching orders from the tea party, I say to my \nRepublican friends in the House. All the Speaker has to do is find the \ncourage to defy the tea party for the good of our great country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/05/senate-section/article/S7217-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I thank the distinguished majority \nleader, not only for how he spoke out today, but also for the fact that \nhe is strong on this issue. He also spoke about what this shutdown is \ndoing to law enforcement.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I am going to speak further \non that. But I couldn't help but think, as I was asked by a friend in \nVermont: What is going on?\n  I said: Well, you know, we had hundreds of hours of committee \nmeetings, votes, and all. We had hours and hours of debate in the House \nand the Senate, and we passed the Affordable Care Act.\n  Even though it passed the House and the Senate and was signed into \nlaw by the President, however, the Tea Party continues to oppose the \nlaw. So they did two things that they thought would knock it out. One, \nthey went to a Republican dominated U.S. Supreme Court and said let's \nknock out this law. The Supreme Court said no. They upheld the law.\n  Then they ran a candidate for President of the United States, whose \nmain argument was that he would get rid of the Affordable Care Act.\n  He lost badly.\n  Throughout all this time and after 40 votes to get rid of the \nAffordable Care Act, the Republicans have not offered what we would get \nas an alternative? Most parents like the fact that their\n\n[[Page S7218]]\n\nchildren can stay on their insurance while they are in college. Are you \ngoing to get rid of that--and do they have something with which to \nreplace that? Most people like the fact that if you have a preexisting \ncondition, cancer, a heart condition, or something like that, they can \nstill get health care. They want to do away with that. What do they \nhave to replace this sort of care?\n  After 40 votes, a Presidential election, the Supreme Court--they have \nlost everywhere. It makes me think of General Custer at Little Big Horn \nwho came galloping in because he knew he was going to win.\n  They have been handed the same kind of defeat that Custer was at \nLittle Big Horn. And if they have a better idea on health insurance for \nAmerica, then I think they should have the guts to bring it to the \nfloor and vote up or down, not just shut down the government like they \nare doing now.\n  Today marks the fifth day of the government shutdown, and by refusing \nto pass a continuing resolution to simply fund the continuing \noperations of the Federal Government, Republicans are threatening the \ncritical functions of all three branches of government. As chairman of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, I am acutely aware of the devastating \nimpact that Republicans' treatment of Federal judiciary is having on \nour system of justice.\n  The last time Republicans refused to pay the bills that we in \nCongress had already incurred, it undermined our Nation's credit \nrating. It also resulted in what is known as sequestration and the \ncorresponding cuts to the Federal judicial branch have been \ndevastating. But with the ongoing shutdown of the entire Federal \nGovernment, a handful of ideologues in the House of Representatives are \nholding the entire judicial system hostage and this threatens our \nentire democracy.\n  Earlier this year, in the face of sequestration, a group of 87 \nFederal district judges warned that sustained budget cuts ``have forced \nus to slash our operations to the bone, and we believe that our \nconstitutional duties, public safety, and the quality of the justice \nsystem will be profoundly compromised by any further cuts.''\n  Now, thanks to the Republican shutdown, according to a letter to all \nFederal courts from Judge John Bates, Director of the Administrative \nOffice of the U.S. Courts, the judiciary will only be able to remain \nopen for approximately 10 business days into October. What will happen \nafter those 10 days? What happens when the operating funds run out \ncompletely? Will we be able to swiftly bring criminals and terrorists \nto justice? There is no court to bring them to. Will small businesses \nand individuals be able to have their claims resolved? Again, no court. \nEach and every Federal court in this country will soon have to start \nmaking decisions about what part of justice is essential and what can \nbe delayed until funding is restored. If this shutdown continues, \nmillions of Americans will not have access to the justice they deserve \nunder our Constitution. Here in the United States, where we have the \nmost open, transparent, honest, effective system of justice in the \nworld, we are slamming the doors on everybody--Republicans, Democrats, \nand Independents alike.\n  This coming Monday, the first Monday in October, marks the opening of \nthe new term of our Supreme Court. On its first day, it will hear an \nimportant case about a worker's right to bring an age discrimination \nclaim under the Constitution. On its second day, it will hear another \nsignificant case about whether there should be any limits on the amount \nof money wealthy individuals can pump into our elections. If the \nshutdown continues, it is unclear how our courts, including our highest \ncourt, will cope with the funding being withheld. Will the Court remain \nopen to the public to hear arguments the following week if this \nshutdown continues? Will local courthouses have to shut down entirely \nfor parts of the year? Will the guarantee of defense for the indigent, \nestablished under Gideon v. Wainwright, continue to be eroded by \nfurther cuts to our Federal public defenders? Or will we in Congress \nfinally turn the page on our fiscal mistreatment of a co-equal branch \nof government?\n  We must not take for granted that we have the greatest justice system \nin the world. Its cost is less than 1 percent of the entire Federal \nbudget, yet we fail to support it. The New York Times, referencing \nJudge Bates's letter and the ongoing stress to our justice system, \nrightly noted this week that unless Congress ends this needless \nshutdown, ``the damage to American justice would be compounded and hard \nto recover from once the impasse is over.''\n  I thank the men and women of the judicial branch of our Federal \nGovernment for their dedication under increasingly difficult \ncircumstances and I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 1, 2013]\n\n                      The Courts and the Shutdown\n\n                        (By Dorothy J. Samuels)\n\n       The opening of a new Supreme Court term on the statutorily \n     prescribed first Monday in October is always surrounded by a \n     fair amount of drama having to do with the momentous legal \n     issue the justices will be taking up. The government shutdown \n     has imbued the start of the 2013-2014 term this coming \n     Monday, Oct. 7, with a different sort of suspense.\n       A notice posted on the Supreme Court's website says the \n     court ``will continue to conduct its normal operations'' \n     through this Friday. It is silent about what will happen if \n     the ``lapse of appropriations,'' as the notice delicately \n     describes the madness, continues beyond that. The court will \n     be announcing its plans a week at a time.\n       It is expected, though, that the term's first oral \n     arguments will proceed as scheduled, shutdown or no, and that \n     the court will conduct business as usual, much as it did \n     during the Clinton-era shutdowns. How long Supreme Court \n     operations could remain unharmed if the shutdown drags on is \n     unclear.\n       For lower federal courts, a prolonged shutdown could be \n     disastrous. Sufficient reserve funds are on hand for normal \n     court operations for just 10 business days, through Oct. 15, \n     according to a memo recently circulated by Judge John Bates, \n     director of the Administrative Office of the United States \n     Courts.\n       Once those funds are depleted, there would need to be \n     extensive furloughing of staff, and reductions in probation, \n     pretrial and courthouse security services to comply with the \n     federal Anti-Deficiency Act, which allows only ``essential \n     work'' to continue during a government shutdown. Coming on \n     top of the devastation to the nation's court system caused by \n     the maniacal across-the-board budget cuts known as \n     sequestration, the damage to American justice would be \n     compounded and hard to recover from once the impasse is over.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thank the men and women of our judicial \nbranch who have stood up for this. But you know, our courts have been \nforced to run on fumes for far too long, and soon, they will be running \non empty. I call on the House of Representatives to stop playing games \nwith our co-equal branch of government, the judiciary.\n  This government shutdown is having a real impact on our lives and our \ncountry. Recently, there was a terrible bus accident and tragically \npeople were killed. Yet the NTSB cannot even go down and investigate \nwhat happened so it doesn't happen again because they are closed. There \nare businesses in Vermont that have invested in their business and are \nprepared to open--one in particular, and I will speak later about this \none next week--and all they need is a certificate from the Department \nof Agriculture in order to open. The business is poised to open and \nstart making money, especially during tourist season, but the \nDepartment of Agriculture is closed and they can't get the certificate.\n  We also take for granted that our open and transparent government is \na cornerstone of our democracy and a shining example of civic \ninvolvement. Even the public's right to know is compromised because of \nthis shutdown. Every Member of Congress, regardless of political party \nor ideology, should be alarmed.\n  Right now, Americans seeking help with Freedom of Information Act, \nFOIA, requests encounter closed for business signs at many of the \nFederal offices that facilitate them. The National Archives and Records \nAdministration Office of Government Information Services--a critical \noffice established by the Leahy-Cornyn OPEN Government Act to mediate \nFOIA disputes--is not operating due to the shutdown of the Federal \nGovernment. And according to several press reports, the Department of \nJustice has also sought stays in several important FOIA cases--\nincluding FOIA litigation seeking information about the government's \nuse of the PATRIOT ACT to\n\n[[Page S7219]]\n\ncollect data on Americans' telephone calls--due to the lapse in Federal \nfunding.\n  This shutdown has impacted other agencies, too. The Center for \nEffective Government reports that the processing of FOIA requests has \nbeen suspended at the Social Security Administration, the Federal Trade \nCommission and the National Labor Relations Board. The National \nSecurity Agency, an agency facing a public trust deficit in light of \nrevelations detailing its sweeping surveillance of Americans' emails \nand phone calls, has also ceased the processing of FOIA and Privacy Act \nrequests. Many other Federal agencies have either taken their websites \noff-line or stopped updating their websites. We literally have a closed \ngovernment.\n  All of us--whether Democrat, Republican or Independent--have an \ninterest in making certain that our government is fulfilling its \nresponsibilities to its citizens. Yet, right now, House Republicans are \nchoosing to debate again the nearly 4-year-old Affordable Care Act on a \ncritical spending bill. Again, let us not forget that the act has been \nupheld by the Supreme Court and was a key issue in a Presidential \nelection where the electorate in this country voted against the person \nwho wanted to do away with it. They are forcing us to choose whether \neven the most fundamental parts of our government are ``essential.'' \nRather than picking and choosing, we in Congress must commit ourselves \nto upholding all of our democratic principles and ensuring the \ngovernment's ability to work for every American. The House of \nRepresentatives can end this stalemate today by taking up the Senate \npassed CR, sending it to the President, and reopening the government, \nso we can get back to the business of finding a reasonable way to \nbalance our budget and get our fiscal house in order.\n  It is important for that business owner in Vermont that the \nDepartment of Agriculture be open. It is important for our communities \naffected by criminals that our FBI remain open and fully functional. It \nis important to those who may have their children riding on a bus that \nwe find out why this other bus accident happened and is it something \nthat is going to happen again with a busload of children. But instead \nwe have something akin to General Custer riding to Little Big Horn, \nclaiming this is going to be victory, and I suspect that this will \nresult in the same sort of defeat for those who seek to shut down the \ngovernment for ideological reasons.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, this has been an interesting discussion \nfor the last 37 minutes. It lacks a little bit of a preamble.\n  The reason we are in the situation we are in now is because Congress \ndidn't do the spending bills when they were supposed to do the spending \nbills. We have 12 spending bills. There is no reason we didn't spend 12 \nweeks, 1 week doing each of those for a period of 12 weeks. It is the \nsecond most important job we have. I think the most important job we \nhave is national defense, but budgeting--spending--is the next biggest. \nIf we had done one bill each week for the 12 weeks we needed to and had \nopen amendments on them, there wouldn't have needed to be any of this \ndiscussion. Most of the things would have been resolved by now. They \nwould have either won or lost, and that is what happens around here.\n  Except we are busy dealmaking instead of legislating. We don't allow \namendments now. When a bill comes to the floor, there is a discussion \nbetween the two leaders to see how limited they can make the \namendments. I try to only do relevant amendments. I wouldn't mind if \nthat were the law around here. That is the law in the Wyoming \nlegislature. Whatever the title of the bill is, your amendment has to \nbe relevant to that. It helps to get through a lot of the process in a \nhurry. But we don't even bring them up.\n  I take that back. The leader did come to the floor and chastise me \nfor forgetting we had the Transportation bill brought up on the floor. \nWe didn't get to do amendments on it, and when we didn't get to do \namendments on it, our side said nuts to finishing that right now. The \nleader could have brought it right back and showed we were not \ninterested in doing transportation. He talked about us not being \ninterested in transportation, but that was not the case. There were \namendments that needed to be done to the Transportation bill.\n  That is 1 bill out of 12. What happened to the other 11? If we had \ndone the bills timely, we wouldn't be in a continuing resolution. What \nis the matter with a government that can't operate like a business and \nhave a preplan for what is going to happen if this tragedy does happen? \nWe don't have any plans like that. What we do is stand and chastise \neach other for not having plans for what is happening. That is wrong. \nWe shouldn't be doing that. We should be getting our work done in a \ntimely manner, and we should be doing it through legislation, which \nmeans allowing amendments on the floor.\n  Yes, I know there are some amendments I wouldn't want to vote on. \nThere are some amendments the other side wouldn't want to vote on. But \nthat is what we signed on for. We have to vote on the amendments and \nget the process done, but we are not doing that.\n  As to the shutdown, I wish to share what actually wound up as a guest \neditorial from a guy named Bill Johnson who lives in Pinedale, but he \ngot his guest editorial in the Powell Tribune, which is quite a ways \naway from there. He is an old truckdriver, and he said he is tired of \npulling the load; that it is time for a producers' shutdown. Whoa. I \nwouldn't verify his math, but this is the way he sees it.\n  He sees that there are 11 people taking money out of the pot and thus \nriding on the wagon. That leaves nine people paying the taxes into the \npot and thus pulling the wagon. ``A bad ratio indeed!''\n  He says: Now government people ``will tell you they pay taxes, but \nlet's not forget that all their wages first come out of the pot.'' \nGovernment people ``don't create wealth. They spend the wealth!'' Now \nthese same government people ``are enjoying quite a party.''\n\n       We hear them bragging about the following:\n       ``We have better pensions and wages.\n       ``We have paid sick days, cheaper medical insurance, free \n     vehicles. . . .''\n\n  We get paid when the government shuts down and we come back to work \nwithout having worked.\n\n       ``Some States pay $15 an hour on welfare, so why work?''\n       They say a government agency's success is measured by the \n     size of its budget. There's no incentive to cut a budget!\n\n  ``They say if a tax-paying `person' is successful, it's because `the \ngovernment people' have helped him!''\n\n       They ask, ``How can we raise the tax-paying `people's' \n     taxes again?''\n       We need more money for raises and Obamacare. Work harder, \n     please! We'll take care of the rules and the regulations.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this entire \narticle.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Powell Tribune, Sept. 26, 2013]\n\n                       Tired of Pulling the Load?\n\n\n                      time for a producers' strike\n\n                           (By Bill Johnson)\n\n       We now know that there are 11 mules taking monies out of \n     the pot and thus riding on the wagon. That leaves nine mules \n     paying taxes into the pot and thus pulling the wagon.\n       A bad ratio indeed! Now government mules will tell you they \n     pay taxes, but let's not forget that all their wages first \n     come out of the pot. Government mules don't create wealth. \n     They spend the wealth!\n       Now these government mules are enjoying quite a party. We \n     hear them bragging about the following:\n       ``We have better pensions and wages.''\n       ``We have paid sick days, cheaper medical insurance, free \n     vehicles, blah, blah, blah.''\n       ``Some states pay $15 an hour on welfare, so why work?''\n       They say a government agency's success is measured by the \n     size of its budget. There's no incentive to cut a budget!\n       They say if a tax-paying mule is successful it's because we \n     government mules have helped him!\n       They ask, ``How can we raise the taxpaying mules'' taxes \n     again? We need more money for raises and Obamacare. Work \n     harder please! We'll take care of the rules and \n     regulations.''\n       If this were a 30-year-long football game, the score would \n     be about 99-7. Heck, the taxpaying mules can't even get their \n     feet on the ball!\n       Our once great Uncle Sam is like Humpty Dumpty sitting on \n     his wall. He's waiting for an earthquake, war, or market \n     crash to cause his great fall!\n\n[[Page S7220]]\n\n       So what can we do? The non-violent answer is simple! When \n     the time comes, just quit pulling on the wagon. Take a three- \n     to five-day vacation instead.\n       This means: Truckers don't truck. Trainmen don't train. \n     Pilots don't plane. Miners don't mine. Marketers don't \n     market. Bankers don't bank. Groceries don't go and pipelines \n     don't flow!\n       This scheduled vacation for our nation's producers, the \n     taxpaying mules still pulling the wagon, ought to be \n     nationwide. That will never happen.\n       However, our friends in Utah, Idaho and Montana might join \n     in. So might Moffat County and the seven other counties that \n     wish to secede from Colorado. Same goes for Nebraska, Kansas, \n     Oklahoma and Texas. Get the picture?!\n       It is amusing to listen to all the hoopla about potential \n     government shutdowns. Big deal! Remember the scene in \n     ``Crocodile Dundee'' when the would-be robbers pull a knife? \n     Mr. Dundee says, ``That's not a knife, this is a knife!''\n       That's what a producers'' strike would look like!\n       This is the way to cut government spending, lower your tax \n     rates, and shove some government mules off the wagon. We \n     would score a few touchdowns and give them a list of the \n     peoples' demands.\n       The path we are presently taking will only lead to the \n     death of our country. Our intentions are to save the USA. We \n     all want government of the people, by the people and for the \n     people!\n       ``All that is necessary for evil to triumph is that good \n     men do nothing''--(Edmund Burke.)\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Continuing from Mr. Johnson's article, he asks, ``So what \ncan we do?'' Here is his answer:\n\n       The nonviolent answer is simple! When the time comes, just \n     quit pulling on the wagon. Take a three- to five-day vacation \n     instead.\n\n  Take as long a vacation as the government takes. This means that \nfarmers will not farm, stores will not open, manufacturers will not \nmanufacture, powerplants will not produce power--and continuing his \narticle:\n\n       Truckers don't truck. Trainmen don't train. Pilots don't \n     plane. Miners don't mine. Marketers don't market. Bankers \n     don't bank. Groceries don't go and pipelines don't flow!\n\n  That is what would happen if we had a shutdown of the private sector, \nthe ones that are carrying the load. He says this scheduled vacation \nfor our Nation's producers, the taxpaying people still pulling the \nwagon, ought to be nationwide.\n  Of course, he knows that will never happen, but he hopes people get \nthe picture.\n  Continuing his article:\n\n       It is amusing to listen to all the hoopla about potential \n     government shutdowns. Big deal! Remember the scene in \n     ``Crocodile Dundee'' when the would-be robbers pull a knife? \n     Mr. Dundee says, ``That's not a knife, this is a knife!''\n\n  And, remember, he pulls out his near machete? He says:\n\n       That's what a producers' strike would look like!\n\n  ``This is the way to cut government spending, lower your tax rates, \nand shove some government'' people ``off the wagon.''\n\n       We would score a few touchdowns and give them a list of the \n     people's demands.\n\n  So that's the view of the trucker in Wyoming, and he gets to think \nabout this a lot as he drives miles and miles and miles and miles. It \nis a long way between towns. But he is pointing out that our government \nis being weighted down with a lot of different things, not just \npeople's salaries with growing government--each of those adds to the \nneed for a tax increase--but we are also weighted down with the \ninterest load. If the interest rate goes up, that wagon load is going \nto get mired in mud.\n  He mentions the rules and the regulations. Paperwork alone kills \njobs. It eliminates people who could pull the wagon, and government \ngrowth and benefits add to the weight of the wagon.\n  So we are in a shutdown, and what has happened? The government has \nshut down some of its revenue centers--the national parks. People drive \nthrough those and they pay to drive through those. There are hotels and \nrestaurants and things. There are concessionaires in there, and they \npay a fee for the right to do that, and they collect money for the \nFederal Government. They are not having any customers. It is hard to be \na business and not have a customer. But we have forced that on them \nwith supposedly shutting down a revenue center for us. People actually \npay for that.\n  The sequester. We made it hurt because there was no preplanning. Now \nwe have the shutdown and we are making it hurt with the barricades and \nclosing the national parks and all the other things that got mentioned \nout here, but it is because of no preplanning.\n  Incidentally, when we talk about ObamaCare and no plan, I had a plan \nbefore President Obama became a Senator, a 10-step plan that would have \ndone more than the present bill does.\n  I worked with Senators Coburn and Burr on a substitute bill which \nwould have done what the President promised would be in the bill but is \nnot in the bill. But there were 60 votes on the other side of the \naisle, and with a few special deals the 60 votes carried the day and we \nare stuck with what will be a train wreck--and then we will get what \nthe Democrats have always wanted, which is single-pay, universal \nservice through the government.\n  But I have a plan for fixing this debt load, pulling the wagon a \nlittle easier. It is called the penny plan. Originally when I \nintroduced the penny plan, which is eliminating 1 penny out of every \ndollar the Federal Government spends, it had to work for 7 years in \norder to balance the budget. We need to be on the downtrend. Seven \nyears wouldn't be so bad. But with the sequester, that turns out to be \n2 years and we would have a balanced budget. We go a couple more years \nand pay down some of this debt we have. The debt keeps me awake nights. \nThat is less than a 10-percent total decrease in what we are spending \nright now. Businesses have to make that kind of a change sometimes in \nless than 1 year, and sometimes it is painful the way they have to do \nit. If we have more time--and 2 years could be quite a bit of time--we \nought to be able to plan our way out of it.\n  So let's quit spending, let's cut up the credit cards. That is the \ndebt limit we are coming up with, that is the credit cards. We could \nallow for a little bit of use of the credit cards--as long as there is \na plan for how we are not going to need the credit cards anymore. And \nthat would be the penny plan. So I hope we would all take a look at it.\n  I do feel sorry for the 8 million Federal employees who I know work \nhard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. ENZI. That is a lot compared to the ones pulling the wagon.\n  I will have some more comments on this later because it is a major \ncrisis, but it didn't need to be a major crisis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent that an extra 5 minutes be added to \nour side later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, we need to bring this government \nshutdown to an end, and the way to do that is for the House of \nRepresentatives to pass the bill for a $986 billion budget to run the \ngovernment for 1 year which John Boehner and the Republicans in the \nHouse of Representatives asked the Senate to pass. That is the number \nthey wanted. That is not the number the Democrats in the Senate wanted.\n  They wanted $986 billion to run the government for 1 year. That is \nthe budget we sent over. They will not pass that budget. So now we have \na situation where we should be negotiating over health care, over \nenvironmental issues, over other issues because the budget has been \npassed--but, no. They are going to hold the entire country hostage.\n  Consider where our country stands right now. When George W. Bush left \noffice, the Dow was at 7,900. It is now above 15,000. At the height of \nthe great Bush recession, unemployment peaked at 10 percent. It is now \nat 7.3 percent. Our deficit has been cut in half. We are making \nprogress. But we are not there yet. Many Americans continue to \nstruggle.\n  As our country climbs back from the worst economic crisis since the \nGreat Depression, the tea party Republicans are sending America into \nreverse. The\n\n[[Page S7221]]\n\ntea party Republicans shut down the government. They are putting our \neconomic recovery at risk. They are signaling to the world that America \ncannot perform the most fundamental job of government--passing a \nbudget.\n  In the alternative, the tea party Republican universe they have \ncreated here has the tea party demanding that we fund health care \nresearch while simultaneously trying to end health care coverage for \nmillions of Americans; to pay for our troops but sideline the \nintelligence agents who keep us safe from terrorist attacks; and claim \nto defend the Constitution but shut down the building where it lives \nand breathes. This tea party Republican logic is tying our country in \nknots, and it makes no sense.\n  Although the government shut down at midnight this past Monday, the \nseeds of the shutdown were sown years ago. This shutdown is the product \nof more than a decade of disdain for the democratic process waged by \nthe tea party Republican party that is increasingly out of the \nmainstream. When the Republican Party started losing congressional \nseats, they redrew electoral maps in their favor and passed laws to \nsuppress American voters they had alienated. And when a historic bill \nwas signed into law to finally make health care a right for millions of \nlow-income Americans, a law that was upheld by the Supreme Court, a law \nthat opened for business on Tuesday, the response of the tea party \nRepublicans was to shut down the entire government.\n  At the core of this tea party Republican ideology is the idea that \nthe democratic processes our country runs on can be dismissed, that \nthey can be manipulated, that they can be contorted to cater to the \nprivileged at the expense of the poor, the vulnerable, and the \ndisenfranchised of our country.\n  This isn't about the Republican Party versus the Democratic Party. \nThis is about tea party Republicans versus democracy itself. The \nessence of American democracy has been our ability to govern by \nmajority rule while respecting minority rights. Our system is \ninherently designed to enable compromise and avoid the divisiveness of \nideological extremists.\n  I know about these tea party extremists. I served in the House of \nRepresentatives with them. They live by the Republican tea party \nparadox: They hate the government so much that they have to run for \noffice in order to make sure the government doesn't work. And now there \nis a new Republican tea party paradox: They want to pay Federal \nemployees not to work while blocking the legislation that will put them \nback to work. The Democrats are fighting to open the government so \nFederal employees can return to work and can earn their pay, not pay \nthem for not working. That is the new Republican paradox.\n  The tea party Republicans have a three-step plan. No. 1: Deny \ndemocracy. Tea party Republicans ignore the fact that the Affordable \nCare Act passed the Congress, was signed by the President, and upheld \nby the Supreme Court. Tea party step No. 2: Manufacture a crisis. The \ntea party Republicans shut down the government and put our country on \nthe brink of default, because they refuse to accept the fact that the \nAffordable Care Act is the law of the land and the American people \nreelected President Obama. Step No. 3: Turn out the lights. Just shut \ndown the government.\n  What is at stake if the Affordable Care Act is repealed? Without the \nAffordable Care Act, for women everywhere in America the agenda will go \nback to being a preexisting condition. They could be charged higher \ninsurance rates because they are women. For families everywhere in \nAmerica, the threat of personal bankruptcy will return, caps on \ninsurance benefits will be reemployed, and medical bills will once \nagain lead to personal bankruptcies. For a young college graduate \nstruggling to find a job, their parents' plan is no longer an option. \nFor a low-income family who has spent years taking their kids to the \nemergency room instead of regular doctor appointments, it will mean \nmore late nights in emergency waiting rooms.\n  Who else will be harmed if the tea party Republicans continue to \nrefuse to expand the Medicaid Program in their respective States, the \nexpansion that is a key part of the Affordable Care Act? The answer is \ntwo-thirds of the country's poor, uninsured African-Americans and \nsingle mothers, and more than half of the low-wage workers in the 26 \nStates where Governors have turned down Federal funds to expand \nMedicare.\n  Let's take Texas, for example. Texas currently has the highest \nconcentration of uninsured Americans in our country--6 million people. \nMany live in poverty. Under the Affordable Care Act, every State has a \nchoice: It could give the poor and sickest and neediest of its citizens \nhealth care coverage through expanded Medicaid paid for entirely by the \nFederal Government or it could say, no, thanks, and leave these poor \npeople, these uninsured people, in a state of uncertainty. Texas turned \ndown cold more than $100 billion in Federal funding over the next \ndecade, denying health care coverage for the 1.5 million Texas \nresidents who live in poverty.\n  That is what the tea party Republicans are fighting for--to not take \nthe money to ensure that the poorest people get health insurance. That \nis what it is all about. That is what they are fighting for. They \nbelieve they have a right to say, no, we are not going to cover these \npoor people. No, we are not going to give them insurance. That is their \nright--they should have the freedom to deny all these people that \nhealth insurance. And 26 other States, all with Republican Governors, \ndid the very same thing. Every State in the Deep South but Arkansas \nsaid no.\n  There is an ancient Greek proverb that says the world will know true \njustice when those who have not been harmed are as angry as those who \nhave been harmed. You can see all across America people are angry. \nPeople who have not been harmed are angry about those who are being \nharmed by what the Republican tea party is doing here in Congress. That \nis why everyone in America wants this shutdown ended. They know that \neliminating the Affordable Care Act would gravely harm the poor in our \ncountry, the children, the working families. Not since the Great \nDepression have so many Americans suffered from such severe economic \nproblems. There are 46 million Americans living in poverty today. That \nis $23,000 a year for a family of 4. The poverty rate for African \nAmericans is 27 percent, for Hispanics it is at 23 percent. There are \nalmost 50 million people in our country at risk of not having enough \nfood. Sixteen million children live in poverty in the United States as \nwe stand here today. There are more than 11 million Americans out of \nwork, 13 percent unemployment for African Americans, 9.2 percent for \nHispanics, and it is too high for Whites, for Asians, for Native \nAmericans--for everyone in our country.\n\n  Behind each of those numbers is a name, each of those statistics is a \nstory, each of those figures is a face and a future that is at risk.\n  Behind each furlough is a Federal worker who has a vital job not \nbeing done. Somewhere in Georgia in the midst of the flu season there \nis an employee of the Centers for Disease Control who is at home \ninstead of stopping a flu outbreak at a local elementary school. \nSomewhere in Florida is an FDA employee who was shut out of his job \ninspecting fish imports for toxic contamination while a mother shops at \nthe local grocery store picking up salmon for dinner. Somewhere in the \ngulf coast there is an oil rig safety officer catching up on their \nchores at home instead of stopping the next potential BP spill before \nit happens. Somewhere in Boston a doctor has now put on hold a clinical \ntrial to bring a new treatment to children born with a rare form of \nheart disease while a mother in Milwaukee holds her sick newborn, \nwondering if a cure could ever be found. Somewhere in Massachusetts a \ncivilian military employee tasked with developing the best in \nprotective gear for our soldiers is barred from entering his military \nbase while abroad a soldier takes fire on the front lines. And here at \nthe Capitol there are police officers who threw their bodies in between \nthe public and a threat just this week, doing so without even receiving \na paycheck.\n  This government shutdown is just a preview of coming attractions. If \nRepublicans force us to default on our debt, millions of jobs could be \ndestroyed. We could go from a shutdown of our government to a meltdown \nof our entire economy.\n\n[[Page S7222]]\n\n  We won't be blackmailed, we won't be threatened, we won't back down, \nwe won't give up. We will stand and we will fight. We will fight for \nthe families who have dreamed of the security of health care, we will \nfight for the Federal workers who deserve a paycheck, we will fight for \nthe working families reaching for the American dream. Because--make no \nmistake--what is at stake here isn't just health care, it isn't just a \nfunctioning government, it isn't just the stability of our economy. \nWhat is at stake is the future of our democratic system. Because you \ncan shut down the government, you can engage in revisionist history and \nrevise the rules to fit your ideology, but the American people will \nrise up--and they are rising up--to say put America back to work. They \nwill not let the tea party Republicans stop the progress of our \ncountry. They are going to demand justice. They are going to demand \nthat the shutdown end and the spirit of the American people be \nrecognized.\n  What we need to do is to get the government back to work for the \nAmerican people. The Senate has to send the House a bill that will end \nthe shutdown. The House should schedule the vote for this bill \nimmediately. It will pass. We should not be cutting the National \nInstitutes of Health, which is working to find the cure for cancer, for \nAlzheimer's, for Parkinson's and other diseases that devastate.\n  We should not be keeping our civilian defense workers off the job. We \nshould be coming together to create jobs to build better futures for \nall Americans. We should make sure America pays its bills and does not \ndefault on its debts. We need to raise the debt ceiling. Now is the \ntime. Let's get to work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, someone wisely declared: After all is said \nand done, much more is said than done. A lot has been said in the well \nof this Chamber this week. Unfortunately, not much has been done. On \nthe other hand, Speaker Boehner and Majority Leader Cantor and the \nMembers of the House of Representatives, including Members of both \npolitical parties, have done much to end the shutdown and to protect \nthe American people. The House has passed bills that would fund \nveterans' benefits and fund the National Institutes of Health. The \nHouse has also approved measures to make sure our National Guard gets \npaid and to keep our national parks open. The House funded WIC, the \nprogram that provides health care and nutrition for low-income women \nand their children. The House has funded FEMA. Moreover, all of these \nbills have been passed with significant bipartisan support in the House \nof Representatives.\n  At the risk of overstating it, I am still frankly stunned at what we \nare hearing from some of my colleagues. It is difficult for me to \nunderstand their objections to passing these bills in the Senate.\n  First, none of these bills is controversial--not one of them. The \nbills provide funding for noncontroversial things such as veterans' \ndisability payments, the GI bill, and cancer research. These bills keep \nour national parks open and make sure our National Guard personnel get \npaid. There are many things on which Republicans and Democrats \ndisagree, but whether to take care of our veterans should not be one of \nthem, and the last I checked it was not one of them.\n  Second, the President himself asked Congress to do this. Republicans \nin the House took the President at his word and acted immediately to \ndraft bills that would make sure his priorities and the Nation's \npriorities would receive funding. In response, Senate Democrats said \nthat this plan to fund veterans, national parks, and other priorities \nwas unserious. They said Republicans were playing games.\n  The biggest head-scratcher of them all: the President issued a veto \nthreat for bills that fund the very things he said he wanted funded. \nWhy will the President and why will Senate Democrats not take yes for \nan answer? Why are they demanding that we fund everything? They tell \nus: You have to fund everything or we will allow you to fund nothing.\n  Third, all of these bills received significant bipartisan support in \nthe House. In the middle of a government shutdown, surrounded by all \nthis divisive rhetoric, Republicans and Democrats came together in the \nHouse overwhelmingly to approve these bills. I think we owe it to the \ncountry to show we can do the same in the Senate.\n  Fourth, this approach, the approach that has been advocated by the \nHouse of Representatives, represents a path forward that was first \nintroduced by none other than the distinguished Senate majority leader \nhimself. On Monday afternoon Senator Harry Reid asked for unanimous \nconsent to pass a bill that ensured that our Active-Duty military \npersonnel would be paid in the event of a government shutdown, and in a \nmatter of minutes it was passed. I ask my friends across the aisle: Was \nSenator Reid playing games? Was that unserious? Of course not. So why \nis it unserious when we try to fund veterans' disability payments or \ncancer research or the National Guard or national parks? Why is it all \nof a sudden playing games to keep our national parks open? What exactly \nhas changed since Monday? Why can we come together to pass a bill \nfunding military pay but not to fund veterans' disability payments?\n  Finally, none of these bills have any connection to the \nimplementation of ObamaCare. I understand my friends across the aisle \nsupport that law despite its numerous and harmful failings. I \nunderstand they want to protect it. But none of the bills we are \nconsidering relate in any way to the implementation of ObamaCare.\n  I am concerned that my friends across the aisle cannot see this law \nfor what it is and what it is already doing to American families all \nacross the country. Now the government is shut down because Democrats \nhave refused to work with us to do anything to protect the American \npeople from the harmful, potentially devastating effects of ObamaCare. \nThey will not even consider passing bills to fund veterans' benefits, \ncancer research, or national parks unless ObamaCare is fully funded and \nfully implemented. We have an obligation to address the negative \neffects of this law, but the Democrats refuse to negotiate.\n  The President has issued a veto threat on funding for things that he \nhimself asked Congress to fund because the bills do not include \nObamaCare funding, even though the programs funded in these bills have \nnothing to do with ObamaCare. I fear that the Democrats are now simply \nthe ObamaCare party. It is the only thing that matters to them even \nthough it is hurting people throughout the country already and \nthreatens to do so far more in the coming months.\n  A recent report included a story of a man named Tom, Tom from \nSeattle, who signed up with the exchanges only to find out that his \nhealth care costs were going to skyrocket under ObamaCare. I will quote \nfrom the story.\n\n       Tom of Seattle, who is self-employed, said, ``My premiums \n     would increase approximately 61 percent. I went from $891 a \n     month to $1,437 a month. And also my deductibles all \n     doubled.''\n       The letter from his insurer said his current deductible for \n     his family of five would double from $4,000 a year to $8,000.\n       Even though that is for the Bronze Plan, the least \n     expensive option under ObamaCare, he says his additional \n     payment of $550 a month will give him a plan that is no \n     better than what he already has.\n       What's more, it also carries a benefit his family does not \n     need: maternity and newborn care.\n       ``My wife is 58 years old and our youngest child is soon to \n     be 18,'' says Tom. ``We'll be having no more children. That \n     is not a benefit that we would ever purchase nor need or be \n     able to use.''\n\n  These are the kinds of people we are trying to protect from this law. \nThis is just one story among many stories.\n  I ask my friends: Join us in ending the shutdown. Join us in \nprotecting the country from ObamaCare, and let's do the right thing for \nthe American people. Leadership is not about what is said; leadership \nis about what is done. So I invite my colleagues to join House Speaker \nBoehner and Majority Leader Cantor and the other House Members who are \nleading. They are leading by doing. We can and must lead. We can end \nthe shutdown and simultaneously protect the American people from the \nharmful effects of ObamaCare. We can do this. We must do this. If we \nstand together in support of the American people, we will do this.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEE. Yes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Through the Chair, I inquire whether, in evaluating\n\n[[Page S7223]]\n\nthe relative activity of the Senate and the House in trying to bring \nthis shutdown to a conclusion, the Senator would not concede that the \nSenate has repeatedly voted on House-passed measures? We have taken \nthem up, stripped out extraneous language, and sent them back. We have \ntabled them. We have over and over done our constitutional duty and \nvoted. The Senator might not like the way the vote came out, but does \nhe concede, A, that we voted on House-passed measures, and B, that the \nSpeaker of the House has never yet called to the floor a Senate-passed \nmeasure and had a fair vote on the House side of the aisle?\n  Mr. LEE. In response to the question posed by my distinguished \ncolleague, my friend from Rhode Island, yes, I will acknowledge that we \nhave taken votes--some votes in response to many of the pieces of \nlegislation enacted within the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. And that the House never reciprocated by taking up a \nSenate-passed bill?\n  Mr. LEE. The House has not voted on all the things passed by the \nSenate just as the Senate has not voted on all the things passed in the \nHouse.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. My question was not whether the House voted on some, \nnot all. I think the fact is that the House voted on nothing the Senate \npassed; they have done nothing but tee up political votes to send over \nto us.\n  Mr. LEE. That is not accurate. The House of Representatives has voted \non things, sent them back in the form of messages, with some of those \nmessages carrying two amendments that we considered. I see the \nSenator's point. It is a valid one in that we have had action taken in \nboth Houses. We have had votes cast in both Houses.\n  It is important, however, to recognize that Republicans have offered \nsignificant elements of compromise in all of this. Republicans started \nfrom the standpoint that what they would like is repeal of the law. \nUnderstanding that is not possible under the current circumstances, \nthey sought first to defund ObamaCare indefinitely. They sought that \nfirst. That was stripped out. That went back to them. They responded \nwith a significant compromise offer in the next go-around to defund it \nfor a period of 1 year. That was send back, that was rejected.\n  There have been other elements since then that have been passed to \nfund parts of government. Recognizing there are a lot of areas in \ngovernment spending as to which there is broad bipartisan, basically \nunanimous consent in both Houses, in both political parties, that we \nought to be continuing to fund those things at those levels, they have \nacted in those areas, and the Senate has so far refused to go along \nwith those. So, in the spirit of compromise, it would be helpful if we \nact on those. In the spirit of compromise, it would be helpful if the \nSenate would act on those aspects of legislation as to which there is \nbroad-based bipartisan support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, my intention coming here was to help solve \nproblems, to find common ground, to work together with colleagues from \nboth sides of the aisle. That is my history, and, in fact, that was my \nprimary motivation for running, for stepping into the shoes of my \nillustrious predecessor, Olympia Snowe of Maine. In fact, that is what \nwe did this summer on student loans when a small bipartisan group of \nSenators worked together to find a compromise, work it through both \nsides of this body, both parties, then through the House and then get \nthe signature of the President. We got 81 votes in the Senate and 392 \nin the House. That is what I want to try to do. That was a validation \nof what I am here for.\n  This situation we are in now cries out for resolution. It cries out \nfor finding common ground, for compromising, getting everybody back to \nwork, getting the government shutdown over. So why are we not doing it? \nWhy aren't we out cutting a deal? Why are we not out compromising?\n  I talk to my colleagues here in the Senate on both sides of the \naisle, talk to House Members, both Republicans and Democrats, and there \nare lots of options. In fact, the House has sent us a series of \noptions. The first one was essentially to defund--effectively repeal \nthe Affordable Care Act, then it was to delay the Affordable Care Act, \nthen it was to delay a part of the Affordable Care Act. But the \nimportant thing about these options and this discussion is that it is \nall taking place in the context of a government shutdown. That is not \nwhere negotiations should be made. That is not where negotiation and \ndiscussion should be had, when essentially the government has been shut \ndown and one side is saying: We won't allow the government to operate \nunless you give us what we want on a substantive piece of legislation.\n  This is the problem. This is why I think in this one case negotiation \nreally is not the right course. It is a process problem, it is a \npractical problem, and I believe it is a constitutional problem. It is \nperfectly appropriate to negotiate budgets. As a Governor, I did it \nfour times for biennial budgets and innumerable supplemental budgets, \nand it is perfectly appropriate to negotiate up to the deadline--lots \nof late nights. That is when this work, for some reason, seems to get \ndone. But in the context of budgets, of negotiating the most \nfundamental governmental document, you negotiate about numbers, about \ndetails, about allocations. You don't negotiate about entirely separate \nsubstantive pieces of law.\n\n  In fact, that happened 1 month ago right here when Leader Reid and \nSpeaker Boehner negotiated a continuing resolution on what the numbers \nshould be, and it was a hot and heavy negotiation. The leader \ncompromised. He said: Let's go forward because we can do this cleanly \nwith a continuing resolution at a lower level than the Senate Democrats \nfelt was appropriate than what was in that budget that was passed \nearlier this year.\n  But that is not what is going on here. We are not negotiating about \nthe dollar amounts of the budget or the details or the allocations, \nsuch as how much will be allocated to defense or how much will be \nallocated to Head Start. This is an attempt to rewrite a major piece of \nsubstantive law through holding the government hostage, which is a \nresult that cannot be achieved through the normal democratic and \nconstitutional processes. That is the core of this current situation, \nand that is what is bothering me about it. I don't mind negotiating \nbudgets. I do think we shouldn't use the threat of a government \nshutdown--or now the reality of a government shutdown--to obtain \nlegislative and policy benefits that we can't otherwise obtain through \nthe normal constitutional process. In a very real sense, this is a \nfrontal assault on the Constitution itself.\n  Ironically, it is being led by many of those who wrap themselves \ndaily in the Constitution. I don't have one of those books, but we all \nknow those books, such as, ``How a Bill Becomes a Law.'' I can \nguarantee you can read those books until, as my father used to say, the \nspots come off, but I guarantee there is nothing in there that says if \nall else fails, hold the government hostage and then you can make a \nlaw. That is not what it says.\n  My wife Mary got me a book when I was first elected called ``Congress \nfor Dummies.'' Even in ``Congress for Dummies,'' it doesn't say you can \nmake laws, change laws, rewrite laws in the context of holding the \ncountry hostage. It is an attempt to create an alternative process, a \nnew shortcut way of achieving political ends without having to deal \nwith those pesky elections.\n  Here is the electoral history of this bill: In 2010, the Affordable \nCare Act was passed in the early summer. There were elections in 2010, \nand, indeed, the Republicans gained substantial seats in the House \nprobably because of concern about the Affordable Care Act. I will \nconcede that. But the Senate didn't turn over. By the way, that is the \nway the Framers planned it, and that is why there are 6-year terms, so \npublic passions in one electoral cycle don't entirely change the \ngovernment.\n  Then there was another election in 2012. In that election, in which \nthe Affordable Care Act was a major factor, Democrats gained seats in \nthe House, gained seats in the Senate, and the President, whose name is \nattached to the bill, won by 5 million votes.\n  In my election in Maine in every debate--and goodness knows there \nwere probably over 20 of them--my Republican opponents started the \ndebate by saying: I want to repeal the Affordable Care Act. That was \nthe whole mission. I defended it--not in every detail because I think \nit needs to be fixed--and\n\n[[Page S7224]]\n\nI won that election and here I am. Mr. Romney said: I will repeal \nObamaCare on day one, but he lost.\n  Here we are, in effect, trying to effectuate that agenda--that policy \nposition--through an alternative process that skips around those \nannoying elections. The passionate opponents of this act are acting as \nif those elections didn't happen.\n  Let's be clear about what this is: This is one faction of one party \nin one House of one branch trying to run the entire U.S. Government.\n  That is not the way our Constitution is supposed to work. I am \nconfident of that statement because from talking to my friends in the \nHouse, I believe it is highly likely that if a clean continuing \nresolution--that means one without any strings, without any political \nbaggage, without any repeal of the Affordable Care Act--went before the \nHouse today, tomorrow or Monday, it would pass. With most of the \nDemocrats and enough Republicans to achieve the majority, the bill \nwould pass and all of this would be over.\n  Yesterday, Speaker Boehner said two things that I think were \nimportant. One I agree with and one I don't. The one I agree with was \nwhen he said this isn't a game. It is not a game. It is it deadly \nserious. It is deadly serious because of the impact this shutdown is \nhaving on our country. It is having a serious impact on people \nthroughout the country and in Maine.\n  Let's talk about this from a national standpoint. Approximately half \nof the civilians in the Department of Defense and 70 percent of our \nintelligence agencies' personnel have been furloughed. Air squadrons \nhave been grounded, there are people who are not being trained, and our \ndefense industrial base is already suffering.\n  In Maine we have 1,500 people on furlough at the Portsmouth Naval \nShipyard and more coming at Bath Iron Works. Almost half of our \nNational Guard people are on furlough.\n  This is not a game. But all of this is being done in the name of \neffectively repealing or crippling the Affordable Care Act. Even if \nthey don't think it is a good law, this is not the way to go about \ndismantling it. It is not the way our Constitution is designed.\n  Why won't we even negotiate? Why aren't the Democrats negotiating on \nthis and maybe nick the Affordable Care Act? It reminds me of a story \nof a city guy who came up to a farmer in Maine. He said: I like the \nlooks of your land. I would like to buy your farm. The farmer said: It \nis not for sale. The city guy said: How about the 50 percent on the \nriver, I would like to buy that. The farmer said: It is not for sale. \nThe city guy said: How about just the quarter acre where your house is \non the road? The farmer said: It is not for sale. Then the city guy \nsays: Why won't you negotiate? Because it is not for sale.\n  This is not the place or time to negotiate. Listen, I think there are \nproblems with the Affordable Care Act. I would love to sit down in good \nfaith with people and try to fix them--starting with making the Web \nsites work better. But I think the way to do that is not in the context \nof the government being held hostage.\n  Here is the real problem: If we do it now, this will become the \nnormal way we legislate around here. This is a 6-week continuing \nresolution. So we nick the Affordable Care Act in this one, then next \ntime it is going to be, OK, we will take another nick.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have 4 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KING. I am afraid this will become the normal way we do things \naround here. Police, intelligence people, and military officers tell us \nthey don't negotiate with hostage-takers, and the reason they don't is \nbecause they would empower, enable, and ensure it will happen again, \nand that is what worries me.\n  Our constitutional system has two principles in tension; one is \ngoverning and the other is checks and balances. Governing is to \nestablish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common \ndefense, promote the general welfare; and, of course, checks and \nbalances is the rest of the Constitution so we are not abused by our \ngovernment. If we take away the governing part, which is what the \nbudget is, nothing is left but checks and balances. The Framers thought \nof this.\n  Madison in the 58th Federalist addressed it directly. He said: It \nmight be a good thing to have minorities have additional power above a \nquorum. He then said:\n\n       But these considerations are outweighed by the \n     inconveniences in the opposite scale. In all cases where \n     justice or the general good requires new laws to be passed, \n     or active measures to be pursued, the fundamental principle \n     of free government would be reversed--\n\n  By minority rule.\n\n     It would no longer be the majority that would rule: the power \n     would be transferred to the minority.\n\n  Lincoln put it much more succinctly:\n\n       If the minority will not acquiesce, the majority must, or \n     the Government must cease. There is no other alternative, for \n     continuing the Government is acquiescence on one side or the \n     other.\n\n  That is what is at stake--governing. I understand the opposition, \nalthough I frankly don't fully understand not wanting people to have \nhealth insurance. I understand the passion, and I understand the \nattempt. I think the Speaker is a good man, and he wants to do the \nright thing.\n  I understand the need to get something and win something in this \nweird atmosphere where everybody has to win or lose. They gave it their \nbest shot. It didn't work. Let's move on. Let's have a clean vote in \nthe House so the American people and the world know we still know how \nto govern. I want to talk, I want to negotiate, and I want to solve \nproblems but not at the expense of this institution, not at the expense \nof the Constitution, and not at the expense of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, yesterday the White House said it is \n``winning'' the shutdown debate, and that it is ``not concerned'' how \nlong the shutdown lasts.\n  The Democrats may be content with playing political games. The \nRepublicans remain focused on finding a solution to reopen the Federal \nGovernment. When the White House says it is winning--maybe winning the \npolitical debate or winning the political game, if you will--it is the \nAmerican people who are losing.\n  The Obama administration said yesterday it would support a measure \nproviding retroactive compensation to furloughed Federal workers. Yet \nit continues to oppose funding for the National Guard and Reserve, \nveterans services, nutrition assistance for low-income Americans, FEMA, \nlifesaving medicines and cures at NIH, and the national parks and \nmuseums.\n  What I would simply say is that there are bills that have been sent \nhere by the House of Representatives that are available to be picked up \nby the Senate at any time. We could fund all of those various things \nright now. The bills are from the House. All we have to do in the \nSenate is to pick them up and pass them, and there wouldn't be any \nobjection on this side of the aisle.\n  We could fund the National Guard and Reserve, we could fund veterans \nservices, we could fund nutrition assistance for low-income Americans, \nwe could fund FEMA, we could fund lifesaving medicines and cures by \nfunding NIH, and we could fund the national parks and museums. It is \nthat simple.\n  Our colleagues on the other side consistently talk about this \nparticular program that is not being funded or this particular Federal \nissue that is not being addressed right now in terms of funding. It can \nall be solved that easily.\n  All they have to do is pick up the bills that have come over to us \nfrom the House of Representatives and pass them right now without \nobjection on the Republican side, and all of these things that are \nbeing talked about could be funded. It is that simple and that easy.\n  I hope in the end there would be some colleagues on the other side \nwho would agree with us that that is the simplest way to deal with the \nimmediate crisis. We obviously have other issues at work and at play \nthat will be discussed. I wish to talk about one of those in just a \nminute, but in the meantime, if we\n\n[[Page S7225]]\n\nare concerned about some of these important programs that are not being \nfunded, we can do that right now. We can take care of the things that \nbenefit people in this country, such as, the people who defend us, the \nNational Guard and Reserve, and the people who want to see our national \nmonuments and parks open. We have heard stories about how those are not \navailable to people across the country. It is very simple. Pick up the \nbills and pass them right now.\n  What I would like to talk about, in addition to getting the \ngovernment back up and running, is doing something to address our \nNation's debt. We find ourselves now on the fifth day of a partial \ngovernment shutdown that--from my perspective--was completely \navoidable. We know the government shutdown is only one of the \nchallenges we are currently facing. The Treasury tells us we are going \nto be reaching our debt limit in the coming days, which astonishingly \nstands at almost $17 trillion.\n  As we look at the near future, we need to address the debt limit, and \nwe need to end this partial government shutdown. I think it is \nunavoidable. Those two issues have sort of converged and come together. \nAt one time, we were going to be talking about addressing one and then \nsubsequently dealing with the debt limit. Now it looks as if those are \nall going to be one big debate and discussion.\n  What I am perplexed about is our friend on the other side of the \naisle and the President who continue to insist they are not going to \nnegotiate on those issues. When the people of South Dakota sent me to \nWashington, they did so with the expectation that I will continue to \nstand for their values. They also know that when it comes to governing, \nthere will be differences of opinion. Oftentimes that means we are \ngoing to have to sit down together with people on the other side of the \nissue to find common ground.\n  But to say it is my way or the highway is not the way to approach \nthese issues. These are issues that are important to both individuals \nand our economy, and they just can't say we are not going to negotiate. \nThat is not a viable or a reasonable position in the eyes of the \nAmerican people.\n  To put a fine point on that, earlier this week the majority leader \nwas quoted as saying:\n\n       The president said he's not going to negotiate on the debt \n     ceiling. He's not going to negotiate, we aren't either. It \n     has never happened in the history of the country.\n\n  At the end of last week while the President was out giving political \nspeeches, instead of engaging with Congress to solve these issues, the \nPresident made this statement:\n\n       And that's why I said this before. I am going to repeat it. \n     There will be no negotiations over this.\n\n  That is the President of the United States.\n  There will be no negotiations over this, reiterated by our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle in the Senate.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. THUNE. I would be happy to yield when I have concluded my \nremarks, on the time of the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I think the reason Republicans here in the \nSenate find this stance so perplexing is that the characterization we \nhave never negotiated around a debt ceiling is absolutely not true. \nDeficit reduction measures over the last several decades have been \npaired with increases in the debt ceiling. Almost 30 years ago, we had \nthe Balanced Budget Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, otherwise \nknown as Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. I was a staffer here at the time. That \nwas done in the context of the debt ceiling.\n  We had several measures in the 1990s that reduced our deficits that \nwere done in association with an increase in the debt ceiling.\n  Most recently, we all remember the Budget Control Act of 2011, which \nresulted in restraint largely on the discretionary side of the budget, \nwhich many of us would like to change; but it has also resulted, for \nthe first time since the 1950s, in 2 consecutive years where the \nFederal Government spent less than it spent the previous year--the \nfirst time since the Korean war. The common denominator is that these \ndeals were paired with an increase in the debt ceiling.\n  The point I am trying to make, for those of my friends who are \narguing that negotiating around our debt ceiling is unprecedented, is \nperhaps they ought to take a closer look at history.\n  This week, Kevin Hassett and Abbey McCloskey of the American \nEnterprise Institute wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal entitled \n``Obama Rewrites Debt-Limit History,'' which I think characterizes the \nhistory of the debt limit in a more accurate way. They write:\n\n       According to the Congressional Research Service, Congress \n     voted 53 times from 1978 to 2013 to change the debt ceiling.\n\n  So 53 times in those 35 years of recent history.\n  They go on to write:\n\n       Congressional Republicans who want legislative conditions \n     in exchange for a debt-limit increase are following a \n     strategy that has been pursued by both parties the majority \n     of the time. Of the 53 increases in the debt limit, 26 were \n     ``clean''--that is, stand-alone, no strings-attached \n     statutes. The remaining debt-limit increases were part of an \n     omnibus package of other legislative bills or a continuing \n     resolution. Other times, the limit was paired with reforms, \n     only some of which were related to the budget.\n\n  To reiterate, out of 53 increases in the debt limit, less than half \nwere what we say are clean or stand-alone measures. The others had \nother legislation associated with them, in many cases an omnibus \npackage of legislative bills or continuing resolutions or deficit \nreduction measures.\n  To make that happen again, what we need is leadership. We need \nleaders on the other side of the aisle, including the President, to \ncome to the table in good faith to make the tough decisions.\n  I have to say I find it concerning that instead of coming to the \ntable this week, the President has embarked on a media blitz suggesting \nRepublicans in Congress want to default on the debt. In an interview \nthis week with CNBC's John Harwood, the President stated that he \nrecently told representatives from the financial services sector \nvisiting Washington that they should ``be concerned.'' They should be \nconcerned over a faction of Congress that is willing potentially to \ndefault.\n  In my view, these statements are both unproductive and misguided. \nNobody wants default. Nobody wants a government shutdown. I can assure \nthe President and my friends on the other side of the aisle that \nRepublicans here in the Senate couldn't agree more that those are \nthings we need to avoid.\n  What I would suggest is that instead of simply kicking the can down \nthe road, instead of pushing the difficult decisions off until \ntomorrow, we have to get serious about the long-term fiscal health of \nour country so we can grow our economy and help strengthen our middle \nclass. Rather than stoking fears that rankle financial markets and \ndamage the economy, now is the time to move beyond politics and to work \nwith congressional Republicans to make a significant downpayment to \naddress America's long-term debt problems.\n  Republicans are seeking responsible and reasonable solutions. South \nDakotans, and I think the American people, understand that choosing to \ndo nothing when it comes to the debt while piling it on the backs of \nfuture generations is not a responsible way to continue to govern our \ncountry. I would pose to my Democratic colleagues that Republicans \nstand ready to come to the negotiating table and act in good faith to \nget the government up and running again and to make responsible \nspending reforms that address the true drivers of our debt.\n  I hope our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will take a \nlesson from history and not suggest they are not going to negotiate. \nThat is not a viable position in the eyes of the American people, and \nit is not a viable position if we want to work in a way that is going \nto lead to an accomplishment and a result here in Washington, DC, on \nthese issues and matters that are of great importance not only to today \nbut to the future of this country.\n  I would simply say again, as I said when I began, having a position \nthat we are not going to negotiate on a government shutdown and we are \nnot going to negotiate on a debt limit increase is inconsistent with \nwhat the American people have said they want\n\n[[Page S7226]]\n\nto see done. The latest poll I saw shows that by a 2-to-1 margin, \nAmericans think we ought to be around the debt limit increase figuring \nout what we are going to do about the debt. That is what the American \npeople think. It is also unrealistic to think we are going to be able \nto solve our problems, and it is inconsistent with what history has \nshown us in the past, that when we have been able to accomplish \nsomething, we have been willing to sit down together in the context of \nraising the debt limit which, by the way, will be over $17 trillion \nwhen this is all said and done. I think the American people believe we \nare going to ask for another debt limit increase to raise that by \nperhaps another $1 trillion, borrowing limit. They would like to see us \ndo something meaningful to address the incredible, burgeoning, \nexploding Federal debt we are putting on the backs of our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  I see the Senator from Rhode Island is up next, and if he would like, \non his time, to ask a question, I would, through the Chair, entertain \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Dakota. I noticed he was on the floor during the remarks of the \nPresiding Officer, the Senator from Maine, a few moments ago. Having \nheard those remarks, I ask the Senator from South Dakota if he would \nconcede that there is a difference between negotiating and negotiating \nwith hostages; whether the hostage is shutting down the government or \nwhether the hostage is defaulting on the U.S. obligations, there is a \ndifference between negotiating and negotiating while holding hostages.\n  Mr. THUNE. I would say through the Chair, to my colleague from Rhode \nIsland, that I think what makes a negotiation successful is when both \nsides are sufficiently motivated. It strikes me, at least, that if we \nare going to have a successful outcome, both sides have to have \nincentives to be at the table.\n  I think Republicans have indicated very clearly that we believe one \nof the ways in which we get legislation, policy put in place that is \ngood for the future of this country is to do it around a debt limit \nincrease. Historically, that has been the case. That has been a \nprecedent. It has been very clear, as I mentioned, throughout the \ncourse of modern history that many of the big budget agreements we have \nreached have been done in the context of a debt limit increase. So I \nwould suggest to my colleague from Rhode Island that whatever the \nmotivation is for getting people to the table, we just need to get to \nthe table.\n  We have had a lot of, on both sides of the aisle, I would say, in \nfairness, people questioning each other's motives. But we are in a \npretty tough spot right now. We have a government that is shut down \nthat we need to get reopened. We have a debt limit we are going to hit \nin the next couple of weeks. I hope we can sit down in good faith and \nfigure out where we can find a common path forward that will allow us \nto govern in a responsible and a reasonable way, but to address what I \nthink are the big issues facing the future of this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I note that the President and Leader \nReid have both indicated a very open willingness to negotiate on \nvirtually anything. But in light of the difference the Presiding \nOfficer pointed out on the floor a moment ago between good-faith \nnegotiating under our established constitutional procedures and \nnegotiating while holding hostage either the continuing operation of \nthe Federal Government or a U.S. default on its obligations for the \nfirst time in history, that that difference does indeed bear on this \ndiscussion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, today marks the fifth day of the \nshutdown. I come to the Senate floor once again to call on the House of \nRepresentatives to take up the Senate bill. It is a simple bill. It has \nno bells and whistles. It simply says, Let's open the government again. \nLet's open all the monuments. Let's open up the research that is going \non at the National Institutes of Health which is important to save \nlives. Let's put our intelligence employees, who every day are putting \nthemselves at risk trying to gather intelligence data, back to work. \nAnd then let's take those 6 weeks to do what the Senator from South \nDakota was talking about, which is to negotiate a bigger deal, a budget \ndeal.\n  One of the things I have been concerned about is that the Senate has, \nin fact, passed a budget, the House has, in fact, passed a budget, but \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle will not let those two \nbudgets go to conference committee as they are supposed to do so we can \nwork out the differences and have a long-term solution. The solution is \nnot to shut the government down.\n  What has happened? The Senator from Maine, the Presiding Officer, did \na good job of reviewing what has gone on over the past few weeks. \nFirst, we passed a sensible bill to keep the government open at low \nspending levels--sequestration levels, as we call them here--with the \nspending cuts included, because we knew that was a compromise, but we \nknew that was a way we could get our friends from the other side of the \naisle to agree to have a further negotiation period. Instead, we got \nback a bill that would have delayed the Affordable Care Act--something \nthey knew very well the President would veto and the Senate would not \nagree to. Now we have gotten a series of bills where they have agreed \nto keep certain agencies open--sort of government by Whack-a-Mole. One \nproblem comes up; OK, we will get that one done. Oh, maybe there is a \nbig merger that has been proposed that has antitrust problems and could \ncost consumers money. Maybe we will put a few antitrust lawyers back to \nwork. Oh, I guess there is an imminent threat going on right now, so \nlet's add a few intelligence officers. Let's handle that one. Maybe \nthere is a foodborne illness problem that has developed in part of the \ncountry. Maybe we have to put some of those Centers for Disease Control \nemployees back to work.\n  That is no way to govern in business and that is no way to govern the \ngreatest Nation on Earth. We are a democracy that has been a model for \nthe rest of the world. This is not the answer.\n  What is the next vehicle we got? Today we found out they have voted \nto pay furloughed workers. That is something I support. That is \nsomething most of the Senators here support. OK. But does this make \nsense, that they would decide to do that today and then not also vote \nto put them back to work? They are essentially deciding they are going \nto pay them--which I support--that they are going to pay them, but they \nare going to pay them to stay at home. This doesn't make sense in \nLanesboro, MN. This doesn't make sense in Detroit Lakes, MN. They \nbelieve Federal workers have been hired to do a job and it is time to \nput them back to work, and that is what this debate is about.\n  These are the things I have been hearing from my constituents. I have \nsome random letters that came in on our e-mail system over the last few \ndays. Here is a letter from Jason of St. Paul. He says:\n\n       I am a Minnesota resident currently on active duty in the \n     U.S. Navy on deployment in the Middle East for my 2nd tour . \n     . . As a military member, if I did not do my job I'd be \n     putting the lives of my friends and fellow military members \n     at risk.\n\n  Jason is a Navy reservist on active duty. He continues:\n\n       At home, I am a full-time professional firefighter and EMT \n     for the St. Paul Fire Department. If I chose to fail on my \n     duties when a fire call came in, people would die. Similarly, \n     the shutdown in the U.S. Government--\n\n  He says,\n\n       I know it happened in the House, and that the Senate passed \n     a bill, sorry--\n\n  He adds that, and then he says:\n\n     The shutdown of the U.S. Government is unacceptable. I work \n     in a coalition office with several other European officers \n     from other navies and I am embarrassed at what I see from \n     Congress. I urge you with all of my being to work to resolve \n     this. I am confident that you can get the job done.\n\n  Next, Lisa from Oakdale, MN:\n\n       Senator Klobuchar, I am 39 years old and have never \n     contacted a representative until now. I felt compelled to do \n     so today because as a federal civilian employee, I want to \n     express my extreme disappointment. I have dedicated my career \n     to federal service, which I am now considering changing given \n     this unfairness. Please work to resolve the budget as quickly \n     as possible so my husband and I can return to work.\n\n\n[[Page S7227]]\n\n\n  That is what Lisa said.\n  The House of Representatives said, rightfully so, they would pay her \nwhile she is at home, but they didn't send her back to work. They \ndidn't do what she asked for in this letter. They didn't send her back \nto work. She simply wants to do her job.\n  Here is a letter from Pamela from Young America, MN, a farmer:\n\n       Please do whatever you can to stop the government shutdown. \n     We have 14 acres of land enrolled in the CRP program \n     [Conservation Reserve Program] and our rental payment is to \n     be made to us this first week of October. As long as the \n     government shutdown is in place our CRP payments are delayed. \n     We depend on this money as it is not a small amount for our \n     family. There are many farmers/land owners in this same \n     situation. Please stop the shutdown.\n\n  Well, I hope the House of Representatives is listening to Pamela of \nYoung America, MN, today.\n  Kathy from Braham, MN:\n\n       I am an employee of the Social Security Administration, \n     Office of Disability Adjudication and Review.\n       I have seen you intervene on matters for claimants who have \n     disability hearings pending. I am furloughed as part of the \n     government shutdown. If you want your constituents' hearings \n     addressed, I need to be at work in my office.\n\n  Is she talking about pay in this letter? Of course she wants to get \npaid, and she is going to get her pay, and she should, but that is not \nwhat she is talking about. She is talking about doing her job and \ngetting back to work. Yet today the House of Representatives voted to \npay workers to stay home. OK, we want to pay them but not to put them \nback at work, when that is all she is asking to do.\n  Alicia from Hastings, MN:\n\n       Dear Senator Klobuchar:\n       I am writing to express my extreme concern over the federal \n     government shutdown. I am a teacher, a mother of three boys \n     and the wife of a furloughed veteran who works for the \n     Minnesota Air National Guard. I have never before written a \n     letter to my representatives, but feel so utterly helpless \n     and frustrated at this time; I need to voice my concern.\n       My concern at this time is that those in Congress have \n     forgotten about people like me, like those in my family, and \n     those in my community. I feel like an inconsequential number, \n     a nameless and faceless casualty in a game that has no \n     winners. I am concerned that my family's experience is lost \n     in the rhetoric exchanged between party members. I am \n     concerned that we are the forgotten and nameless . . . \n     collateral damage in a philosophical debate.\n       At this point in time, my husband, who is a veteran working \n     full-time for the Minnesota Air National Guard, is out of \n     work because he is a federal employee not deemed essential. I \n     am afraid that not only are the other 800,000 laid-off \n     federal employees deemed non-essential, but the rest of the \n     American citizens are non-essential as well. . . . Our \n     struggles are real-life struggles; not a game, not \n     philosophical, not in theory, not distant and not imaginary. \n     My hope is that those struggles and hardships matter to you, \n     and in a real way. . . . I am hoping you will understand the \n     urgency of this situation for my family and for the thousands \n     of others whom you directly impact on a daily basis. I don't \n     want any representatives to forget the real people affected \n     by these decisions. . . . That is your duty. That is your \n     charge. That is your enormous task. . . . I hope that I can \n     count on you to look out for my family and the many others \n     you affect. I hope that you will consider our lives and \n     hardships. . . . Thank you for your efforts to . . . solve \n     this situation.\n\n  She does not want to be inconsequential. She does not want to be non-\nessential--not just her husband, who is furloughed, but she as a \ncitizen of this country. Again, is she asking for money? Of course they \nwant to get paid, and they will get paid, but that is not what this is \nabout. This is about her husband getting back to work to do the duties \nhe was hired to do by the American people.\n  This is a simple bill. It simply allows them to go back to work.\n  I am heartened by the fact that the number--I think it is at 22 House \nMembers now on the Republican side--who have said they want to vote on \nthis Senate bill. That is a magic number. That is enough to pass it. We \nhave to let that bill come up for a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise today in order to talk about the \nimpact of the current government shutdown on Hawaii's Federal workers.\n  Here in Washington, we debate in what most people consider \nabstractions. We use terms such as ``ObamaCare,'' ``filibuster,'' and \n``discretionary spending.'' We talk about government programs and \ninitiatives in the aggregate and in the abstract. Hardly a day goes by \nthat we do not hear about some program costing in the millions and \nbillions. While we use these terms and concepts when debating the nuts \nand bolts of government policy, what we need to always keep in mind is \nthat these dollars and these terms impact real people, real lives.\n  The work of the Senate is to debate and to deliberate with the goal \nof finding consensus solutions to the challenges our Nation faces. The \ncore of what we do is about people, families, and communities. When we \nget away from thinking this way, when we focus on the abstractions and \nthe slogans and who is winning the day's media war, it becomes easy to \nforget what we are all here for. When we forget that, we find ourselves \nunable to move forward and find consensus. We lose focus on the people, \nfamilies, and communities that sent us here.\n  Public service is a privilege. It is also a responsibility. When we \nstand for election or enter public service in some other way, we are \ncommitting to put ourselves in the back, behind the people for whom we \nwork and serve.\n  So today, as we mark another day of a government shutdown, I would \nlike to share some stories with my colleagues, stories about people and \nfamilies affected by the shutdown.\n  I have received letters like my colleague from Minnesota has received \nletters from her constituents, from people of all ages, serving in \ndifferent capacities and at different Federal Government agencies, and \neven some who are just embarking on a path to public service. These are \nall people dedicated to their work and dedicated to their country. The \ndamage we are doing by not getting these folks back on the job is \nserious and impacts our national security, our economy, and a host of \nnecessary services upon which the people of our country depend.\n  This shutdown and the debate around it is undermining a commitment to \npublic service for many people. It is damaging the effectiveness of our \ninstitutions, and it is unnecessarily putting many families in Hawaii \nand across the Nation in a state of uncertainty and anxiety.\n  One furloughed man who wrote to me expressed these views clearly. He \nsaid:\n\n       As a U.S. Air Force civilian, I am a furloughed employee. \n     Hawaii has nearly the highest percentage of federal workers. \n     This has a huge impact on the Aloha state. Unlike the recent \n     sequester, one can't scale back when nothing is coming in.\n       Some lower-grade workers may lose their homes and with it \n     their sense of pride for choosing to work for the govt. \n     That's the reality of this shutdown.\n\n  He went on:\n\n       By Oct 9, we'll have lost more than the recent sequester \n     cuts. Many have not overcome that and now we're summarily \n     discharged. And the debt ceiling debate is next? I work in an \n     office of 10 or so. Half active duty, half civilian. We \n     provide the continuity needed year in and year out to manage \n     instrument procedures at all our bases in the Pacific Air \n     Forces. . . .\n\n  He goes on:\n\n       Are we ``non-essential'' employees? I respectfully ask \n     Speaker Boehner to ask them. I'm upset that a few politicians \n     are holding my country, my community, and yes, my family \n     hostage for political brinksmanship. . . . I stand with you, \n     Leader Reid and the ``responsible'' Republicans in the U.S. \n     House that want to get our nation moving again.\n\n  Another constituent wrote to me about the impact of the shutdown on \nher family. She said:\n\n       As the wife of an ``essential personnel'' government \n     employee, I would like to tell you that the shutdown is \n     devastating. We are parents of three children, one of whom is \n     special needs and requires expensive measures daily to \n     survive. Without a paycheck, we will be unable to pay our \n     bills, buy food, support our children. Many, many middle \n     class federal employee families are in the same boat. Savings \n     will not support us indefinitely.\n       My husband is, right now as we speak, at work doing his \n     duty, protecting the American public against foodborne \n     illness and contamination. Yet he is doing it with no pay. We \n     are devastated. Please please tell our story. Tell the \n     Republicans who have not crossed the aisle to please be \n     reasonable and fund the government. They can argue later. \n     Children are paying the price for the shutdown.\n\n  As of right now, at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, three of our \nNation's nuclear submarines are in drydock. Work on them stopped due to \nthe shutdown. One of the shipyard workers wrote this to me:\n\n\n[[Page S7228]]\n\n\n       Mazie, I am an employee of Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. The \n     shutdown has left my co-workers and myself with a sense of \n     trepidation, insecurity and angst. Most of the hard working \n     dedicated and patriotic federal civilian employees I work \n     with live paycheck to paycheck due to the high cost of living \n     in our islands. I have fears of not being able to pay my \n     mortgage on time in November.\n       But more importantly Mazie, the operational readiness of \n     our Pacific Fleet is in jeopardy because we aren't able to \n     keep our ships ``Fit To Fight'' if we can't go to work, \n     repair them and meet schedule deadlines for returning them to \n     operational status. Our workload already is stretching our \n     resources and demanding we perform more with less. How can we \n     recover a day, a week, a month or more sitting at home when \n     so much is at stake? The long term consequences of this \n     shutdown has ripple effects that are not one for one but a \n     much longer period when moving a large industrial workforce \n     back into a rhythm of productivity and efficiency. Please \n     continue to work with your colleagues in Congress and \n     convince them to end this shutdown sooner rather than later.\n\n  This letter is an example of the selflessness of so many workers. \nWhile he is concerned about himself and his colleagues, his greater \nconcern is for the impact this shutdown will have on our Nation's \nsecurity.\n  I have also received letters from people just starting out in life \nand in public service. For example, one young woman wrote me:\n\n       I am in jeopardy of losing my AmeriCorps VISTA placement, \nwhich would prevent me from developing essential workplace skills, and \nan education stipend that would lighten the load of my student loan \ndebt.\n\n  Another shared this:\n\n       My husband and I are closing on our first condo today, \n     Tuesday, October 2nd and are now faced with the challenge of \n     my husband not receiving a paycheck during the shutdown. He \n     is a government employee who is expected to work during the \n     shutdown without a payday in sight. I am extremely nervous \n     now about paying our mortgage and other essential bills when \n     I should be excited about our first home purchase. I know \n     eventually this will be straightened out but at what cost to \n     us? We are both in our early 30's trying to make a life \n     together and like many obstacles, this is another setback. I \n     hope this comes to an end quickly.\n\n  These are people just starting to make their way in the world. They \nare working hard and doing all the right things. Yet, through no fault \nof their own, they are facing uncertainty and are likely questioning \nwhether they have chosen the right path.\n  The last letter I would like to share today--and I will be sharing \nmore in the coming days about other areas of Hawaii's economy that have \nbeen impacted--is one that I hope my colleagues will think about as we \ngo forward. This couple wrote:\n\n       My spouse and I are both federal employees, with a combined \n     public service commitment of over 50 years. We have seen and \n     lived through many congressional sessions and many more \n     shenanigans, but neither of us can recall a time when the \n     truculence of a few has caused so much hurt in the lives of \n     so many. I am ``essential;'' my husband is not. We will get \n     by.\n       Others are not so lucky. Our administrative assistants, for \n     example, both of whom are barely hanging on, trying to feed \n     their kids on the same pay they received three years ago \n     while the costs of health insurance, transportation, and \n     housing have continued to rise, are now not being paid at \n     all.\n       Our daughter, for example, over $200,000 in student loan \n     debt, who tends to our veterans as a physician in a VA \n     hospital, still had to come up with her rent on Tuesday and \n     still has to pay for healthy food and quality daycare so that \n     she can go to work, but not get paid.\n\n  These people devoted their careers to serving the public, helping \npeople, and making our country a better place.\n  I ask my colleagues to think: How long will this couple's daughter or \nthe administrative assistants they mention in their letter continue to \nhang on and stay in public service? If our political system cannot \nfunction, our institutions and the people who work in them and rely on \ntheir services suffer.\n  One of the most damaging legacies of this shutdown could be the \ncrisis of confidence it will create among the American people toward \ntheir own government. That would be devastating.\n  I am not arguing that government should be the answer to all of our \nproblems, provide all of our services, but the services it does provide \nshould be worthy of the people, families, and communities we are \nproviding them for. Having a dedicated Federal workforce is central to \nthat goal, and our job as Senators is to give that workforce confidence \nthat their work is valued, that they are valued, that their \ncontributions are worthwhile. This shutdown fails miserably in all of \nthose respects.\n  We have the privilege of serving in the Senate. Let's do our job for \nthe people all across our country who, like all these people who wrote \nto me and who wrote to all my other colleagues, expect nothing less of \nus.\n  Let's reopen the government. Speaker Boehner, let the House vote on \nthe bill that the Senate sent to you. Let's get back to working on what \nwe can do better to serve the people, families and communities that \ngave us the privilege to be here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Hawaii \nfor her comments and say that on the basis of what this Senator just \ndiscovered, having gone down to the other end of the Capitol, it is \ngoing to take a lot of loud voices to get the Speaker to hear us \nbecause they have shut down. They have gone home. They are not even \ncoming back until next Monday.\n  I was just wandering through this deserted Capitol. I encountered \nCongressman Steny Hoyer, one of the great leaders of the Congress, who \nis the minority whip now and used to be majority leader in the House of \nRepresentatives. He just gave me this report.\n  Those chambers down there at the other end are darkened. Here we are, \non the basis of a small group of people in the House of Representatives \nwho insist on having it their way or no way, we have all of these \npeople and all of these specific events that all of these Senators have \nchronicled of the deprivation of the lack of security. I mean you can \ngo on and on as a result of the shutdown.\n  This Senator is going to enumerate a few examples of that while the \ntwo Senators from Hawaii and the Senator from Wisconsin are here, and \nthe great presiding officer, one of the bright lights of the new class \nthat just came into the Senate.\n  If you really examine what is the problem--the problem--it actually \ngoes back to the Hebrew Scriptures, in the Hebrew Scriptures, to two \ncommandments that then were reiterated by Jesus in the new Scriptures.\n  The first commandment: Love God with all your heart, mind, soul, and \nstrength. The second is likened to it: Love your neighbor as yourself. \nThere is a practical ``how to'' for what we know as the Golden Rule: \nTreat others as you want to be treated. That is a practical application \nof the second great commandment of: Love your neighbor as yourself.\n  It is part of the root of the problem we see. It is not only gripping \nthe capital city of the United States, where people are so ingrown and \ninsular and unwilling to respect the other fellow's point of view and \nwork out their differences--the very underpinnings of the greatness of \nour democracy that has lasted over 2\\1/4\\ centuries is on that basic \nprinciple of: Treat others as you would want to be treated.\n  In other words, in the political context, do what Tip O'Neill and \nRonald Reagan used to do: Have your fights, but at the end of the day, \nrespect each other so when it is time to do the deal, you can come \ntogether and resolve your differences.\n  Another great model for this Senator when he was a young Congressman \nwere the two leaders in the House of Representatives: Tip O'Neill, the \nDemocratic Speaker, and Bob Michel, the Republican leader. It is the \nsame kind of relationship that Tip had with the President.\n  They would fight like the dickens during the day, but they kept that \npersonal respect through a personal friendship, so that even though \nthey vigorously disagreed about an issue, they realized that they were \nnot the only ones in this country, that there were other people who \nthought differently than they did, and in the grand tradition of \nAmerican democracy, when it was time to build a consensus to achieve a \nworkable solution, then they could come together and work it out.\n  But what we see is a small--very, I would dare say--totally inward-\nlooking group that thinks that they know it all and that their opinion \nis the only opinion, and that they have the political leverage since \nthe Speaker of the House has said that he will only pass something with \nRepublican votes. By the\n\n[[Page S7229]]\n\nway, it did not used to be that way. They now call that the Hastert \nrule, named after Speaker Hastert.\n  Before that, it did not used to be that way. We used to pass \nlegislation in the House of Representatives with Republican and \nDemocratic votes. I give you that great example. I want to give you one \nof the finest examples of government being able to work during a time \nof economic emergency. It was in 1983. We were within 6 months of \nshutting down Social Security because Social Security was starting to \nrun out of money, where it could not make its full payments. It would \nhave made partial payments.\n  Those two Irishmen, Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan, said: We are going \nto fix it. The first thing we are going to do is to take this iron rail \nof American politics, and we are going to take it off the table to be \nused as a hammer to beat your opponent over the head with in the next \nelection. Then we are going to appoint a blue-ribbon panel. They are \ngoing to bring back their recommendation to the Congress, and we are \ngoing to pass it.\n  All of that occurred. It passed overwhelmingly and made Social \nSecurity actuarially sound for the next half century, into the 2030s, \nall the way from 1983. That is an example of the finest traditions of \ngoverning under the American constitutional method in our democratic \nsystem.\n  So when you get at loggerheads in a time such as this, where is that \nrespect--that genuine respect and not that superficial respect, that \nrespect that fortunately we show to each other out here on the floor of \nthe Senate. But where is that genuine respect, and where is that \nrecognition? Those words over the presiding officer are scrolled in the \nmarble: E Pluribus Unum. Out of many, one. We gain our unity from many \npeoples, many ideas, but we all think of ourselves unum, as one, as \nAmericans.\n  That is what we are missing. You boil all of this down, and that is \nwhat is going on in American politics today. We do not talk to each \nother. We are shouting past each other. Turn on your cable TV. Look at \nthe shouting match there. Turn on one cable network and you get only \none perspective. Turn on another cable network and you get another \nperspective. We are not talking to each other. We are not.\n  Also, as the good book says, as Lyndon Johnson as President often \nreminded us: Come, let us reason together. That is what is happening. I \nsee other Senators that want to speak here. I have got a whole bunch of \nthings that I wanted to enumerate that are happening in the State of \nFlorida, where the shutdown of the Federal Government is affecting the \nState government. I am not going to list those so that my colleagues \ncan go on and speak.\n  I have got a bunch of issues to talk about related to national \nsecurity, where we are genuinely harmed today with the shutdown of the \ngovernment. I want to point out that one of our military commanders--it \nhappens to be a tanker unit, the big KC-135 tankers. They fly and \nrefuel all of our aircraft. They refuel in the air.\n  He said, ``We are effectively shut down.'' Another commander of \nanother active duty wing, Colonel DeThomas says that when you take the \nfurloughs, these furloughs on top of the 6 days that they lost unpaid \nin the sequester in the last fiscal year, which ended September 30, he \nsays: You do that, and it creates a double whammy. That is what is \nhappening. That is just one little snippet of our national security. I \nam so glad that these colleagues are here to speak. I will share all of \nthe details that I intended to share at a later time. I thank the \nSenators for their attention.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to deliver \na message from the people of Wisconsin. They are fed up with the \npolitical games that are being played here in Washington. They have had \nenough. On Tuesday, Congress failed the American people and our \ngovernment shut down because the tea party faction in the House put \ntheir own personal agendas and partisan politics ahead of progress for \nthe American people.\n  The Republican leadership in the House could end this shutdown by \nsimply letting the House vote on the Senate-passed bill to fund the \ngovernment. Instead, the Speaker of the House has, for over a week, \nprevented the House from voting on a clean funding bill that would open \nthe entire Federal Government.\n  In my home State of Wisconsin, we believe in hard work. We believe \nthat hard work should be respected and rewarded.\n  Every day people get up and go to work to build a better life for \nthemselves and their families. They trust in the promise that if you \nwork hard and play by the rules, you will get ahead.\n  They are right to expect that both parties in Washington work \ntogether to help keep that promise. They are right to expect that both \nparties in Washington work together to respect the hard work of \nAmericans who have helped lift this country up from the worst recession \nsince the Great Depression. They are right to expect that both parties \nin Washington work together to reward the hard work of families and \nsmall business owners who, through sheer grit and determination, have \nbeen moving our economy and our country forward.\n  In my home State of Wisconsin, our State motto is one word: Forward. \nThe people of Wisconsin live up to that motto every single day, and I \nwould say all Americans do as well.\n  As I stand here today, in the midst of the fifth day of a government \nshutdown, I can't say that Congress has. Instead of working together to \nmove our economy and our country forward, the Republican leadership in \nthe House has offered day after day of political games and \nbrinkmanship.\n  Here is the price: In Wisconsin, more than 800 workers in the \nNational Guard are off the job--hard-working people who have committed \nthemselves to public service, to something bigger than themselves. They \nget up every day and work for our common good. They deserve to have a \nCongress that does the same.\n  These are particularly tough times for my State. Even as the national \neconomy is rebuilding and rebounding, my State's economy has lagged \nbehind the rest of the Nation. Our economy cannot afford to have the \ntea party extremists in the House making it harder for small business \nowners to create jobs.\n  Their shutdown has blocked small business loans and investments in \nWisconsin and that threatens our ``made in Wisconsin'' economy and \ntradition, our work ethic, and our entrepreneurial spirit.\n  Due to this tea party shutdown, Wisconsin's small businesses are \nmissing out on about $3.5 million in SBA-supported loans every day. \nThat means Wisconsin's small businesses have been denied access to \ncritical loans since this shutdown began.\n  We know the majority of new jobs in the United States are created by \nstartups, and small businesses are engines of our economy, creating two \nout of every three new jobs. Our economy needs to have a Congress that \nis supporting and strengthening small business efforts, not a Congress \nthat steers from one manufactured crisis to another.\n  Groundbreaking research, supported by the National Institutes of \nHealth, adds more than $800 million a year to Wisconsin's economy. We \nshould all be able to agree, both parties in the House and the Senate, \nthat in order for America to outinnovate the rest of the world we must \nprotect and strengthen our investments in research, science, and \ninnovation.\n  The failure of the House leadership to step up and actually lead has \nput in place a shutdown that is threatening Wisconsin's leadership on \nbioenergy research and on biomedical research. This failure in \nleadership in the House means new patients are being turned away from \nthe benefits of cancer research being done at the University of \nWisconsin.\n  On a broader scale, our NIH Director, Dr. Francis Collins, told the \nWall Street Journal on Tuesday that as long as the government is shut \ndown, the National Institutes of Health says it will turn away roughly \n200 patients each week from its clinical research center, including \nchildren with cancer. He said:\n\n       We've had to tell people ``I'm sorry, you can't come \n     here.''\n\n  This is the price extracted by a small tea party group in the House \nwho can't\n\n[[Page S7230]]\n\nsee past their own political agenda to defund, delay, or repeal the \nAffordable Care Act. It is reckless and it is irresponsible. But it \ndoesn't have to be that way. It is time. It is time the House \nleadership steps up and actually leads.\n  More than 1 week ago the Senate passed a clean bill that funds the \ngovernment, ends the shutdown, and that opens the Federal Government \nfor business again. They have obstructed that measure from going to the \nHouse floor for a simple up-or-down vote. The House Republicans need to \nend these politics. It is time for the House to have an up-or-down vote \nto end this shutdown.\n  House Republicans need to break with their divisive threats. They \nneed to start governing and pass a responsible budget that invests in \nthe middle class and strengthens our economy. It is time. It is time \nfor the House to have an up-or-down vote to open our government for \nbusiness.\n  House Republicans need to stop standing in the way of progress. They \nneed to start working to build a better and stronger future for our \ncountry. It is time. It is time for the House to have an up-or-down \nvote to end this gridlock and to move our country forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. We certainly appreciate the hours of the Presiding Officer \nin presiding. I don't know whether the Presiding Officer's time is at \nthe beginning or the end, but we are grateful for the time this \nweekend.\n  I wish to start by commending the work of the Capitol Police. I \ndidn't have a chance to do that yesterday in light of what happened in \nWashington the other day. It was a terrible incident and a terrible \ntragedy. As usual, the Capitol Police handled it with professionalism \nand with very effective policing and law enforcement and kept people \nsafe. We should commend them every day, not only on days when there is \na dangerous incident that takes place. We thank them for that.\n  We gather here today to talk about our country and whether we are \ngoing to finally, after almost a full week now, have a government that \nis open, operating, and functioning. I think a lot of people in both \nparties, and maybe more so on the Republican side of the aisle, have a \nbetter chance this week to understand, appreciate, or have insights \ninto what our government does every day, how it helps people, keeps our \neconomy moving, and keeps us safe. I only hope those lessons are being \nlearned.\n  When I am in Pennsylvania or in Washington and getting communications \nfrom Pennsylvania, people ask, in light of this shutdown, some basic \nquestions. A lot of the questions are the same: When will it end? How \nwill it end? Is there a way out? They ask those kinds of questions. \nThey don't know because there is often not a readily identifiable \nanswer.\n  But as complicated as this is, and as difficult as it has been, \nespecially for people directly affected or even affected indirectly for \nfolks around the whole country, there actually is a pretty simple \nanswer, and maybe it has been overlooked this week. It comes down to \none word--technically it is two words. The first word is ``just'' and \nthe second word is ``vote.'' But in our social media age, often words \nare jammed together, so maybe we will say it is one word, ``justvote.''\n  People might say what does that mean? Congress should have votes all \nthe time, and we understand the House and the Senate votes things all \nthe time. What does ``just vote'' mean? Actually, it is rather simple. \nA week ago yesterday the Senate voted on a measure, a simple amendment, \nthat was sent over to the House that was a clean resolution--in other \nwords, a continuing resolution. It is another way of saying to keep the \ngovernment operating. It didn't have anything attached to it, nothing \nabout anything extraneous or additional. That is where the phrase a \nclean CR, continuing resolution, comes from. It is a way to keep the \ngovernment open.\n  The House, led by Speaker Boehner, decided not to consider that. Here \nit is. It is actually pretty simple. It is an amendment to H.J. Res. \n59. It is amendment No. 1974. We can see the markings on it when it was \nbeing considered here. It is all of 16 pages. It doesn't even get to \nthe end of page 16. It is a simple document, and it has been sitting \nover there for a week. I, of course, won't read it, but it is a very \nsimple way out of this predicament.\n  It has overwhelming support across the country. Even for people who \ndisagree with me or disagree with Democrats about health care or about \nany other issue, there is overwhelming support for this. When someone \nsays ``just vote,'' this is what they should just vote on in the House. \nThe House passes this, and it is over. The government shutdown is over. \nThe President will sign it and literally within--I don't know how long \nit will take them to consider it in the House, 20 minutes for a vote, \nor an hour for all the procedural mechanisms to play out--and then the \nPresident would sign it. I am sure there are people who would drive it \nto the White House to have him sign it.\n  That is what this is. It is a 16-page bill that is simple. It even \nhas growing support on the Republican side.\n  When we say just vote, just vote on this 16-page document. It may not \nlook like a key--it is 16 pages of legislative language--but this is \nthe key to ending what I think is not a Republican-Democratic shutdown, \nbut this is the key to ending the tea party shutdown. That is what this \nis. I think most people understand that now we are into a couple of \ndays of government shutdown.\n  It would be very easy for that vote to take place. It would transpire \nvery quickly. The Speaker would only have to put the bill on floor. He \nwouldn't have to vote for it. Most Republicans wouldn't have to vote \nfor it and likely would not. But the combination of getting Democrats \nvoting for it, virtually every one, and a handful of Republicans, is \nnot only possible but I think there are people waiting to do it. Maybe \nthe number would even grow if it actually happened. This is what should \nhappen. That could happen today or the next opportunity would be \nMonday.\n  I would hope the Speaker would do that because I think a lot of \npeople are asking a fundamental question about who is in charge, who \nruns one part of the House or the other. It is my judgment that the tea \nparty is in charge now. I hope conservative Republicans, very \nconservative Republicans, and moderate Republicans can get control of \ntheir party.\n  What I worry about--and I think what economists worry about even more \nthan I because they know more than we do about the economy--the concern \nis if they don't get control of one wing of one political party, we are \ngoing to have an economy that gets out of control. No one wants that, I \ndon't believe, in either party.\n  The other point I wanted to make about where we are--and I know there \nare people who hear a lot of back and forth and they get a little tired \nof the debate. They would rather have everyone vote in the House and \nthis would be over. I think it is important to talk about the words \n``compromise'' and ``negotiation,'' because they have been used a lot \nby the Speaker and by Republican Members in the last couple of days.\n  I think the record is pretty clear, even though some have forgotten \nit--and there were reminders this week--that the negotiation and the \ncompromise on the resolution to keep the government operating already \nhappened. It happened weeks if not months ago. Both sides agreed a \nresolution to continue funding the government would go forward with \nnothing attached to it.\n  The hard part for Democrats is that we had to compromise in a very \nsubstantial way, and I think that is an understatement. The compromise \nwe put on the table and we adhered to is the compromise of a $70 \nbillion cut in fiscal year 2013 enacted levels.\n  What does that mean? That means we agreed to a much lower number. \nDemocrats on this side passed a budget resolution in the early hours of \na Saturday morning. We voted all night. I don't know how many votes we \nhad through several days and throughout the night, but we passed a \nbudget resolution which had a higher number than the number we agreed \nto later. So we compromised substantially.\n\n  I think you could even make the argument the compromising so far has \nbeen all on one side--the Democratic side--to agree to a much lower \nnumber.\n\n[[Page S7231]]\n\nBut one of the most important parts of that is we compromised on the \ncore issue before us. This continuing resolution and funding the \ngovernment, keeping the government operating, is not a health care \ndebate. I realize people have made it into a health care debate, but \nthe core issue is will the government remain open. We said yes. Will \nthe government remain open at the Democratic number? We wanted that, \nbut we said no in order to keep it functioning and moving forward. We \nagreed to a lower number. That is the core issue, what will the number \nbe to fund the government.\n  So the compromising and the negotiating was done a long time ago and \nwe were the ones who compromised. The idea that we should have a drawn-\nout discussion, which they call negotiating, to open the government \ndoesn't make a lot of sense. Once the government is open, we have a lot \nto debate and talk about and negotiate.\n  One of the illustrations of what I am talking about in terms of what \nhappened here and that transpired over many months, where Democrats \ncompromised to keep the government functioning, was set forth in \nseveral news articles in the last couple of days, but I won't read \nthem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CASEY. I ask unanimous consent to have 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Looking at the Thursday, October 3 edition of Politico, on \npage 19, here is the headline. I will hold it up, but it is probably \ntoo small to see so I will read it: ``How the Shutdown Fight Is \nObscuring a Major Republican Victory.''\n  They are saying here that the compromise the Democrats made to cut \n$70 billion is the compromise that already happened and should keep the \ngovernment open. That is the reality.\n  The good news is there is a growing number of Republicans in the \nHouse and Senate who are saying just what I am saying: Let's just have \nthe House vote and pass the continuing resolution as it is.\n  I have a number of examples from Pennsylvania. These are examples of \nwhat middle-class families are facing.\n  I have heard from several constituents who may not be able to make \ntheir mortgage payments this month due to furloughs and from others who \ncan't close on homes because their federal loans are not being \nprocessed during a shutdown. I want to take the opportunity to \nhighlight two letters from my constituents. This letter No. 1:\n\n       Because of the government shutdown, my husband has been \n     furloughed, and is now home without pay for nearly a week. \n     Our mortgage payment is due next week and we are going to be \n     short because of this. My family barely gets by as it is and \n     we cannot afford to lose an entire week's salary because of \n     government tantrums over a health care bill . . . I cannot \n     even begin to express how disappointed I am in our government \n     and your lack of consideration for middle class families who \n     are struggling.\n\n  This is letter No. 2:\n\n       After searching for a house for over two years, we have \n     finally found our home. We have gone through all the \n     underwriting for our mortgage, and we only need the stamp \n     from USDA. Unfortunately, since the government shutdown, USDA \n     has closed. We were supposed to have settlement on October \n     11th, 2013. My husband . . . and I already put in our notices \n     that we will be moving. This is absolutely unacceptable. \n     Please help us in making our home, OUR HOME.\n\n  Every day that Speaker Boehner refuses to hold a vote on the Senate \npassed bill that will reopen the government causes more uncertainty and \ndifficulty for Pennsylvanians and citizens across the country. It's \ntime for this shutdown to end and for the House to just vote on the \nclean continuing resolution that will reopen the government.\n  Let me conclude with this. I think one of the best lines of the week \nabout this piecemeal approach the House is taking day after day, \ninstead of just voting on the measure before them to open the \ngovernment, came from the commander in chief of the VFW--the Veterans \nof Foreign Wars. He said:\n\n       We expect more from our elected leadership, and not a \n     piecemeal approach that would use the military or disabled \n     veterans as leverage in a political game.\n\n  I think that is a pretty good estimation of why we shouldn't go in \nthe direction of piecemealing. The House should, in a word, just vote \nso we don't have--and I say this respectfully to my Republican \nfriends--a tea party shutdown evolve into a tea party default. It is \nbad enough we are in a shutdown, but it will be a lot worse if, for the \nfirst time since 1789, the U.S. Government defaulted and the full faith \nof credit of the United States was badly, badly damaged.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the other day a reporter came up to me and \nsaid: You have been here a while. What do you think it will take to end \nthis shutdown? I replied with a single sentence: The Speaker of the \nHouse needs to lead.\n  A majority of House Republicans want to end this shutdown by voting \nfor a clean continuing resolution, but a small number of the most \nideological Members of the House oppose such a move and oppose a vote, \nand the Speaker has given this small group a veto over the functioning \nof the U.S. Government.\n  Congressman Charlie Dent, a Pennsylvania Republican, made one of the \nmost stunning statements about this situation. In a television \ninterview this week, Congressman Dent said the following:\n\n       I do believe it's imperative we do have a clean funding \n     bill to fund the government. That was the intent of the \n     Republican leadership all along, but obviously there were a \n     few dozen folks in the House Republican Conference who \n     weren't prepared to vote for a clean bill, and that's why \n     we're in the situation we're in right now.\n\n  Congressman Dent, a Republican, makes it very clear what is going on \nover in the House of Representatives. There are a few dozen folks in \nthe House Republican Conference who aren't prepared to vote for a clean \nbill, and that is why we are in the situation we are in right now. So \nthe Speaker of the House is allowing a ``few dozen folks'' to shut down \nthe U.S. Government. What an indictment of the House Republican \nleadership.\n  Speaker Boehner could bring all this chaos to an end. All he has to \ndo is bring the Senate's bill reopening the government to a vote. The \nSenate has voted three times on House continuing resolutions. Speaker \nBoehner has yet to schedule a single vote on the Senate's bill. Why? \nBecause it would pass.\n  That has to sound totally counterintuitive--that you don't bring a \nbill to the floor because it would pass. When the Speaker himself says \nhe wants the government to open, and 90 percent of his own Republican \nCaucus wants the government to open but 10 percent of his caucus \ndoesn't, that means he would have to depend on a few Democratic votes \nto pass the bill. And that is anathema to the Speaker of the House; a \nbill with bipartisan support cannot be allowed, in his judgment, to \ncome to a vote because it would pass. That means it would be a \nbipartisan bill. It would depend upon some Democratic votes. It is his \npolicy--the Speaker's policy--that he cannot hold votes on bills that \nrequire Democratic votes to pass.\n  I cannot think of a more striking example of rank partisanship than \nthat policy. I hope the Speaker will be asked one of these days to \nexplain his refusal, as to why he is following the dictates of a small \ngroup of his caucus when there is a bipartisan solution right in front \nof him. We have looked through the media, and we cannot find where the \nSpeaker has ever been asked or answered this question: Why will you not \nbring the Senate continuing resolution vote to the floor of the House \nof Representatives for a vote? Why will you not allow a vote on that \nbill?\n  Instead, the Speaker sends us piecemeal bills and demands we open the \ngovernment one program, one agency at a time. Today, there is a new \nelement--a bill that would pay Federal employees whether they are on \nthe job or not during this shutdown.\n  Federal employees didn't ask to stop working, so we should pay them. \nBut why in heaven's name--why in heaven's name--should we not let them \nget back on the job serving this country if they are going to be paid? \nWhy not pass a continuing resolution and let them work? This bill to \npay retro actively Federal employees who aren't working passed, \napparently, unanimously today in the House of Representatives.\n\n[[Page S7232]]\n\n  Why not let them work? Pass a continuing resolution.\n  I also want to ask the Republicans who support this bits-and-pieces \napproach this question: When all this piecemeal legislating is through, \nwhat is it that you propose to remain closed? Is it the USDA inspectors \nor offices that process small business loans? Is it the agency that \nworks on Pell grants for college students? Is it NOAA forecasters who \nkeep the watch on hurricanes? Is it FEMA workers who respond when \nstorms come ashore? Is it the furloughed workers at the National \nInstitutes of Health who process the grants that fund so much of our \nNation's health research? Just which Americans do the House Republicans \nintend to keep as hostages to their obsession with repealing ObamaCare?\n  One of the problems with the Republican approach is it makes gross \njudgments as to who will be ransomed and who will remain a hostage. \nWhat agencies get ransomed and which ones remain hostage? I don't think \nwe can be satisfied with freeing some of the hostages while the rest \nremain captive. That is not what this country is all about. We are not \nthe United States of National Parks Visitors or the United States of \nNSA. We are one Nation, and that is why the attempt of the Republicans \nin the House to pick out one group of Americans at a time is going to \nfail.\n  I heard one Republican say the other day that our call, the \nDemocratic call, to open the entire government was ``cynical.'' What a \nremarkable statement. Here is what I call cynical: Shutting down \ngovernment cancer trials for young patients, Head Start classrooms for \nstudents, benefits for the families of our troops who fall in combat, \nshutting down all that and hundreds of other things, and then offering \nto restore the government in slivers, piece by piece, while pretending \nyou are doing the country a favor. That is pretty doggone cynical--\nacting as if it is a compromise worthy of praise to shut down our \ngovernment and then to allow portions of it to reopen today, perhaps \nanother portion or two tomorrow, and another portion or two the day \nafter that. That is cynicism.\n  The anecdote to that cynicism is the true spirit of this country, and \nit is embodied in people such as Congressman John Dingell and former \nSenate majority leader Bob Dole. Bob Dole is a Republican. Both of \nthose great gentlemen, Congressman Dingell and Senator Dole, served \nthis country in peace and war. And when the House Republicans tried to \ncover up their destructive behavior by draping it in the love our \nNation feels for our World War II veterans, these two men, Republican \nand a Democrat, both World War II veterans, said it clearly:\n\n       If you want to honor the service, give the nation we risked \n     our lives for its government back, all of it.\n\n  Here is what they said in a joint statement:\n\n       If this Congress truly wishes to recognize the sacrifice \n     and the bravery of our World War II veterans and all who've \n     come after, it will end this shutdown and reopen our \n     government now.\n\n  Senator Dole and Congressman Dingell added:\n\n       Piecemeal or partial spending plans do not adequately \n     ensure that our veterans--and indeed all Americans--have \n     access to the system of self-government established to serve \n     and protect them.\n\n  Republicans have a simple choice: Continue their current dead-end \napproach or reopen the government and then have discussions about \nhealth care or the budget or other issues they wish to discuss. It is \ntime for those Republicans who say the government should be open, who \nsay they do not believe in these destructive tactics, to match their \nwords with deeds. It is time for the rhetoric now to give way to \nleadership.\n  Speaker Boehner can end this all now--end this farce of rifleshot \nfunding that leaves our government full of holes--and bring up for a \nvote in the House of Representatives a clean continuing resolution. \nOpen the government, all of it. Open it now, Speaker Boehner, by \nallowing the House to vote on the Senate bill which will reopen this \ngovernment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, most people believe in compromise. Coming \nfrom Hawaii, I certainly believe in compromise. It is part of who we \nare.\n  When you live on an island--no matter how contentious issues may \nget--because of your geographic limitations, you will always see \nsomeone the following morning at the Safeway, at the coffee shop, at \nthe bus stop or back at work. So I am deeply personally inclined toward \ncompromise, and so are the people that I represent back in Hawaii.\n  The problem here is that the House Republicans' supposed compromise \nis not a compromise at all. Absent from their press conferences and \ntheir photo ops is the truth. They are attempting to extort the end of \nthe Affordable Care Act in exchange for doing the job that they were \nelected to do--a job that 800,000 Federal employees need them to do--\nwhich is to simply just pass a bill to fund the government.\n  Passing observers, people who were busy last week may be tempted to \ncast blame on both parties, but the reality is that there is no \nquestion, by any objective measure, of whose recklessness has forced \nour government to halt many of its most important services. This \nshutdown is on the Speaker and the tea party.\n  Meanwhile, my friends and neighbors back home are suffering. About \n25,000 people in Hawaii are civilian Federal employees, and most of \nthem are going without paychecks. More than 36,000 women and children \nin Hawaii depend on the Special Supplemental Nutritional Program for \nWomen, Infants, and Children, which makes sure that low-income mothers \nand infants are fed. Without funding, these families could actually go \nhungry. More than 3,000 children in Hawaii participate in Head Start \nprograms. Head Start is a program that provides early education and \nrelated social services to children and their families. Without \nfunding, these kids will have no place to go every day.\n  Only 3 weeks after 250,000 gallons of molasses spilled into Honolulu \nHarbor--one of the worst environmental catastrophes in the history of \nthe island of Oahu--Federal support for investigation, cleanup, and \nrestoration activities have essentially had to stop. Those \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration employees responsible for assisting are not allowed to \nreport to work.\n  At the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, 2,600 employees are furloughed. \nWorkers are forced to stay home, causing real economic hardship. This \ncontinued uncertainty not only affects them, but affects the decisions \nof future shipyard workers who may now choose other professions rather \nthan become the naval engineers that Hawaii and our Nation desperately \nneed. With nearly half of their workforce at home, officials at the \nPearl Harbor Naval Shipyard are forced to make hard choices about what \nwork they can perform. We need to end this shutdown so that the Pearl \nHarbor Naval Shipyard can continue to ensure that our entire naval \nfleet is ready to respond to any contingency in the Asia Pacific.\n  These are not theoretical hardships or decisions. My constituents \nhave been sharing their situations with me. I have received many \nletters. Let me give an example of a person from Kailua on Oahu, who \nwrote to me saying:\n\n       Let me start by stating that I am a U.S. citizen. I love my \n     country, I love my job, I want to work and am proud to \n     support the war fighters when I can work. But I am truly \n     disappointed and feel a sense of betrayal over the past three \n     months of furloughs, budget cuts and being worried about my \n     job and career.\n\n  Another constituent of mine from Mililani on Oahu serves in the \nReserve. She relies on the money she receives from her monthly unit \ntraining assembly to pay her mortgage. She knows she may not be able to \nmeet all of her financial obligations at the end of this month, which \nis when her paychecks may stop arriving. But she asked me not to give \nin on the Affordable Care Act because millions of uninsured Americans \ndeserve access to health care.\n  Even residents who do not collect a paycheck from the Federal \nworkforce are suffering. One small business owner from Makawao, on the \nisland of Maui, is suffering because her business relies on traffic to \nand from the Haleakala National Park, which has been closed since \nMonday. She says:\n\n\n[[Page S7233]]\n\n\n       Many small businesses like mine felt an immediate impact on \n     our sales as tours cancelled their trips into Hawaii's most \n     visited attraction.\n\n  Last night I got an e-mail from someone who is waiting on a small \nbusiness loan that is not coming through because of the delay in \nprocessing SBA loans. This person is expecting to have to lay off 40 \nindividuals from their small company.\n  So the idea that this is somehow a pro-business shutdown, the idea \nthat they are protecting the rights of employers, the idea that this is \nin any way good for the economy is just belied by all of the facts.\n  Personally, working with a reduced staff, I began answering phone \ncalls myself this week and many of the stories were similar: Without \npay and Federal services, life has become uncertain and worrisome for \nthousands of families. This is all because House Republicans are \nthrowing a temper tantrum and refusing to take a reasonable vote to \nreopen the government. This really is a tea party temper tantrum, and \nit is totally unprecedented. It is a low point for the Congress.\n  But there is a solution to this, and the senior Senator from Michigan \npointed it out. It is simple. All that has to happen is for the Speaker \nof the House to put our legislation on the floor and let the House \nvote. There is a broad bipartisan majority of Members of the House of \nRepresentatives who want to reopen the government.\n  So I have two questions. First, for the media and for the \nconstituents of Speaker Boehner: Please ask him, why in the world--if \nthere is a majority of Members of the House of Representatives prepared \nto reopen the government--why he would not use his authority to put \nthat legislation on the floor? And I ask everyone to ask all of their \nMembers of Congress to let the House vote. If we let the House vote, \nthis crisis will be done on Monday morning.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 20 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about reopening the \ngovernment. We are now 5 days into a government shutdown that should \nnever have happened. Minnesotans do not want a government shutdown. \nThey want us to do our jobs, not refight the same old political battles \nover and over. With each day of the shutdown I hear more and more \nreports about how it is affecting Minnesotans, as I am sure the \nPresiding Officer hears about how it is affecting the people of Maine.\n  Minnesotans seeking basic government services are being turned away. \nHundreds of people go to the Minneapolis Social Security office each \nday to get Social Security cards. But on the first day of the shutdown, \naccording to the Minneapolis StarTribune, those Minnesotans--some of \nwhom took time off from work and drove long distances--arrived to find \nthe card center closed.\n  Minnesota's small businesses are also feeling the impact. Small \nbusinesses in Minnesota receive an average of $1.8 million in loans \nevery day under the Small Business Administration's Guaranteed Loan \nPrograms in 2012. With the government shut down, these programs will no \nlonger take new applications and our businesses have to put their plans \non hold.\n  It is not just businesses that are facing problems getting access to \nloans. Minnesota is home to a lot of great, smaller financial \ninstitutions. We have the second most community banks in the country. \nIt is the home of a lot of credit unions, and I talk with them \nregularly. Earlier this week, I met with folks from some Minnesota \ncredit unions, and they explained to me that as a result of the \nshutdown, they are having problems approving mortgages because the \nSocial Security Administration can't verify Social Security numbers. \nThat is not just bad for those Minnesotans who are trying to buy or \nsell a home, it is also bad for the economy.\n  This week my office heard from one of those Minnesotans who is in the \nprocess of buying a home. Jesse is using a USDA Rural Development loan. \nHis banker now has all of the documentation compiled and ready to be \nsubmitted to Rural Development for approval, but they are shut down. \nJesse was originally supposed to close on October 11, next Friday, and \nthe sellers were scheduled to close on another property right after \nclosing on the property they are selling to Jesse.\n  Jesse and his family are now living with his in-laws, and they have \nall of their possessions in storage. He doesn't know whether he will be \nable to close on his new home--all because some people thought it was a \ngood idea to insist on shutting down the government to repeal the \nhealth care law, which isn't going to happen and never was going to \nhappen.\n  Jesse is really frustrated and disappointed. He felt compelled to let \nme know how this is affecting him and other people. He asked me to do \nwhatever I could possibly do to end this shutdown quickly.\n  The shutdown is also affecting other Minnesotans who depend on vital \nprograms, such as Federal nutrition programs. An estimated 125,000 \nMinnesota mothers and mothers-to-be depend on the Women, Infants, and \nChildren Program, or WIC, so they can buy healthy food for their \nfamilies. With the shutdown no new Federal funds are available to \nsupport WIC. That puts the program in Minnesota, and the women and \nchildren it serves, at risk. Hopefully, we can avoid any terrible \nconsequences by getting the government up and running as quickly as \npossible.\n  But in some other States, such as Utah--according to Forbes--they \nhave already stopped accepting new participants.\n  In a shutdown the Administration for Community Living in the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services can't fund senior nutrition \nprograms such as Meals On Wheels. Seniors who rely on Meals On Wheels \nface uncertainty. If the shutdown goes on, State and local agencies \nwill not be able to replace Federal funding and that will result in an \noutright inability to access the program. That is why I will be \ndonating my salary during the shutdown to Second Harvest Heartland. It \nis a great hunger relief organization which works throughout Minnesota \nto help people who need to get food.\n\n  Meanwhile, Minnesota's farmers cannot get the resources they need. \nSusan Magadenz, a constituent of mine from Eden Valley, MN, works at \nthe USDA Farm Service Agency. She wrote me to say:\n\n       This shutdown has cut off services to thousands of American \n     farmers. They cannot get grain checks released and are \n     missing access to funds they require to carry out their \n     operation.\n\n  The shutdown is hitting Minnesotans in many other ways as well. The \nshutdown means that the National Institutes of Health is not awarding \nany new funds or making payments on recently awarded grants. The Mayo \nClinic receives 40 percent of its research funding from NIH grants. By \nthe way, this is one of the many reasons we are going to have to \naddress the sequester. This sequester has hit vital NIH funding really \nhard, even though this is an agency that some people seem not to have \nnoticed until the shutdown.\n  Speaking of the effects of the shutdown compounding the damage from \nthe sequester, tribal schools are being hit even harder because they \nget a substantial part of their funding from the Federal Government in \nwhat is called Impact Aid. Impact Aid is Federal money that goes to \nschool districts where Federal property or Federal activities \nsignificantly reduce the local tax base. The biggest recipients are the \nschools on military bases and on Indian reservations. We have 11 tribes \nin Minnesota, and some of them get about one-third of their school \nfunding from the Federal Government.\n  I am on the Indian Affairs Committee, and I can tell you that the \nsequestration has been hitting them even harder than it has been \nhitting other people. These are some of the most vulnerable kids in the \ncountry. Their afterschool programs are being canceled because of the \nsequester. And\n\n[[Page S7234]]\n\nnow, on top of that, Impact Aid is at even greater risk because of the \nshutdown. That is not right. It is just wrong.\n  Some veterans services, through the Department of Veterans Affairs, \nare already being curtailed, and if the shutdown goes on for very much \nlonger, VA will not be able to process benefit claims and payments, \naggravating the claims backlog we have been working so hard to address.\n  These are just some of the effects the shutdown is having on \nMinnesotans. People are suffering. Minnesotans who have written and \ncalled my office want Congress to get things done, do our work, and not \nshut down government. More than a week ago, I voted--with the Presiding \nOfficer and a majority of my colleagues in the Senate--to pass the bill \nto keep the government open and prevent the damage that a shutdown does \nto our country and to our economy.\n  The House could take up that bill and pass it in a matter of hours, \nand it would reopen the government immediately. It has been widely \nreported that enough Republicans and Democrats support that bill for it \nto pass in the House if Speaker Boehner would only put it up for a vote \nin the House. That is all he needs to do. Let the full House vote on \nthe continuing resolution. But the House hasn't done that.\n  Instead, a faction of the Republicans in the House has decided that \nrehashing old political fights and political brinkmanship are more \nimportant than getting back to the job we were sent here to do, which \nis putting Americans back to work, improving education, and \nstrengthening our economic recovery.\n  Earlier this week I was asked what I would be working on if there \nwere no shutdown. I would be working to pass my Community College to \nCareer Fund Act. This legislation is aimed at closing what is called \nthe skills gap. What is a skills gap? Recent studies in Minnesota show \nthat about one-third to one-half of all manufacturers in our State have \njobs they need filled, but they can't fill them because they don't have \npeople with the skills to fill them. There are more than 3 million of \nthose jobs across the country that are going unfilled because of the \nlack of workers with the right skills. My bill would help those \ncompanies that have open positions. It would help workers find jobs, \nand it would help our country be more competitive globally. It would \naddress college affordability. It is the kind of thing we need to be \ndoing.\n  I have seen partnerships between businesses and community colleges in \nMinnesota that work--at Hennepin Technical College in Hennepin County, \nfor example. A group of manufacturers worked with the school, Hennepin \nTechnical College, and created a curriculum where students could get \ncredentials. I went to a roundtable there and they told me they had put \nover 300 students through this course and 93 percent of them had \npermanent jobs.\n\n  The manufacturers who are involved in this partnership had skin in \nthe game. They gave Hennepin Tech machines and helped design the \ncurriculum. Now they have people filling the jobs that need to be \nfilled. I have seen this model work throughout Minnesota, and I have \nseen it work throughout our country.\n  However, we still have a skills gap. That is why my bill would create \na competitive grant program to incentivize partnerships between \nbusinesses and community colleges. This isn't just manufacturers; it is \nin health care, it is in IT. It would incentivize businesses and \ncommunity colleges to create programs targeted at getting workers the \nskills they need to fill these jobs.\n  This is what I want to be working on. This is what the Presiding \nOfficer wants to be working on for the people of Maine. This is the \nkind of thing Americans sent us to do. Americans want us to learn from \nstrategies that are succeeding in our States--in Minnesota and in \nMaine--and then work together to make our country more prosperous and \nstronger. What else are we supposed to do? That is why they sent us.\n  I recognize we have political differences we have to work through, \nbut brinkmanship and crises can't be the rule; they should be the \nexception. After the debt ceiling crisis in 2011, Standard & Poor's \ndowngraded our Nation's credit rating and they cited the dysfunction in \nCongress as a main reason. After that, people thought--I thought and I \nbelieve most people in this country thought--OK. We have learned our \nlesson. We are not going to govern by crisis and brinkmanship.\n  In fact, this year, in March, the Senate passed a budget through the \nregular process, through regular order. The House passed a budget--a \ndifferent budget, but that is the way it works--and then we are \nsupposed to get together for a conference. We have sought for months to \nhave a conference with the House to resolve the differences in regular \norder. But we were blocked by the same Senators who thought it was a \ngood idea to shut down the government and to defund the Affordable Care \nAct. The House has simply refused to go to conference; instead, they \nwaited for the government shutdown and then sought to go to conference \non a 2\\1/2\\-month continuing resolution that would delay the health \ncare law for 1 year.\n  That is irresponsible. Minnesotans and Americans want us to govern \nresponsibly.\n  Brenda Gregorich from Duluth wrote me on Wednesday about her husband, \na disabled veteran whose disability benefit is now further delayed due \nto the shutdown. She says:\n\n       We would rather do without, than have you give in to \n     delaying the Affordable Care Act. Please stand strong and do \n     not let anyone change or delay this. We will sit tight \n     without income while you work towards this.\n\n  Overwhelmingly, Americans do not want us to shut down the government \nto stop the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n  Earlier this week, Minnesota's health care exchange opened and, \naccording to Minnesota Public Radio, received approximately 100,000 Web \nhits on its first day--the second highest number of hits in any State. \nBelieve me, we are not the second largest State.\n  So the shutdown is not actually stopping the implementation of the \nhealth care law; instead, the shutdown is threatening to do serious \ndamage to our economy.\n  Today, jobless claims are close to a 5-year low. The second quarter \nof 2013 marked nine consecutive quarters of economic growth. The \nprivate sector has created 7.5 million jobs over the last 42 months. \nThere are more people on private, nonfarm payrolls than at any time \nsince September of 2008.\n  But the shutdown is putting our still fragile economic recovery in \njeopardy. Moody's chief economist Mark Zandi testified before the \nSenate a few weeks ago that a shutdown lasting just a few days would \ncost the economy approximately 0.2 percent of GDP, and a longer \nshutdown could cost it as much as 1.4 percent. The U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce has called on Congress to keep the government open stating:\n\n       It is not in the best interest of the U.S. business \n     community or the American people to risk even a brief \n     government shutdown that might trigger disruptive \n     consequences or raise new policy uncertainties washing over \n     the U.S. economy.\n\n  This shutdown is painful for our constituents and it is damaging the \neconomy. Everyone should understand this is costing the government \nmoney. Some people may think at least if the government is shut down, \nwe are saving money. But, actually, the very opposite is the case. \nRecently, in the New York Times, they had an editorial that detailed \nsome of the reasons shutdowns end up being very expensive. A shutdown \ngovernment cannot collect fines and fees, contractors build in the cost \nof the shutdown and the added probability of future shutdowns to how \nmuch they charge the government. Furloughing government workers means \nlost productivity. Lost economic output means lower tax revenue for \nFederal, State, and local governments.\n  This shutdown is unnecessary and it is irrational. Please, let's \nreopen the government and get back to the work the people elected us to \ndo.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today marks the fifth day of the \ngovernment shutdown. With each passing day, the consequences grow more \nsevere, more people are affected, and the implications grow far more \nserious.\n  Federal civilian employees working to support our National Guard, \noverhaul our nuclear submarines, and analyze the latest terrorist \nthreat are\n\n[[Page S7235]]\n\nbeing furloughed, leaving us less safe as a country. I understand this \nafternoon Secretary Hagel, in response to a letter the Presiding \nOfficer and I signed, along with many of our colleagues, is recalling \nsome of those civilian workers. But there are still other implications.\n  Disabled veterans who have sacrificed so much for this country are \nfacing delays in the handling of their claims. Pregnant women and \nlittle children who depend on the foods provided by the WIC Program are \nat risk. Vital biomedical research is being disrupted such that even \nthe sickest children cannot enroll in clinical trials at the National \nInstitutes of Health.\n  The impact goes beyond these services provided by essential Federal \nprograms. Jobs in the private sector are affected as well. In Maine, \nour gem of a national park, Acadia National Park, is shuttered during \nthe peak of the foliage season. This not only disappoints tourists, it \nhurts the innkeepers, owners of bed and breakfast organizations, \nservers at restaurants, and the small gift shop entrepreneurs who \ndepend on these tourists during this time of year.\n  The list of harm goes on and on and on and worsens with each passing \nday. It is time for this shutdown to end.\n  From the start of this debate, I have urged our House colleagues not \nto adopt a policy that linked ObamaCare with the funding of government. \nI have been outspoken in my own opposition to ObamaCare and have cast \nmany votes consistent with that position. I have cosponsored and \nintroduced bills to reform the law so we can better rein in health care \ncosts and truly help the uninsured without jeopardizing their jobs and \nwithout imposing billions of dollars of new taxes, fees, and penalties \nthat discourage job creation and drive up costs. But the fact is the \nDemocratic Senate is never going to pass, nor is President Obama ever \ngoing to sign, a bill that repeals his signature accomplishment.\n  So now that we have all made it crystal clear where we stand on \nObamaCare, it is past time that we reason together on how to bring this \nimpasse to an end. In that regard, I must express my own disappointment \nin the lack of results from the President's meeting with congressional \nleaders and what I understand to be the President's refusal to enter \ninto negotiations with Congress.\n  So let me present to my colleagues and to the President for their \nconsideration a proposal to bring an end to the shutdown. The proposal \nis based on concepts that have been discussed by Senator Pat Toomey and \nCongressman Charlie Dent, and they also reflect my own personal \ndiscussions with many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  Even the staunchest advocates of ObamaCare, including the President \nhimself, recognize the law is not perfect. What 2,000-plus-page law \ndealing with extremely complex issues could be? The President himself \nhas delayed the implementation of the employer mandate and certain \nconsumer protections.\n  I have, therefore, searched for common ground on reforming ObamaCare, \nseeking a proposal that has widespread bipartisan support in order to \nattract the necessary votes of our House colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle; that is, the repeal of the 2.3-percent tax on the sales of \nmedical equipment. When such an amendment repealing this tax was \nconsidered by the Senate during the budget resolution, it passed by a \nresounding vote of 79 to 20. Clearly, it has strong bipartisan support.\n  This $30 billion tax on medical devices such as pacemakers and \ndefibrillators will cause the loss of as many as 43,000 domestic jobs, \naccording to industry estimates. It will reduce investment in research \nto produce new medical devices and, ironically, it will increase health \ncare costs because the manufacturers will simply pass on the costs to \nconsumers.\n  Now the administration has protested the idea of repealing this tax \nbecause it would lose $30 billion in revenue over the next 10 years. \nFair enough. Let's make up for the lost revenue by providing an offset. \nIt is a complicated one, but it works. It is called pension smoothing. \nIt would smooth out the amount of payments businesses make into pension \nplans. This is not an unusual concept. New York State has adopted it to \nallow local school systems to reduce their annual pension contributions \nsomewhat next year in exchange for higher payments in future years. The \nresult of allowing private businesses to smooth out their pension \ncontributions would produce tax revenue by lowering their deductions, \nand that could be used to offset the cost of repealing the tax on \nmedical equipment.\n  Second, I would propose that the continuing resolution funding \ngovernment include a bipartisan bill that Senator Mark Udall and I \nintroduced earlier this year to give agencies flexibility to deal with \nsequestration. It makes no sense at all for Federal managers not to be \nable to set priorities and then submit their plans to the \nappropriations committees as they do now with reprogramming requests. \nSequestration is a flawed policy. It does not discriminate between \nabsolutely essential programs and those that are duplicative, wasteful, \nor simply less important. Now, it is Congress that should be making \nthese decisions, but if the across-the-board meat-ax cuts of \nsequestration stay in effect, the least we can do is let Federal \nmanagers set priorities and manage their budgets subject to \ncongressional oversight.\n  It is my hope that if repeal of the medical equipment tax, offset \nfully by the pension-smoothing proposal, plus the Collins-Udall \nflexibility bill were combined with a continuing resolution to fund \ngovernment, we might well have the combination necessary to secure the \nvotes and reopen government. Surely, it is worth a try. So on this late \nSaturday afternoon, I offer this proposal, and I urge my House \ncolleagues to send us such a bill, which I would then urge the Senate \nmajority leader to schedule for an immediate vote.\n  We have a lot to do to restore the public's confidence in our ability \nto govern. We can start by offering and voting on specific proposals \nsuch as this one. It is time that both sides come out from their \npartisan corners, stop fighting, and start legislating in good faith. \nThe shutdown represents a failure to govern and must be brought to an \nend.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am not happy to be here, but it is an \nhonor and a privilege to be on the Senate floor representing the people \nof Louisiana and speaking for constituents around the country on this \nimportant subject. It is unfortunate we are here today because of the \nirresponsible behavior of one group of Members from one party in \nbasically one Chamber.\n  While I most certainly respect my colleague from Maine and think that \nthe proposal she has generally outlined has a lot of merit--and I would \nadd, there would probably be 15, 20, or 25 other Senators from both \nparties who have worked together to find common ground on many issues \nwho could come up with equally meritorious proposals--it misses a very \nimportant point. The point is simply that the House Republicans and a \nhandful of Senate Republicans have forced the government into a \nshutdown, hurting their own constituents--hundreds of thousands of \ntheir own constituents--and small businesses in their districts that do \nnot deserve in any way to be dragged into this fight or to be used as \nbait in these negotiations. That point cannot be understated, and it \ncannot be ignored.\n  This whole issue is not caused because neither side can compromise or \nwe cannot find common ground. We have proven that over and over on \nhundreds of issues. I myself, along with the Senator from Maine and the \nPresiding Officer--who is new here but not new to government--have been \npart of dozens of extraordinary efforts when there did not seem to be \nany way forward to find a way. So we know how to do that. We can do it. \nThe problem is that there is a rump group of Republicans and the \nRepublican House leadership that have made a terrible mistake in \nshutting the government down and putting government workers and our \nprivate sector partners--and I want to underscore ``our private sector \npartners.'' This government does not work with just Federal employees \nalone. They do the bulk of the wonderful work--many of them do--that we \nrely on every day--our neighbors, our relatives, our aunts, uncles, et \ncetera. But the real power is\n\n[[Page S7236]]\n\nnot just with them, it is with the private sector that helps this \ngovernment and our nonprofit and not-for-profit sector that joins with \nus in fulfilling the missions, the important missions of government \nthat have been put at risk.\n  What that rump group did, though, was basically take all of this \nhostage until they get something. What they want to date is not clear. \nThey want many things, all sorts of different things. One of them is to \nrepeal the Affordable Care Act or to dismantle it in such a way that it \ncannot work to provide for the first time in the history of America \naffordable access to health insurance. There are other reasons that \nhave been stated. They do not like the spending levels. They do not \nlike the debt. They do not like Democrats generally. They do not like \nPresident Obama. There have been many things I have read about what \nthey have said.\n  But no matter what they have said, their actions are irresponsible, \nreckless, and neither the President nor the Democrats should enter into \nnegotiation with a gun to our constituents' heads. That is as simple as \nit is. There is a difference, but it is an important difference. House \nRepublicans cannot get Democrats to any negotiating table unless they \nput the weapons down. These weapons are being used against their own \nconstituents and their own businesses in their own districts, and it is \nnot fair.\n  I want to read from one of my constituents, who says it better than I \ncould. It is one of the messages that came into our office. We have \nbeen closed but functioning with a small staff. This message is from \nVicki Cusimano, whose husband Mark is a 13-year military veteran who \nworks on planes as a technician at one of our great air stations in \nBelle Chasse, LA, which, by the way, would be on high alert today \nbecause there is a storm out in the Gulf of Mexico. Thank goodness it \nis not a hurricane, but it is tropical storm Karen that has put the \nwhole gulf coast a little bit on edge. It is not a huge and powerful \nstorm, but these storms are unpredictable, as the Presiding Officer \nknows, being from a coastal State himself, how these things can happen.\n\n  Anyway, Belle Chasse is right there. Vicki is there with her husband \nMark, a 13-year veteran. Mark says:\n\n       They've--\n\n  Speaking of Congress--\n\n     just pushed us away and said, ``Hey, we're going to fight, \n     and you're going to pay for it.'' Well, they're still getting \n     paychecks. We're not, and now we're trying to figure out how \n     we're going to fend for our families.\n\n  That is what Mark said.\n  Vicki says:\n\n       We have bills [to pay], and you can't tell Wells Fargo, \n     ``Sorry. I can't pay my house note today because the federal \n     government has furloughed my husband.''\n\n  So I want to clarify because I have been one of the ones saying we do \nneed to negotiate, but we need to negotiate without a gun to our head. \nWe need to negotiate when the House decides and the House recognizes \nthat their reckless behavior cannot be encouraged, that it is wrong. I \nknow it is hard when you make a mistake to admit you are wrong. It is \nvery difficult to do. But this would be a time to do it and then move \non to negotiations that we can have over everything, whether it is the \nAffordable Care Act, whether it is the budget, whether it is \nappropriations. I am chair of the Homeland Security appropriations \nbill. I most certainly know how to negotiate a major bill, $42 billion. \nDan Coats is my ranking member from Indiana. We have been in \nnegotiations literally on and off for years as partners on the Homeland \nSecurity bill.\n  But when we asked, the Democrats and the President--but the Democrats \nasked to go to the budget conference to work out the differences \nbetween the budget in the House, the Ryan budget, and the budget in the \nSenate, the Murray budget--which, unusually, was cast during the same \nweek. People will not even remember this because it was so long ago. It \nwas sometime in April, sometime in April. The House passed their budget \nafter an open, raucous debate. We passed our budget. I think we stayed \non the floor until 5 o'clock in the morning, as I recall. I can \nremember being very tired and everybody was pretty aggravated. But we \nstayed here. We got our work done.\n  So when people call for negotiation, the time for negotiation was \nthen, and we can still have this 6-month-delayed negotiation. But the \nHouse Republicans--the tea party Republicans and House Republicans--\nhave to put their weapons down. You cannot negotiate with a gun to your \nhead. It is not fair--not just to us but to our constituents and to our \nbusinesses.\n  I am saying to my delegation and to the House Republicans: Do not use \nthese reckless and irresponsible tactics. In addition, do not even \nthreaten--do not even use the threat of not living up to the full faith \nand credit of the United States of America. You are really playing with \nfire then. That is what I believe the President is saying. That is what \nDemocrats are saying.\n  Now, we have proven--it is not a matter of conjecture or a matter of \nguessing or a matter of, well, they say they negotiate, but they really \nwill not. This is the record. Here is the record. This is evidence. \nThis is not something anybody made up. It is in the Congressional \nRecord. I am not going to read the whole sheet here, but I am going to \nsay--what this says is that on 19 separate occasions Senator Reid or \nSenator Murray or Senator Wyden or one of the Democrats came to the \nfloor--and here are the dates: April 23, May 6, May 7, May 8, May 9, \nMay 14, May 15, May 16, May 21, May 22, et cetera, et cetera, June 19, \n26, July, August, and then the latest was October 2. OK. Those are the \nfacts. On every single occasion, there was one out of six Senators who \nstood on behalf of the others here and blocked it and said: No, we \ncannot, we will not go to a budget conference. Those Senators were \nSenator McConnell on May 8, Senator McConnell on May 9, et cetera, et \ncetera, Senator Paul on May 21, Senator Toomey on June 19, Senator \nCruz--who has been the leader of this irresponsible and reckless \nstrategy, which I do not think is getting his party or his future \nanywhere, but I will have to see about that--Mike Lee on July 17, and \nthen Senator Rubio on August 1.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. So this is the record. When people say Democrats have \nnot been willing to negotiate, that is false, false, false. We have \nbeen trying to negotiate for 6 months, and the way you negotiate is \ngoing to a budget conference.\n  Even now we are in control of the Senate. People elected us. No one \nappointed me to be here. The people of this United States elected us in \na fair and square election. Some of us won by a lot, some of us only by \nsmall amounts, but it was an election by the people of the United \nStates. The people elected the Republican leadership in the House.\n  They passed a budget. We passed a budget. All we have to do is go to \nconference. Not everyone in Washington is reckless. Not everyone loves \nto fight over our constituents' misfortune of unemployment and lack of \nbusiness. There is a small group that put them on the chopping block. \nThey need to take them off. They should not be used as fodder in \npolitical fighting and debate. It is not right. That is the argument.\n  When they remove the constituents and re-fund the government and put \nthe government open again, we could then ask to go to conference. This \ntime they should say yes. They just have to not show up. Sit at your \ndesk and do not say anything, do not object. We will go to conference, \na budget conference. Then you put everything on the table. Everything. \nYou can talk about anything you want. You can talk about taxes, no \ntaxes. You can talk about how much money you want to spend overall. \nMost importantly, you can decide how much revenue, how much in taxes \nyou want. What the American people want is a budget. We have not had \none for a while. We need to get one. We have had spending limits, but \nwe have not had a budget. We have had spending limits, but we have not \nhad a budget. Let's get a budget.\n  Then those of us who are appropriators--I am one of those, and in \ncharge of helping to try to build the homeland security budget--the \nchairman then will give us the number that is agreed\n\n[[Page S7237]]\n\nto by the Democrats and Republicans. They will say to me and Senator \nCoats: Okay, you have X amount of money to spend. You have lots and \nlots of requests out there. You have lots of responsibilities. Let me \nlist a few: Securing the entire border of the United States, all \nairports, all land ports, all river ports. We have to check all the \ncargo that comes into the country.\n  Our budget funds TSA, not the most popular group. But we try to keep \nour air travelers safe and support international commerce at every \nlevel. Every business traveler who is trying to cut a deal in Germany \nor in England or in Asia has to get either preclearance or global entry \nor travel. We support that effort. We want our businesses out there \nmaking contracts, bringing jobs to America. We cannot do that if this \nbudget does not get done. So give us a number. We will put the budget \ntogether the best we can together. We will live within the restrictions \nthat are given to us--or the guidelines. We will not spend one penny \nmore than what the budget tells us.\n  But we cannot even get there because not everyone is being reckless. \nNot everyone is being unreasonable. There is clearly an identifiable \ngroup, led by the Senator from Texas. One of his colleagues or someone \nin the press--I am not sure who, but it was a great quote--said that \nSenator Cruz has led the Republican Party and the tea party into the \nmiddle of eight lanes of traffic and walked away. Eight lanes of \ntraffic with traffic coming both ways is a very unsafe and dangerous \nplace to be. They are going to have to find their way to the side of \nthat road.\n  Open the government, and then say yes to a budget conference where \nall things can be negotiated, and have been for literally hundreds of \nyears. This is not a new process the Senate and the House have been \nundertaking. This is regular order.\n  I am going to end here. This is day 5. I want to have this printed in \nthe Record, since they are in the middle of traffic now, with very few \nsafe ways out, but we could open the government and get to the \nnegotiating table.\n  I want to have printed in the Record that for businesses, 800,000 \nworkers--I know they passed a bill a little while ago to say those \nworkers could be paid. That is important to do. But, again, it is not \njust workers. What about the contracts they are supposed to be giving \nout or the projects? They still do not have authorization even if they \ncome back to work to do that. It is going to affect business. Let me \nsay how much.\n  The Federal Government spends $400 billion in the private sector. \nThat is $1 billion a day. So this reckless behavior has already cost $5 \nbillion; every day $1 billion gone.\n  Is their resolution in the House going to reinstate that $1 billion \nthat small businesses have lost or business generally? I do not think \nso. I did not read the fine print. I do not think that is in there. \nEvery day, if you say 25 percent of all of our contracts should go to \nsmall businesses, that is $240 million a day for small businesses lost.\n  The government roughly makes about 150 loans to small businesses \nevery day. We are in day 5. That is 600 loans gone. I could go on and \non with every day how that affects businesses.\n  I am happy to see, in conclusion, that the House, in realizing they \nare in a bad, bad situation, has sent a lifeline out to the 800,000 \nFederal employees, their own constituents that they put on the chopping \nblock and took these paychecks as negotiating fodder because they do \nnot like the bill that passed 3 years ago, upheld by the Supreme Court, \nand being implemented in the majority of States, including States with \nRepublican Governors.\n  That is foolishness, recklessness, and irresponsibility. But that is \nwhat they did. We did not do that; they did that. If we open the \ngovernment, get contracts going again, stop threatening small \nbusinesses that have nothing to do with this, then we can go to the \nbudget conference and open everything for negotiation.\n  Maybe we can do the medical device tax. I would like to work on flood \ninsurance, for one. My constituents are going crazy. Flood insurance \nhas gone up tenfold. I cannot even get to a negotiating table. We would \nlike to pass the WRDA bill in Louisiana. I would like to see the \nKeystone Pipeline negotiated. I am for the Keystone Pipeline. The \nPresident is against it. But maybe we can find some way forward.\n  But we cannot go anywhere until we get out of eight lanes of traffic. \nThe only way to do that is to admit you were wrong, open the \ngovernment, and then go to conference and put everything on the table \nand let's talk.\n  I see my good friend from Connecticut here. I thank him for joining \nus on the floor today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/05/senate-section/article/S7237-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me thank my great friend from \nLouisiana for her remarks and for all the work she has done to stand up \nfor her constituents, but also for small businesses. I think she makes \na great point, that right now there are thousands of small businesses \nthroughout my State, the northeast, throughout the Presiding Officer's \nState as well, that are waiting for loans from the SBA that cannot get \nthem because right now the SBA is essentially out of business. That \nright now is having a detrimental effect on our economy.\n  I thank her for her great advocacy on behalf of the small businesses \nthroughout Louisiana and across the country.\n  There is a lot of truth to the fact that there can be mutual blame \nthrown around this place very often when it comes to the reasons why we \nhave not solved a lot of our most vexing problems as a nation. The \ndeficit, for instance, did not get to be the size it is without both \nparties playing a role in the fact that we still sit back without the \nwill to try to take on that enormous problem and burden we are leaving \nto our kids. That is due to both Republican and Democratic \nintransigence.\n  There are a lot of things that happen here in which you can very \naccurately and appropriately assess that both sides of the aisle have \nbeen part of the blame. This is not one of them. This is not one of \nthem. When it comes to trying to figure out the reasons why our \ngovernment is shut down, it is pretty simple to explain how we got \nhere.\n  Yet I have heard a lot of my friends on the other side blame the \nmajority leader and blame the President for the shutdown. I have even \nheard some newscasts try to suggest that it is just sort of good old-\nfashioned generic gridlock here in Washington that has led to this \nshutdown.\n  Mostly the American public gets it. I think mostly the American \npublic understands that this is essentially a shutdown of the Federal \nGovernment caused by a small band of ideological conservatives in the \nHouse of Representatives called the tea party. I have sort of tried to \nstruggle with how to explain this to the handful of people back in \nConnecticut who still do not understand what is going on, although \nthere is no way to create an analogy that works.\n  I mean this shutdown is so ridiculous, it is so unique that there is \nno metaphor that works. I have tried this one. Imagine that there is a \ncouple. They live in Boston, let's say. The wife loves living in \nBoston, but the husband has sort of been fed up with Boston for a \nlittle while. He wants to move to the west coast, let's say to San \nFrancisco. But they have been living in Boston for a long time. They \nhave this disagreement as to what to do next. They have been having it \nfor a while. They have not sorted it out. But they chose to live in \nBoston, so that is where they continue to be.\n  Well, one day the husband comes home and says to his wife: You know \nwhat. I have had enough. I have had enough. I want to move to San \nFrancisco. If you do not agree, I am going to call up some contractors \nand have them come over and take the roof off our house.\n  She says: What are you talking about? Take the roof off our house? I\n\n[[Page S7238]]\n\nnever talked about the roof coming off our house. The roof is \nimportant. It keeps us warm. It keeps us dry. You are kidding, right? \nYou are not going to take the roof off the house.\n  He said: Listen, I am going to give you 3 days. If you do not agree \nto move to San Francisco, then I am going to call someone and take the \nroof off of our house.\n  She says: Well, of course, I am not going to do that. Of course I am \nnot going to move to a place that I do not want to move to. We should \ntalk about that. We should come up with a compromise. We should discuss \nthis. Certainly I am not going to agree to move to San Francisco if you \nare threatening to take the roof off the house.\n  Three days go by. She goes to work. She comes home, and the roof is \ngone. He took it off. She cannot believe it. She cannot believe it. \nRain is coming in. It is the middle of winter. It is freezing cold. It \nis miserable.\n  He shows up to work on the second day, and says to his coworkers: You \ncannot believe what my wife did. She took the roof off our house.\n  The coworkers say: Well, what do you mean?\n  I told her we had to move to San Francisco. And when she did not \nagree, I told her I was going to take the roof off the house. I did, \nbut it was her decision. She would not move to where I wanted to move. \nSo I had to go through with it. I had to take the roof off the house.\n  If you were that coworker and listened to that story, you would know \nexactly what was going on. You would know exactly who to blame. You \nwould associate yourself with the decision the wife made and say: \nForget it, I am not moving somewhere with that threat hanging over my \nhead. You would back her up when she said: Put the roof back on the \nhouse before we start discussing about where we are going to live next.\n  That is essentially what has happened here. We had always assumed \nthat the operation of the Federal Government was not something we \nnegotiated over, just like the woman in my analogy assumed that the \nroof being on the house was not something that she had to worry about \ndisappearing.\n  Yet here we are. The government is shut down simply because of the \ndemands of a small group of tea party Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives. Their demand in this case is they want the health care \nlaw repealed, despite the fact that it was passed by two legislative \nbodies, signed by the President, upheld by the Supreme Court, verified \nin an election in which a President who said he would implement it was \nreelected by a huge margin. Every single Senator in the Senate who \nsupported it and ran for reelection was reelected.\n  That is their demand in this case. As the Senator from Louisiana \nsaid, we should react as we would expect that woman to react. We want \nthe government back up and operating, and then we will talk. I want the \nroof back on my house before we discuss where we are going to live.\n  This isn't about politics any longer. This isn't about inconvenience.\n  We are now going into the second week of this shutdown. It has \nstarted to ruin lives, such as Melanie Rhodes' from Bridgeport, CT. A \nfew years ago Melanie was homeless, living out on the streets. Things \nwere very tough for Melanie. Melanie became pregnant and had a little \nboy, a wonderful little boy about 2 months premature, a wonderful \nlittle boy named Malachi. Malachi had some developmental issues right \noff the bat, but she knew her life had changed and she had to do \neverything possible for her little boy. She placed him into the Birth \nto Three System, our early screening program. They identified the \nproblems he had. He was connected with a Head Start Program in which he \nwas enrolled at about 9 months old.\n  Malachi is still behind his peers at 3 years old, but he is doing a \nlot better. He is beginning to finally communicate with a handful of \nsigns. Every day he has been in that Head Start Program his life and \nher life have become better. Even though she has been struggling \nthrough the worst recession of her life, of my life, of most of our \nlives, she started to turn the corner very well. She applied everywhere \nover the last 3 years. She did everything we would have asked of her to \ntry to find a job. She applied with Walmart, Walgreens, and McDonald's.\n  Finally, in the past few weeks she got a job as a busdriver. She had \ncompleted her training, was waiting for her background check to come \nthrough, and was to start her job in a matter of days. She stayed up \nall night last Monday night, past midnight, watching CNN, watching the \nnews, to see if the government was going to be up and operating. She \nknew the Bridgeport Head Start Program runs on a budget that expired at \nthe end of September. That was one of the handful of programs that \nwould shut down immediately upon the shutdown of the government.\n  She woke up on Tuesday morning and hoped against all hope by calling \nHead Start to see if they were going to be up and operating, and they \nweren't. They had shut down. Bridgeport told 1,000 families across \nsouthwestern Connecticut that they couldn't show up for preschool that \nday. Their families had to scramble to find some kind of coverage for \nchildcare.\n  For Melanie it was a double disaster because she has a child with \ndevelopmental disabilities. She can't have just anybody take care of \nhim, and she is having a hard time finding someone. She is now going to \nbe faced with not only inappropriate care for her child, perhaps \nsetting him back developmentally, but she also probably can't start \nthat job she was waiting for.\n  If we take this situation and multiply it times 1,000 in only one \ncity in Connecticut, then look at the fact that that problem could be \nmultiplied 18,000 times over the course of next week as more Head Start \nPrograms shut down, we see this shutdown is not about politics. It is \nnot about inconvenience. It is about people's lives falling apart.\n  What about the 1,500 workers at Sikorsky Aircraft, the majority of \nwhom are in Connecticut. They have 43 employees from the Federal \nGovernment who inspect the helicopters as they go down the assembly \nline. But because those helicopter assembly lines are making Black Hawk \nhelicopters for the U.S. military and they move pretty fast, if they \ndon't have those inspectors for a handful of days, they can't continue \nto move the assembly line.\n  On Friday, 1,500 workers were furloughed from Sikorsky Aircraft, let \ngo until those inspectors are back on the job--43 inspectors equal \n1,500 private sector layoffs.\n  When you are laid off from a job, sometimes if you can see it coming, \nyou can try to make arrangements. If you are on a paycheck-to-paycheck \nbasis, where everything that comes in goes right back out again to pay \nyour food bills, mortgage, student loans, whatever it may be--if you \ncan see the layoff coming, then you might be able to scramble to find a \npart-time job or save a little bit more for the final few months of \nyour employment. But when you get a notice in 2 days you are going to \nbe laid off for an indeterminate amount of time, there is no way for \nthe people who are living paycheck-to-paycheck to put their lives \ntogether.\n  As Senator Landrieu said, that results in mortgage payments being \nmissed, in credit ratings going into the tank, and lives being ruined \noff of a purely political crisis caused by a handful of rightwing \nRepublicans in the House of Representatives.\n\n  I hear my friends on the other side of the aisle and Speaker Boehner \nsay, yes, but if the Democrats would only negotiate, would compromise, \nwe could get this thing done. Before I yield the floor to my friend \nfrom Rhode Island, I wish to say two things about that insistence from \nRepublicans that the problem is not their demands that the health care \nlaw be repealed before we open the government but it is that Democrats \nwill not sit down and negotiate.\n  I think the Senator from Louisiana said it best: It makes no sense to \nnegotiate with a gun to our head. Open the government and we will sit \ndown and talk about anything the other side wishes to talk about.\n  Let us also discuss what the positions of the two parties are. \nRepublicans want the most important achievement of President Obama's \nfirst term repealed. We want the government to continue to be \noperational. Republicans want a law taken off the books that will \nensure 30 million more people with health care. We want the government \nto continue to pay its bills.\n  What I am trying to say is that we don't actually have demands. All \nwe\n\n[[Page S7239]]\n\nwant is what our constituents have always expected to happen to \ncontinue to happen. All we have asked for in this crisis created by tea \nparty Republicans is for the government to be open and for the \ngovernment to continue to pay its bills.\n  We could make a bunch of our own demands. I think it is ridiculous \nthat we don't have background checks on the purchase of firearms in \nthis country, but I am not saying I am going to shut down the \ngovernment unless I get my way on background checks. All I want is the \ngovernment to be open and for us to pay our bills.\n  Second, normally one negotiates when we don't have consensus. \nNormally, we sit down and compromise when 50 percent of the Senate and \n50 percent of the House doesn't agree to the exact same thing. That is \nwhy we have to sit down and talk--because we do not have consensus.\n  We do. We have a bill, which is the clean continuing resolution--and \notherwise just keep the government open and operating for another 6 \nweeks on the same rules it used to be operating under. We had, I think, \n54 votes in the Senate. It is publicly supported by a majority of the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Why would we negotiate when we already have a bill that is supported \nby the majority of the Senate and the majority of the House? The only \nthing that has to happen in order for the government to get back and on \nits feet is for Speaker Boehner to call a vote on that bill. It makes \nno sense that Speaker Boehner says sit down and negotiate, when there \nis already a proposal pending before the House that has the support of \nthe majority of both bodies.\n  We don't have a lot to negotiate over because all we want is the \ngovernment to open and for us to pay our bills. We don't need to \nnegotiate because we already have a proposal that enjoys the support of \nthe majority of this body and the majority of that body.\n  Tea party Republicans should stop holding this country hostage to \ntheir ideological demands. Speaker Boehner should call a vote on this \nbill tonight and this totally self-created crisis could come to an end \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent to speak up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we are 5 days into the government shutdown, \nbut unfortunately there has been no progress in resolving this issue. I \ndisagree with some policies championed by my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle, and indeed I sometimes disagree with the President \nand Members of my own party on specific policy prescriptions. Case in \npoint: raising the student loan interest rate and the so-called JOBS \nAct. In both cases I tried to make my best argument on the merits of \nthe issue, and then we voted, moved on, and I am still working to try \nto improve both laws. I haven't given up, but I have not shut the \ngovernment down because my views didn't prevail.\n  So I say to my colleagues on the other side, the way to change laws \nyou do not like is not to shut down the government at the expense of \nyour fellow Americans and at the expense of our economy; it is to try \nto build consensus and persuade a broad swath of the American people \nthat there is a better way of doing things and making concrete \nproposals.\n  It has been pointed out many times before that the House of \nRepresentatives has attempted to repeal the Affordable Care Act 45 \ntimes at last count, I believe, but I have yet to hear any credible \nplan put forth to replace it or strengthen it or make it work better. \nAnd the American people want our constructive efforts to succeed. They \nwould like it modified if it needs modification. But the attitude of \nsome of our colleagues has been to just strip away the whole book of \nsignificant legislation--and replace it with what? We don't know. That \nis irresponsible.\n  This Senate and this Congress is a great institution. Our Founding \nFathers, in their wisdom, set up a system with plenty of room for \ndebate, different points of view, and checks and balances. But checks \nand balances are not what is happening today. The government has been \nshut down not because Congress can't agree on levels of funding. We \nagree. We have actually agreed with the House on their level. The real \nreason is that some on the other side of the aisle--and I do think it \nis just a small cadre--have a very different vision about the \ngovernment itself. And this is not hyperbole. We can all recall that \nduring the Republican Presidential primaries we had candidates seeing \nwho could out-promise whom in terms of eliminating aspects of the \nFederal Government. They proposed getting rid of the EPA, the Commerce \nDepartment, the Department of Education, FEMA, and the Department of \nEnergy--not reforming these agencies, not changing their missions, not \nmaking them more efficient or more effective, but just doing away with \nthem--and that spirit is animated in the House today, unfortunately.\n  I am particularly glad that view did not prevail in the last election \nbecause these agencies are vital to all Americans. Looking back at \nRhode Island, we were victims of serious historic flooding over the \nlast several years. If FEMA had not been there to step in and help us, \nwe would still be trying to pull ourselves together. As a small State, \nlike Connecticut and other States, we do not have the resources to do \nit. We saw the same thing with Hurricane Sandy. They were there helping \nefficiently and effectively. And that is one of the agencies my \ncolleagues are not allowing to operate today.\n  Many small business men and women in my community, manufacturers, et \ncetera, have been aided immensely by the Department of Commerce. That \nis something else that was on the hit list during the Presidential \nprimaries by Republican candidates.\n  Those of us who enjoy clean water, fresh air, and the importance of a \nhealthy environment--i.e., every American--even if they do not notice \nit or admit it, their health and the health of their children would be \njeopardized severely if EPA was eliminated. There are calls repeatedly \nto make it more efficient, more effective, make it more businesslike, \nand those calls have to be recognized and heeded. But the notion that \nwe would just wipe it away and the private markets or private self-\ninterests would ensure that our air is clean, that our water is clean, \nand that our health is protected is not something that is either \nrealistic or, indeed, even something that is arguable.\n  There is room in this country for a range of views, and I recognize \nthat many of my colleagues, who consider themselves members of the tea \nparty, are simply doing their best to represent the views of those who \nsent them here. But I would hope everyone who has been entrusted with \nthe responsibility of government could work together to at least make \nthe government function--i.e., to stay open. That is a basic \nresponsibility our constituents entrusted us with when they sent us to \nWashington.\n  There is nothing patriotic about shutting down the government, \nputting hundreds of thousands of people out of work, and potentially \nforcing our country into default. And the hundreds of thousands out of \nwork are not just government employees. As my colleague from \nConnecticut pointed out, now defense contractors are beginning to \nfurlough. These industries are the heart and soul of so many \ncommunities. When these jobs are lost, there is a multiplier effect, \nwhich affects the entire community. And this cascading series of \neconomic problems will get worse each day we keep this government \nclosed.\n  Both sides need to work together, but we have already significantly \ncompromised on our side. Again, as the Senator from Connecticut pointed \nout, we are voting for a continuing resolution at the House level, not \nour level--a multibillion-dollar gap. We have accepted that. At least \nfor the interim period, the 6 weeks or so of this continuing \nresolution, we accept the House's position. And of course, for many of \nus who have been arguing vociferously to end this sequestration, to \nincrease investment, this was a significant compromise. We are not \nseeing that reciprocated on the other side; it is ``my way or the \nhighway,''--stop ObamaCare or nothing gets done, Government doesn't \nwork, and we will default on our credit.\n  That is reckless, irresponsible, and does not serve the interest of \nthose who sent us here.\n  It is time for those who are proposing the wild plans of shutting \ndown the\n\n[[Page S7240]]\n\ngovernment if they don't get exactly what they want to grasp the \nreality of the situation. We cannot keep this government closed. This \nclosure will last as long as Speaker Boehner wants it to. He can, under \nthe rules of the House, call up this bill within hours--perhaps less--\nor Republicans can join Democrats and sign a discharge petition to \nbring it to the floor regardless of the Speaker's position. Those are \ntwo paths that should be taken immediately to open this government.\n  We all have a shared responsibility for the government. As I sense \nit, one of the basic rationales of this government is to keep the \nlights on, keep people working. Let's get to the difficult negotiations \non how we improve efficiency, how we improve operations, but we have a \nresponsibility to keep our government open--to open it and then keep it \nopen--and the longer this shutdown drags on, the more people will be \naffected. Cancer patients, young mothers, scientific researchers, \nFederal employees, people who take prescription drugs all are being \nnegatively impacted. Government contractors are being laid off.\n  Let's work together and reopen the government for business. Let's \ncontinue to debate the issues. We have many issues we can debate but \nnot under the sword of Damocles--of a government that is closed and an \neconomy that is beginning to lose more and more of its momentum and \nstrength. That harms the American people irresponsibly and recklessly \nfor a very narrow self-interested principle.\n  There is another aspect here too. It is not just the government \nshutdown, but we are coming perilously close to a potential default on \nthe debt of the United States. The government closure is affecting our \neconomy dramatically, but a default on our debt could be catastrophic. \nThere is a growing risk that this brinkmanship on the part of the \nRepublican Party could force us to default. We are only 12 days away \nfrom a potential default because the tea party Republicans would rather \nplay their games over the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, than choose \nto do what we have always done--pay our bills.\n  This is not about borrowing more money to spend more. This is about \npaying for those things we agreed on--Republicans and Democrats--\nthrough congressional appropriations, through legislation creating \nprograms such as Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security.\n  These are obligations we have incurred, and we won't be able to pay \nall of them. Indeed, on October 17, unless my Republican colleagues end \ntheir obstruction, the Nation will not be able to pay its bills, \ncausing dire consequences for American workers and our economy.\n  Many commentators have pointed out a default will destabilize the \nnational and global economy. It could cause another financial crisis \nand over the span of a month cause an estimated $106 billion shortfall \nof Federal spending that would cause a severe economic contraction.\n  If we can't pay our debts, then we will contract federal activity. \nThat contraction will be multiplied in the economy. Our economic growth \nwill slow. In fact, not only decelerate, it could collapse. Ironically, \none aspect of that is it will almost overnight increase our deficit as \nless economic activity produces less revenue, there are more people who \nare laid off and eligible for unemployment insurance. It is a downward \nspiral.\n  Economists on both sides agree that it is just the specter of default \nthat has serious economic consequences. In fact, we have already seen \nthe 1-month interest rate of Treasurys jump over the 6-month and the \nyear-long rates. The markets are already voting. They are nervous. They \nare nervous that the Republicans will carry out these threats, and you \ncan see it in what they are demanding in order to buy the short-term \npaper of the United States versus the longer term paper.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S7240, October 5, 2013, in the second column, the \nfollowing language appears: . . . Treasuries . . .\n  \n  The Record has been corrected to read: . . . Treasurys\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  We just have to look back at August 2011 to know there will be \nconsequences. Back then, Republicans pushed us perilously close to \ndefaulting on the debt, and that manufactured crisis set back job \ngrowth and the economy. The Government Accountability Office estimated \nthat the 2011 debt ceiling crisis cost taxpayers $1.3 billion in that \nfiscal year. It also rattled American households and created economic \nuncertainty. From June to August 2011, consumer confidence fell 22 \npercent. And I suspect that if this debate--particularly with respect \nto the debt ceiling--continues to pick up over the next few days, \nAmerican consumers will become more and more nervous.\n  It took several months after August 2011 for the recovery of consumer \nconfidence, for people to come back into the marketplace to begin to \nparticipate. The S index of equity prices fell about 17 percent in \nthat period surrounding the 2011 debt ceiling crisis, and it did not \nrecover to its average over the first half of the year until 2012. So \nwe are going to see a market effect. We know that. That was August \n2011, and indeed I am concerned that this crisis is even more perilous \nbecause the opposition seems to be more intransigent. Those people are \nsaying there won't be any consequences to default or repeal of \nObamaCare is more important than anything else, even the economic well-\nbeing of the United States.\n  Roughly half of U.S. households own stock either directly or \nindirectly through mutual funds or 401(k) accounts. So this fall in \nequity markets, which we saw in 2011, will cut across a wide swath of \nthe American public. We saw in 2011, the result of the approaching \ndeadline and debate over whether or not to pass the debt ceiling, wiped \nout about $2.4 trillion of household wealth. This decline in wealth \nleads to a decline in consumption, and consumer spending accounts for \nroughly 70 percent of our gross domestic product. So put the links \ntogether: People are nervous. They pull back. The economy pulls back. \nGrowth begins to decelerate, in fact reaching zero--or worse. That is \ndemonstrably the effect in some degree from what happened in August \n2011, and would likely happen again--in fact, this time, perhaps worse.\n  Already we are starting to see some of the warning signs. We are \nseeing banking institutions prepare for the worst. According to the \nFinancial Times, on October 3, 2013:\n\n       One senior executive said his bank was delivering 20-30 \n     percent more cash than usual in case panicked customers tried \n     to withdraw funds en masse. The move to source extra cash is \n     a precaution to deal with an unnecessary upturn in demand, \n     banks said. . . . Banks are also holding daily emergency \n     meetings to discuss other steps, including possible free \n     overdrafts for customers reliant on social security payments \n     from the government.\n\n  But this potential consumer dash for cash is only the tip of the \niceberg when it comes to entirely avoidable self-inflicted economic \nwounds if we get close to--and certainly if we do not raise the debt \nceiling, and default.\n  According to The Economist, the noted British magazine, Treasurys are \n``more than 30 percent of the collateral that financial institutions \nsuch as investor banks use to borrow in the $2 trillion triparty repo \nmarket.'' That is the source of overnight funding for most large \nfinancial institutions and many other institutions. ``A default could \ntrigger demands by lenders for more or different collateral. That might \ncause a financial heart attack, like the one prompted by the collapse \nof Lehman Brothers in 2008.''\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S7240, October 5, 2013, in the third column, the \nfollowing language appears twice: . . . Treasuries . . .\n  \n  The Record has been corrected to read: . . . Treasurys\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  We are just barely understanding the inner relationships of all these \ndifferent financial instruments and financial markets. But this is not \nthe only financial instrument that could be affected. Money market \nfunds are a prime source of investment by thousands of Americans--both \ninstitutions and individuals. According to the Federal Reserve's \nSeptember 25, 2013 Statistical Release on the Financial Accounts of the \nUnited States, money market funds in the second quarter of 2013 hold \n$449 billion of U.S. Treasurys.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S7240, October 5, 2013, in the third column, the \nfollowing language appears twice: . . . Treasuries . . .\n  \n  The Record has been corrected to read: . . . Treasurys\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Back in 2011, Matthew E. Zames, the chief operating officer for \nJPMorgan Chase and the chair of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory \nCommittee--which offers observations to the Treasury Department on the \noverall strength of the U.S. economy as well as providing \nrecommendations on a variety of technical debt management issues--wrote \nto at that time Secretary Geithner and expressed concern of:\n\n       . . . a run on money market funds, as was the case in \n     September 2008 after the Lehman failure. In the event of a \n     Treasury default, I think it is likely that at least one fund \n     would be forced to halt redemptions or conceivably break the \n     buck. Since money funds investors are primarily focused on \n     overnight liquidity, even a single fund halting redemptions \n     would likely cause a broader run on money funds.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S7240, October 5, 2013, in the third column, the \nfollowing language appears: . . . break the bruck . . .\n  \n  The Record has been corrected to read: . . . break the buck . . \n.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n\n\n[[Page S7241]]\n\n\n  And from the same 2011 treasury borrowing advisory committee letter:\n\n       Because Treasuries have historically been viewed as the \n     world's safest asset, they are the most widely-used \n     collateral in the world and underpin large parts of the \n     markets. A default could trigger a wave of margin calls and a \n     widening of haircuts on collateral, which in turn could lead \n     to deleveraging and a sharp drop in lending.\n\n  What this is saying, essentially--not just in the United States but \nworldwide--this could have a huge, immediate, unpredictable global \neffect on markets, causing deleveraging, causing a sharp drop in \nlending, causing confusion and uncertainty. One thing we should \nrecognize, particularly after the events of 2008, is markets do not \nlike uncertainty. And when things are uncertain, they pull back. If the \nexpectation is a declining market, there is a premium to the \ninstitution or individual that can get out first. When they start \ngetting out, people notice, and then you have a stampede to the door.\n  The consequences that are possible are staggering, and yet we hear so \nmany of our colleagues glibly sort of saying that, if they don't get \nour way on certain aspects of this bill or that bill, they are going to \ndefault on the debt of the United States. I think that approach is \nvery, very dangerous.\n  We are seeing already some indications from financial markets that \nthese factors are beginning to affect economic behavior. Again from the \nFinancial Times, October 3:\n\n       Money market funds dumped October Treasury bills on \n     Thursday, in the first sign of investor unease that \n     Washington may not raise the federal debt ceiling in the \n     coming weeks and risk triggering a technical default by the \n     US Treasury on its debt.\n\n  From the Institute of International Finance this month, a well-\nrespected organization:\n\n       Just when the global economy is showing signs of \n     stabilization, with Europe emerging from recession, and \n     geopolitical risks in the Middle East seem to be subsiding, \n     consumer and investor confidence could be tested by a range \n     of political and policy uncertainties . . . What is truly \n     unprecedented is a possible, but still unlikely--\n\n  And I hope that is the case, unlikely--\n\n     combination of government shutdown and failure to lift the \n     current $16.7 trillion debt ceiling by October 17. The impact \n     of such a failure of political leadership on business, \n     consumer and investor confidence is difficult to say and \n     could lead to further downgrades of the U.S. sovereign debt. \n     Reflecting rising credit risks, 5-year CDS spreads for the \n     U.S. have risen by 45 percent in the past 3 weeks to 33 basis \n     points and could test, or exceed, the previous high of 62 \n     basis points reached during the previous threat of default in \n     2011.\n\n  That is an indication the market is getting very nervous about what \nwe are doing. These rising rates are not good for the United States. \nThey mean the market is beginning to look at the default as possible \nand the risk is being written into the instruments that they are \nproviding in terms of insurance, if you will, on U.S. Treasurys and \nother securities.\n  On October 17, the extraordinary security measures the Department of \nTreasury has had to employ since May 19 will be exhausted. The Treasury \nSecretary told us that. On that date, Treasury will have approximately, \nin their view, $30 billion on hand to meet the government's daily \nexpenditures which can be as high as $60 billion. That $60 billion \nrepresents payments for the Nation's bills on things such as Social \nSecurity, Medicare, national defense, and education.\n  However, some tea party Republicans have decided to dismiss this \nissue and say they are planning to limit the fallout. That they should \nnot be blamed for it because they have a plan in case of default. They \ncall for, what they argue is prioritization, where some of the U.S. \nbills are paid and others are not. But their plan for prioritization is \njust another version of default. Indeed, the House passed legislation \nthat would prioritize payments. However, in a letter to Speaker \nBoehner, the Department of Treasury made clear prioritizing payments \n``would not protect the full faith and credit of the United States'' \nand that prioritization is ``simply default by another name.''\n  It is shocking to witness the lengths some of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle are willing to go in order to win political \npoints and gain negotiating leverage. They are threatening the economic \nwell-being of every American by refusing to do something, at least at \nthis point, as essential as paying the Nation's bills. Paying the \nNation's bills should be a routine matter. There is no alternative. \nCongress has always done so. Since 1960, Congress has acted to prevent \na default on the debt 78 times, 49 of which were under Republican \nPresidents.\n  Indeed, President Reagan said in 1983 that ``the full consequences of \ndefault--or even the serious prospect of default--by the United States \nare impossible to predict and awesome to contemplate.''\n  Regrettably, because of some colleagues, particularly colleagues in \nthe House of Representatives, there is a serious prospect of default, \nsomething President Reagan warned us against.\n  He also, I think quite rightly, pointed out the consequences are \nimpossible to predict. The markets, frankly, are much more complicated, \nmuch more interrelated, much more driven by technology today than in \n1983. Automated computerized trading was not a common feature of \nmarkets in 1983. Today it is. Today, algorithms have programs that look \nfor declines in products and then begin to sell it's not an individual \nbroker who says: Listen, I know this is going to be worked out in a \ncouple of hours. It is a machine and we have seen these machines go \nhaywire. There is a real possibility that initial reaction to a \ntechnical default on the debt could trigger some of this trading in a \nway that even the people who built these elaborate algorithms do not \nfully understand.\n  This is very serious, more serious today than in 1983. But President \nReagan's words were prescient then and decisive then and right then and \nthey are the same today.\n  This should not be a negotiating chip. Speaker Boehner's threat to \ndefault in order to extract dollar-for-dollar cuts to programs, to make \nchanges in this program or that program, is risking the economic \nviability of the United States and indeed the world's financial \ncondition.\n  Also, the Speaker suggested we have always done it this way. He said \nevery major effort to deal with the deficit in the past years has been \ntied with the debt limit. That is not supported by the facts. Over the \npast 30 years, 77 percent of laws passed by Congress to pay for \nspending already accrued were not statutorily linked to deficit \nreductions or budget reforms; 77 percent were simply done because we \nhave to extend the debt ceiling. We will do it. We always have.\n  Furthermore, several of the deficit reduction measures identified by \nSpeaker Boehner as tied to paying our Nation's bills included \nsignificant new revenue. According to U.S. Treasury estimates, the \nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 raised $126.6 billion over 4 \nyears and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 raised $188 \nbillion in new revenue over 4 years.\n  I do not see the Speaker coming up and saying we have a plan. We are \ngoing to make adjustments here on the spending side and on the revenue \nside and then we are going to tie it to the debt ceiling. No. In fact, \nthis discussion of revenue increases or revenue positions, spending \ncuts, all of this is not appropriate to the debt ceiling discussion. It \nis appropriate for the conference on the budget. We have had a budget \nin the Senate since March and we have been prevented from going to \nconference with the House Republicans by Republican Members in the \nSenate.\n  There is a bipartisan demand, many of my colleagues on the Republican \nside have asked, suggested we go to conference. That is the appropriate \nway to deal with this--not threaten the world and the American people \nwith default on our debts but doing a budget in regular order, taking \nup the budget, talking about revenues, talking about changes to \nprograms, talking about continued efforts to reduce our deficit, \ntalking about growing the economy. That ultimately is the best way to \nreduce the deficit.\n  You cannot expect, as the Speaker implied by citing budget reforms \ntied to the debt ceiling, which contained revenue, that Republicans are \nserious. That is not going to be the case from what I sense from the \nother side.\n  We have a real challenge before us. The challenge is that there seems \nto be this blase attitude in some respects, particularly in the House, \namong certain of their Members that: So what if\n\n[[Page S7242]]\n\nwe default. Other countries have defaulted. We saw something like it in \nGreece.\n  But Greece, for example--it is very difficult to compare the two \neconomies. I do not want to suggest that our experience will mimic \ntheir experience. It is a much smaller economy. It does not have an \nindependent currency. It is tied to the euro. But their debt in 2012 \nwas basically challenged. While the intent of restructuring was to \navoid default that would require payment of credit default swaps on \nGreek debt, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association in 2012 \ndetermined that they had technically defaulted on their sovereign debt. \nThis would trigger credit default swaps being called. One estimate of \nthe net notional value of the Greek credit default swap outstanding at \nthe time was about $3.2 billion, but in that economy it was a \nsignificant number and according to a Forbes article on March 9, 2012:\n\n       While no one expects the Greek settlement to have systemic \n     implications, it does set the precedent for any subsequent \n     restructurings, which could take on added importance if big, \n     troubled peripherals like Spain or Italy take a turn for the \n     worse.\n\n  The Greek situation is not identical to ours. In fact, because of the \nsize of our economy, because of the ubiquity of U.S. Treasurys across \nthe globe, in so many different instruments, in so many different \ninstitutions, a default could be much worse. But the Greek example does \ndemonstrate there are consequences to default.\n  The Wall Street Journal on September 7 2013 pointed out:\n\n       . . . since tipping into recession in 2008, Greece's \n     economy has shrunk more than 20 percent from its peak while \n     successive waves of austerity measures since the start of the \n     Greek debt crisis in 2009 have helped push tens of thousands \n     of businesses into bankruptcy and sent unemployment to a \n     record of around 27 percent.\n\n  The Pew Center reports that unemployment among young Greeks under 25 \nyears old skyrocketed to 62 percent in June, 2013.\n  Austerity in some respects is another word for contracting government \nspending--contracting government engagement in the economy. This \nshutdown is essentially a miniausterity program for the last 5 days \nbecause we have contracted government contributions to the economy. \nHundreds of thousands of Federal workers furloughed, additional private \nsector contractees furloughed, extraordinary measures taken to shut \ndown the government. These measures will lead inevitably to the \ncontraction we have seen in other places. Holding the full faith and \ncredit of the United States hostage to appease a handful of \nirresponsible and reckless House members who are fighting battles that \nhave been lost several times is not what our democracy is about.\n\n  I urge immediate action to get our government up and running again \nand our bills paid. Then we can focus on a more pressing need--creating \njobs, opportunity, and prosperity for families in my State of Rhode \nIsland and across this Nation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am grateful to the senior Senator from \nRhode Island for his statement. I listened to every word of it from my \noffice. He is such a great asset to the State of Rhode Island and our \ncountry with his military background and his experience in the Banking \nCommittee and Armed Services. Very few people have the wisdom he has.\n  I would also note that the Presiding Officer's presentation was also \nremarkably good.\n  Mr. President, in closing today I want to read a very brief statement \nfrom a Nevada publication. The headline is:\n\n       Nevada Residents Are Calling Their Obamacare Hotline In \n     Tears, Desperate For Health Coverage.\n       Uninsured Americans in Nevada are so desperate to get \n     health coverage under Obamacare that many are calling the \n     state's new insurance marketplace ``in tears.''\n\n  Kevin Walsh, a senior Xerox official who heads the department that is \nhelping some states maintain their online Obamacare marketplaces and \ncall centers, told Bloomberg Businessweek that many people had \ncontacted Nevada's Obamacare hotline with ``just raw emotion'' within \nthe first hour that the marketplace opened on Tuesday. Nevada has an \nadult uninsurance rate of 27 percent--the fifth highest in the country.\n\n       ``They were calling and saying, `Can I get my coverage \n     today so I can see my doctor this afternoon?' '' said Walsh. \n     That is in one sense moving but also frustrating because, \n     sure, you can sign up--but the coverage can't be effective \n     until January 1st.\n       Uninsured Americans and those with costly or skimpy health \n     plans have been rushing to sign up for health coverage under \n     the law, although technical glitches have delayed the \n     enrollment process for some of them. Those who have \n     successfully enrolled say that they are pleased with the new \n     coverage they will be getting beginning in January.\n       Even some ardent Republicans and ObamaCare skeptics who \n     signed up for coverage are admitting that the law will be a \n     financial boon to them and give them peace of mind. Butch \n     Matthews, a lifelong Republican and initial proponent of \n     repealing the law, told ThinkProgress that it would end up \n     saving him $13,000 per year on medical costs. ``I still am a \n     very strong Republican, but this . . . I'm so happy this came \n     along.''\n\n  Mr. President, it has been this way all across America this week. I \nlearned personally from the man who started Google that they had \nproblems when that first started. They didn't believe that many people \nwere interested in the information they could give. There were about 9 \nmillion people this week who have gotten online to find out about \nObamaCare.\n  This has been very successful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/05/senate-section/article/S7242-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:02 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following joint resolutions, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.J.
