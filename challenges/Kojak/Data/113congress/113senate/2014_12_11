May the awesome Author of an \nenchanting yet endangered universe uplift our honored Senators with the \nessential twin gifts of freedom and responsibility, ever fulfilling the \ndemanding American dream. At these crossroads of compelling challenge, \nmay the Senators be reassured that each human life is a singular \njourney of promising purpose, that the Creator's divinity and human \ndignity are inseparably linked. May the Most High bless the Senators, \nthe Nation, and humanity with Shalom's sacred healing, hope, and \nharmony.\n  Recalling my early childhood in a Displaced Persons Camp in Germany's \nAmerican Zone, and on my 40th anniversary in the rabbinic ministry in \nthe most ecumenical Nation under Heaven, I am grateful.

Today's generation goes to Google for answers to questions \nthey have about geography, about politics, famous people, or any \nsubject. Any subject, you name it, and we all go to Google as quickly \nas we can. But long before Google, we had to use books, encyclopedias, \nvolumes of books containing all sorts of facts on topics, and they were \nall in alphabetic order. For almost the last 40 years--39 to be exact--\nthe Senate has had its own encyclopedia--legislative counsel Jim \nFransen.\n  Jim began his Senate career in 1975, just after graduating from law \nschool--from the University of Wisconsin--where he also studied as an \nundergraduate. That year he joined the Office of Legislative Counsel as \nassistant counsel. Over the years, Jim Fransen gradually moved up the \nranks until he was named legislative counsel, a position he has held \nfor 15 years.\n  He is a noted expert on a lot of things, but especially the United \nStates Tax Code. We have heard speeches on this floor about the \ncomplexity of the Tax Code. That is a monumental assignment, to \nunderstand the Tax Code. Jim certainly does, perhaps better than anyone \nin Washington. Jim actually wrote the Tax Reform Act of 1986. That was \nthe famous Bradley-Gephardt legislation.\n  For four decades, he has played a role in every important piece of \ntax legislation that has become law in our country. The Office of \nLegislative Counsel does the work for the Senate--not Democrats, not \nRepublicans, but all of us, including our staffs. They write bills to \ncreate programs while also drafting amendments that will have some \neffect on these programs, sometimes wiping out these programs. This \nimpartiality is the key to the success of the Senate and something we \ndon't often consider--how we get to the point where we are.\n  This massive bill we are going to deal with today has legislative \ncounsel's imprint on it. The same can be said of the bill they are \ngoing to work on today in the House, the omnibus; the tax extenders, \nthe same thing. These are the must-do's we have to do before we leave \nhere.\n  Another key to the success of Jim Fransen is the excellent team he \nhas put together in the Office of Legislative Counsel. The staff, under \nhis watchful eye, receives about 15,000 legislative inquiries every \nyear--15,000--well more than 1,000 a month, and they are responsible \nfor drafting 98 percent of all the legislation we do.\n  (Mr. WALSH assumed the Chair.)\n  It is rare to find someone like former Senator Jim Webb, who was a \nfreshman Senator who came in and drafted his own bill that would give \neducational benefits to the military. Senator Webb came to me and said: \nI am going to write my own bill. Now that doesn't happen very often, \nbut it was extremely important to him that he did that, and it had to \nbe done because it was a significant piece to the new GI bill of \nrights, which the Presiding Officer--the General--would certainly \nunderstand. But 98 percent of the work we do here is not stamped by Jim \nWebb. We depend upon Jim Fransen's office to do this. So his job is not \nan easy job, but he has excelled because of his knowledge of the law, \nhis experience of the legislative process, his patience, and his \nimpeccable character.\n  Jim Fransen is a man of integrity and one who considers everyone's \nviews, whether he personally agrees with them or not. It is no wonder \nJim is the second longest serving legislative counsel in the history of \nthe Senate. One of his admirers once told me: Jim always plays it way \nup here, while the rest of us are down here. His phone rings at all \nhours of the day and night with random requests, and Jim handles it all \nwith class and dignity.\n  Jim is retiring from the Senate at the end of this month. He will be \nmissed, and that is an understatement, but he leaves with us an Office \nof Legislative Counsel that has never performed better. I thank him for \nhis service, and I do this on behalf of the entire Senate family. I \nthank his family for the untold hours he has spent away from home. I \nappreciate the work his wife Margaret Ann has done in supporting him, \nand, of course, he will spend more time with his three daughters and \ntwo grandsons. So thanks very much for sharing this good man with us.\n  I wish Jim the very best in his retirement, and I repeat, I thank him \non behalf of the Senate family for all the work he has done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/11/senate-section/article/S6584-3", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6584-S6585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I indicated, we are going to move to the \ndefense bill, but we are going to also, as part of that bill, do \nsomething that is at least 10 years overdue. For the last 10 years, we \nhave been struggling to get bills out of the energy committee. We are \nfortunate enough to get them out once in a while, but they are stymied \nhere on the floor. That has been going on for 10 years. There has been \na permanent wrecking crew, led by one person, to do this.\n  Before Nevada was settled by pioneers, its mountains were home to \nthousands of bighorn sheep--we still have lots of them--and pronghorn \nantelope--we have the largest antelope herd in the entire world in \nnorthern Nevada--and Nevada's streams and lakes at one time were full \nof Lahontan and cutthroat trout. That is not the case anymore.\n  Because of the growth in the State of Nevada there has been a \ntremendous impact on the environment. We had in Nevada salmon in our \nrivers, but not anymore. We are trying to replenish fish so that we \nwill have more of what we did have before, including salmon. Like every \nState across the Nation, Nevada's natural and cultural heritage has \ncome under immense pressure as our cities and populations have swelled.\n  About 80 percent of the people now live in one of our 17 counties. \nClark County is where Las Vegas is. The other 16 counties make up about \n20 percent of the population. So the pressure, especially because of \nwhat has happened in southern Nevada, has been very difficult on the \nenvironment.\n  The other thing people have to understand is that 87 percent of the \nState of Nevada is owned by the Federal Government. That creates a lot \nof issues--some positive, some negative. But with the population having \nswelled, some of the issues we are now experiencing are certainly to be \nexpected. As our society continues to expand, the stresses on our land, \nour wildlife, and water resources will continue.\n  That is why the package of land bills in this National Defense \nAuthorization Act is vitally important to our country. The package is a \ncompromise that protects our Nation's wild and scenic places, our \nNation's unique history, and opens up other lands for development.\n  Are there provisions in this bill that I don't care a great deal \nabout in a positive fashion? Yes. There are things in this bill I don't \nlike. But there are things in here I do like. Are there things in this \nbill the majority of Republicans probably don't like? The answer is \nyes. So this is what legislation is all about. It is about compromise. \nIt is about working together to have an end product, and that is what \nwe have here.\n  This compromise is a chance for the Senate to get something done. \nCompromise has been wanting in this body, especially regarding matters \nof the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Hundreds of bills for \nthe last 10 years have been stopped.\n  I am only offering my opinion, but one of the finest public servants \nI have ever served with is Jeff Bingaman from New Mexico. Jeff is an \nabsolutely brilliant man, a hard worker. I would bet--and I don't bet \nvery often, and I am sure no one will take me up on this--but I think \none reason Jeff Bingaman left the Senate was because of the work he was \nunable to get done in his committee. What a good chairman he was,\n\n[[Page S6585]]\n\nbut he was stymied time and time again from getting anything out of \nthat committee. So for the last 10 years that committee has worked \nreally hard, very hard, but they haven't had much to show for that \nwork.\n  This package protects more than 1 million acres of landscapes. I was \nwaiting in my office and Senator Bennet from Colorado came to my \noffice. He had a great big poster with him. I asked: What is that? It \nwas upside down. You could see immediately what it was when it was \nright side up. He was looking for time on the floor to show America \nwhat was in this bill for the State of Colorado. This beautiful vista \nhe was showing me--and he showed the whole world last night--is \nsomething that is in this bill. It will be protected--a stunningly \nbeautiful forest area in Colorado.\n  One million acres of landscape will be protected. Watersheds will be \nprotected. Historic treasures will be protected. This protects over 140 \nmiles of wild and scenic rivers throughout our country. These bills \nwill create nearly 250,000 acres of wilderness in five States: \nColorado, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, and Washington.\n  Additionally, the packages convey more than 100,000 acres to local \ncommunities for economic development. My friend the Presiding Officer \nunderstands how important that is, being able to convey to the private \nsector the ability to develop Federal lands. It has to be done \ncarefully. It can't be done on a massive scale. If we did that, the \nrich people would wind up owning all the nice places. These are places \nI think should be shared by the American people. But 100,000 acres go \nto local communities for economic development.\n\n  The legislation continues our country's rich history, establishing \nnational parks. It designates a number of new areas--for example, the \nHarriet Tubman Historic Park.\n  I read in a period of a month two books on Harriet Tubman. They both \ncame out at about the same time. I can't imagine why a movie hasn't \nbeen made about this dynamic little 5-foot woman who did such \nremarkable things. What a story of this woman--this slave. She was a \nslave--bringing people out of the South into freedom in the North. She \ntook them as far as Canada. She did it alone. So I hope some day \nsomeone will make a movie of this stunningly powerful woman. We are \nrecognizing an area that will be named on her behalf.\n  The bundle of lands bills is good for America. It stretches literally \nfrom the shores of Alaska to the coast of Maine. It is especially \nimportant to Nevada, my State. It protects over 75,000 acres of \nwilderness in Humboldt and Lyon Counties in northern Nevada, the first \nnew wilderness protections in the State since 2006.\n  One of those areas is named after a famous Indian, Wovoka. There was \na man who was a famous Indian. He established a dance that really \nbrought Native Americans together. Even though it started in Nevada, it \nswept the country. This is going to be in Lyon County, it contains \nsage-grouse, bighorn sheep habitats, and some of the best fly fishing \nopportunities in Nevada and the Nation.\n  Now there is a pine forest wilderness in Humboldt County which has \nbeen championed by the local community. They have been working on this \nfor years. We couldn't get it out of the House of Representatives. Over \nhere, of course, it was a lost cause, and don't even think about \ngetting it out of the energy committee.\n  Environmentalists, ranchers, hunters, anglers, and off-road vehicle \nenthusiasts came together to protect 20,000 acres of scenic lakes, \namazing rock formations, and prime sage habitat.\n  But it also allows a mine there to have some more land from the \nFederal Government which they need from enlarging that land. It is a \ncopper mine. It is extremely important that we develop copper and don't \nhave to import it from South America and Russia.\n  Southern Nevada established the Tule Springs Fossil Beds National \nMonument on the edge of North Las Vegas. This area is the largest \ndeposit of ice age mammals in the United States. Imagine that basically \nin the middle of thousands of homes. People couldn't understand what \nthey were digging up out there, ice age mammals that are so \nunbelievably large and preserved over these thousands of years. When \nthe resources are developed, catalogued, and better understood, it will \nlikely be the largest deposit in the entire country.\n  The package sells 10,000 acres of land to the city of Yerington. Lyon \nCounty was a county that probably suffered more from the economic \nshutdown. They had huge problems of unemployment, and now we have that \nmine there that will help. This will allow them to make even more jobs \nthere.\n  The agreement also provides lands to the cities of Las Vegas, North \nLas Vegas, Fernley, Carlin, allocates tracts for three universities and \ncollege campuses, and expands Nellis Air Force Base and the Fallon \nNaval Air Station.\n  This is good for Nevada. It is good for the country. This legislation \npromotes jobs, protects the environment, helps our Armed Forces, and \ngives Americans the opportunity to enjoy the beautiful landscapes this \ncountry has to offer.\n  It is not perfect legislation. No legislation is. But this is really \ngood legislation. So I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthese critical lands bills which are part of the defense authorization \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/11/senate-section/article/S6585-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                         farewell to the senate\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, in 1986 the people of \nSouth Dakota elected me to serve them in the 100th Session of the \nCongress in the House of Representatives. In 1996 they gave me the \nhonor and privilege of being their junior Senator.\n  When I ran for the House in 1986, I told the people of South Dakota \nthat neither party has all the answers, and that both parties have good \nideas, as well as men and women of good will. My job, as I understood \nit, would be to work in a bipartisan manner, listening to all parties \nand reaching a good fit--also known as a compromise. That is what I \nstill believe.\n  However, in each year of my 28 years of service this has become more \ndifficult to achieve. Each party, rather than working cooperatively for \nthe American people, is more and more focused on winning the next \nelection. Today, days after the 2014 election, you can walk into the \ncall center for either party and find Members dialing for dollars for \n2016. Tonight there will be fundraisers across DC where Members will \ndiscuss policy not with their constituents but with organizations that \ncontribute to their campaigns. We have lost our way.\n  My thoughts are not original. My colleague and dear friend from South \nDakota, Senator Tom Daschle, in his farewell called for finding common \nground that ``will not be found on the\n\n[[Page S6586]]\n\nfar right or on the far left. That is not where most Americans live. We \nwill only find it in the firm middle ground based on common sense and \nshared values.''\n  Ohio's Senator Voinovich in his 2010 farewell speech said that his \ngreatest frustration was the difficulty in finding common ground on \nsignificant issues, saying that ``it doesn't happen enough.''\n  In fact, the need for bipartisanship and the lack of it in the Senate \nis a hallmark of Senate farewell speeches. Rather than expounding on \nthis topic, I would like to share the instances where I have \nexperienced it.\n  I found it working with my colleague Senator John Thune, as we put \naside our political differences and worked as our constituents expected \ntwo Norwegians to work. We worked side by side as we pushed for farm \nbills, highway funding, emergency relief from droughts and from floods. \nWe successfully fought the proposed BRAC closing of Ellsworth Air Force \nBase. However, honoring our Norweigian heritage, we never hugged.\n  I found it on the banking committee, working closely with Ranking \nMember Crapo. Together, we reached middle ground on reforms in which \nboth parties gave up significant priorities, compromising, finding the \nmiddle ground to pass bills out of committee.\n  My best and most enduring memory of this magnificent body occurred \nduring my 9-month absence following my AVM, a long and humbling \njourney. During this journey my committee assignments were respected \nand my friend from Rhode Island Senator Jack Reed graciously accepted \nextra responsibilities until my return. Senator Harry Reid told me that \nduring my long absence my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nnever once tried to take advantage of my absence. More importantly, in \nso many ways the kind words and prayers from you and your spouses, on \nboth sides of the aisle, supported both Barbara and me and gave us \nstrength during my long and continuing recovery.\n  I was grateful and humbled by your support on September 9, 2007, the \nday I returned to the Senate when almost every chair in this Chamber \nwas filled. Senator Reid and Senator McConnell, I thank you for your \nwelcome back to the Senate family.\n  In the years ahead, I will miss this family--not the bickering that I \nmentioned earlier, but the blessings that you have all been to Barbara \nand me.\n  I would also like to thank another family that has been critical to \nmy work for South Dakota--a family that goes by the name ``Team \nJohnson.'' This team is composed of highly talented and caring \nindividuals. They have worked tirelessly in the halls of Congress, in \nSouth Dakota, and on campaigns to make our State and our country a \nbetter place to live.\n  I wish I could thank each one of you for your service. Please know \nhow much I appreciated the long hours and late nights that you put in. \nIn the years ahead I hope we will continue to celebrate the friendships \nwe have forged.\n  To my friend and chief of staff for 30 years, Drey Samuelson, thank \nyou for joining my fledgling, uphill race for Congress in 1986 and for \nstaying with me until we close the Senate office in a few days. Few \nMembers of Congress have been as fortunate as I have been to have the \nloyalty, friendship, and thoughtful guidance that you have given me.\n  My legislative directors have all been remarkable, but time limits me \nto noting the services of two individuals who have served the longest. \nDwight Fettig started with us in the House as a young man fresh from \nhis internship with Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota. Dwight rose \nthrough the ranks to legislative director and then became my first \ndirector on the banking committee. Todd Stubbendieck is my current LD, \nand his legislative guidance for over 10 years has guided the staff in \nmoving critical legislation through the Senate. Todd and Dwight have \nworked on legislation for projects that now deliver water to hundreds \nof thousands of people across South Dakota, country of origin labeling \nbills, farm bills, national historic sites for Lewis and Clark and the \nMinute Man Missile, numerous projects for Ellsworth Air Force Base and \nthe South Dakota National Guard with efficiency and collegiality. To \nTodd and Dwight, thank you for your outstanding legislative teams.\n  Our No. 1 researcher, humorist, historian, and go-to person, Luci \nWeigel, has been with us since we opened the first offices. Thank you, \nLuci.\n  To my South Dakota State director, Sharon Boysen, thank you for \nleading the three State offices, for ensuring that we were responsive \nto South Dakotans, and for coordinating with the DC office.\n  Sharon Stroschein, who directed the Aberdeen office, and Darrell \nShoemaker, who managed the Raid City office, have been outstanding \nleaders for 28 years. You and all the State staff have been great \nadvocates for South Dakota. You made sure that I always knew what was \non the minds of South Dakotans, that I visited crisis situations, \nnonprofits, local and tribal governments, promising businesses, \nschools, and much more. Thank you.\n\n  Linda Robison, thank you for your dedication, willingness to go the \nextra mile, and your outreach to and service for our State's veterans \nfor 28 years.\n  The Senate office only needed one office manager for the last 18 \nyears. Nancy Swenson is the most efficient, precise, and insightful \nperson I know. The University of South Dakota will be forever grateful \nwhen they receive the archives Nancy assembled. Thank you.\n  To the Senate standing committees on banking and MILCON, you have \nserved our Nation well, and I know you will continue to do so in the \nfuture. Thank you for your leadership on important issues.\n  I am looking forward to the years ahead and the time we will share.\n  To my wife Barbara and our three children--Brooks, Brendan, and \nKelsey--thank you for your unwavering support, for putting up with \nlate-night dinners, for accepting that my work demanded that I be away \nso many weekends, and for working side by side with me on challenging \ncampaigns. Without your understanding, love, and support, I could not \nhave done the work I love.\n  Finally, to the people of South Dakota, thank you for the honor and \nprivilege of serving you in our State legislature, the House of \nRepresentatives, and the United States Senate. Thank you for working \nside by side with me to improve the lives of South Dakotans and our \nNation.\n  Pilamayaye.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Tim Johnson\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to my \ncolleague and friend Senator Tim Johnson.\n  Tim has deep roots in South Dakota and in the towns of Canton and \nVermillion in particular. He has served our State for more than 35 \nyears, first in the State legislature and then, after winning a highly \ncompetitive primary against two well-known Democratic opponents, in the \nHalls of Congress. In 1996, after a decade in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, Tim won his first of three terms in the U.S. Senate. I \nam well acquainted with his second election because I came out on the \nshort end of that stick. But I have had the privilege of serving with \nTim now in the South Dakota delegation for over 16 years, and the last \n10 have been here in the Senate. Today I want to pay tribute to his \nmany years of public service and all he has done for our home State.\n  I would also like to take a moment to thank Senator Johnson's staff \nfor their dedicated work. They have worked closely with my staff for \nmany years, and I am grateful for their efforts.\n  Like many South Dakotans, I will always remember Tim as a fighter. \nSouth Dakotans are tough, rugged folks, and Tim has exemplified that \nspirit every day in the Senate. A big part of his legacy as a public \nservant will be his tenacity, his work ethic, and his unwavering focus \non the policies he believed to be in the best interest of South Dakota.\n  Tim and I haven't always seen eye to eye on every issue, but we have \nalways been able to come together and work with South Dakotans in times \nof crisis. From drought relief, to flood and tornado responses, to \nprotecting the Black Hills from wildfires, Senator Johnson and I have \nalways been able to quickly\n\n[[Page S6587]]\n\nrespond to the needs of our State regardless of party differences or \npast disagreements.\n  Mr. President, when you represent a State like South Dakota--what \nsome people like to call a flyover State, a State some of our \ncolleagues here in the Senate occasionally mix up with North Dakota--\nthere are days when it can seem as though the concerns of rural \nAmericans aren't given fair consideration and the needs of rural \nAmerica are not being heard by the administration or the more densely \npopulated areas of our country.\n  I have had the great pleasure of working with Tim to bring a voice to \nthe concerns of rural America and those of us who hail from the middle \nof the country. To highlight just one of the many examples I could \nbring up, since his first term in Congress Tim has fought tirelessly \nfor water infrastructure to deliver clean drinking water to families in \nSouth Dakota and throughout the Great Plains. Water is a vital resource \nin the rural expanses of South Dakota, and Tim's efforts have helped \nmeet this basic need in underserved Indian reservations, small towns, \nand rural areas across the State. These investments will pay dividends \nwell beyond his tenure in the Senate.\n  Throughout Tim's long career in public service--from his beginnings \nin the legislature to his ascension to the chairmanship of the Senate \nbanking committee--he has had a hand in numerous efforts that will help \nSouth Dakotans and Americans alike for generations to come.\n  I know I speak for all South Dakotans when I say thank you, Tim, for \nyour dedication and your service to our great State. It has been an \nhonor to serve with you here in the United States Senate. Thank you for \nyour example, your efforts on behalf of our beloved South Dakota, and \nmost of all for your friendship. On behalf of my wife Kimberly and me, \nI wish you, Barbara, and your family the very best as you begin your \nretirement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2992\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. The DOD just reported that in 2014 almost the same \nnumber of servicemembers--19,000--reported unwanted sexual contact as \nin 2010. Still, fewer than 3 out of 10 are willing to report. The \noverall percentage of those who are reporting openly and seeking \njustice is declining, and a striking 62 percent retaliation rate went \nunchanged from 2012. Despite retaliation having been made a crime in \nlast year's NDAA, the Pentagon reports no indication of progress on \nthat front. Despite the Pentagon's spin, these numbers do not show an \nincreased trust in a system that simply isn't working for the men and \nwomen in uniform.\n  I wish to draw attention to comments made earlier this year by the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, GEN Martin Dempsey. He said:\n\n       We are currently on the clock, if you will . . . the \n     President of the United States said to us in December, you \n     know what, you've got about a year to review this thing and \n     show me you can make a difference . . . we understand that \n     just because Senator Gillibrand's vote was defeated yesterday \n     doesn't mean that a year from now it may not be reintroduced, \n     and if we haven't been able to demonstrate making a \n     difference, you know, then we deserve to be held to the \n     scrutiny and standard.\n\n  There is no other mission in the world for our military where this \nmuch failure would be allowed. Based on General Dempsey's own timeline, \nour men and women in uniform deserve a vote on this broadly bipartisan \nreform because the military has not been able to demonstrate that they \nhave made a difference; therefore, they should be held to the scrutiny \nthis year.\n  Throughout last year we continued to see the evidence of how much \nfurther we have to go to solve the problem of sexual assaults in our \nmilitary. We saw BG Jeffrey Sinclair--one of the highest ranking \nofficers ever charged with sexual assault--walk away with a slap on the \nwrist, reportedly over fears that the commanding officer had rejected a \nplea deal on lesser charges for political reasons despite stated \nconcerns over evidence.\n  That case brings up the very important issue of undue command \ninfluence--another reason why an independent justice system is needed. \nWe should all be able to agree that our brave men and women in uniform \ndeserve blind justice. The scale should not be tipped in either \ndirection--in favor of a victim or an accused. Why should our \nservicemembers enjoy a lesser standard of justice and fairness than you \nand I, whose freedoms they risk everything to protect?\n  According to a recent story in the New York Times, an attendee of a \nsexual assault prevention seminar was asked if things were improving. \nShe said:\n\n       We all laughed. Sinclair was happening then. He proved that \n     it was a joke.\n\n  The Times also chronicled the story of a survivor they called Kris, \nfrom Ellsworth Air Force Base. On April 12, 2013, about two dozen male \nofficers of the 37th Bomb Squadron gathered at a strip club at the \nbeginning of a pub crawl--including her commander. She was assaulted \nlater that night. According to the Times:\n\n       What Kris encountered since reporting the assault was the \n     same kind of cold-shouldered skepticism on the part of her \n     commander that Christensen had seen in a vast majority of \n     sexual assault cases--behavior that was supposed to have \n     changed with the military's recent vows to support those who \n     reported sex crimes.\n\n  Further, she was retaliated against, which is now supposed to be a \ncrime, and was told by a commander, ``It's illogical for you to think \nthat there won't be negative consequences to your reporting.''\n  She said: ``I was put on a shelf.''\n  Why in the world would we want this commander who takes his team to a \nstrip club and retaliates against a sexual assault victim to have the \nauthority to decide if a crime was committed? It is insane, and it is \nbeneath our military members.\n  I could read many more troubling cases, but perhaps the most eye-\nopening instance showing the ongoing lack of accountability was \nrevealed in testimony by a witness at a court-martial on September 24, \n2014--just 2 months ago. In this case, former Fort Leonard Wood drill \nsergeant Angel Sanchez was found guilty on multiple accounts of \nsexually assaulting female trainees. According to the witness, the \ncommand sergeant major at Fort Leonard Woods said--and remember this \nwas just 2 months ago--``If any more sexual assault cases come \nforward'' the whole company of soldiers won't graduate--not ``I don't \nwant to see any more sexual assaults''; rather, ``I don't want to see \nany more reports.''\n  Here is how we really know the system is broken: When a cadet is \ninstrumental in obtaining the first sexual assault convictions in over \na decade at the Air Force Academy, he is expelled. When a chief \nprosecutor is too good at his job and briefs Members of Congress, he is \nretaliated against and forced out. When a survivor comes forward, she \nis put on a shelf.\n  Time is short, but there is more than enough left for this Congress \nto actually do its job. We should not have more calls for just a little \nmore time. The DOD has failed on this issue for over 20 years now, and \nthe scandals of the last 12 months and the latest data show they still \ndon't get it.\n  As USA Today said:\n\n       Over the decades, sexual scandals have spurred cycles of \n     Pentagon apologies, congressional handwringing, half-baked \n     attempts at action and nibble-around-the-edges changes. Isn't \n     it time that women and men who serve their country so nobly \n     have a justice system that will serve them when they are \n     victims of crime?\n\n  I agree. Congress should vote to remove the chain of command from \nthese crises before year's end. Our servicemembers deserve no less.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be \ndetermined by the majority leader, after consultation with the \nRepublican leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar \nNo. 644, S. 2992, the Military Justice Improvement Act, that there be \nup to 1 hour equally divided between the proponents and opponents of \nthe bill prior to a vote on passage of the bill; that the vote on \npassage be subject to a 60-affirmative vote threshold; finally, that \nthere be no amendments, points of order, or motions in order to the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think it might be appropriate for the \nranking member of the appropriate personnel subcommittee to be heard on \nthis. In\n\n[[Page S6588]]\n\nmy opinion, he is the most knowledgeable person on this subject at this \ntime, and that would be Senator Graham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I join in the objection with Senator Inhofe. I appreciate \nwhat Senators Inhofe and Levin have done over the last couple of years, \nworking in a bipartisan fashion, to make sure we deal with a problem in \nthe military that is a problem in society, sexual assault, sexual \nharassment, and to set a zero-tolerance policy, but at the same time \nkeep the military in a position to defend this country.\n  What can we say about our military? We heard Senator Gillibrand's \nview. My view is that this is the finest military in the world--great \npeople. But within that construct, you have people doing things that \nare criminal, wrong. But is it any different in the military than it is \nanywhere else?\n  My argument is this is a societal problem, and in the military it is \na problem that is being addressed in, I think, a very aggressive \nfashion. Contrary to what the Senator from New York offers the Senate, \nI like where we are headed.\n  In March, we rejected her approach. Her approach was to fire every \ncommander and replace the commander with a bunch of military lawyers to \nmake decisions not just about sexual assault but about aspects of \nmilitary life far beyond that.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has been a military commander, and \nbarracks theft is a very big deal in the military. When you are in the \nmilitary and you find out someone has stolen from another member of the \nunit, and you are all living together on top of each other, side by \nside, that is a very big deal, and the commander responsible for that \nunit needs to make sure something happens fairly.\n  The last matter I will ever agree to is the following: Sir, or \nma'am--this is the first sergeant going to the commander--last night we \nthink there may have been a rape in the barracks, and the commander \nsays, well, that is no longer my problem, send that over to the \nlawyers. What a terrible thing to do to a military unit. The commander \nneeds more accountability, not less. The commander is the person whom \nwe choose to send people to war.\n  It is odd, to me, that we will give the commanders of the American \nmilitary the power of life-and-death decisions, but somehow they are so \nmorally corrupt or incapable of rendering justice in a situation such \nas this.\n  All I can say is that I respect the passion of the people who are \nbehind this to a point, but you are going too far. Members on the other \nside of the aisle have been threatened with money being cut off if they \nvote against this idea. This is no longer about reforming a system, \nthis is a political cause going out of control.\n  In my view, the good thing about the Armed Services Committee is that \nwe have always been able, for the most part, to work out problems that \naffect our military.\n  And I say to Senator Levin, through the Chair, above all others, I \nappreciate my colleague's maturity and leadership to make sure we get \nthe right answer. The right answer is to purge the military of the \nheinous crime of sexual assault, sexual harassment, clean up this mess, \nbut do not destroy the structure that makes it the finest military on \nthe planet, and we are well on our way.\n  Senator Gillibrand's bill last year did not make it through the \nSenate, but another bill did. Senator Ayotte, Senator McCaskill, \nSenator Fischer, along with the chairman, and others, came up with a \nreform package that I think was passed unanimously last March.\n  What do we now know from the recent report? You would have to have \nsuch a bias about your view to believe that this report doesn't show \nprogress. By any objective measurement, the reforms we have been \nworking on in a bipartisan fashion are beginning to bear fruit.\n  I will give an example of some of those reforms. Every victim of a \nsexual assault or of sexual harassment allegations in the military is \nto be assigned an individual lawyer--a judge advocate--to represent \ntheir interests.\n  I don't know about other States, but in South Carolina, we are miles \naway from that. The goal of the Senators that I have just mentioned, \nand myself, is to make sure that the military is the most victim-\nfriendly legal system in America, but a person can still get a fair \ntrial. That should be the goal of all of us, to ensure that every \nvictim has a lawyer.\n  I have been a judge advocate for 32 years now. I have thought long \nand hard of the times that I have known a lawyer in the legal community \nrecommend to the commander: Go forward on a sexual assault case, and \nthe commander says no. There is literally a handful, or less, that I \ncan think of. However, I do know that there are a lot more cases where \nthe lawyer says: Sir, or ma'am, we don't think we have enough here to \nprove this beyond a reasonable doubt, and the commander will say: Go \nfor it anyway. I want to make sure we air this out. That is the most \ncommon use of a commander's discretion vis-a-vis their lawyer.\n  But to those who are worried about making sure the commanders and \nlawyers understand where we are coming from, we made a wholesale change \nof how they report and dispose of these cases. If a judge advocate \nrecommends to the military commander in question to go forward and the \ncommander says no, that commander's decision to say no is reviewed by \nthe Secretary of the Service. In my case, it is the Secretary of the \nAir Force. If an Air Force commander is given legal advice by their \nJAG, informing us that we have a good case in the area of sexual \nassault, and the commander says no, it goes all the way up to the \nSecretary of the Air Force. As anybody who has ever been in the \nmilitary knows, that is a very big deal. That is the ultimate sign that \nwe expect people to treat these allegations seriously.\n  If the JAG and the commander say no to the prosecution, it goes to \nthe next step in the chain of command. What did this report say--and I \nwill let Senator Levin detail some of the results. The big takeaway is \nthat more people are coming forward, which is a good thing. More people \nare telling us they feel better able to come forward because the system \nis more understanding. The lawyer who has been provided to the victim \nhas been received very well.\n  The number of reports, restricted reports--where a victim says, I am \ngoing to tell you about what happened to me, but I don't want to go \nthrough the process of prosecuting somebody because I don't want to go \nthrough that process myself--that are now unrestricted has gone up \nfairly dramatically, meaning that the victim believes there will be \nsomebody there helping them through the system.\n  Retaliation is a problem all over society. I don't know of any law in \nSouth Carolina that makes it a specific crime in the eyes of the victim \nto retaliate against bringing an allegation forward.\n  Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, it is a crime to \nretaliate against someone making an assault complaint. The retaliation \nportion of the report--where 62 percent felt retaliation--mostly came \nfrom peer, lower level members of the unit, not the commander.\n  Here is what I would say: Once the commander goes forward and gives \nhis blessing to the allegation, retaliation is going to be less likely \nbecause it was the commander who made the decision in that unit and not \na far-off lawyer.\n  I will now turn this over to Senators Inhofe and Levin.\n  There are so many more reforms that are paying dividends. So many of \nthem have not even started yet.\n  I have to say we are on the right track. Let's give this a chance. We \nare taking this seriously. The military is responding in a positive \nfashion and now is not the time to retreat from these reforms. I do \nbelieve what we have done today will help us tomorrow, and our goal is \ncommon--to eliminate the scourge of sexual assault and sexual \nharassment, but keep the military command structure the way it is \nbecause it is necessary to hold our commanders more accountable.\n  I will end with this thought. There is no problem in the military \nthat can be solved without commander buy-in. That is the role of the \ncommander. To everybody who wonders about what is going on in the \nmilitary legal community, this colonel who feels put upon--if I am the \nhead of the subcommittee--will get a chance to come to our committee \nwith Senator Gillibrand and\n\n[[Page S6589]]\n\nmyself, if I am there, to give an accounting of what they think went \nwrong with the system and how they were treated, and the Air Force will \nbe required to respond.\n  Every judge advocate of every branch of the service opposes the \nGillibrand approach. Every commander and every member of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff oppose what Senator Gillibrand is proposing, for very \ngood reason. Give these reforms a chance.\n  To all of those who worked on this, congratulations. We are moving in \nthe right direction, but we have a long way to go.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are going to vote soon on cloture on--by the way, I \nunderstand there was an objection to the unanimous consent request by \nSenator Gillibrand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is an objection which I join. I understand she wishes \nto respond for 1 minute. I have no objection, as long as we can really \ndo it in 1 minute because I would like to close the debate prior to the \nvote on cloture. My friend from Oklahoma, the ranking member, also \nwants to make a comment.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I ask for 1 minute.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will yield for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I wish to clarify a few things that are very \nmisleading about this debate.\n  First of all, we are not making commanders less responsible. They are \nthe only ones who can prevent retaliation from happening, whether it is \nby them or lower ranks, and they are failing in that right now. The \nonly difference this bill makes is that 3 percent of commanders--the \nhighest ranking commanders, generals--will no longer make this \ndecision, but instead trained military prosecutors should make that \ndecision. Ninety-seven percent of commanders' jobs do not change. They \nhave to train their forces, bring them into battle, instill order and \ndiscipline, and make sure these victims are not retaliated against, and \nthat is where they are failing. We are making commanders more \nresponsible, not less responsible.\n  What I want is not the most victim-friendly place in the world. I \nwant no victims, and that is where we are failing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are going to vote on cloture on H.R. 3979 soon, which \nrepresents the agreement between the Armed Services Committees of the \nSenate and the House on the National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2015.\n  I urge my colleagues--I know my good friend from Oklahoma, the \nranking member, joins in this urging--to support cloture so we can \nenact this important bill into law.\n  The Armed Services Committee approved the defense authorization bill \nby a 25-to-1 vote in May.\n  In June, Senator Inhofe and I came to the Senate floor to urge \nSenators to begin to file amendments to the bill so we could work on a \npackage of cleared amendments and try to identify relevant amendments \nthat would need votes. We made the same request in July.\n  When our efforts failed to bring about a unanimous consent to bring \nthe committee-reported bill to the floor with an opportunity to offer \nrelevant amendments, we began to meet with the House Armed Services \nCommittee in an effort to reach a bipartisan agreement that could be \npresented to the two Houses for approval in the form of a new bill.\n  We also established an informal clearing process pursuant to which we \nwere able to clear 44 Senate amendments--roughly an equal number of \nDemocratic and Republican amendments--which are included in the bill \nthat is now before us. The process is far from ideal, but it was the \nbest we could do under the circumstances.\n  We now have before us a bill that is the product of a bipartisan, \nbicameral agreement between the Armed Services Committees of the Senate \nand the House of Representatives.\n  The House has already passed this bill by a vote of 300 to 119.\n  This bill includes hundreds of important provisions to authorize the \nactivities of the Department of Defense and provide for the well-being \nof our men and women in uniform and their families. The bill will \nenable the military services to continue paying special pays and \nbonuses needed for recruitment and retention of key personnel. It \nstrengthens survivor benefits for disabled children of servicemembers \nand retirees. It includes provisions addressing the employment of \nmilitary spouses, job placement for veterans, and military child \ncustody disputes. It addresses military hazing, military suicides, \npost-traumatic stress disorder, and mental health problems in the \nmilitary. It provides continued impact aid to support military families \nand local school districts.\n  The bill includes 20 provisions to continue to build on the progress \nwe are starting to make in addressing the scourge of sexual assault in \nthe military. It provides continued funding and authorities for ongoing \noperations in Afghanistan and for our forces conducting operations \nagainst the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria--ISIS. It takes important \nsteps to respond to Russian aggression in Ukraine. It adds hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in funding to begin to restore the readiness of our \nArmed Forces. And it begins to make some of the structural changes that \nare needed to enable DOD to perform its essential missions in an era of \ntight budgets.\n  The process may have been flawed, but we have done everything we \ncould to overcome those flaws and produce a defense bill that does the \nright thing for the national defense and for our troops.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture on the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015.\n  We have produced a defense bill that does the right thing for our \nnational defense and for our troops. I hope our colleagues will vote \nfor cloture. I hope I have a minute left to yield to the ranking \nmember.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I know we are out of time. The vote is going to take \nplace in 1 minute and we all appreciate that.\n  I will repeat what I think is most significant: We have to pass this \nbill. The House is going to go home. There is no way of making any \nchanges at this point. It has to pass. If it doesn't pass, when \nDecember 31 gets here, there will be 1.8 million enlisted personnel \nthroughout the country at all of our establishments who are going to \nlose their benefits. I am talking about pilots' pay, flight pay. I am \ntalking about the SEALS who have extraordinary duties and all the rest \nof them. These benefits will be taken away from our enlisted personnel \nif we don't pass this bill. In order to pass this bill, we have to pass \nthis procedural vote that will take place right now.\n  So I encourage everyone to keep in mind, if my colleagues truly want \nto help our enlisted personnel, they have to have this bill and this \nbill has to pass now.\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. \n     3979.\n         Harry Reid, Carl Levin, Brian Schatz, Martin Heinrich, \n           John E.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Farewell to the Senate\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, following in the traditions of the Senate, \nI come to the floor to speak about my experience in the Senate. \nUnfortunately, this will not be the last time I speak, much to the \nchagrin of many of you, as I have some adamant opposition to some of \nthe things we are doing.\n  But I nevertheless will try to put in context some of my feelings and \nthoughts about the great privilege that has been granted to me by the \npeople of Oklahoma. We hear a lot of speeches in this place. As Members \nwho are elected, it gets reflected on us, but nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. Because the things that really make this place operate \nare the people who work with us, the people who support us, the people \nwho help guide us, the people behind the scenes who are both brilliant \nand committed and dedicated to the founding principles of this country.\n  We all have them working for us. Yet they are rarely recognized. So \nwhether our accomplishments are big or small, those accomplishments \ncome through the work, efforts, and labors of those who join with us as \nwe come here to try to make a difference. So I first wanted to say \nthere are a lot of people I need to say thank you to; from our \nParliamentarian Elizabeth to all of the staff who work in the Senate, \nto the people who work at GAO, wonderful people, CRS, the IGs, \nlegislative counsel--they have written thousands, I mean literally \nthousands of amendments for me. They probably are going to have some \nreal mixed feelings about my departure. Then I have personal staff, one \nof whom--all tremendous--but one of whom I found to be a phenomenal, \nbrilliant person. His name is Roland Foster. There is not anything he \nhas ever forgotten. You can ask him anything. He will find it. He knows \nit. So I mention him. I have hundreds of others whom I could equally \nspeak about, from my former chief of staff Mike Schwartz, who passed \naway from Lou Gehrig's disease, to those in my office and staff who \neach knows what a difference they make--they did--the cloakroom staff \nand the help we get from Laura Dove and David Schiappa and Mr. Duncan \non our side--same on the opposite side. We are only able to function \nbecause of all of the people who enable us to do that. So with those \nthank-yous, I actually wanted to move to a different topic. The topic \nis believing in our country. I tell people wherever I go: We do not \nhave one problem we cannot solve. There is nothing too big for us. They \nare all solvable.\n  To prove that is my chairman, Tom Carper, on homeland security. He \nhas been a phenomenal chairman. He is not in my party. We do not agree \non everything, but the one thing we agreed on was that we were going to \nwork together to solve problems. We have. We did not solve them all, \nbut I would suggest if we look at what has come through this place, \neven in this dysfunctional place at this time, we will see more coming \nout under his leadership than any other pieces of legislation. Why is \nthat? It is because the focus was not about him, it was not about me, \nit was about solving the problems of our country.\n  To those of you through the years whom I have offended, I truly \napologize. I think none of that was intended because I actually see \nthings differently. You see, I believe our Founders were absolutely \nbrilliant, far smarter than we are. I believe the enumerated powers \nmeant something. They were meant to protect us against what history \nsays always happens to a Republic. They have all died. They have all \ndied.\n  So the question is, What will happen with us? Can we cheat history? \nCan we do something better than was done in the past? I honestly \nbelieve we can, but I do not believe we can if we continue to ignore \nthe wisdom of our founding documents. So when I have offended, I \nbelieve it has been on the basis of my belief in article I, section 8. \nI think we can stuff that genie back into the bottle.\n  E pluribus unum. ``Out of many, one.'' But you do not have one unless \nyou have guaranteed the liberty of the many. When we ignore what the \nConstitution gave us as a guideline, to protect the individual \nliberties, to limit the size and scope of the Federal Government so the \nbenefits of freedom and liberty can be expressed all across this land, \nthat is when we get back to solving our problems.\n  I think about my father--he had a fifth-grade education--a great \nbeliever in our country. He would not recognize it today. The loss of \nfreedom we have imposed by the arrogance of an all-too-powerful Federal \nGovernment, ignoring the wisdom and writing of our Founders that said: \nAbove all, we must protect the liberty of the individual and recognize \nthat liberty is given as a God-given right.\n  So my criticism isn't directed personally, it is because I truly \nbelieve that freedom gains us more than anything we can plan here. I \nknow not everybody agrees with me, but the one thing I do know is that \nour Founders agreed with me.\n  They had studied this process before. They know what happens when you \ndominate from a central government. This didn't mean intentions are \nbad; the intentions are great. The motivations of people in this body \nare wonderful, but the perspective on how we do it and what the long-\nterm consequences are of how we do it really do matter.\n  We see ourselves today with a President whom we need to be supporting \nand praying for, with an economy that is not doing what it could be \ndoing, and we need to be asking the question, Why? Is there a \nfundamental reason? And there is.\n  We are too much involved in the decisionmaking in the economy in this \ncountry that inhibits the flow of capital to the best return, which \ninhibits the growth of wealth, which leaves us at a standard of living \nthe same as what we had in 1988. That is where we are, yet it doesn't \nhave to be that way.\n  I am going to read some words we have all heard before, but they are \nworth rereading.\n\n       WE hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable Rights . . .\n\n  All of us.\n\n     . . . that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of \n     Happiness--\n\n  I look at legislation and say how does that have an impact on those \ntwo things, and too often it has a negative impact.\n\n     . . . That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted \n     among Men, deriving\n\n[[Page S6591]]\n\n     their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed, that \n     whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these \n     Ends, it is the right of the People to alter or abolish it.\n\n  I don't know where we are on that continuum, but I know we are not \nwhere we were intended to be in the vision of our Founders, and we are \nsuffering, no matter where you are in the country, as a consequence.\n  We established the Constitution to try to protect those rights and to \ndelineate those rights. We put in the limitation of the government and \noutlined the rights of each individual citizen upon which the \ngovernment shall not infringe. Yet what comes out of this body and this \nCongress every day, to my chagrin, infringes those guaranteed rights.\n  Every Member of the Senate takes the same oath and this is where I \ndiffer with a lot of colleagues. Let me read the oath, because I think \nit is part of the problem.\n\n       I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and \n     defend the Constitution of the United States against all \n     enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith \n     and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation \n     freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; \n     and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of \n     the office on which I am about to enter: So help me God.\n\n  Your State isn't mentioned one time in that oath. Your whole goal is \nto protect the United States of America, its Constitution and its \nliberties. It is not to provide benefits for your State. That is where \nwe differ. That is where my conflict with my colleagues has come. It is \nnice to be able to do things for your State, but that isn't our charge. \nOur charge is to protect the future of our country by upholding the \nConstitution and ensuring the liberty that is guaranteed there is \nprotected and preserved.\n  The magic number in the Senate is not 60, the number of Senators \nneeded to end debate, and it is not 51, a majority. The most important \nnumber in the Senate is one--one Senator. That is how it was set up. \nThat is how our Founders designed it, and with that comes tremendous \namounts of responsibility, because the Senate has a set of rules or at \nleast that gives each individual Member the power needed to advance, \nchange, or stop legislation. That is a tool that has to be mentored and \nrefined and wise in its application.\n  Most of the bills that pass the Senate never receive a vote. We all \nknow that. It is a vast majority of the bills. They are approved by \nunanimous consent. It only takes a single Senator to withhold consent \nto stop most legislation.\n  There are many other rules and procedures a Member can use. They are \noften referred to as arcane, but that is only because they are rarely \nused. They are not arcane. They were designed to protect liberty, to \nsecure liberty, to make sure that we don't all follow history and fail.\n  Every Senator has the power to introduce legislation and, until \nrecently, offer amendments.\n  No single Senator should be allowed to decide what the rights of \nanother Senator should be. That is tyranny. It has nothing to do with \nthe history and classics of the Senate.\n  To exercise the rights we have been entrusted with, we must respect \nthe rights of others. That is the true power of our Constitution. That \nis also the true power of the Senate. It is what binds our Nation \ntogether, and it is what is needed to make the Senate work properly \nagain.\n  The Senate was designed uniquely to force compromise, not to force \ngridlock--to force compromise. One Senator had the power to stop \neverything for the first 100 years, but it didn't because compromise \nwas the goal.\n  Our Founders understood there were many differences between the \nStates--in size, geography, economy, and opinions. They united the \nStates as one country based upon the premise that the many are more \npowerful than the one. As Senators, we have to follow this example. I \nhave not always done that; I admit that freely to you. I should have. \nAs Senators, we must follow the example, stand for our principles, but \nworking to find those areas of agreement where compromise can be found \nto unite and move our country forward. My colleague Senator Carper has \nmy admiration because he has worked tirelessly the past 2 years to try \nto accomplish that.\n\n  Not all of the powers of the Senators are exercised on the Senate \nfloor. Each Member of the Senate has a unique role to participate and \npractice oversight, to hold the government accountable, and that is \npart of our duties, except most often that is the part of our duties \nthat is most ignored.\n  To know how to reach a destination, you must first know where you \nare, and without oversight--effective, vigorous oversight--you will \nnever solve anything. You cannot write a bill to fix an agency unless \nyou have an understanding of the problem, and you can only know this by \nconducting oversight, asking the tough questions, holding the \nbureaucrats accountable, find out what works and what doesn't, and know \nwhat has already been done.\n  Effective oversight is an effective tool to expose government \noverreach and wasteful spending, but it also markedly exposes where we \nlose our liberty and our essential freedoms.\n  I have had some fun through the years, taken some criticism for the \nwaste vote--and it is opinion, I agree. Everybody who has seen the \nwaste book has a great defense of why it is there. But the real \nquestion is will we become efficient at how we spend the money of the \nAmerican people? This is a big enterprise. There is no other enterprise \nanywhere close to it in size in the world. It is not manageable unless \nwe all try to agree to manage it and have the knowledge of it.\n  I think there ought to be 535 Wastebooks every year, and then we \nought to have the debate about where we are not spending money wisely \nand have the information at our fingertips so we make great decisions \nbecause, quite frankly, we don't make great decisions because we don't \nhave the knowledge. Then what knowledge we do have we transfer to a \nbureaucracy to make decisions about it when we should have been guiding \nthose things.\n  True debates about national priorities would come about if we did \neffective oversight. It is the Senate, once hailed as the world's \ngreatest deliberative body, where these differences should be argued. \nOur differences should be resolved through civil discourse so they are \nnot settled in the street.\n  Just as the Constitution provides for majority rule and our democracy \nwhile protecting the rights of the individual, the Senate must return \nto the principles to bring trust of the electorate, and it can. Our \nFounders believed that protecting the minority views and minority \nrights in the Senate was essential to having a bicameral legislature \nthat would give us balance and not move too quickly against the very \nfundamental principles upon which this country was based--and not out \nof guessing, but out of thorough knowledge of what had happened in the \npast. We have to be very careful to guard both minority rights and the \nrule of law.\n  There is no one who works in the Senate who is insignificant, whether \nit is the people who serve us when we have lunch, to the highest of the \nhigh. They all deserve our ear. Each of us has value.\n  I would end with one final comment. The greatest power I have not \nused as a Senator, which I would encourage you to use in the future, is \nthe power of convening. You have tremendous power to pull people \ntogether because of your position.\n  To convene the opposite opinions--Chuck Schumer has been great at \nthat for me. When we have a difference, he wants to get together, \nconvene, and see how we work. That power is the power that causes us to \ncompromise, to come together, to reach consensus. So my encouragement \nto you is to rethink the utilization of the power of convening. People \nwill come to you if you ask them to come.\n  Again, I end by saying a great thank you to my family for their \nsacrifice, a great thank you to the wonderful staff I have, and a thank \nyou to each of you for the privilege of having been able to work for a \nbetter country for us all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n\n\n                         Tributes to Tom Coburn\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, we have all just heard a very moving, a \nvery inspirational and what I considered a motivational speech from our \ndear friend Tom Coburn.\n\n[[Page S6592]]\n\n  Twenty years ago, in 1994, there were a bunch of wild and crazy folks \nwho got elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. The Republicans \ntook the majority for the first time in 42 years. They ran on a \nContract with America and were led by a group of firebrand leaders. Tom \nCoburn was in that group of folks who got elected in 1994 to the U.S. \nHouse. I was in that group. Senator Graham was in that group. Senator \nBurr was in that group. Senator Wicker was in that group.\n  There were a few Members of that class who became known as real bomb \nthrowers. Tom Coburn was a bomb thrower. Tom Coburn would object for \nthe sake of objecting to anything that was going on. It didn't make any \ndifference which side of the aisle it was coming from. But let me tell \nyou, Tom Coburn matured into a class act, No. 1, which he always was; \nand No. 2, he matured into a legislator second to none.\n  Tom did not hesitate to object to any spending bill that came from \neither party if Tom Coburn believed that was not provided for in the \nConstitution and was something the U.S. taxpayer should not be paying \nfor. There is nobody who has guarded the pocketbook of the taxpayers of \nthe United States like Tom Coburn.\n  It is remarkable that those of us who were elected with Tom have had \nthe opportunity to see him over the last 20 years take on major \nsubjects that most veterans said, you know, in the end, we are going to \nprevail. But guess what. They never did. Tom Coburn, even though he may \nhave lost a vote from time to time, in the end, Tom Coburn prevailed.\n  Tom is one tough guy too. He has been through a lot physically and, \nboy, what a survivor. I mean we think we have issues to deal with. None \nof us can imagine what Tom has gone through. When somebody comes up to \nme as I am walking through an airport--and they will have seen Tom \nCoburn on TV--and they say: What about this guy Coburn, there are two \nthings that immediately come to mind when I think of Tom Coburn, family \nand faith.\n  First, family. Tom and Carolyn have had such a solid marriage. He \ntried to date her as an eighth grader and she wouldn't go out with him. \nBut he kept pestering her long enough that she finally did and what a \ngreat marriage they have had. They have three beautiful daughters and a \nhousehold of grandchildren whom he absolutely loves to death and likes \nto spend time with, as opposed to being here.\n  Secondly, Tom's faith. There is nobody I have ever met who has a \nstronger faith than Tom Coburn. He exhibits it on the floor, he \nexhibits it one-on-one, he exhibits it in the Prayer Breakfast every \nWednesday morning. He is one person who has probably counseled more \npeople in this body, on both sides of the aisle, than anybody other \nthan the Chaplain.\n  On top of that, he is just a class act. He has been a dear friend. We \nhave spent many hours on the road together, many hours on the golf \ncourse together and socializing together. There is no finer individual \nwho ever served in the Senate than Tom Coburn. He is one of the things \nI am truly going to miss about leaving here. But actually, as we have \nalready talked, we will probably now spend more time together than ever \nsince both of us are retiring.\n  But, Tom, to you, I thank you for that great friendship but also \nthank you for what you have done for my children and my grandchildren. \nYou are a great American and you have served this country well.\n  God bless you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, along with many of my other colleagues, \nI pay tribute to one of the most decent and principled men I have ever \nmet, Senator Tom Coburn.\n  Washington is going to miss Tom, but the irony of that is Tom really \ncan't stand Washington. When he first got here, the feeling appeared to \nbe mutual. Some just didn't know what to make of this doctor from \nOklahoma--so frequently on the losing end of lopsided votes, so often \npressing ahead on his own and never giving up. That was apparent from \nhis days in the House, when we hear he led the only ``filibuster'' in \nthe House anybody can ever remember. He may have placed more holds than \nany equivalent Senator in history. He apparently held his own bill \nonce.\n  Fast forward to today. The pundit class has declared Tom Coburn a \ncard-carrying member of the establishment. The rebel who once described \nhimself as a kamikaze pilot has now been branded, incredibly, with a \nscarlet ``E'' right on his forehead. It may seem contradictory, but Tom \nalways fought smart battles--the kind you might lose today but win \nlater--and he forged an amazing bond with the people he represents. For \nTom that meant spending as much time away from Washington as possible \nand making himself available when he was home.\n  Tom published his address, and Oklahomans were never shy about coming \nover to share their opinions. Tom was never shy about sharing how he \nfelt either. He believed his constituents deserved the truth. He gave \nit to them absolutely unvarnished, but he did it in a respectful way.\n  It reminds me of the two posters he has framed on either side of his \ndesk. One says: ``NO,'' N-O. The other says ``KNOW,'' K-N-O-W. That is \nTom in a nutshell. It is why Tom has made so many friends on both sides \nof the aisle. It is why you can't flip on MSNBC most mornings without \nseeing him.\n  I think Tom actually prefers these settings. It is a challenge he \nrelishes. Not only is Tom confident enough to tangle with anyone, he \nusually wins, and he rarely--rarely--makes lasting enemies. It is a \ntrait that has served him well, particularly at the beginning of his \ncareer.\n  Tom first came to Washington representing a district that was heavily \nDemocratic. He won a close race that year. I am told he also gained a \nfriend, and that friend was the Democrat he defeated. His opponent's \ngrandson actually ended up joining Tom's staff, which obviously is a \ngreat honor.\n  But it is no picnic being on Tom's staff. Tom works his staff hard. \nIt is difficult even to take a sick day over there. Tom has always got \nthe stethoscope nearby. If the doctor is in, so are you. Yet the people \non Tom's team seem to love him. ``Once a member of Coburn's family, \nalways a member.'' That is their motto.\n  It doesn't mean they love everything about him. Take his handwriting; \nit is just what you would expect from a guy named Dr. Coburn. It is \nabsolutely awful--a mix of chicken scratch, hieroglyphics, and vocab \nfrom the extra credit section of an MCAT.\n  Back in the 1990s one staffer made the mistake of letting Tom take a \nyellow highlighter back to Oklahoma. Tom spent the entire weekend \nmarking up a massive bill. There were handwritten notes and questions \nin nearly every margin. It took literally days to decipher any of it. \nIt was like something out of a Dan Brown novel. Needless to say, an \noffice ban on yellow highlighters was quickly implemented.\n  So the legacy of Tom's former profession gets him in trouble \nsometimes, but it remains the job he enjoyed most: helping to deliver \nnew lives into the world. It brings a unique perspective to Tom's work \nin the Senate. It instilled a lasting appreciation for life too.\n  Even though Tom has stopped delivering babies these days, he still \ntravels back to Oklahoma a lot. There is nowhere he would rather be \nthan his hometown of Muskogee, and there is almost nothing he would \nrather be doing there than mowing his lawn or eating a sandwich at his \nfavorite barbecue joint or sipping a cold Coors with olives. He prefers \nthese things over almost anything else, except spending time with his \ngrandkids and of course his wife Carolyn.\n  Tom has known Carolyn since grade school. She has always been the one \nto keep him balanced and grounded. She doesn't care that he is a \nSenator. She frequently reminds him of that too.\n  Carolyn is also the reason Tom is such good friends with President \nObama. Both men came to the Senate the same year. At freshman \norientation, Carolyn spotted Michelle Obama from across the room. ``She \nlooks like fun,'' Carolyn said. ``Let's sit next to her.'' The rest, as \nthey say, is history, and it is also remarkable. Because when Tom \nannounced his retirement, warm sentiments poured in from across the \npolitical spectrum. It was a day--listen to this--when Barack Obama and \nJim DeMint found something to agree on. It must have brought some joy \nto Tom at such a difficult time.\n  As he departs the Senate, Tom will leave one battle behind to \nconfront another. We are sending him every best\n\n[[Page S6593]]\n\nwish in that fight. We are keeping him in our prayers. We know he will \nprevail, but he is really going to be missed around here. He is just \nthe type of citizen legislator our Founders envisioned.\n  Tom has poured over more oversight documents than anyone cares to \nimagine. His ``Wastebook'' has become an annual phenomenon. It helps \ndrive the conversation on spending. He has led on issues like HIV and \nmalaria.\n\n  The Senate will lose a critical leader on intelligence oversight when \nhe leaves. Tom played an invaluable role on the Intelligence Committee, \nwhere he brought a unique blend of integrity, analytical rigor, and \ndogged determination. He served our Nation selflessly, toiling for \nhours every week in a secure hearing room, learning many sensitive \nmatters he could not discuss with others.\n  He worked closely with another extraordinary departing colleague, \nVice Chair Saxby Chambliss, to ensure that our Nation's intelligence \ncommunity retains the tools necessary to defend our country.\n  If anyone thinks our Nation's classified programs aren't overseen \nrigorously, they certainly haven't met Tom Coburn. He brought a \nskeptic's eye and a professional determination to the task. His probing \nlines of questioning earned the respect of his colleagues and helped \nthe intelligence community craft stronger programs, while also \nreminding us of the value of many other intelligence activities.\n  Now, Tom has obviously done a lot to earn his reputation as a hawk on \nthe budget, too. His interest there was never about the baubles of \noffice. It is about solutions. That is why Tom actually volunteered for \nSimpson-Bowles. That is why he lobbied me to actually take him off--\nbelieve it or not--of the Finance Committee.\n  You always know where Tom stands. I am told he was overseas with a \ncouple of other Senators when a government minister launched into a \nfinger-wagging harangue about our country. Tom couldn't take it after \nhe listened for a few minutes. He cut him off, told the minister what \nhe thought of him, and caught the next flight home. So Tom is literally \none of a kind. We are not likely to see another one like this guy.\n  Here is what former Senator Kyl had to say about him:\n\n       Tom's like your conscience. You can try to ignore him, but \n     you know he's right even when you wish he weren't.\n\n  Some people may think Tom is a member of the establishment now, but \nthe truth is Tom never changed. Washington changed. America changed.\n  People recognize the wisdom of his ideas--about leaving a better \ncountry to the next generation, about giving Americans the freedom and \nthe opportunity to achieve real meaning and lasting happiness in their \nlives.\n  We are going to miss the Senator who actually likes to get his hands \ndirty, who actually likes to legislate. We are going to miss the \nSenator who is so devoted to procedure that he sleeps next to Marty \nGold's book, and we are going to miss a friend who understands that \nhonest compromise is necessary to achieve anything in a pluralistic \nsociety. We are all going to miss Tom a lot. But he can retire with \npride, and he should know that we are sending him our best wishes for a \nspeedy recovery and a joyful retirement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I was not at all surprised as I listened \nto the words of our colleague Senator Tom Coburn that he quoted \nextensively from the Declaration of Independence and he referred to our \nConstitution--the founding documents of our great country.\n  When America's Founders conceived of a nation of citizen legislators, \nthey had leaders like Senator Tom Coburn in mind. Indeed, throughout \nhis service in Congress, he has remained a compassionate physician, a \ndevoted husband and father, a fierce defender of the rights enshrined \nin our Constitution, and an unwavering opponent of excessive spending.\n  Senator Coburn may be best known as our most diligent fiscal \nwatchdog, relentlessly hounding wasteful spending. His annual \n``Wastebook'' report is a call for transparency and accountability in \nthe Federal Government that has guided oversight investigations and \npolicy debates.\n  The aspect of his service in the Senate that deserves just as much \nacclaim is his work on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee and the Select Committee on Intelligence. Serving \nwith Senator Coburn on both of those committees for many years, I have \nseen firsthand his brilliance, his tenacity, and his determination to \nstrengthen our Nation and the safety of our people. He has a keen \nunderstanding of the grave and ever-evolving threats that our Nation \nfaces.\n  As a citizen legislator, Senator Coburn leads by example and with \ncompassion. With his expertise as a physician, he has been a leader in \npromoting wellness, disease prevention, combatting HIV/AIDS, and \nadvancing biomedical research. When it comes to fiscal responsibility, \nhe walks the walk, having returned more than $1 million from his Senate \noffice budget to the American taxpayers.\n  We have heard many descriptions of Tom Coburn today, but the word I \nmost associate with him is ``integrity.'' He is a man of the utmost \nintegrity, who always stands tall for his principles and for what he \nbelieves in. He sets an example for all of us who seek to serve the \npublic.\n  On a personal note, I want to thank Senator Coburn for hounding me \ninto joining a women's prayer breakfast that meets each week and has \nintroduced me to a number of wonderful women from the House of \nRepresentatives who have become my close friends as well as colleagues. \nAnd I use the word ``hound'' appropriately. He mentioned it to me so \nmany times that eventually I gave in and went to one of those \nbreakfasts, and, indeed, it has been a spiritually enriching experience \nthat I never would have had but for Tom continuing to press me to \nattend.\n  This past January Senator Coburn announced his intention to leave the \nSenate, due in part to his deepening health problems--problems he has \nfaced with extraordinary courage. This somber news was counterbalanced \nby his overarching concern, not for himself, but for his family and for \nthe people of his State and our Nation.\n  As he now returns to the life of a private citizen, I wish him every \nsuccess in combatting his illness, and I thank him for his truly \nextraordinary service to our country. To quote from Scripture, I think \neveryone would agree with these words when it comes to Tom Coburn: \n``Well done, good and faithful servant.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I have no prepared remarks. I am trying to \nspeak right from my heart, and my heart is full.\n  I want to start off by thanking Tom for the very kind comments he \nmade about serving with me. We met 10 years ago. He was that bomb \nthrower--still is a little bit--that Saxby talked about when they were \nelected 20 years ago. I was one of the people who came up, along with \nLamar Alexander, George Voinovich, and Mark Pryor, for an orientation \nfor new Senators so that when they got here we could actually spend \nsome time and teach the new guys and gals the ropes.\n  I remember the first day we convened and put them all in a big circle \nin Ted Stevens' office, a beautiful office here in the Capitol, and out \nof those 3 days Tom and Carolyn and Michelle and Barack began to bond \nand became friends. I didn't know how close friends they were until \nabout 4 or 5 years ago. Barack Obama had given the State of the Union \naddress. I was sitting on the Republican side. There was a time when we \nactually went back and forth to try to mix things up. The President \nfinished his speech, and there is no rope line at those speeches. The \nPresident came along to shake hands with people. I was sitting next to \nTom, and we walked down so we could say hi to the President.\n  I will never forget what the President said to him. In just the quiet \nbetween the two of them--they embraced, and the President said to him: \nAre you still praying for me? And very quietly, Tom Coburn said: Every \nnight.\n  Just like that--they didn't agree on everything, but they were \nfriends. They are friends, and they will always be friends. I hope Tom \nand I will be as well.\n  I remember sitting up there where Cory Booker, our new Senator from\n\n[[Page S6594]]\n\nNew Jersey, is sitting now, listening to Mike Enzi talking about how he \nworked so well with Ted Kennedy--Ted Kennedy, one of the most liberal \nDemocrats in the Senate, and Mike Enzi, one of the most conservative--\nand how they got extraordinary amounts of stuff done.\n  I just want to say that the legislation coming out of our committee--\nand Senator Collins has led that committee before--is moving through \nthis body and the House--it is really pretty amazing--to strengthen our \ncyber defenses, to take the chemical facility antiterrorism law that \nSusan Collins authored and to make it better and make it real, to \nbetter protect our Nation's information from attacks from all over the \nworld, to try to make our Postal Service not just relevant and not just \nhanging on but actually vibrant and real.\n  But that day, Mike Enzi talked about the 80/20 rule with Ted Kennedy. \nHe said: Ted Kennedy and I agree on about 80 percent of the stuff, and \nwe disagree on 20 percent. He and I decided to focus on the 80 percent \nwe agreed on and set aside the 20 percent we didn't agree on to another \nday.\n  I call that the ``Enzi Rule,'' and that has helped guide me here in \nthe Senate, and it certainly has helped to guide me in the work I have \nbeen privileged to do with Dr. Coburn.\n  When I became chairman of the committee about 2 years ago and Dr. \nCoburn was going to be the ranking member of the committee, somebody \nasked me what it was going to be like. How are you going to work with \nthis guy?\n  I said: It is going to be a little like a marriage. You have to work \nat it every day. Everybody has to give and meet somewhere in the \nmiddle.\n  I love to ask people who have been married a long time what the \nsecret is for being married a long time. Some of you have maybe heard \nme talk about this. I get some really hilarious answers but also some \nreally terrific and insightful answers.\n  I think the best one I have ever gotten when I asked what is the \nsecret for being married 40, 50, 60, 70 years is the two c's. It is not \nCoburn and Carper. It is the two c's: communicate and compromise. That \nis not only the secret for a vibrant, long marriage for two people; it \nis a secret for a vibrant democracy.\n  I believe the reason why Tom and I have had this partnership that I \nthink has been productive is, one, we surround ourselves with people--\ncertainly for me--smarter than us. The second thing is we believe in \ncommunicating, we believe in compromising, and we believe in \ncollaborating. I think the American people are the beneficiaries of \nthat.\n  We have a reception later today for Tom, and I hope he comes. We will \nhave the opportunity to say some more things, as well. He is not the \nkind of person who likes to be praised, so this is probably punishment. \nThere is a verse in the Scriptures talking about heaping with praise, \npouring praise all over. This is probably a little like that. But I \nwant to close with this. His words on the Bowles-Simpson Commission are \nfor the ages, and I hope we will never walk away from the lessons he \nshowed us with his courage in supporting that work and helping to craft \nthat work.\n\n  There are words in the Scriptures, in Matthew 25, that talk about the \nleast of these in our society. When I was sick, when I was hungry, when \nI was thirsty, when I was naked, when I was in prison--those are the \nquestions. The answer: If you have done it to the least of these, you \nhave done it also to Me.\n  Senator Coburn believes we have a moral responsibility, a moral \nobligation to the least of these in our society. He also believes we \nhave a fiscal obligation, a fiscal imperative to meet that moral \nobligation in a fiscally responsible way. And I think those two ideas \nguide him in his work, and, frankly, it is an inspiration to me.\n  Last word. Leaders should be humble, not haughty. Leaders should lead \nby our example, not ``do as I say'' but ``do as I do.'' Leaders should \nhave the heart of a servant. Leaders should have the courage to stay \nout of step when everyone else is marching to the wrong tune. Leaders \nought to be committed to doing what is right, not what is easy. Leaders \nshould treat other people the way they want to be treated. Tom has \noffended just about everybody in this body, but he always comes back \nand apologizes, and he has already done it here today. Leaders should \nfocus on excellence in everything they do. If it isn't perfect, make it \nbetter. It is in the preamble of the Constitution--``in order to form a \nmore perfect Union.'' That defines him. Finally, if you think you are \nright and you know you are right, never give up. That is what a leader \nshould be about.\n  For the years he served here and for a long time before that and for \na long time to come, he has been that leader, and I feel lucky to say \nhe is my friend.\n  God bless you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I feel surrounded by friends and colleagues \nwho are getting ready to leave, and being part of that original class \n20 years ago, there is one thing that I have learned is extremely \nunique in Washington. I am next to two people who are voluntarily \nleaving. The toughest decision a Member of Congress ever makes is to \nleave this institution voluntarily. And I know that for my two friends \nand my third one, Mike Johanns, this was not easy. It is not easy to \nstand here and know that in January they are not going to be here any \nlonger, because they are truly friends, and that is tough.\n  To say that Tom Coburn can be intimidating I think is an \nunderstatement, and I think that comes because his breadth of knowledge \nbased upon his experiences in life enable him to be an expert on a lot \nof issues.\n  With that in mind, I remember the day Tom sat down--we were leaving \nthat week, and I said: What are you going to do this weekend? And he \nsaid: Well, Sarah's future fiance is coming to sit down with me to find \nout whether he can marry my daughter. And I looked at him and thought, \nI would hate to be that young man.\n  Well, the truth is that Tom is a very intimidating guy. He plays \nhard, and he plays to win.\n  There is not an individual I know who is more fair and more \ncompassionate than Tom Coburn. I remember the day the Bush \nadministration wanted to extend the PEPFAR Program--the AIDS in Africa \nprogram--and when Tom found out that they were going to relax the \nrequirement on how many people were treated and that more money would \ngo to education than to actually saving lives, he grabbed me and he \nsaid, ``We can't let this stand. We've got to fight it. We've got to \nchange it.'' And it was Tom Coburn who blocked the reauthorization of \nPresident Bush's PEPFAR plan for 6 months--a Republican President, a \nRepublican Senator. Why? On principle.\n  Tom Coburn, if you didn't know it before this speech today, has never \ndone anything in this institution or in life that wasn't based upon \nprinciple. No Member of Congress should ever question whether he thinks \nhe is right because if he didn't think he was right, he wouldn't fight \nso hard.\n  It is particularly difficult for me to say goodbye to Tom. We truly \nare legislative partners. We fought a lot of battles for a long time, \nand inherently we have a level of trust in each other that I would \nactually sign on to legislation that I had no idea what it did; I just \nknew that in that foxhole he needed somebody he could count on, and I \nknew when he signed on to something that I needed, that there was \nalways somebody there to cover my back.\n  The institution is losing something significant when we no longer \nhave that legislative expertise Tom Coburn represents.\n  There are a lot of descriptions that people have used today and that \npeople will use in the future to describe Tom Coburn, but I would boil \nit down to two words that I think best describe him: Tom Coburn is a \ngood man. In every sense of the word, he is a good man. This \ninstitution will lose a great leader when Tom Coburn retires.\n  Godspeed, Tom.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will be very brief. I know people are waiting to \nspeak.\n  I guess it would surprise the world in general to know that Tom \nCoburn and I are true friends, but we are. He is a man of integrity \nabove all.\n  You don't have to agree with someone--we probably disagree on 90 \npercent of all the issues--to trust someone's integrity, to trust \nsomeone's\n\n[[Page S6595]]\n\nhandshake, to trust someone that if you make a good argument, \nunderstanding their values, they will come along. That is just what Tom \nCoburn has done time and time again with this Senator from New York and \ncountless others on the other side of the aisle.\n  On so many issues where Tom was opposed, I said: Let's just sit down \nand let me give you the logic and then you will make your own judgment. \nAnd I knew that would be good enough. Sometimes it didn't work. \nSometimes he disagreed. But he always sat and listened. He always asked \nperceptive questions, not ``gotcha'' questions. He was trying to figure \nit out.\n  Of course the most well known was when we negotiated on the Zadroga \nbill. Thousands of New Yorkers had rushed to the towers and gotten \npoison in their lungs and their gastrointestinal systems, and we wanted \nto help them. We thought they were just like our veterans. Tom knew it \nwas a big expense. He sat with us, listened, made suggestions to make \nit leaner and trimmer, and then supported the bill. So right now there \nare people alive throughout the New York area, heroes, because of the \nintegrity of that man from Oklahoma.\n  Tom, I will miss you. This body will miss you. Regardless of our \nideological views and perceptions, we will miss you. You are a great \nAmerican.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. First of all, there is not a whole lot that needs to be \nsaid that hasn't been said, but one thing I want to say to my dear \nfriend Tom Coburn is that he made Washington happen for me, if you \nwill. He made it more tolerable. I had a hard time in transitioning. \nTom reached out. He saw that. We talked about this before, but Tom made \nthis place more palatable.\n  Tom, you have expanded my area of friendships with more people than \nyou know and the right type of people, and I appreciate it I think more \nthan you even know.\n  I will end with this, and I don't mean to say a lot. I have been \nasked about Tom Coburn. How would I explain him? Tom Coburn's got soul. \nTom Coburn's got soul. And I mean that from the bottom of my heart, \nbrother. You have soul, and I thank you for what soul you brought to \nthis place.\n  God bless.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Fourteen years ago I entered the House of Representatives. \nI had been elected, but before I took office, I traveled to Washington, \nand Matt Salmon, the Congressman I was replacing, said: Is there \nanybody you want to meet? And I said: Tom Coburn. I had watched from \nafar what he had done on the Appropriations Committee and the stands he \nhad taken, and I admired him. I went and visited with him in his office \nwhile he was packing up his stuff. I will never forget that. And I have \nto say that today I admire him even more than I did then, having \nwatched him go back into the private sector and then enter the Senate.\n  Columnist George Will said Tom Coburn was the most dangerous creature \nthat could come into the Senate. Why? Because he is simply uninterested \nin being popular. I think that is certainly true. But if he didn't care \nabout it, it happened anyway. I have news for Tom. As you can see \naround, he has become popular. But one thing he never managed to \nachieve, if he sought it, was becoming partisan. When you hear those \nacross the aisle lavish praise on this man, realize that was never one \nof his goals and never happened, much to his credit.\n  I thank you and your staff for your generosity over the years to me \nand my staff and for what you have done for this institution, for your \ncolleagues, and for me personally.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I probably have known Tom for the least \nlength of time of anybody in this Chamber, and I want to offer some \ncomments from the perspective of only 2 years and really more like a \nyear and a half since we became friends and colleagues.\n  I have seen Senator Coburn in two contexts--one is intelligence and \nthe other is faith. He and I serve on the Intelligence Committee. We \nsit directly across from each other. That committee is generally a non \npartisan one, but it is also one where all the meetings generally are \nclosed. There is no press. You can really take the measure of someone \nwhen they ask questions and participate in a debate in that forum.\n  His questions always struck me as the questions I wished I had asked, \nand they struck me as the questions I am sure the people of America \nwould have wanted asked. They were penetrating, they cut through \nobfuscation, and they were always meaningful and helped us move toward \nthe important work that committee has to accomplish.\n  I have also become acquainted with him through our faith and \nparticipation in the Wednesday Prayer Breakfasts, and more recently, \nfor reasons that I am not entirely sure, he has invited me to join him \non Tuesday evenings for dinners on the other side of the Capitol that \nhave been very meaningful.\n  For the 9 years before I came here, I taught a course called \n``Leaders and Leadership,'' and I taught it at a couple of colleges in \nMaine. I taught it really as much for myself as for my students because \nI wanted to try to understand what leadership was, and I thought if I \nsigned on to teach it, I would have to learn something about it. Every \nyear what we did was go through and discuss the stories of great \nleaders throughout history, some well known and some not so well known. \nWe always started with Ernest Shackleton. We talked about Eleanor \nRoosevelt and Margaret Thatcher and Martin Luther King and Lincoln and \nChurchill. We always tried to define the qualities that make a leader, \nand there are lots of them--perseverance, communication, vision, team \nwork, trust--but the last one on the list and the one that brings me \nback to Tom is always character. It is an indefinable quality. You \ncannot really put a specific definition to it, but people like Lincoln \nhad it, Ernest Shackleton had it, Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain from \nMaine had it, Eleanor Roosevelt had it. It involves a combination of \nqualities that Tom embodies, and almost all of them have been mentioned \nhere today--integrity, intelligence, honesty, faith, belief in \nprinciple, and daring to stand for principle. It is the hardest thing \nto teach, but it is the easiest thing to see. And the reason I felt so \nprivileged to get to know this man for such a short period of time is \nthat he has shown me what character is all about.\n  Tom, it is one of the great joys of my life to have had these 2 years \nto get to know you, if only slightly. It is one of the great sadnesses \nof my life that it has only been 2 years.\n  Godspeed, Tom. You have made a difference for this country that we \nall love and honor and respect. Thank you for your service and for \nsharing your great character with all of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I was elected in a special election 16 years ago. I was \nNo. 435 in the House of Representatives, so I did what my father told \nme to do when I went into business. He said: Son, sit in the back of \nthe room, listen to people who are smart, pay attention to them, and do \nwhat the smart people do.\n  After 2 weeks of listening to Tom Coburn, I said no human being could \nknow as much about everything as this guy named Coburn. In 16 years, I \nhave come to believe, yes, there is one who knows about everything he \nspeaks of, and that is Tom Coburn.\n  Senator Coburn has been a great role model for me. The Senator from \nOklahoma has taught me many great lessons, and I have learned a lot \nfrom him.\n  The greatest evangelists in life are those who witness their faith, \nand Tom Coburn is a true witness for his faith and has changed the \nlives of many people. I have enjoyed, as much as anything, our walk \nwith faith at the Prayer Breakfasts, in private meetings, and what we \nhave shared together.\n  Lastly, every Christmas I try to give my grandchildren who can read \nsomething to read as a little treasury to put in their book to save so \nthat when they grow up, they can refer to great things and great \nhistorical statements that have been made. I doubt if there has ever \nbeen a better statement made on the floor of the Senate about our \nheritage, our country, our future, and our\n\n[[Page S6596]]\n\nhopes than Tom Coburn has said today. It will be required reading for \nmy grandchildren this Christmas, and I can assure you that I am a \nbetter man for having served with Tom Coburn, the great Senator from \nthe State of Oklahoma.\n  God bless you, Tom.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The other Senator from Oklahoma.\n  I wish to make some unscripted comments, but sincere and from the \nheart. I hope I am accurate when I say this, that I think in some \nrespect I discovered Tom Coburn. I suspect that Tom and I are the only \ntwo who have ever been to Adair, OK. I remember hearing that there was \na conservative doctor from Muskogee. I remember calling him up at that \ntime and asking him to run for the House of Representatives, which he \ndid. He kept his commitments and did everything he was supposed to do. \nI always remember that day.\n  As Senator Coburn knows, we have a place my wife and I built on a big \nlake in Oklahoma back in 1962--a long time ago. When I drive up there, \nI go through Adair, and I go by that little sheltered area that is half \ntorn down now. They tore down the biggest bank in town. Every time I go \nby there, I have to say I recall meeting for the first time with a \nyoung doctor named Tom Coburn.\n  I regret to say there are times in our service together when we have \nnot been in agreement on specific issues, and I think we have a \ncharacteristic in common. I think we are both kind of bullheaded, which \nhas created some temporary hard feelings, but there is one thing that \novershadows that. Jesus has a family, and His family has a lot of \npeople in it. Some are here in this room. Tom Coburn and I are \nbrothers.\n  In the 20 years I have been here in the Senate, I don't believe I \nheard a speech that was as touching and sincere as the speech I heard \nfrom my junior Senator a few minutes ago.\n  I really believe that in spite of all the things that have happened--\nand there were some differences, but they were minor--that he never \nceased to be my brother, and I want to ask the Senator right now to \nforgive me for the times I have perhaps said something unintentionally \nthat was not always right and was not always from the heart. But I want \nmy junior Senator to know that I sincerely love him and am going to be \nhurting with him with the troubles he has right now, or might have in \nthe future, and will sorely miss him in this body.\n  I ask that the Record show that I sincerely love my brother, Senator \nCoburn.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. I have been sitting here listening to the respect and the \nemotion of people recognizing the service of Tom Coburn. I don't have a \nprepared speech, but I second everything that has been said about Tom.\n  My emotions well up in me when I think about Tom. Tom exhibits the \nconviction that I wish I had more of, Tom exhibits the commitment I \nwish I had more of, and he exhibits the courage I wish I had more of.\n  I remember my very dear friend Chuck Olson made this statement: Lord, \nshow me the kind of person You would like me to be and give me the \nstrength to be that person.\n  I feel like God has given a gift to the Senate, and certainly a gift \nto me, by simply saying, take a look at Tom Coburn. Look at the \nqualities he exhibits and his commitment to faith. He is a pretty good \nmodel to follow.\n  Thank you, Tom.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I came down to give my farewell remarks, but before I do, \nI have to make a comment about Senator Coburn. Senator Coburn is \nabsolutely what many people said about his word. Yesterday was an \nexample of that when he resolved an issue.\n  There is always activity after the Senate, and I wish my friend from \nOklahoma the best.\n\n\n                         Farewell To The Senate\n\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for allowing me to speak on my 6 years \nof serving in this body. It has been a true honor to serve with the \nPresiding Officer in the short time he has been here and to serve with \nall of my colleagues, but it has been an even bigger honor to serve my \nfellow Alaskans.\n  Alaska is a huge State--660,000 square miles. More than--to my \nfriends from Texas and California, please don't take this personally--\ndouble and triple the size of States such as Texas and California.\n  But Alaska is a very small place in many ways. People make personal \nconnections with their elected official. At the end of the day, we \npretty much know everybody one way or another. Alaskans will more than \nlikely will see me at a checkout stand at Andy's Hardware or Home Depot \nor hanging Christmas lights at my wife's store or doing errands with my \nson Jacob that at times he is not very anxious to do. It is a small \nState, and they will more likely see me doing that than on the floor \nmaking speeches or on C-SPAN.\n  When Alaskans contacted me with an idea or complaint or problem, we \nmade sure we responded. After 6 years in the Senate, I am most proud of \nthe work with helping Alaskans and their families. My office responded \nto more than 360,000 individual letters and emails and phone calls from \nAlaskans. To put it in perspective, 360,000 is roughly half the \npopulation of the State.\n  Much of my staff is here with me on the floor today. I thank them for \ntheir unwavering service to their fellow Alaskans. Truly I have the \nbest of the best. Some of them worked with me when I was mayor and are \nnow working for me as a Senator. Many will go on and continue to do \nincredible work not only for Alaskans but for this country. I thank \nthem.\n  We took on 3,000 individual casework cases to help Alaskans navigate \nthe Federal Government. We helped them get their Social Security \nchecks, made sure the local post office actually delivers the mail, and \nin Alaska that is important. We fought for benefits for individual \nveterans.\n  I am also proud of the great policy work we did. When I say we, it is \nbecause sometimes ideas came from Alaskans, sometimes they came from \nthis body, sometimes I would have a crazy idea I would write down on a \nsheet of paper, but at the end of the day it was my staff that did the \nwork.\n  Opening Alaska's arctic lands and waters to responsible resource \ndevelopment--NPR-A, CD-5, Beaufort and Chukchi. We also helped to \nconvince the EPA to free up permits for Kensington and Greens Creek \nmines.\n  The Arctic. When I first came to the office, I have to say that not \neverybody knew where the Arctic was. Some didn't even know it was an \nocean, to be frank with you, but that is not the case today. Some of my \ncolleagues probably got tired of hearing me always talk about Alaska no \nmatter what they were discussing.\n  I see my friend Al Franken is here, and I know he remembers this \nstory. He draws incredible maps of the United States, and he does it \nall freehand. I remember him drawing a map one day, and I said: You \nmissed two things, Alaska and Hawaii.\n  He said: Well, when I drove around the country with my parents, they \nwere not States, they were just territories, and the maps they bought \nwere maps of the lower 48. So I sent him a dot-to-dot of Alaska, and he \nsent me back a nice letter with a map of Alaska he had drawn.\n  No matter what conversation my colleagues might be having on an \nissue, I would manage to weave in Alaska.\n  The Arctic has unbelievable potential. We just touched the tip of the \niceberg and there is more work to be done.\n  Working on defense is important to Alaska. It is important that we \nkeep our military bases secure by saving F-16s at Eielson and getting \nF-35s next. We need to make sure that the benefits for those who are \nserving continue to be there for them.\n  It is incredible to hear stories from veterans when they talk about \nthe new model of care we developed over 2\\1/2\\, 3 years ago. Our State \nhas 77,000 veterans. When I was campaigning in 2008, I had an idea that \nI called the Hero's Health Card, and I remember when I got into office, \npeople said it will never happen. People who know me know that when you \nsay never or no, that means yes, they just didn't spell it properly, \nand I have to figure out what to do.\n  Today in Alaska, it doesn't matter if you are a veteran in the \nsmallest rural communities or the biggest cities, you\n\n[[Page S6597]]\n\nwill get health care and access to it through our tribal health care \ndelivery system--the first in the Nation.\n  One time when I was in Bethel, this gentleman who was a veteran came \nup to me when I was in the VFW Hall. A lot of us have been in VFW \nhalls, and you know that when someone comes at you at an aggressive \npace, it is probably not a positive situation, but you have to engage \nthem in a conversation. He held his hand out and showed me his scars, \nand he said that he had to go to Anchorage to get this taken care of, \nand you told me I could go down to my clinic and get it taken care of, \nbut it didn't happen. I was about to say something, but before I could \nget a word out, he said: Do you know what I get to do because of what \nyou did? Every single week now when I need therapy, I can go down the \nstreet in Bethel instead of flying to Anchorage to get it done. That is \na model of how to do the right thing.\n  Alaska is well known for fisheries. I don't mean to pick on Senator \nFranken, but I remember him coming up to me because we coined a phrase \non modified engineered fish which we called the ``Frankenfish.'' It was \nnot about the Senator, but it was about this fish that was chemically \nenhanced and would really destroy the fisheries in Alaska and would be \nbad for the market and bad for consumers. We fought over that issue \nbecause Alaskans brought it to our attention every single day.\n  I just mentioned some of the things we did for native rural health \ncare, which was not just about Alaska. When we discussed an issue in \nour office, we asked: Can we do it for Alaska, and does it have an \ninternational impact? Will it impact the rest of the United States in a \npositive way?\n  I remember hearing and reading about the money the Federal Government \nowed to our tribes which had not been paid for two decades. It was \nmoney for clinical services they produced. We did some things, and the \nnet result was Alaska received over $500 million in settlements over \nthe last year. On top of that, many tribes across the country now have \nalmost three-quarters of a billion dollars, money owed by the \ngovernment for services delivered to individuals. And earlier this week \nwe were able to pass another piece taking away the restriction on our \ntribes in Alaska so they can now, under the Violence Against Women \nAct--and we hope the House passes it--to be able to dispense and do \ntribal government in the sense of our justice system improving the \nsituation on the ground when it comes to sexual assault, domestic \nviolence, and substance abuse.\n\n  There are a lot of examples. It is hard when we talk about these \nbecause there are a lot of great things that have been done, not just \nindividually but collectively. But in this place we spend a lot of time \ntalking about doom and gloom and how the sky is falling and always the \nworst-case scenario.\n  We have come a long way in the last 6 years. The people who know me \nknow I don't care how bad the situation is, I am positive about it \nbecause there is always another day to solve these problems and make \nthings happen.\n  I think about where we were when I came to the Senate. I remember \ncoming on this floor as a freshman in 2009, and the chaos of this \neconomy was unbelievable. We were losing 600,000 jobs a month--equal to \nthe whole population of my State--unemployed, boom, gone. Unemployment \nwas around 10 percent. The stock market was at 6,500. Two of the \nlargest automobile companies in this country were flat on their backs. \nNo housing starts were happening. The market was crashing. The deficit \nwas $1.4 trillion per year. As a new Member, I wasn't sure what I had \ngotten myself into, to be frank. Some of the Members who came with me \nwere trying to figure out, What did we get? But we didn't sit around.\n  I know we always hear this doom and gloom out there. When we look \nback over 6 years, we remember we had some battles here, and most \npeople think we don't do anything. But where are we today? We are \n17,000-plus in the stock market today.\n  I can tell my colleagues that Alaskans saw this because every year--I \nknow I hear from other Members who ask me this question all the time--\nwe get a permanent fund check. It is based on investments we make, and \nit is based on revenues we receive from oil and gas. That permanent \nfund check doubled this year from $800 to over $1,900. Why did it \ndouble? Because it is based on the stock market average of the last 5 \nyears. We dropped off 2009, so the market was doing better. Every \nAlaskan felt what this economy has done. So when the naysayers are out \nthere speaking, it is just not accurate.\n  GM and Ford and Chrysler have added over half a million good-paying \njobs. Unemployment is at 5.8 percent--almost a 50-percent drop. Over 10 \nmillion new jobs and the longest stretch of private sector growth on \nrecord--56 months. Just last week--I know we always hear it is not good \nenough. Of course, but it is a heck of a lot better.\n  I remember the chaos on this floor during those 3 or 4 months and as \na new Member what we had to go through.\n  The deficit has dropped by $1 trillion a year. We are down to about \n$480 billion now. We have sliced off $1 trillion a year from the \ndeficit.\n  In Alaska we have seen some incredible things. Anchorage unemployment \nis at 4.9 percent. There are more jobs in mining and timber than ever \nbefore. Tourism has risen to nearly 1 million visitors. There are \n78,000 people in the fishery industry.\n  It is important to remember that this is just a moment in time of \nchallenges we have as a body and as a country. It is important to \nremember that there is a lot of work ahead of us. But we have \naccomplished a lot. But we spend a lot of time on this floor debating \nwhat is bad about this country.\n  A lot of us are coming to the floor and giving our farewell speeches \nand talking about good things. There are a lot of good things we should \nbe proud of as a country. I am proud of what we have done over the last \n6 years. This country is back on track. We have more work to do to make \nsure people's incomes rise, but that is starting to happen now.\n\n  The challenge for my colleagues who are still here and for this \ncountry is--it has been an incredible honor to be in this body, but \nwhat do we do to make sure we move forward so we don't have this as a \nplatform of negative attitudes and views but about opportunity and \npossibilities; not about things that we sit here and try to figure out \nhow to kill but what we try to do to improve and give new ideas a \nchance.\n  I said it earlier: I am a very optimistic person. I believe what is \npossible today can be even better tomorrow. But it is incumbent on \npeople to believe it, to want to do it, to put aside their differences \nwhere we can. I will tell my colleagues, that is why fewer Alaskans are \nparty registered and more are nonparty registered in our State than in \nmost States--because our view is that we don't care about the party; \nwhat we care about is getting things done. We are trying to find the \nanswer to yes rather than trying to find the way to no.\n  My staff has always, and it is a struggle sometimes--and I have a \ngreat staff, as I said earlier, some from Alaska, some from here, and \nsome from across the country, people who I don't understand why they \ncontinue to subject themselves to working for me after the mayor's \noffice, and then they came here. I always told them that what mattered \nwas not who sponsored the bill but whether it is a good idea. If it is \na good idea, then let's move forward, try to find an answer, try to \nsolve the problem.\n  The positive attitude we have to have is not only important for this \nbody, but it is important for this country. In a weird way, they love \nus and they hate us. The poll numbers show they don't love us too \nmuch--13 percent. But on the flip side, they look to us. They look to \nus for certainty and guidance and where we might take them. The pundits \nare different, but the people look to us. I see it when I go to stores, \nwhen I am out and about. People may be angry with us, but they want to \nknow what we are going to do to solve these incredible problems, and it \nwill be incumbent upon the next Congress to sit down and work together. \nIt is going to be tough because the politics of the day are about the \nmoment in time, not about the long term. This is an incredible \nchallenge that has to be dealt with in some way.\n  I have spent a lot of time trying to, as I said, do what I can; it \ndidn't matter whose idea it was. I listened to Senator Coburn speak. I \nremember one\n\n[[Page S6598]]\n\nday we were working on an issue--essential air service. Some of us have \nthat in our States. Senator Coburn was against it. I remember having a \nconversation with him and trying to explain that between one airport \nand the next is 1,200 miles. There is no road. There is no way to get \nto it. At the end of the day we were able to resolve that issue and \nmove forward.\n  I think of all the things that have been accomplished in this body \nbut how little people know about it. In an odd way, over these last few \ndays more of the positive issues are out there. I hope the press covers \nthem. We will see. But we live in a world where it is better to talk \nabout the negative because that seems to be what thrives. I hope that \nchanges.\n  Let me end by sharing a couple of other quick thoughts. There are a \nlot of great stories about being here in the Senate. Someone asked me \none day: Do you write these down? And I said no.\n  I remember I was in Sitka, AK, and I was headed to the airport. I got \nto the airport, and the attendant there was checking my ticket, and he \nsaid: Oh, wait, Mr. Begich. We have something for you.\n  It was a wrapped gift at the airport.\n  I said: Great.\n  Now, people who care about the TSA, please ignore what I am about to \nsay. They just handed it to me. I took it. I opened it, and it was one \nof those empty books that say: Please write down your thoughts and your \nnotes. They are incredible thoughts.\n  I remember I was coming through--people will remember when it snowed \nlike crazy. Well, people from DC thought it snowed like crazy. I did \nnot. I knew one thing, and that is about how the plows work, being a \nformer mayor. I thought to myself, I can't leave my car on the street \nbecause they will plow me in, especially in this place, or they will \nattempt to. So I and my son Jacob--we got our snow shovels, did our \nshoveling, and then drove the car to another area. Then I realized--we \nwere dressed in what I call Alaska good garb. And then I realized that \nI had to get back to the house because I had this snow shovel and he \nhad a snow shovel. It was on the other side of the Capitol. So what did \nwe do? People who know me know I don't really follow all the rules \naround this place. We started walking through the Capitol with our snow \nshovels over our shoulders. The place was empty. I realized what an \nincredible place this is. First, we were allowed to walk through with \nsnow shovels. It was dead silent. If my colleagues have never done \nthat, they should. You walk through the Capitol and you just see the \nhistory, and in a small way, we were a part of it.\n  I did break another rule. This is confession time. I am a Catholic, I \ncan do that. We came into this Chamber. I had the corner desk over \nhere. Why did I pick that desk? A lot of people don't know this story. \nWhy did I do that? One, I was a junior Member, but No. 2, I wanted that \ndesk because that is where the candy box was, and I knew every Member \nwould have to go there sooner or later, and I thought I could spend \nsome time talking to them. And maybe I would have a candy box, which I \ndid. I had special candies from my wife's store.\n  One day I came in here late at night with my son, and we sat right \nthere. I know the security guards probably didn't see us. We took a \nphoto. Yes, I broke the rules. I took a photo of my son sitting there, \nand I will cherish that photo forever.\n  As my son once said--and I said it on this floor one time--about how \nimportant it is to get things done and the battle we were having--I \nremember I actually quoted my son on the floor, and I think I shocked \nsomebody. I was talking to him about something, and he said: Dad, just \nsuck it up. I thought, only from a young kid do you hear what you have \nto do sometimes.\n  Now, I didn't forget her; I just wanted to wait until the end. I know \nI am breaking the rules, but my wife is right up there. I am pointing \nto her. Yes, I am, Sergeant at Arms. Too bad. I am acknowledging her. \nShe has been incredible. She has allowed me to do my public service, to \nfly those 20 hours every weekend to and from Alaska. She has taken care \nof Jacob when I couldn't. I love her dearly. Thank you.\n  To end, I will just say this: It has been a true honor to serve in \nthe U.S. Senate, to serve the people of Alaska, and to know every day \nwe--me, my staff, and my colleagues who work with me--contributed a \nlittle bit to making life better for Alaska, for Alaskans, and for this \ncountry. There is no experience like serving in this body and doing \nwhat I could to make a difference.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Walsh). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I know a number of my colleagues are going \nto want to talk about our friend Mark Begich. When we came to the \nSenate--I see a number of folks here--we came in 2008. I see a lot of \nother Members who are newer Members as well. I think when you come in \nwith a class, you get kind of confused about what is going on and you \nform a bond.\n  I remember my first--our first--Senator Franken wasn't here yet, but \nSenator Merkley, Senator Hagan, Senator Bennet, and a number of others. \nAnd we were in Senator Durbin's office. There was still a question \nabout what was going to happen in the election because there were \nthousands of votes out. So being giddy new Members, we got on the phone \nto call Senator Begich to say we wish him well and we are counting on \nhim. He said: Hey, Jacob and I are leaving on vacation because I \nalready know where the votes are coming from. I am going to be there.\n  He knew his State that well.\n  As someone who is a former chief executive and as some others here \nwho are former chief executives, I remember him coming here, and many \nof us new Members were kind of scratching our heads about the notion of \nhow this institution would work or didn't work sometimes. But, as \nSenator Begich mentioned and as Senator Murray mentioned at our dinner \nthe other night, there are a lot of people in this body who are chronic \noptimists. I am blessed to have an optimist in my colleague Senator \nKaine. I don't always fit in that category. But Senator Begich, week in \nand week out, would always try to remind us that it is not quite as \nbleak as it might seem at the moment, that there was good news and \nthere was progress being made.\n  I think, looking back, I am not sure some of us fully realized, \nparticularly that first year and a half or two when so many things \nhappened--controversial things and things that are still being \nrelitigated in many ways but that have allowed this country to make \nprogress, and Senator Begich was an incredibly important part of that.\n  He was also, as one of the newer Members, liaison to management. So \nwhenever anything didn't happen right with leadership, it was always \nthe fault of Senator Begich.\n  But I just want to say--and I know Senator Hagan was here a little \nbit earlier--I fear at times that our elections are almost becoming \nlike parliamentary elections in the other countries where people are \nvoting for or against a leader not based upon what a leader has done \nindividually--such as Senator Landrieu and all the things she has done \nfor Louisiana, Lord knows--but, as Senator Begich just mentioned, there \nwas not a bill or an issue where he didn't find an Alaska connection \nand where he didn't make a difference for the people of his great \nState.\n  So I know I am just the first of many who want to say to my \ncolleague, to my friend, to a great Senator, Godspeed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I was a part of that class. I was a \nlittle late getting here, my colleagues will recall. But I was part of \nthat class and campaigned with the class, and I remember being with \nMark Udall and Tom Udall and Mark Begich at a campaign event, and they \nkind of looked at me and said: So your dad wasn't like a public \nservant.\n  I said: No.\n  And they said: Well, that is unusual.\n  No, no, that is fine.\n  What a lot of people don't know about Mark is his father died very \nfamously in a plane crash.\n  Mark is the only Member of this body, I believe, who did not graduate \nfrom college, did not go to college.\n  There are a lot of things about Mark--and Mark Warner just referred \nto it--he was a chief executive.\n\n[[Page S6599]]\n\n  We need more mayors here. Sometimes we say we need more diversity. \nSometimes we say we need more women. God knows we need more satirists--\nbut mayors, wow. Having that mayor's perspective--Cory Booker looking a \nlittle smug--is very useful.\n  Mike Enzi, a mayor--am I forgetting a mayor?\n  Mr. BEGICH. Tim Kaine, Richmond.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Bob Corker.\n  Whom are you pointing at? Tim, were you a mayor?\n  Mr. KAINE. Richmond.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Oh, Richmond, you just kept saying Richmond. I don't \nknow anybody named ``Richmond.''\n  Mr. WARNER. He was also a lieutenant governor.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. So he was a lieutenant governor too--OK. So he is the \nmost qualified.\n  This is what it is like when we are together. Being a Senator, a lot \nof people ask: Is being a Senator as much fun as working on ``Saturday \nNight Live?'' The answer of course is no. It is not close, but it is \nthe best job I have ever had.\n  It means so much to us what we can do for our State, and no one knows \nmore about his State--and I know Mary Landrieu is sitting here, no one \nknows more than Mary and Mark--and that it is an incredibly long flight \nhe took every weekend to go back to Alaska.\n  Minnesota had a happy warrior, one of the great, great Senators who \nhas ever served this body, Hubert Humphrey. We may have noticed during \nMark's speech he teared up a few times, the most when he was talking \nabout his wife.\n  That is good for you. That works out well.\n  But Hubert Humphrey said: ``A man who has no tears has no heart.''\n  This man has a tremendous heart. Humphrey was a happy warrior, and \nthis guy is a happy warrior--and you brought joy, humor, and optimism \nto this body, and I thank you, my friend, for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I rise to say a word about my dear friend Mark Begich \nand to add some words on behalf of him.\n  We saw, when he presented himself in his final remarks to this body, \nhis compassion, his heart, and his emotions were clear in relation to \nhis family, his son, and to us--because he was truly an amazing friend \nto many. He is always in a good humor, always upbeat.\n  As the Senator from Virginia said, we could never quite understand \nit, but he was--and still is--an amazingly optimistic and positive \nperson.\n  Having served as mayor, as a small business owner, as a passionate \nchampion for Alaska, what he didn't mention--I thought I might because \nit might be too hard for him to remember today--but I want this body to \nremember that Mark comes from a distinguished line of public service.\n  A lot of us say that, but in Mark's case his father literally gave \nhis life to Alaska. His plane went down on October 16, 1972. The plane \nhas never been found.\n  So when Mark walked in the first day I met him, I don't know what I \nwas expecting, but I was expecting someone to have a heavy burden on \nhis shoulders because of that. As the eldest daughter of nine children, \nI take responsibility so much for my brothers and sisters, and I don't \nknow how I could have gotten where I have gotten without both parents \nliterally lifting me up every day.\n  So as I have sat across from Mark all these years in very close \nleadership meetings on Tuesday mornings--and he has walked in with such \noptimism, such extraordinary confidence in himself, in what he is \ndoing, and in encouraging us--I was always just so struck by the fact \nthat he grew up with a large family, six children. His mother was \nwidowed at a young age. He took on so much responsibility, and yet he \ncame to the Senate ready to serve.\n  I know his father is truly honored that he didn't get bitter, he \nwasn't angry. He grew up to be a man who accepted that as God's will, \nwhich is a hard thing to accept.\n  He did so much for the community that his father loved and the State \nthat his father loved. I wanted to add that to the Record because a lot \nof people watching us think we are one-dimensional robots and that \nthere are no other dimensions to our lives and our family.\n  But it always struck me, Mark, that you have been such a man of \ncourage, such a great inspiration to your family, and truly an \ninspiration to all of us.\n  I know your parents are very proud, both of them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I wish to add a word to honor my good friend Senator \nMark Begich. I think there is a special connection with those of us who \nwere elected on the same day.\n  We share something else in common, which is on that election day in \nNovember 2008 neither one of us knew if we had won. We both had to wait \nsome length of time--in my case 2 days and in Senator Begich's case a \ncouple of weeks--but it kind of makes us ponder the future: Are you \ngoing to serve or are you not going to serve and how will you utilize \nthat opportunity.\n  There is another connection that comes from being western Senators. \nWhen we talk about salmon--and Mark Begich mentioned a while ago \n``Frankenfish.'' Well, we are very concerned. We have a collective \nconcern about the health of our salmon runs.\n  It is not just a fishing economy, although that is very much a part \nof the economy of our States, it is about the soul of our States, the \ntraditions of our State, the natural resources of our States.\n  When we talk about timber, we have a connection. Sitka was mentioned. \nSitka spruce is a common tree in our State of Oregon.\n  When we get concerned about the rescues off the Oregon coast because \nthe water is so cold one can't be in it for very long without dying--\nwhich makes it much more important to have advanced helicopters, and \njust last night we were able to keep a key helicopter on the coast due \nto Senator Mark Begich's considerable involvement and advocacy. Thank \nyou so much for doing that.\n  Why is our water so cold off the coast of Oregon? Because it is \ncoming down with the currents from Alaska. In so many ways our States \nare tied together.\n  As I have served this first 6 years, I have turned to my friend from \nAlaska for advice and counsel time after time. His seasoned policy \njudgment and his core political instincts are on a par with any other \nSenator in this Chamber and certainly far in advance of my own.\n  I say to the Senator, I appreciate your friendship. I appreciate you \nsharing your judgment, and I appreciate your buoyant spirit that \nreminds us, when we are discouraged, that so much can be accomplished. \nWhat an honor it is to have a seat in the Chamber of just 100 Senators, \nwhere we can add our voice to a conversation about truly how to make \nthis a better world.\n  Thank you, my friend, for your service. We will miss you greatly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I just want to add my words to what my \nother colleagues have said about someone I am going to miss dearly. \nSenator Mark Begich and I worked together on many things. When I passed \nthe reins from the steering and outreach committee and suggested to our \nleader that he should seriously consider Senator Begich for that \nresponsibility, he made us all proud as part of the leadership in \npresenting a very important perspective every single day.\n  I have frequently referenced an energy committee trip I took to \nAlaska with Senator Begich where--I thought Michigan was big. Michigan \nis big. But we not only had to travel a long way to get to Alaska, once \nwe were in Alaska we had to travel a long way from one end to another.\n  I remember I ran into a number of people from Michigan because in our \nUpper Peninsula we also have a lot of snow, and we have a lot of people \nwho were working there. But everywhere we went--and we traveled to \nNative American villages. We flew to Barrow. We were in every part of \nthe State. Some areas you could only get into by helicopter.\n  We would get there--we went to a Native village that needed a new \npost office. Senator Begich took me out. We had boots on because there \nwas water coming up. We looked at this little,\n\n[[Page S6600]]\n\ntiny post office that was maybe a little bigger than a closet, not \nmuch. We came out. The whole community was there to urge us to support \nthis post office.\n  To see not only the information, the depth that Senator Begich had \nabout that before we got there, but the way he interacted, his \ncommitment to them--everywhere we went he knew about that community, \nthe leaders in the community. He had a relationship with them.\n  This is somebody who loves Alaska. In his bones, in your DNA, Mark, \nis your State. I love seeing that. It was so inspirational to see that. \nI know the Senator has wonderful family support at home. It has been my \npleasure to be at your home for dinner and to watch your son. He is \ngrowing up. I know we have a lot more that we will benefit from, from \nyour leadership. I know you have a lot more to contribute to Alaska, to \nour country.\n  Just know you are leaving with incredible respect from colleagues and \nlove and affection. We wish you every Godspeed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I rise to add my sense of gratitude and \nappreciation to someone who has become a dear friend. I am his newest \ncolleague and have had the privilege of working with him for these past \n13 months. I just want him to know and state very publicly that he was \none of the anchors to me as I was getting to know a very different \nplace from being a mayor of a big city.\n  Your sense of fierce pragmatism was a light to me, coming down into a \nplace known for partisanship and gridlock, and demonstrated to me your \nability to bring people together and get things done, but even more \nthan that, being a model for me, a role model for me in the early stage \nof my career in the Senate.\n  I have to confess, and do it with pride, that I love this country \nwith the depth and the core of my being. My parents taught me that \nsense of pride. But you expanded that, incredibly, by bringing me out \nto Alaska. Of all my experiences in these 13 months, that was one of \nthe highlights. It taught me a lot when I saw that a Senator still had \nsuch a powerful touch and connection and knowledge and love of the \npeople of that State. You have made me love Alaska even more and know \nAlaska in my heart.\n  What was extraordinary to me, in knowing you in your short career, \nwas how much you got accomplished, how steadfast you were in pursuing \nthe interests of your State and this Nation. One thing I have to say, I \nfelt uncomfortable as I saw you--I will never forget being at Bartlett \nHigh School, with the Bears, and seeing your love and connection to \nthose kids. It made me feel very uncomfortable, the negativity that was \nbeing hoisted upon you during a campaign.\n  It made me think of something as I was out there, and I thought about \nit again as you talked of history. There is a very famous poet named \nMaya Angelou, who said these words:\n\n     You may write me down in history\n     With your bitter, twisted lies,\n     You may trod me in the very dirt\n     But still, like dust, I rise.\n\n  The truth is, you are one of those people who are at your ascendency. \nYou have risen above it all. You have risen above the things in \nWashington that try the spirits, not just of those of us here but of \nthe Nation. You have risen to a level of accomplishment in your life \nthat is extraordinary and as awesome as some of the vistas I saw in the \nState of Alaska.\n  The beauty I have right now, the confidence and the joy I have right \nnow, is the simple fact that I know that God ain't finished with you \nyet.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I just want to rise, similar \nto others in our class, and many other Senators have risen, to talk a \nlittle bit about Mark Begich and his service to Alaska and praise him \nfor his service, because I think he has been--since I have been here, \nthe 6 years I have served with him; he was in my class--I have seen a \nremarkable Senator who truly cares about his State and has been an \nincredible advocate for his State.\n  I was not here for his entire speech, but I turned it on. The good \nthing about our offices is you can tune it in. I caught the point where \nhe got a little bit choked up about Deborah and Jacob. I got choked up, \ntoo, in the office. I can cry but not in public. In any event, the \nfirst thing I know about Mark is how much he cares about his family and \nhow much the toll of serving in the Senate takes on that family.\n  His travel--I am a westerner, and I have to travel out 5 hours, 6 \nhours, 8 hours to get home. His flight is always--we heard the \ndescription the other day from Senator Murray. He flies all the way out \nto Seattle at the end of the day. It is 12:30 our time when he arrives \nthere. Then he gets on another flight for another 4\\1/2\\ hours up to \nAnchorage, just to get home. It is not a very long weekend. Then he has \nto get on a flight and come back.\n  His family is so important. I have seen him with his son Jacob. We \nlive just across the alley from each other. I can look out my back \nwindow and look down and see the light--just four houses down--and know \nwhether Mark and Deborah and Jacob are in town. We have spent many good \ntimes in his house there. That is the first thing I would like to say.\n  The second is--I have seen this over and over again with Senators. \nYou are one of the best at it--taking the issues that are involved with \nAlaska and that Alaskans care about and that you knew so well when you \nwere a mayor and fitting them into this vast Federal landscape and \nmaking sure Alaskans are heard. I think you are one of the best at \ndoing that. You stepped out on so many different issues. I remember the \nNative American corporations and how you would reach out in a number of \nareas with Senators throughout the Senate and try to reach some \ncompromise there.\n  I have a large Native American community. We, too, have the same \nkinds of issues on that front that you do. We also share many Native \nAmerican tribes. As the Senator knows well, it was my father and my \nuncle who stood up in the 1960s and 1970s to make sure the Natives got \na fair shake in Alaska. Mark--that is the way he serves when it comes \nto Native Americans, caring about them, caring about their issues, \ngoing up to the North Slope where it is cold.\n  My understanding is that during this campaign he got frostbite on one \noccasion, being out in that terribly tough environment. Thank you for \nthat and for working with me and working with everyone else who tries \nto make sure Native people get justice. They look to Washington for \njustice. They look for justice at the Supreme Court. They are not \ngetting much of it over there at the Supreme Court any more. We are the \nlast refuge. We served together on the Indian Affairs Committee.\n  One final thing to talk about. I have been working on an issue, it is \nthe chemical substances act, for the last couple of years with Senator \nVitter. We have tried to do everything we can to bring people--\nextraordinary piece of legislation--12 Republicans, 12 Democrats on \nthis piece of legislation.\n  We have been working to make it better. We have had Senators start \njoining us on both sides of the aisle. Mark, you were one of the key \npeople to work on that. As Senator Warner said earlier, you were our \nliaison to the leadership. You were in all of those leadership \nmeetings. Whenever I told you there was a problem, you would surface \nit, whether or not it was going to blow up the meeting. You stuck in \nthere when it came to truly caring about issues and caring about \ngetting things done.\n  I think if anything is your hallmark, it is wanting to put aside the \npartisanship and try to get things done. So that is something that you \nshould be tremendously proud of.\n  Just as a final word, I love your State of Alaska. I have climbed \nyour highest mountain. My cousin, Mark Udall, has also done the same \nthing, climbed Mount McKinley, which has now returned to its Native \nname, called Denali. I remember going up to your State as a State \nattorney general. It was the only State in the Nation that put in money \nfor our conference of attorneys general and put us on an 8-hour train \nacross Alaska so we could see all of Alaska.\n  Alaska is a terrific State. You and I have some disagreements on what \nwe\n\n[[Page S6601]]\n\nprotect in Alaska, but the wonderful thing is we understand each \nother's position. We are still very good friends. It has been a real \nhonor to serve with you. I wish you and Deborah and Jacob the very \nbest. Wherever you land--I hope to see you in Alaska again because I \nknow I am going to come up there. But wherever you land, our door will \nalways be open to you.\n  Thank you and God bless you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, we have heard a lot of people honoring \nour wonderful colleague Senator Begich today. We are all going to miss \nhim dearly. We are especially going to miss him in Minnesota. I have \nheard many positive statements about Alaska today, but no one can come \nfrom a State where they can say they have one of the main streets in \nAnchorage named after them; that is, Minnesota Street in Anchorage.\n  That is because there are many Minnesotans. Believe it or not, it was \nnot cold enough in Minnesota so they moved to Alaska. One of those \npeople who moved to Alaska was Mark's dad. Mark's dad actually grew up \nabout 30 miles away from my dad. It is rough-and-tumble country up in \nthe Iron Range of Minnesota. Mark still has relatives in northern \nMinnesota, and particularly he has an uncle named Uncle Joe--Joe \nBegich--who served in the legislature for many years and also is a \nKorean War vet and was truly the heart and soul of the Iron Range \ndelegation in the Minnesota State legislature.\n  For any of our colleagues who think Mark Begich is a character, they \nshould meet his Uncle Joe. I know Uncle Joe. I hope he is watching \nbecause nothing made him happier than the day Mark Begich got elected \nto the Senate. And when Mark once came up there with me and we were \ngreeted by Uncle Joe, it was like a hero's welcome when Mark Begich \nappeared on the Iron Range of Minnesota. People came out, and we did an \nevent with veterans. Then, of course, the problem was we went to a bar, \nand we could get no pictures that didn't have a Budweiser sign on them.\n\n  But Mark is a hero up there, and he is a hero across our State just \nfor the work he has done for rural communities. When I say we have \nrural communities in Minnesota, he always says we have extreme rural \ncommunities in Alaska.\n  He has done work in conservation, which we care about so much. He has \ndone work on tourism. We are cochairs of the tourism caucus, and I \nstill remember the hearing we had right in the middle of the downturn, \nwhere every Senator came to talk about all of the things that were \nhappening in their States with tourism. Mark was actually able to cite \nthe price of cruises you could take in Alaska. It was written up in the \nWashington Post about all the Senators hawking their States, but no one \nwas prouder to hawk Alaska.\n  The other thing about Mark, which I know was mentioned, is he doesn't \nbelieve politics is about standing in the opposite corner of the boxing \nring. He believes politics is about working together in the middle and \ntrying to find common ground.\n  The last thing I will say is how much we love Deborah and Jacob, and \nwe know we will see them around and they are not going to go away.\n  One time Deborah, Jacob, and Mark came over to our house for brunch. \nMy daughter is about 6 years older now. She was about 13. Jacob and my \ndaughter were playing a game in the other room, and the adults were \ntalking over breakfast. I will never forget Jacob Begich. From the \nother room, he heard his dad talking about him and, as any politician's \nkid would do, he said: Stop talking about me, dad. So that kid has \ninherited that Mark Begich sense of fierce independence. When he left, \nmy daughter said: I love that kid, mom. He knows how hard it is to be a \npolitician's kid.\n  So Mark has left here the legacy of Alaska, the legacy of good work, \nthe legacy of a great staff, and the legacy of a great family. So we \nwill see you around, and thank you for your service.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Mark Pryor\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I am honored to stand here and recognize \nmy colleague and friend, Arkansas's senior Senator Mark Pryor, for his \nservice to our State, his contributions to our country, and his work \nacross the aisle.\n  I have worked with Senator Pryor during his entire service in the \nSenate, both as a Member of the House and as a colleague in the Senate. \nWhile we don't always agree on policy, we always agree that we need to \ndo what is best for Arkansas and what is best for our Nation.\n  Mark is always ready to step forward, find a solution, and resolve an \nissue. He is always ready to extend a hand to the other side of the \naisle to get support, and he always has Arkansas on his mind.\n  Over the last 4 years, we have introduced several pieces of \nlegislation together, and you will find our names as cosponsors of \nseveral other pieces of legislation that all have one goal--helping the \npeople of Arkansas and helping the people of our country.\n  There is a longstanding tradition of collaboration in the Arkansas \ndelegation. When I was elected to the House in 2001, long-time Arkansas \nCongressman John Paul Hammerschmidt gave me some advice I have tried to \nlive by since coming to Washington. He said: John, always remember that \nonce the election is over, it is time to put away the political \ndifferences and focus on helping the people of Arkansas. That is how \nthe delegation worked during John Paul's 26 years of congressional \nservice, which included service with Mark's dad, Senator David Pryor, \nand that is how Mark and I operated as well.\n  I appreciate the welcome Mark gave to me and the help his office \noffered to my staff when I moved over here to the Senate in 2011. I \nvalue his friendship, thank him for his service, and appreciate all he \nhas done for the people of Arkansas. I wish him well in the next \nchapter of his life.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request?\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                      Bailout Provision In Omnibus\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, yesterday I came to the floor to call on \nHouse Democrats to withhold their support from the omnibus spending \nbill until one provision is removed. The provision was slipped in at \nthe last minute to benefit Wall Street. In fact, it was written by \nlobbyists for Citicorp. That provision means big money for a few big \nbanks. It would let derivatives traders on Wall Street gamble with \ntaxpayer money--and when it all blows up, require the government to \nbail them out.\n  Just to be clear, I want to read the title of the part of the law \nthat will be repealed if this provision is not stripped out of the \nomnibus. The title is ``Prohibition Against Federal Government Bailouts \nof Swaps Entities.'' That is what is on the table to be taken out of \nthe law.\n  Now, I am here today to ask my Republican colleagues who don't want \nto see another Wall Street bailout to join in our effort to strip this \nWall Street giveaway from the bill. This is not about partisanship. \nThis is about fairness. This is about accountability and \nresponsibility. This is about preventing another financial collapse \nthat could again wipe out millions of jobs and take down our whole \neconomy.\n  If big Wall Street banks want to gamble with their own money, so be \nit. Let them take their risks with their own money, and let them live \nwith the consequences of those risks. That is how markets are supposed \nto work. But they shouldn't get to gamble with government-insured \nmoney, and they shouldn't get to run to the government when the deal \ngoes sour.\n  Opposition to government bailouts of Wall Street is not a liberal or \na conservative issue. The current law, the one about to be repealed, \nwas put in place years ago because after the 2008 financial collapse, \npeople of all political persuasions were disgusted by the\n\n[[Page S6602]]\n\nprospect of ever having to use taxpayer dollars to rescue big banks \nfrom their own bad decisions.\n  This morning, Senators from both parties--Sherrod Brown, a Democrat \nfrom Ohio, and David Vitter, a Republican from Louisiana--called for \nthis provision to be taken out of the spending bill. Here is what they \nsaid:\n\n       If Wall Street banks want to gamble, Congress should force \n     them to pay for their losses, not put taxpayers on the hook \n     for another bailout. Congress should not gamble on a possible \n     government shutdown by attempting to tuck this controversial \n     provision into a spending bill without having been considered \n     by the committees of jurisdiction, where it can be subject to \n     a transparent and rigorous debate.\n\n  Senators Brown and Vitter are exactly right. This provision has no \nplace in a must-pass spending bill.\n  Conservative activists have jumped in as well. They are raising their \nvoices today to say that this provision has no place in a must-pass \nspending bill. Here is what one front-page contributor on the \nconservative blog RedState said this morning:\n\n       I have no way to refute the basic point that Democrats are \n     making about the CRomnibus fight right now. In fact, I might \n     even go so far as to say they are right. . . . what possible \n     good faith reason can Republicans have for threatening to gum \n     up the whole works over doing a favor to Wall Street? . . . \n     generally speaking, if Nancy Pelosi is opposed to something \n     then instinctively I know I should be for it. Beyond that I \n     haven't the slightest clue why the proposed tweak to Dodd-\n     Frank ought to be anything resembling a hill the Republicans \n     should die for.\n\n  These conservative activists are right. If you believe in smaller \ngovernment, how can you support a provision that would expand a \ngovernment insurance program and put taxpayers on the hook for the \nriskiest private activities? If you thought the Ex-Im Bank exposed \ntaxpayers to risk--even though it has never cost the taxpayers a dime--\nhow can you support a provision to prevent another calamity such as the \none that cost taxpayers billions of dollars just 6 years ago?\n  House Republican leaders are moving quickly to try to jam this bill \nthrough today before their own Members have had a chance to digest this \nWall Street bailout provision. The fact sheet that Republican \nappropriators sent around to their Members explaining the provision \ndoesn't even describe it accurately. According to the fact sheet, the \nprovision in question would ``protect farmers and other commodity \nproducers from having to put down excessive collateral to get a loan, \nexpand their businesses, and hedge their production.'' Whatever you \nthink about the bill, that description is flatly wrong. In fact, that \ndescription applies to yet another Wall Street reform rollback that the \nRepublicans are pushing right now, which is attached to a completely \ndifferent bill.\n  Now, I don't know if Republican leaders in the House are deliberately \ntrying to confuse their Members into voting for a government bailout \nprogram or whether they just can't keep straight all their efforts to \ngut financial reform. Republican leaders are about to bring this bill \nup for a vote. So here is the bottom line. A vote for this bill is a \nvote for future taxpayer bailouts of Wall Street. When the next bailout \ncomes, a lot of people will look back to this vote to see who was \nresponsible for putting the government back on the hook to bail out \nWall Street.\n  To Republican leaders in the House, I would ask this. You say you are \nagainst bailouts on Wall Street. I have heard you say it again and \nagain for 5 years. So why in the world are you spending your time and \nyour energy fighting for a provision written by Citigroup lobbyists \nthat would increase the chance of future bailouts? Why, in the last \nminute as you head out the door and a spending bill must be passed, are \nyou making it a priority to do Wall Street's bidding? Whom do you work \nfor--Wall Street or the American people?\n  This fight isn't about conservatives or liberals. It is not about \nDemocrats or Republicans. It is about money, and it is about power \nright here in Washington. This legal change could trigger more taxpayer \nbailouts and could ultimately threaten our entire economy, but it will \nalso make a lot of money for Wall Street banks. According to Americans \nfor Financial Reform, this change will be a huge boon to just a handful \nof our biggest banks: Citigroup, JPMorgan, Bank of America.\n  People are frustrated with Congress. Part of the reason, of course, \nis gridlock. But mostly it is because they see a Congress that works \njust fine for the big guys but won't lift a finger to help them. If big \ncompanies can deploy their armies of lobbyists and lawyers to get \nCongress to vote for special deals that benefit themselves, then we \nwill simply confirm the view of the American people that the system is \nrigged.\n  This is a democracy. The American people sent us here--Republicans, \nDemocrats and Independents. They sent us here to stand up for them, to \nstand up for taxpayers, to protect the economy. Nobody sent us here to \nstand up for Citigroup.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues in the House to withhold their \nsupport from this package until this risky giveaway is removed from the \nlegislation. It is time for all of us to stand up and fight.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

REPORT ON NON-COMPLIANCE BY THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION \n                   OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE INF TREATY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Russian Federation is in violation of its \n     obligations under the Treaty between the United States of \n     America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the \n     Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range \n     Missiles, signed at Washington December 8, 1987, and entered \n     into force June 1, 1988 (commonly referred to as the \n     ``Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty'' or ``INF \n     Treaty'').\n       (2) This behavior poses a threat to the United States, its \n     deployed forces, and its allies.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President should hold the Russian Federation \n     accountable for being in violation of its obligations under \n     the INF Treaty; and\n       (2) the President should demand the Russian Federation \n     completely and verifiably eliminate the military systems that \n     constitute the violation of its obligations under the INF \n     Treaty.\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, and every 90 days thereafter, the \n     President shall submit to the committees specified in \n     subsection (d) a report that includes the following elements:\n       (A) A description of the status of the President's efforts, \n     in cooperation with United States allies, to hold the Russian \n     Federation accountable for being in violation of its \n     obligations under the INF Treaty and obtain the complete and \n     verifiable elimination of its military systems that \n     constitute the violation of its obligations under the INF \n     Treaty.\n       (B) The President's assessment as to whether it remains in \n     the national security interests of the United States to \n     remain a party to the INF Treaty, and other related treaties \n     and agreements, while the Russian Federation is in violation \n     of its obligations under the INF Treaty.\n       (C) Notification of any deployment by the Russian \n     Federation of a ground launched ballistic or cruise missile \n     system with a range of between 500 and 5,500 kilometers.\n       (D) A plan developed by the Secretary of State, in \n     consultation with the Director of National Intelligence and \n     the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), to verify that \n     the Russian Federation has fully and completely dismantled \n     any ground launched cruise missiles or ballistic missiles \n     with a range of between 500 and 5,500 kilometers, including \n     details on facilities that inspectors need access to, people \n     inspectors need to talk with, how often inspectors need the \n     accesses for, and how much the verification regime would \n     cost.\n       (2) Form.--The report required under paragraph (1) shall be \n     submitted in unclassified form but may contain a classified \n     annex.\n       (d) Committees Specified.--The committees specified in this \n     subsection are--\n       (1) the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Committee on \n     Armed Services, and the Select Committee on Intelligence of \n     the Senate; and\n       (2) the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on \n     Armed Services, and the Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, the Banking Committee has \njurisdiction over economic, trade, banking, and financial sanctions. \nDuring the last year, I have worked with my colleagues in Congress to \nauthorize the President to impose tough sanctions targeting President \nPutin and his cronies, and he has enlisted our allies in that effort. \nWe all agree that if Putin continues to intimidate the people of \nUkraine he must face intensifying economic and political isolation.\n  But unlike with the sanctions bill enacted earlier this year, the \nForeign Relations Committee did not consult the Banking Committee on \nthis bill prior to its markup. Even so, my staff has worked \ncooperatively with Foreign Relations staff in recent weeks to fix many \nof the most significant textual problems which would have made its \nimplementation unworkable. Those negotiations have now progressed to a \npoint where I have been satisfied with the changes included in the \nsubstitute amendment. While it is still not perfect and contains some \nprovisions\n\n[[Page S6607]]\n\nwhich in my view are unnecessary, we have made substantial progress.\n  The President has worked to impose punishing sanctions on Russia, \nmaximizing their effect on Russia while minimizing their effect on the \nU.S. and Western allies. I heard personally from Secretary Lew the \nadministration's concern that the mandatory global energy sanctions in \na prior version of this bill could have driven a wedge between the U.S. \nand our allies. They could have ensnared potentially hundreds of our \nallies' businesses--including firms whose governments in Europe and \nelsewhere may otherwise be working with us to isolate Russia. That \nproblem has now been resolved, and the substitute now gives the \nPresident discretion to target firms involved in these activities \nshould he so choose. I am confident he will now be able to implement \nthese measures in a way which is sensitive to the concerns of our \nallies, and which can protect innocent U.S. investors in pension funds, \nmutual funds, and emerging market funds which hold stock in European, \nAsian or other firms subject to potential sanction under the bill.\n  Sanctions should offer the President flexibility to continue to work \nwith allies to maximize pressure on Russia as its economy reels under \nthe stress of sanctions, falling world oil prices, and a falling ruble. \nI support the aid to Ukraine authorized in this bill, and I support \nfurther sanctions on Russia that will not drive a wedge between the \nU.S. and our allies, that will protect innocent U.S. investors, and \nthat can be implemented with minimal confusion or delay. I am glad we \nwere able finally to reach agreement on the bill and appreciate the \ncooperation of my colleagues in this effort.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I further ask unanimous consent that the committee-\nreported amendments be withdrawn; the Menendez-Corker substitute \namendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time; and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the \nbill, as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    Executive Action on Immigration\n\n  Mr. LEE. As we all know, President Obama recently announced Executive \naction on immigration, what he refers to as deferred action, for \nmillions of aliens who are here illegally but who have children who \nwere born in the United States and by virtue of their birth in the \nUnited States are U.S. citizens.\n  Now the President has repeatedly assured the American people that he \nis not creating a pathway to citizenship for those individuals, but \nthat isn't true. He and his administration have cleared the pathway to \ncitizenship for millions of people who have crossed into our borders \nillegally. They know that is what they have done, and it is illegal. \nImmigration law is quite complicated, but here is the bottom line on \nthis issue: If you are the parent of a U.S. citizen, when that child \nreaches the age of 21, assuming you haven't committed certain crimes or \ndone other things that might exclude you from what the law generally \nallows, you can get a green card and eventually you can get \ncitizenship. But there is a catch. If you are in an illegal status \ninside the United States because you crossed into our borders illegally \nand that is how you became an illegal alien--that is, you entered \nwithout inspection, as that term is known in immigration circles--then \nin order to get back on the path to citizenship you are first required \nunder existing law to leave the country and then to come back across \nthe border into the country legally. Because you broke immigration laws \nbefore you came into the country, the law says you have to wait either \n3 years or 10 years to return, depending on how long you were inside \nthe country illegally before you left.\n  When we talk about clearing the path to citizenship for this set of \nimmigrants--that is those who are close relatives of U.S. citizens--\nthat is what we are talking about: getting around the rule that those \nwho cross our border in secret must leave the country, wait a period of \nyears outside the country because they broke our laws, and then return.\n  So when the President says he isn't clearing such a path to \ncitizenship, that is Washington shorthand for, don't worry, I am not \ncircumventing the law.\n  What stands between these people and citizenship is the need to enter \nthe country lawfully, which they cannot do until they leave, wait a \nperiod of time that Congress has set by law, and then and only then \ncome back. The President claims he is not touching this rule, but that \nis exactly what he is doing and exactly what he has done, and he is \ndoing it through a program called advance parole. Advance parole is \nessentially a form of permission for an undocumented immigrant to \ntravel outside the country and then return. When he gets back to the \ncountry and approaches the border, he presents an advance travel \ndocument to border officials and they will parole him into the country.\n  What is more, the President has announced if you leave the country \nunder a grant of advance parole, the administration will treat you as \nthough you never left at all, waiving the 3-year to 10-year wait \nmandated by Congress for people who have come here unlawfully and then \nleft the country.\n  When that is done, as it turns out, the illegal immigrant will become \neligible to take advantage of a different way to become a citizen: \ngetting what is known as adjustment of status. Adjustment of status, \nwhich gives you a green card without having to leave the country, is \navailable to parents of U.S. citizens so long as they crossed our \nborder lawfully, which advanced parole lets them do.\n  So how hard will it be to get advance parole, which leads to a green \ncard, which in turn leads to citizenship? Well, it is supposed to be \nvery hard. Parole is kind of a temporary emergency pass that lets \nsomeone into the country for an extremely urgent reason, even though \nthe law says that an immigrant in that circumstance cannot be admitted \nfor one reason or another.\n  In fact, there is a Federal statute passed by Congress that restricts \nthe power of the executive branch of the Federal Government to use \nparole to a very narrow, very confined set of circumstances. That law, \nINA section 212(d)(5)(a), says that the executive branch may parole \nindividuals into the United States ``only on a case-by-case basis for \nurgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.''\n  That term ``urgent humanitarian reasons'' means conditions such as \ngetting medical treatment or perhaps attending a funeral of a close \nfamily member. ``Significant public benefit'' usually means \ncircumstances such as one being a witness in a crime and as such \nneeding to come into the country to testify at trial.\n  To be clear, it is illegal--illegal--to parole people into the \ncountry who don't meet that standard. But for deferred action \nrecipients, here is the standard the President is using: A person \nwarranting advance parole, which again also eventually leads to \ncitizenship, must file a form I-131 with USCIS. The instructions for \nthis form explain that deferred action recipients can get parole for \n``educational purposes, employment purposes or humanitarian purposes . \n. . ''\n  I continue:\n\n       Educational purposes include but are not limited to \n     semester abroad programs or academic research;\n       Employment purposes include but are not limited to overseas \n     assignments, interviews, conferences, training or meetings \n     with clients. . . .\n\n[[Page S6609]]\n\n  In no universe is a meeting with a client or a conference an urgent \nhumanitarian reason. Nowhere in the universe are those circumstances \nfor a significant benefit to the American public.\n  Imagine this scenario. Imagine that a foreign national approaches our \nborder. The border officials ask the individual for a visa, and he \nsays, oh, I don't have a visa, but I do have a business meeting in \nDenver. Can I come in, even though I don't have a visa? There is no \ndoubt he would be turned away promptly. But for the new deferred action \nrecipients under the President's Executive action plan, so long as you \nhave a business meeting in Toronto or an overseas assignment in Buenos \nAires, you can get permission to leave and be paroled back into the \ncountry immediately upon your return, along with the government's \npromise to ignore the 3-year or 10-year bar that is supposed to keep \nyou out of the country. And once you do that, you can adjust your \nstatus and get a green card and eventually citizenship.\n  How do I know this? Well, in 2010 the American Spectator published a \nleaked Department of Homeland Security memo, a version of which \npurportedly reached the Secretary of Homeland Security--then-Secretary \nJanet Napolitano--exploring the administration's options on \nimmigration. That memo explicitly contemplated using parole as a way to \nsidestep Congress and give citizenship to illegal immigrants who are \nrelatives to U.S. citizens.\n  It says ``individuals could . . . be paroled into the U.S. for \npurposes of applying for adjustment of status to render immediate \nrelatives of U.S. citizens eligible for parole, DHS could issue \nguidance establishing that family reunification constitutes a \nsignificant public benefit.''\n  So let me be clear. Advance parole leads to citizenship for parents \nof U.S. citizens. The administration knows that, and they are giving \nadvance parole for reasons such as client meetings that clearly violate \nFederal law.\n  This is the danger of unilateral Executive action, drafted in secret \nand announced to the American people as a fait accompli. In our system, \npolicies are debated in the legislature and their consequences need to \nbe explored through debate. Here, the President's action has avoided \nthat constitutional lawmaking process, but it has also broken existing \nlaws passed by Congress.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                    Serving as President Pro Tempore\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I have been in the Senate just a few \nweeks shy of 40 years. For the past 2 years I have had the distinct \nhonor of serving this Chamber as the President pro tempore. Just four \nSenators from Vermont have held this title. I am the first in more than \na century.\n  It has been among my greatest privileges to represent Vermont in the \nU.S. Senate, something I dreamed about as a child, and it has been day \nafter day after day a privilege to represent my very special State of \nVermont in this body.\n  It has also been an honor and privilege to serve as the President pro \ntempore in this institution, the U.S. Senate. This is an institution \nfor which I will always have the greatest respect and affection.\n  When I assumed the position of President pro tempore, something I had \nnot realized would happen, Marcelle and I welcomed into our family over \ntime nearly 20 invaluable members of the U.S. Capitol Police. As \nPresident pro tempore and third in the line of succession, the office \ncomes with a security detail. It is not something I had asked for. In \nfact, I said, well, I don't really need that, and they said: You don't \nget any choice in the matter.\n  I got to know them well. I had a background in law enforcement before \nI came to the Senate, but I have never served with such professionals \nas those who comprise this team. They sacrifice time at home. They \nsacrifice time with their families and weekends and holidays. I could \nnot be more grateful for their dedication to public service and for \ntheir professionalism and good nature. They are an example of what the \nbest in law enforcement should be.\n  The U.S. Capitol should be very proud of our U.S. Capitol Police and \nespecially of those who are in this unique dignitary protection \ndivision. Those who serve on such details are trained to blend into the \nbackground. You might forget they are there, but they are, and they \nmiss nothing. When I try to give them credit for the work they do, they \nsay: Well, that is just our job. It is a lot more than their job. It is \ntrue professionalism and it is something that makes everybody in law \nenforcement and should make everybody in the U.S. Senate proud.\n  I want to recognize their commitment and acknowledge their service. \nThe members of this detail include Sergeant David Ribb, Thomas Andriko, \nHenry Smith, Shane Powell, Eric Boggs, Robert Schultz, Antonio \nCarofano, Amy McDaniel, John Jastrzebski, Ryan Rayball, Ryan Andrews, \nJay Schmid, Austin Reinshuttle, Sean Keating, Anthony Ravenel, Gideon \nMaran, John Brito, Luis Pimentel, Jose Ramirez, Jr., Robert Leh, James \nMelenson, Edward Wojciechowski, and Marc DesJames, who recently \nretired.\n  Next year when Congress reconvenes, we will elect a new President pro \ntempore, my friend Senator Orrin Hatch. I will continue as dean of the \nSenate, and a future President pro tempore emeritus. I wish Orrin Hatch \nthe best, and I know he is going to be in safe hands with the dedicated \nmembers of the President pro tempore's security detail.\n  Again, having served in law enforcement, having considered that a \nvery significant part of my career, I have never seen more professional \npolice officers than these men and women. Every one of us as Senators \nshould be glad they are there.\n  Madam President, on another matter, after 9 months of hearings and \nbriefings, many long days and nights of negotiations, this past weekend \nthe Appropriations Committee completed work on the fiscal year 2015 \nConsolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act.\n  Earlier this year many of us came to the floor and praised Chairwoman \nMikulski for her heroic efforts to pass the fiscal year 2014 omnibus. \nWhile many in Washington thought that feat could not be repeated 2 \nyears in a row, as the most senior Member of the Appropriations \nCommittee I knew she would prove them wrong, and she did. Chairwoman \nMikulski rallied her 12 subcommittees and reached across the aisle to \nnegotiate this omnibus and avoid another shutdown. Without her, this \nwould not have been possible.\n\n  Similar to Chairwoman Mikulski, my friend Senator Shelby from \nAlabama, the committee's vice chairman, also deserves a great deal of \npraise for the role he played. Without Senator Shelby's recognition of \nthe importance of passing appropriations bills rather than continuing \nto fund the government on autopilot, we would not have reached this \npoint.\n  As chairman of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and \nRelated Programs Subcommittee, I also wish to thank the ranking member, \nLindsey Graham, chairwoman Kay Granger, and ranking member Nita Lowey \nin the other body. They were always able partners, whose wealth of \nexperience--I will emphasize that--wealth of experience is invaluable \nto the subcommittee's work, and it is reflected throughout the final \nagreement.\n  I look forward to working with the incoming subcommittee chairman \nLindsey Graham next year to continue to fund the diplomacy and foreign \naid programs that are essential to protecting U.S. interests around the \nworld in a manner that reflects American values.\n  The State, Foreign Operations portion of this omnibus was negotiated \nwith the full participation of representatives of both parties in both \nHouses of Congress as a balanced, bipartisan bill. Every word was \ndiscussed and agreed to by Republicans and Democrats, and our \nrespective subcommittee bills have been publicly available since they \nwere reported out of committee in June.\n  My Democratic clerk of the subcommittee, Tim Rieser, made sure \neverybody in both parties were kept apprised of everything we did. I \nwant to thank him, Janet Stormes and Alex Carnes of the Democratic \nstaff, as well as Paul Grove, the Republican clerk, and Adam Yezerski \nof the Republican staff. They all played an essential role.\n  Others who were indispensable and deserve our thanks are Valerie \nHutton, Celina Inman, Elmer Barnes, and\n\n[[Page S6610]]\n\nPenny Myles of the editorial and printing office, who worked long hours \nto produce draft after draft of the bill. They do an outstanding job.\n  Division J of this omnibus for the Department of State and Foreign \nOperations provides a total of $51.8 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority to protect U.S. security, humanitarian, and economic \ninterests around the world.\n  Anybody who doubts that these funds are important should think about \nthe devastation being wrought by ISIL in Syria and Iraq and its impact \non neighboring Lebanon and Jordan, in addition to what is happening in \nthe Central African Republic, South Sudan, and other areas where \nhundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by ethnic and \ntribal violence. Part of this funding will support aid for refugees and \nother victims of disasters, and we provide $1.5 billion above the \nbudget request. The bill also includes additional funds to help Ukraine \nand other former Soviet republics counter Russian aggression.\n  It provides $2.5 billion in emergency funding to respond to the Ebola \nepidemic, which reminds us all that a deadly virus is often only one \nairplane trip away from our shores.\n  The bill includes full funding for diplomatic security, which \nunfortunately we need today.\n  As far as U.N. peacekeeping, the bill provides funding and \nauthorities to fully meet our commitments.\n  It includes an increase above the budget request for PEPFAR and other \nglobal health programs, which I was very pleased about considering that \nthose increases did not require cuts to other critical programs.\n  The bill includes additional funding for educational and cultural \nexchanges. It provides funding to address the gang violence and poverty \nthat contribute to the migration of unaccompanied children from Central \nAmerica. That problem ebbs and flows but cannot be ignored. We have \nseen the flood of young children across our southern border, risking \ntheir lives rather than staying and being attacked and raped in their \nown country, or forced into gangs and made to shoot and kill and rob.\n  I am very pleased we were able to include the amounts requested for \nprograms to protect biodiversity and tropical forests, support clean \nenergy and reduce global warming, combat wildlife poaching and \ntrafficking. These are important national security issues.\n  I am also pleased that provisions relating to our commitments to the \ninternational financial institutions, particularly relating to \nevaluations, beneficial ownership, human rights, industrial-scale \nlogging, and financing for large dams, were included. I look forward to \ndiscussing them with the Treasury Department, State, and USAID.\n  The provisions relating to a Small Grants Program to provide small, \nmulti-year USAID grants to small entities, timely feedback from \nbeneficiaries of humanitarian assistance, and reforms to provide \nincentives for Foreign Service Officers to support sustainable, \nlocally-driven development, are also important.\n  There is a lot more in this bill to support friends and allies so \nthey can combat disease, hunger, poverty, strengthen the rule of law, \nand protect human rights. These are all programs that are directly \nlinked to our national security. They fulfill our moral obligation as \nAmericans, as members of the wealthiest, most powerful Nation on Earth.\n  There are some things that I wish were not included, particularly a \nHouse provision carried from last year that would weaken limits on \ncarbon emissions from projects financed by the Export-Import Bank and \nOverseas Private Investment Corporation. Our European partners are \nwisely ending public subsidies for coal in favor of cleaner, healthier, \nrenewable energy, but the House continues to block such progress here.\n  I am very disappointed the Senate provision to bring the United \nStates into compliance with the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations \nwas rejected again this year by the House. The Bush administration \nspoke of the necessity of this, as has the Obama administration.\n  Mr. President, no bill is perfect, and this one is no exception. But \nthe State, Foreign Operations portion of the omnibus is a whole lot \nbetter than a continuing resolution that ignores the changing global \nrealities and challenges we face.\n  It was a collaborative effort from beginning to end with Republicans \nand Democrats alike, and it should be supported overwhelmingly.\n  I see my friend, the distinguished senior Senator from Texas on the \nfloor seeking recognition, so I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. It is good to see the senior Senator from Vermont back \nand in good health. I know he has been struggling a little bit with \nthis crazy weather we are having, and we are glad to see him back.\n  On November 5, 2009, a radical jihadist, by the name of Nidal Hasan, \nwho happened to also be a major in the U.S. Army, opened fire at Fort \nHood, TX, claiming the lives of 12 U.S. soldiers, one civilian, one \nunborn child, and wounded more than 30 other people. It was a shocking \ntragedy and event.\n  Shortly after the attack, it became clear that Hasan was motivated by \nthe same poisonous ideology that spurred the attacks on September 11, \n2001; in other words, this was an act of domestic terrorism. Yet due to \nthe narrow and outdated definition of ``international terrorism,'' the \nFort Hood victims have not been awarded the same medals and recognition \nas other military victims of terrorism.\n  Furthermore, the Obama administration took the position of claiming \nthat the 2009 Fort Hood victims were not eligible for Purple Hearts \nbecause this was workplace violence--believe it or not. They further \nsaid they didn't think Hasan was acting under the explicit direction of \na foreign terrorist group, so they were not qualified for these Purple \nHearts and this recognition.\n  When our men and women in uniform come under hostile fire from a \nterrorist, they and their families should receive the full honors and \nfull recognition and benefits that accompany such courageous service. \nThat is why I have authored legislation in the Senate making these \nvictims of the November 2009 attack at Fort Hood eligible to receive \nthe Purple Heart or the civilian equivalent.\n  Last week I was pleased that the House of Representatives passed the \nDefense authorization bill, which includes the legislation I authored \nawarding Purple Hearts to victims of this terrorist attack.\n  I wish to thank my good friends Congressmen Williams and Carter for \ntheir steadfast dedication to seeing this to conclusion and to \nfruition.\n  While long overdue, this is welcome news to the wounded, the families \nof the fallen, and the entire Fort Hood community, because even after 5 \nyears, the wounds from this horrific attack are still there, especially \nfor the families of people such as Michael Cahill, a civilian \nphysician's assistant and retired soldier, and Army CPT John Gaffaney, \nboth of whom charged the shooter and sacrificed their lives to save \nothers around them.\n  The close-knit community at Fort Hood has endured great loss in \nrecent years, and I am pleased we are now just one step closer to \ndelivering this important piece of justice to the victims and their \nfamilies. It is my hope that once the Defense authorization bill clears \nthis Chamber, that the President will act quickly in signing this \nlegislation into law because any further delay is a continuing \ninjustice to all of the victims from that day and indeed all of the \ngood people at Fort Hood.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                         Farewell To The Senate\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Madam President, it is with great honor and gratitude \nthat I rise to reflect on the last 6 years, which have been some of the \nmost rewarding and transformative of my life, and to thank the people \nwho have been by my side as we worked to make our great State and this \ngreat country even better.\n  First and foremost, I wish to thank the people of North Carolina for \nallowing me to serve them in the Senate. Six years ago you sent me to \nWashington to fight for the priorities that make our State great, and I \nhave put North Carolina first every single day. I have\n\n[[Page S6611]]\n\nbeen honored to stand up for our teachers, our students, to fight for \nour seniors, to help create a business climate that promotes job \ngrowth, to build an economy that works for everyone, and to make sure \nwe keep our promises to our servicemembers and to our veterans.\n  I am extremely proud of what we have been able to accomplish, and I \nam forever humbled and grateful for the opportunity to serve.\n  I also wish to thank my family; my husband Chip, who is my rock, and \nmy three children, Jeanette, Tilden, and Carrie, and my two great sons-\nin-law, Will and Martin.\n  These past 6 years have been extremely full of exciting milestones \nfor the Hagan family. Since my term began, my two daughters have both \ngotten married and they both had babies. I have a 1-year-old grandson \nHarrison and a 1-week-old granddaughter Christine. So when I said \nearlier that these past 6 years have been transformative, I wasn't \nkidding.\n  I also wish to thank my dad Joe Ruthven, who is one of my most \ntrusted advisers and a constant source of inspiration for me, as is his \nwife Judy, my stepmom, for all of her love and support.\n  I wish to thank the Capitol Police here in Washington. I don't think \nwe recognize these people enough for the incredible work they do to \nkeep us safe.\n  And, of course, I wish to thank my unbelievably hard-working staff \nwhom I consider to be a part of the official Hagan family. These folks \nare topnotch. Their commitment to our State and the people we serve is \nunmatched. They are passionate and compassionate, and I am so grateful \nto have had them by my side over these last 6 years.

My staff knew how important it was to me that my office \nbe as open and as accessible as possible to the people of North \nCarolina, and my team worked every single day to help us reach that \ngoal. Over the last 6 years, we held a townhall in every 100 counties \nacross North Carolina. In DC, we have held a Carolina Coffee every \nWednesday and we welcomed thousands of North Carolinians to come visit \nus. We have also resolved more than 36,000 constituent cases for the \npeople of North Carolina, from helping veterans access their benefits \nwith the VA to helping families struggling with high mortgage rates to \nbe able to stay in their homes, to helping small businesses cut through \nthe bureaucratic redtape.\n  While my North Carolina staff was there for the folks in our State \nday in and day out, my DC team was helping me fight for North \nCarolinians in Washington.\n  North Carolina is proud to be the most military-friendly State in the \nNation. As a member of a military family, it is important to me to work \nevery single day to keep our State the most military-friendly State. My \nhusband is a Vietnam veteran. My dad and my brother served in the Navy. \nMy father-in-law was a major general in the Marine Corps. I have two \nnephews on active duty. One is an F-15 fighter pilot and the other one \nis a Navy Seal. So when I say one of my top priorities was ensuring \nFederal policies worked for our veterans in active-duty military, they \nare not just words, it is truly a personal obligation.\n  That is why nearly 6 years ago, when Jerry Ensminger, a retired \nmarine, shared with me the story of his daughter Janey, my heart broke \nfor him. Janey died of leukemia at the age of 9 because of contaminated \nwater on the base at Camp Lejeune. He dedicated his life to seeking \njustice for his daughter and other Camp Lejeune victims. I found it \nabsolutely unconscionable that the Federal Government had denied this \nman, who served our country, the answers he needed after all he had \nbeen through. I wanted to do whatever I could to help, and it was one \nof the greatest honors of my life to work alongside my North Carolina \ncolleague Senator Burr to pass the Janey Ensminger Act, to help Jerry \nand the servicemembers and families affected by water contamination at \nCamp Lejeune and to give them the answers and the health care they \ndeserved.\n  It was also important to me that all Americans remembered and \nunderstood the sacrifices made by our military and their families. \nDuring my time in the Senate, I had the opportunity to speak on this \nvery floor about some of the brave servicemembers from North Carolina, \nmany of whom made the ultimate sacrifice, and many of whom lost their \nlives while trying to make the world a better place and safer for the \nrest of us. I had the opportunity to speak with many of their families \nand their stories were both moving and heartbreaking.\n  I spoke with Terry Marquez, whose son Justin died from small-arms \nfire wounds he received while on foot patrol in the Wardak Province in \nAfghanistan just 1 month after he arrived in theater. He was only 25 \nyears old when he died.\n  According to Justin's mom Terry, as Justin grew up in the Army, he \nwas like a fine wine, he just kept getting better with age. He believed \nin protecting others. He believed in making the world a better place. \nHe believed in standing up so that others might not have to. Justin \nembodied the selflessness and courage that defines the men and women of \nour armed services.\n  Shortly after sharing Justin's story on the Senate floor, I invited \nhis mother to be my guest at the State of the Union Address. Her \npresence reminded not just me but so many of the Senators that she met \nthat night--and she knew them all--how important it is that we uphold \nour promises to the men and women who put their lives on the line for \neach and every one of us. It has been an honor to help be one of those \nvoices for our servicemembers, veterans, and their families in \nWashington.\n  As one of 20 women in the Senate, I have also enjoyed being a voice \nfor women and children. As women Senators, we bring a unique \nperspective to the policymaking dialog. We understand the issues facing \nwomen and families because we have been there. Some of us are moms and \nsome are grandmoms. We know what it is like to balance that family \ncheckbook and simultaneously run the business and a carpool, and to \nwant the best possible future not only for our children but for all the \nchildren throughout the United States.\n  More important than that, the women of the Senate know how to bridge \nthe partisan divide to get the job done. Together we passed the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act, the first bill I cosponsored as a U.S. Senator. \nWe kept student loan rates from doubling. We pushed for initiatives \nsuch as my newborn screening bill to ensure that every child has a \nhealthy start in life. I am proud of the work we have done together to \nsupport our families and to\n\n[[Page S6612]]\n\nset this country on a path to a brighter future.\n  But the fact is we need a lot more of that in Washington. If we are \ngoing to address the biggest challenges facing our country, we have to \nbreak through the political gridlock and confront these issues \ntogether--head on, united; not as Republicans and Democrats, but \nworking together on behalf of the American people. We need to work \ntogether to tackle the rising cost of college that is putting higher \neducation out of reach for too many students and then burdening them \nwith unsustainable debt. We need to reform our education system to \nensure that every child has the tools and the technology we have to \nhave today and that we have to understand and be an expert in that \ntechnology in order to be successful in this competitive environment.\n  The economy is improving, but wages are stagnant. We must find ways \nto ensure that Americans working full time are not living in poverty.\n  We need to help middle-class families get ahead and ensure that \nworking women are receiving the support they need, whether it is fair \npay, affordable childcare, or time to care for new babies or seriously \nill family members. There is so much work to be done. It is my hope \nthese issues can be addressed in the 114th Congress, but doing so is \ngoing to take cooperation from all 100 Members of this body.\n  The men and women I have worked with during my time are some of the \nmost dedicated, passionate people I have ever met. And there are so \nmany, I am only going to name a few.\n  Barbara Mikulski was my first mentor, the dean of the women. She \nwaltzed me down the aisle to get sworn in. She is one of the greatest \nadvocates for women and for families. And I know that Patty Murray, the \nmom in tennis shoes, is a dynamite negotiator. Mark Warner, one of my \n2008 classmates, is a leader in seeking bipartisan solutions. Susan \nCollins is a great friend and a proven consensus builder. Chuck Schumer \nis a trusted adviser who embodies what it means to be a fighter.\n  There are so many to name, and I love them all. But I know the \nMembers of the Senate can make progress on these issues that matter so \nlong as we put politics aside and work together.\n  One of my guiding principles is ``to whom much is given, much is \nexpected.'' Six years ago, North Carolinians gave me an opportunity to \nbe a voice in Washington, and I have put North Carolinians first every \nsingle day. I urge my colleagues to do the same--to remember who they \nare fighting for, not who they are fighting against, to see past the \ndeed, to see past the d or the r, to work together in a bipartisan \nfashion as I have tried to do to move this country forward.\n  Working with all of my colleagues and serving North Carolina in the \nU.S. Senate is a huge honor.\n  God bless you all, and God bless the U.S. Senate. Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                          Tribute to Kay Hagan\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, first let me commend my colleague from \nNorth Carolina, Kay Hagan, who has been an extraordinary asset in the \nU.S. Senate. She has shown political bravery to the highest degree over \nand over again, taking what she knew were the right votes even when \nthey were politically tough votes. I just listened to her farewell \naddress and I couldn't agree with her more, that she put the people of \nNorth Carolina ahead of everything else in terms of her service in the \nU.S. Senate. It has been an honor to serve with her, to get to know her \nhusband Chip and her family, and I wish her only the best for whatever \nher future undertakings may be.\n\n\n                     Death in Custody Reporting Act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, on Tuesday I was pleased to chair an \nimportant hearing in the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, \nCivil Rights and Human Rights that took a look at the state of civil \nrights in America today.\n  We heard compelling testimony from our colleagues, including Senator \nCory Booker of New Jersey, Congressman Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, and \nCongressman Keith Ellison of Minnesota. We also heard from civil rights \nleaders Wade Henderson and Laura Murphy, and from Dr. Cedric Alexander \nof the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives.\n  It was a powerful hearing. We talked about Michael Brown of Ferguson \nMissouri, Eric Garner of Staten Island, and the growing sentiment \nacross our Nation that the criminal justice system needs to be \nimproved.\n  In particular, we talked about challenges that our Nation faces when \nit comes to restoring the trust of the minority communities in our \ngovernment. Every witness, every Senator at the hearing agreed. We need \nto do more--not just wring our hands but to hold hands together and \nfind solutions.\n  One issue we discussed at the hearing was the need for law \nenforcement to be more transparent. We discussed important \nlegislation--called the Death in Custody Reporting Act--that would mark \na significant step forward when it comes to transparency. The Death in \nCustody Reporting Act would take the simple step of requiring States \nand Federal law enforcement agencies to report to the Department of \nJustice basic statistical information regarding deaths that occur in \nlaw enforcement custody. This would include information about the name \nof the deceased, when the death occurred, how it occurred, and which \nagency was involved. It would apply when a person is being arrested or \ndetained by local, State, or Federal law enforcement and when a person \nis incarcerated. The bill also directs the Attorney General to study \nthis information and provide recommendations on how these deaths can be \nreduced.\n  It seems like such a simple matter to require accurate information to \nbe collected. In fact, Congress used to require that information, but \nit expired in 2006. As a result, we have not had accurate national \nstatistics regarding deaths in incarceration and custody.\n  Last week the Wall Street Journal reported that it surveyed police \ndepartments about deaths that occurred in police custody between 2007 \nand 2012 and found that more than 550 deaths occurred during that time \nand were not included in national statistics.\n  As we engage in a national conversation about reforming police \ntactics, we need accurate data in order to make the right reforms. At \nour hearing, our witnesses from the civil rights and law enforcement \ncommunity agreed it was time to start gathering this information.\n  I am pleased that last night at the end of the session, the Senate \npassed the Death in Custody Reporting Act by unanimous consent. It is \nan important step forward toward transparency, accountability, and \nrestoring confidence.\n  Let me give credit where it is due. For years this legislation has \nbeen championed by my friend Congressman Bobby Scott of Virginia. I \ncommend him for his dedicated efforts. I also commend my colleague \nSenator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, who has strongly advocated \nfor this bill in the Senate, including in our hearing on Tuesday.\n  Let me also give thanks to Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, and House Judiciary Committee ranking member John \nConyers for their support of this legislation.\n  This is not a partisan bill. It passed the House last year by a voice \nvote. Now it has cleared the Senate and is on its way to the President. \nThe passage of this legislation shows that we can work together across \nthe aisle and make progress. Make no mistake--we have a lot of work to \ndo to improve the state of civil rights in America. There are many more \nsteps we must take to restore the confidence of all Americans in our \ncriminal justice system. The passage of this legislation by Congress is \nan important step in the right direction.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Tributes to Mark Udall\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I wish to take a moment today to speak \nabout my friend Mark Udall, who is\n\n[[Page S6613]]\n\nsoon going to be finishing his term. Mark's sister Doty describes him \nas an OK politician but an extraordinary public servant. I think it is \nfair to say that Mark could never reduce his role as a representative \nof the people of Colorado to just politics. It is not in his DNA.\n  It is with a very heavy heart that I see him leave the Senate, \nbecause he is my friend. But it is especially sad at a time when Mark's \nkind of leadership and constructive engagement is exactly what this \nplace needs.\n  ``Udall'' is a name that is synonymous with the West, and Mark and \nthe collective service of the Udall family have come to represent the \nvery best of our western way of life. They have embodied that \npioneering and entrepreneurial spirit dating back to the days when \nAmericans were building entirely new lives on the frontier. They have a \nhistoric love for the beauty and majesty of the West. They have spent \nlifetimes protecting it.\n  Mo and Stu Udall, Mark's uncle and father, both served our country \nduring World War II. Stu was elected to serve the Second District of \nArizona. When President Kennedy asked Stu to serve as the Secretary of \nInterior, Mo won Stu's seat in Congress.\n  Unlike his son Mark, Mo never ran for the Senate. He explained why. \nHe said:\n\n       I told the Arizona Press Club with [Barry] Goldwater \n     present that there were three reasons I was not running for \n     the Senate: 1. I love the House. 2. My wife and family are \n     against it. And 3, I have taken a poll and you are going to \n     beat the hell out of me.\n\n  Although, he did run for President. The New Republic reported on \nthat:\n\n       The Arizona Congressman, Morris Udall liked to tell a story \n     about a response he got at a barber shop in Maine: He looked \n     in at the door and, meaning to introduce himself, said ``Mo \n     Udall, running for president.'' ``Yeah,'' the barber said, \n     ``we were just laughing about it this morning.''\n\n  It is not hard to know where Mark acquired his self-deprecating \napproach to the world, just as it not hard to know where he inherited \nhis commitment to civil rights, to conservation, and to good \ngovernment.\n  Mark has said it was during this time that his political views were \nformed. He himself went on to seek office.\n  In 2008, when Mark was elected to represent Colorado in the Senate, \nhis cousin Tom--Stu's son--was elected to serve the State of New Mexico \nand is one of our colleagues today.\n  Mark Udall's connection to the West and to public service comes from \nboth sides of his family. Mo Udall, a man of many talents, met Patricia \nEmory, Mark's mother, while playing baseball in Colorado. Patricia or \n``Sam'' Udall was a sharpshooter, pilot, Peace Corps volunteer at the \nage of 56. She was a native Coloradan and the person Mark credits most \nfor his passion for the outdoors, for backpacking and climbing.\n  Today in the 21st century we face a profound set of challenges and a \ndramatic test of our democratic institution. Can what Mark Udall often \ncalls this glorious experiment in self-government continue to thrive \ninto the next century and beyond?\n  Mark has carried the tradition of his family by serving as a moral \nforward-pointing compass. Throughout his career he has defended \npersonal freedom and liberty, and he has built a legacy of conservation \nand preservation. As a member of the Colorado General Assembly \nrepresenting Longmont and parts of Boulder County, Mark toughened the \nlaws against poaching big game as trophy animals. As a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives, he worked across the aisle to establish the \nRocky Flats Wildlife Refuge, cleaning up the former nuclear site and \npreserving 4,000 acres of wild land near Denver. He established the \nJames Peak Wilderness Area, protecting 14,000 acres of some of our most \nscenic land in Gilpin and Grand Counties. He passed the Rocky Mountain \nNational Park Wilderness Act to designate nearly 250,000 acres within \nthe park as wilderness, including Longs Peak, which is actually a 14er \nthat I have climbed. Mark Udall has climbed all of them in Colorado, \nevery single 14er we have, because they are included in the tallest 100 \nmountains that we have, each one of which has been summited by Mark \nUdall. These are lands that will be protected long after any of our \npolitical careers are over and long after they remember who it was who \nprotected those lands to begin with. But if anybody cares to check, \nthey are going to know that it was Mark Udall.\n  Mark has been vocal, active, and effective in his fight against \nclimate change and in his promotion of renewable energy. He was the \nstatewide cochair of the successful 2004 campaign to pass Colorado's \namendment 37. This measure required Colorado's power companies to \ngenerate most of their electricity from renewable sources. Colorado was \nthe first State in the Union to take the issue to the voters. Amendment \n37 passed. Mark Udall was the driving force behind that effort. After \nhis victory in the State, Mark took this issue to the House of \nRepresentatives. The House has twice passed the national renewable \nelectricity standard championed by Mark.\n  During his time in the Senate, he has continued to push for a \nnational policy, and his doggedness in standing up for Colorado's wind \nenergy production saved thousands of good-paying jobs across the State \nand ensured that we will continue to lead the Nation in developing our \nclean energy economy.\n\n  The same is true for our ski areas, which have expanded recreation \nactivities and summertime job opportunities thanks to a law Mark passed \nin this Senate.\n  Colorado's aerospace industry is thriving in part thanks to Mark \nUdall. His work on space policy also dates back to his time in the \nHouse of Representatives as ranking member on the Space Subcommittee. \nMark helped revitalize aeronautics and aviation research and \ndevelopment at NASA and ensure that the Hubble space telescope received \nservice and funding.\n  In the Senate, Mark helped lead the Colorado delegation opposition to \na proposal that would have canceled the Orion Program, costing the \nState 1,000 jobs. The administration backed off. Last week, with a \nshuttle and rocket--both built by companies based in Colorado--NASA \nlaunched a successful test flight of the Orion vehicle. We will again \ncarry astronauts into space, traveling deeper than ever before and \neventually maybe even visit Mars.\n  As everybody in this Chamber knows, Mark has been a staunch defender \nof the rights and freedoms we cherish as westerners. As a member of the \nSenate Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, Mark fought every \nsingle day he was here to protect the security of the American people \nand the Bill of Rights. He has taken on NSA and CIA when they violated \nour constitutional values.\n  In 2011 he worked on a classified level to pressure intelligence \nofficials to dismantle a massive email collection program that affected \nAmerican privacy. Administration officials were unable to provide \nevidence that the program was effective. It was shut down. It only \nbecame public information when the New York Times reported on it in \nJuly of 2013.\n  Well before Edward Snowden made headlines in 2013, Mark warned of the \nNSA's overreach. In 2012, on this Senate floor, he warned the American \npeople that they would be shocked to learn about what the NSA was doing \nin secret. He introduced landmark, bipartisan surveillance reform \nlegislation with Senators Ron Wyden, Richard Blumenthal, and Rand Paul. \nIt became the basis for the USA FREEDOM Act, which received 58 votes \njust a few weeks ago. There was a time, before the relentless use of \nthe filibuster, when a majority of votes in the Senate would have been \nenough to ensure passage of that bill.\n  Earlier this week the Intelligence Committee released the executive \nsummary of the Senate Intelligence Committee's study of the CIA's \ndetention and interrogation program. Nobody in this place fought harder \nthan Mark Udall to shed light on these tactics. His goal from day one \nhas been holding the CIA accountable, shedding light on this dark \nchapter of our history, and ensuring that the neither the CIA nor any \nother agency or future administration would make the grievous mistakes \nthat were made here. He accomplished his goals with respect to the \nprocess without leaking classified information but by applying pressure \nboth politically and privately until the report was finally released. \nHe has been effective because he has stood on consistent principle on \nevery issue we have faced.\n  He voted against the PATRIOT Act. He opposed the war in Iraq. He \nhelped\n\n[[Page S6614]]\n\nlead the fight to end don't ask, don't tell.\n  Mark truly is the very best of what it means to be a public servant: \nindependent, responsible, tough, focused on the future, and possessing \nan abiding can-do spirit. His calm presence, his unassuming nature, and \nhis ability to see pure good in those around him are exactly what we so \ndesperately need in our process today.\n  Simply put, Mark Udall has fought for Colorado families in the most \nconstructive way possible--by pushing thoughtful commonsense \nsolutions--but has never ever fought to achieve a partisan political \nfleece.\n  When Colorado was struck with a series of natural disasters, from \nwildfires to floods, Mark was at his very best, standing up for our \nState and our families to lead the efforts to ensure that our \ncommunities had the support they needed to recover and better prepare \nfor the threats we faced next. He has strengthened the way we respond \nto the growing threat of wildfire by emphasizing preservation efforts \nthat will save lives, property, and tax dollars. We would expect \nnothing else from a man who has dedicated himself and his career to \nstanding up for Colorado families, the middle class, and the values of \nthe American West.\n  As a Senator, a Representative, a State legislator, director of the \nColorado Outward Bound school, Mark has been a model public servant. He \nhas lived up to and exceeded the high standards his family has set for \nmore than a century. Throughout all of his work, Mark has always fought \nagainst the dysfunction that persists in Washington.\n  It is true, however, that Mark cannot take full credit for the work. \nHis wife and partner Maggie Fox shares his commitment to leaving more \nopportunity for the next generation. She has worked as a teacher and \ncommunity organizer on the Navajo and Hopi reservations of Arizona, New \nMexico, and for the Colorado, North Carolina, and Northwest Outward \nBound schools. She has become a leading voice in many efforts to \nprotect our land, our air, and our water. Their partnership is a \ngenuine one. It has made Mark's work possible.\n  Mark's staff has been among the finest, most professional, and most \neffective in the Senate. It has been a pleasure for me and for my staff \nto work alongside them on behalf of the people of Colorado.\n  Over the past few years I have learned that really there are two \nbroad categories of people in Washington: There are those who embrace \nand add to the dysfunction because it serves their ideological \nconvictions or gives them an opportunity to star on the cable news or \nboth. Then there are the people who are actually trying to save the \nplace. They are looking for areas of compromise to break the gridlock \nand to move us forward.\n  Mark is one of the good ones, and I have no doubt he will continue to \nmake profound contributions to Colorado and to our Nation in a variety \nof ways, but we are diminished by his loss. Every one of us, for the \nsake of this institution, would do well to live up to the example Mark \nUdall has set.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I thank Senator Grassley \nfor allowing me this time to talk about my cousin, Mark Udall. First, \nlet me say to Senator Bennet, I know that Mark feels he could not have \nhad a better partner, a better friend, and someone to work with on \nColorado issues and the great national issues than Senator Bennet.\n  Senator Bennet spoke eloquently of Mark's incredible record in public \nservice. Two years in the Colorado legislature, 10 years in the House \nof Representatives, and 6 years here in the U.S. Senate. I served with \nMark in the House, and here in the Senate. He is not only my cousin. He \nis not only an extraordinary public servant. He has been a great ally, \nas we have worked on the issues together.\n  Mark has been--and will continue to be--a champion, for the \nenvironment, for civil liberties, and for a government that is as open \nand good as the people we are privileged to represent.\n  Mark has been a courageous and outspoken leader in the fight against \nclimate change. He knows that global warming is not just a threat to \nour environment, but to our national security and our economy. He and I \nhave worked on this issue throughout our time in public service, \npushing to expand clean energy production and for common sense steps to \nreduce pollution. He and I introduced, and got passed, a renewable \nelectricity standard when we were both in the House to increase the use \nof renewable energy and create jobs across the country. When the Senate \npasses a similar RES, which I believe it eventually will, Mark you will \nshare in that victory, for all your determination and hard work to make \nit happen.\n  Our dads loved the land. They taught us to love it as well. Mark \ndoesn't just climb mountains. He protects them, so that generations to \ncome will enjoy this legacy of natural treasures. Together we have \nfought for full funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and \nfor wilderness preservation. He has accomplished so much that will live \non, long after we all are gone.\n  Mark has also been a true leader on the Senate Intelligence Committee \nand the Armed Services Committee. He is absolutely fearless, and \nundaunted, in defense of our Nation, and in defense of our liberties. \nWe both opposed the original Patriot Act, as well as its re-\nauthorization. Mark has been eloquent and tenacious in warning of over-\nreaching surveillance, and secret interrogations. The Intelligence \nCommittee released its study of the C.I.A.'s secret program this week. \nNo one fought harder to hold our government to account, in insisting \nthat we must not only be secure, but we must honor the values that \ndefine us. We can and must do both. History will remember his \ninvaluable role in making it possible for the American people to have \nthis great and necessary debate.\n  Madam President, my dad once said that, in the end, it is not the \nawards you receive, it is not the trophies in the garage, or the honors \non the shelf, it is what the people who know you best really think of \nyou. To those of us who know Mark--in our family, here in Washington, \nand in his beloved State of Colorado--he is the real deal.\n  I remember when Mark's dad, Mo, ran for President in 1976. Mo lost \nthe nomination to Jimmy Carter. In his concession speech, he recalled \nthe words of Will Rogers, ``Live your life so that whenever you lose, \nyou are ahead.'' Mo went on to say:\n\n       And I am ahead. I'm ahead in staff people who love me and \n     believed in me. And I'm ahead because I have love, respect \n     and admiration for all of you in this room.\n\n  That was true of Mo. It is equally true of Mark. In his years of \npublic service, and in the years to come, that will always be said of \nMark. Whatever the task, whatever the challenge, he meets it head on. \nIn the Congress, and in his day to day life, he is practical, \nindependent, and always generous of himself.\n  Mark, wherever you go, wherever you are, win or lose, you are ahead--\nand we all are ahead whenever you are in the room. Or I might say \nwhenever you are on the trail, or the mountainside. We find you out on \nthe trail as likely as anywhere else.\n  But, then, that has always been the case with Mark, and with all our \nfamily. If you are a Udall, you spend a lot of time outdoors, and \ngladly so. And we never know when we will run into each other. A number \nof years ago, I was hiking up a mountain in Argentina. All of a sudden, \nthere on the trail at 16,000 feet, was Mark, coming back from the \nsummit. So, I never know when I'm going to run into him, but Madam \nPresident, let me say, I am always glad when I do.\n  Mark, for me, you have always set an example. You have always been \ntrue to the legacy of our family. I know that will never change, \nwhatever your endeavors. So, to you, and Maggie, and Jed and Tess, Jill \nand I wish you all the best, in this new chapter in your lives.\n  I thank Senator Grassley for allowing me this courtesy. It is always \nwonderful to work with Chuck. He is a first-class Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                            Greenhouse Gases\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I have said before on the Senate floor \nthat the proposed Environmental Protection Agency regulations to limit \ncarbon dioxide are an example among far too many of Executive overreach \nby this administration.\n\n[[Page S6615]]\n\n  Anyone who knows the history of the Clean Air Act--and I was here for \nthe last major revision in 1990--or who has read the text of that law \nknows it was never intended to address greenhouse gases or climate \nchange.\n  The Clean Air Act is designed to address traditional pollutants that \nhave a direct impact on human health and the environment. However, when \nCongress declined to pass legislation supported by President Obama that \nwould have created a cap-and-trade system targeted at greenhouse gases, \nthe President gave a speech saying he would act on his own. In trying \nto regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, which was not \ndesigned for that purpose, the EPA had to fit a square peg in a round \nhole.\n  As a result, when a number of key provisions in the Clean Air Act \ndidn't say what the EPA would like them to say, the EPA simply \nreinterpreted those provisions to say something different or ignored \nthem. In effect, the EPA was unconstitutionally rewriting a law passed \nby the Congress.\n  We all know what article I, section 1 of the U.S. Constitution says: \n``All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress \nof the United States . . . ''\n  Regardless of where you stand on climate change, we ought to be able \nto agree that it is not appropriate for the EPA or, for that matter, \nany administrative agency to twist the law passed by Congress to mean \nsomething other than what it says. This isn't a partisan position, and \nyou don't have to take my word for it. Just listen to what President \nObama's Harvard professor, renowned liberal constitutional scholar \nLawrence Tribe, has written:\n\n       The defects in the Proposed Rule transcend political \n     affiliation and policy positions and cut across partisan \n     lines . . .\n\n  Continuing:\n\n       The central principle at stake is a rule of law--the basic \n     premise that EPA must comply with fundamental statutory and \n     constitutional requirements in carrying out its mission.\n       The Proposed Rule should be withdrawn. It is a remarkable \n     example of executive overreach and an administrative agency's \n     assertion of power beyond its statutory authority.\n       Indeed, the Proposed Rule raises serious constitutional \n     questions.\n\n  In addition to his reputation as one of the country's most prominent \nconstitutional scholars, Professor Tribe is also a long-time Democratic \nParty activist. In fact, he served as a judicial adviser to President \nObama's 2008 Presidential campaign, briefly worked in his \nadministration, and has been a very vocal supporter of the President. \nWhen Professor Tribe says the Obama administration has exceeded its \nauthority, you can take it to the bank.\n  I should also add, in response to concerns that the EPA regulations \nare not a legitimate or appropriate response to climate change, I often \nhear that at least EPA is doing something. Well, aside from the fact \nthat regulatory approach is not legally justified, it is also \nineffective.\n  As Professor Tribe points out on his treatise in this matter:\n\n       The Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for the Proposed Rule \n     states that the impact of ``reduced climate effects'' has \n     been ``monetized'' but not ``quantified.'' In other words, \n     EPA does not claim that the Proposed Rule would affect the \n     climate. The mismatch and lack of social benefit distinguish \n     the Proposed Rule from other actions by EPA under the Clean \n     Air Act.\n\n  This isn't news. President Obama's first EPA Administrator, Lisa \nJackson, confirmed in testimony before a Senate committee that: ``U.S. \naction alone will not impact world CO2 levels.''\n  So these regulations will have no measurable environmental benefit, \nbut will have tremendous costs, particularly for the Midwest, given our \nenergy mix.\n  The EPA rules are all pain and no gain.\n  This is not an argument about environmental policy. I am proud to be \na leading advocate for renewable energy, and I believe there is room \nfor some bipartisan agreement about diversifying our Nation's energy \nsources.\n  However, I want you all to know that I agree with Professor Tribe \nthat regardless of the underlying policy goals, the rule of law must be \nrespected and the proposed rule should be withdrawn. I hope President \nObama will learn from his former Harvard professor and end with the \nPresident of the United States doing the right thing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                        Prewar Iraq Intelligence\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I wish to speak for a few moments about \none of the most significant events in my 36 years as a U.S. Senator, \nthe war in Iraq. I want to speak about important historical records \ncrucial to our understanding of why we went to war against Iraq in \n2003, I want to enter into the public record recent revelations not yet \nmade public, and I make one more public call for a key document to be \nmade fully public.\n  I will begin by renewing a request to the Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, John Brennan. It is a request I have also made to \nhis predecessors: I ask Director Brennan to declassify fully a March \n13, 2003 CIA cable debunking the contention that 9/11 hijacker Mohammad \nAtta had met in Prague with an Iraqi intelligence official named Ahmad \nal-Ani.\n  Earlier this year, Director Brennan wrote to me, refusing, as did his \npredecessors, to fully declassify the CIA cable. But in his letter to \nme he makes public for the first time a few lines from that document. \nWhile this is a significant addition to the public record, and I will \ndiscuss that in a moment, it is still not the full cable, and I am \ncalling on him to declassify and release the full cable.\n  In order to understand why I am making that request, we need to \nreturn to early 2003.\n  On March 6, 2003, just two weeks before U.S. troops would cross the \nIraqi border, President Bush held a prime-time televised press \nconference. In that press conference he mentioned the Sept. 11, 2001, \nterror attacks eight times, often in the same breath as Iraqi dictator \nSaddam Hussein. There was a concerted campaign on the part of the Bush \nadministration to connect Iraq in the public mind with the horror of \nthe Sept. 11 attacks. That campaign succeeded. According to public \npolls in the week before the Iraq war, half or more of Americans \nbelieved Saddam was directly involved in the attacks. One poll taken in \nSeptember 2003, 6 months after we invaded Iraq, found that nearly 70 \npercent of Americans believed it likely that Saddam Hussein was \npersonally involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. Americans who believed in \na link between Iraq and 9/11 overwhelmingly supported the idea of \ninvading Iraq. Of course, connections between Saddam and 9/11 or al \nQaeda were fiction.\n  America's intelligence community was pressed to participate in the \nadministration's media campaign. Just a week after the President's \nprime-time press conference, on March 13, 2003, CIA field staff sent a \ncable to CIA headquarters, responding to a request for information \nabout a report that Mohammad Atta, the leader of the Sept. 11 \nhijackings, had met in 2001 with an Iraqi intelligence official in the \nCzech capital of Prague. In stark terms, this CIA cable from the field \nwarned against U.S. government officials citing the report of the \nalleged Prague meeting.\n  Yet the notion of such a meeting was a centerpiece of the \nadministration's campaign to create an impression in the public mind \nthat Saddam was in league with the al Qaeda terrorists who attacked us \non 9/11. On multiple occasions, including national television \nappearances, Vice President Dick Cheney cited reports of the meeting, \nat one point calling it ``pretty well confirmed.'' Officials from \nDonald Rumsfeld's Pentagon, who set up a sort of rogue intelligence \nanalysis operation, briefed senior officials with a presentation citing \nthe Prague meeting as a ``known contact'' between Iraq and al Qaida.\n  Why am I bringing up a CIA cable from more than a decade ago? Isn't \nthis old, well-covered terrain? No, it isn't. This is about giving the \nAmerican people a full account of the march to war as new information \nbecomes available. It is about trying to hold leaders who misled the \npublic accountable. It is about warning future leaders of this nation \nthat they must not commit our sons and daughters to battle on the basis \nof false statements.\n  There is no more grave decision for a nation to make than the \ndecision to go to war, and there is no more important issue for every \nmember of Congress than the decision to authorize the use of military \nforce--A decision to authorize force is a decision to unleash the\n\n[[Page S6616]]\n\nmight of our Armed Forces, the strongest military on the planet. It \ncommits the men and women of our Armed Forces to fight, and perhaps to \ndie, on the battlefield. The decision to go to war must be careful, \nconsidered, and based on the facts.\n  Such careful consideration was tragically absent in the march to war \nin Iraq.\n  Here is what the Vice President said on December 9, 2001, in an \ninterview on ``Meet the Press'': ``It's been pretty well confirmed that \nhe [Atta] did go to Prague and he did meet with a senior official of \nthe Iraqi intelligence service in Czechoslovakia last April, several \nmonths before the attack.''\n  Far from ``pretty well confirmed,'' there was almost no evidence that \nsuch a meeting took place. Just a single unsubstantiated report, from a \nsingle source, and a mountain of information indicating there was no \nsuch meeting, including the fact that travel and other records \nindicated that Atta was almost certainly in the United States at the \ntime of the purported meeting in Prague.\n  It was highly irresponsible for the Vice President to make that \nclaim. Calling a single, unconfirmed report from a single source \n``pretty well confirmed,'' as he did on Dec. 9, 2001, was a reckless \nstatement to make on such a grave topic as war, in the face of \noverwhelming doubt that such a meeting occurred.\n  Yet Vice President Cheney's reckless statements continued, even as \nevidence mounted that there was no Prague meeting. In September 2002, \nhe said Atta ``did apparently travel to Prague on a number of \noccasions. And on at least one occasion, we have reporting that places \nhim in Prague with a senior Iraqi intelligence official.''\n  The Vice President made those statements in the face of a then-\nclassified June 2002 CIA assessment that said the alleged meeting was \n``not verified,'' called the information about it ``contradictory,'' \nand described assessments of Iraqi cooperation with al Qaida terror \nplots as ``speculative.'' The Vice President made those statements in \nthe face of a July 2002 Defense Intelligence Agency analysis, which \nreported that there was no evidence that Atta was in the Czech Republic \nat the time. He made those statements despite a Defense Intelligence \nAgency memorandum in August 2002 rejecting the claims by a rogue \nintelligence analysis shop at the Pentagon that the meeting was an \nexample of a ``known contact'' between Iraq and al Qaida.\n  That brings us to the March 13, 2003 cable. It is unfortunate that I \ncannot fully lay out the contents of that cable, because much of it \nremains classified. But as the Senate Intelligence Committee's 2006 \n``Phase II'' report indicates, it appears that the cable was sent in \nresponse to a request from headquarters at Langley for comment on the \nclaim that Atta and al-Ani had met in Prague because the White House \nwas considering a reference to a Prague meeting in a speech. At that \ntime, according to then-CIA Director George Tenet's memoir, the CIA had \nbeen given a draft of a speech by Vice President Cheney containing \nassertions about connections between Iraq and al Qaida. Tenet writes in \nhis memoir that he had to object to the President that the speech went \n``way beyond what the intelligence shows. We cannot support the speech \nand it should not be given.''\n  The text of this cable and the information surrounding it was almost \nentirely redacted by the CIA from the Intelligence Committee's 2006 \nPhase II report. A number of us objected to that redaction at the time \nthe report was made public; indeed, the Majority Leader introduced \nlegislation which I cosponsored that would have declassified the cable, \nlegislation Republicans blocked. At the time of the report's release, I \njoined several members of the Intelligence Committee, including Ranking \nMember Rockefeller, Senators Feinstein, Wyden, Bayh, Mikulski and \nFeingold, in concluding that the administration's decision to keep the \ncontents of the cable classified ``represents an improper use of \nclassification authority by the intelligence community to shield the \nWhite House.''\n  In the years since I have sought declassification of the March 2003 \nCIA cable on numerous occasions. Twice, in 2011 and 2012, I wrote to \nthen-CIA Director Petraeus asking him to declassify the cable. Then in \nFebruary 2013, I asked Director Brennan during his confirmation hearing \nwhether he would contact the Czech government to ask if they would \nobject to declassification of the cable, and he responded, \n``Absolutely, Senator, I will.''\n  Despite his commitment, I heard nothing from Director Brennan for \nsome time. Finally, in March of this year, more than a year after his \npublic commitment to me, I received a letter from Director Brennan.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Director Brennan's \nMarch 13, 2014, letter to me be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     The Director,\n\n\n                                  Central Intelligence Agency,\n\n                                    Washingon, DC, March 13, 2014.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: At my confirmation hearing you requested \n     that I pursue declassification of a 2003 communication \n     related to an alleged meeting between Mohammed Atta and an \n     Iraqi intelligence officer, which was referenced in the \n     Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's September 2006 \n     report entitled Postwar Findings about Iraq's WMD Programs \n     and Links to Terrorism and How They Compare with Prewar \n     Assessments.\n       I understand that your principal concern is that the \n     historical record be as complete as possible regarding this \n     period in our history, and on this point we are in agreement. \n     The American people deserve as full an understanding as \n     possible of these historical events, consistent with the \n     national security interests of the United States. \n     Consequently, having worked with our declassification review \n     experts, I can confirm the following information, which \n     describes the substance of what the communication relayed \n     with respect to the meeting at issue, without compromising \n     national security:\n       On 13 March 2003, CIA headquarters received a communication \n     from the field responding to a request that the field look \n     into a single-source intelligence report indicating that \n     Muhammed Atta met with former Iraqi intelligence officer al-\n     Ani in Prague in April 2001. In that communication, the field \n     expressed significant concern regarding the possibility of an \n     official public statement by the United States Government \n     indicating that such a meeting took place. The communication \n     noted that information received after the single-source \n     report raised serious doubts about that report's accuracy.\n       In particular, the field noted that while it remained \n     possible that a meeting between Atta and al-Ani took place, \n     investigative records subsequently placed Atta in the United \n     States just before and just after the date on which the \n     single-source report said the meeting was to have occurred, \n     making it unlikely that Atta was in Prague at the time of the \n     alleged meeting. The field also warned that both FBI and CIA \n     had previously told foreign intelligence officials that they \n     were skeptical that Atta was in Prague. Finally, the field \n     observed that ``identifications'' like the one that was made \n     by the source of the earlier report, during a period of high \n     emotion four months after the September 11 attacks, could be \n     faulty and would require further evidence. The field added \n     that, to its knowledge, ``there is not one USG \n     [counterterrorism] or FBI expert that . . . has said they \n     have evidence or `know' that [Atta] was indeed [in Prague]. \n     In fact, the analysis has been quite the opposite.''\n       I hope this letter answers any outstanding questions about \n     the correspondence in question and addresses our shared \n     interest in creating an accurate and complete historical \n     record.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John O. Brennan.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. The letter contains no indication that he had asked the \nCzech government for its view, as he committed to do. But Director \nBrennan's letter includes, and therefore finally declassifies, this \nvery clear statement from the cable: ``[T]here is not one USG \n[counterterrorism] or FBI expert that . . . has said they have evidence \nor `know' that [Atta] was indeed [in Prague]. In fact, the analysis has \nbeen quite the opposite.''\n  Again, that cable was sent to CIA headquarters on March 13, 2003--a \nweek before our invasion of Iraq. But the Vice President of the United \nStates, Dick Cheney, continued to suggest the meeting may have taken \nplace. He said the following about the meeting on ``Meet the Press'' on \nSeptember 14, 2003--6 months after CIA received that cable: ``We've \nnever been able to develop any more of that yet either in terms of \nconfirming it or discrediting it. We just don't know.'' Here is what he \ntold the Denver Post newspaper on January 9, 2004: ``We've never been \nable to collect any more information on that. That was the one that \npossibly tied the two together to 9/11.'' Here is what he told CNN on \nJune 17, 2004: ``We\n\n[[Page S6617]]\n\nhave never been able to confirm that, nor have we been able to knock it \ndown. We just don't know.''\n  Mr. President, those statements were simply not true. We did know. We \ndid know that there was no evidence that such a meeting had taken \nplace. We did know there was ample evidence it did not take place. We \ndid know that there was, as the CIA cable says, ``not one'' government \nexpert who said there was evidence that Atta met with Iraqi \nintelligence in Prague. The Vice President recklessly disregarded the \ntruth, and he did so in a way calculated to maintain support for the \nadministration's decision to go to war in Iraq.\n  There is a second recent revelation about how the ``Prague meeting'' \nprogressed from unsubstantiated report to justification for war. It \ncomes from Jiri Ruzek, who headed the Czech counterintelligence service \non and after 9/11. Mr. Ruzek published a memoir earlier this year, \nwhich we have had translated from Czech. It recounts the days after the \nterror attack, including how his nation's intelligence services first \nreported a single-source rumor of a Prague meeting between Atta and al-\nAni, how CIA officials under pressure from CIA headquarters in turn \npressured him to substantiate the rumor, and how U.S. officials \npressured the Czech government when Czech intelligence officials failed \nto produce the confirmation that the Bush administration sought.\n  Mr. Ruzek writes:\n\n       It was becoming more and more clear that we had not met \n     expectations and did not provide the `right' intelligence \n     output.\n\n  Mr. Ruzek continues:\n\n       The Americans showed me that anything can be violated, \n     including the rules that they themselves taught us. Without \n     any regard to us, they used our intelligence information for \n     propaganda press leaks. They wanted to mine certainty from \n     unconfirmed suspicion and use it as an excuse for military \n     action. We were supposed to play the role of useful idiot \n     thanks to whose initiative a war would be started.\n\n  That is chilling. We have a senior intelligence official of a \nfriendly nation describing the pressure that he and other Czech \nofficials were under to give the Bush administration material it could \nuse to justify a war.\n  When it came to the most serious decision a government can make--the \ndecision to commit our sons and daughters to battle--the Bush \nadministration was playing games with intelligence. The full, still \nclassified cable includes critically important, relevant information, \nand it has been redacted and denied to the public in order to protect \nthose in the Bush White House who are responsible.\n  The March 13, 2003, cable is an invaluable record in helping the \nAmerican people understand how their elected officials conducted \nthemselves in going to war. Continuing to cloak this document with a \nveil of secrecy, revealing a few sentences at a time, allows those who \nmisled the American people to continue escaping the full verdict of \nhistory. It deprives the American people of a complete understanding of \nhow we came to invade Iraq. In his letter to me, Director Brennan \nwrites, ``I understand that your principal concern is that the \nhistorical record be as complete as possible regarding this period in \nour history, and on this point we are in agreement.'' But Director \nBrennan's apparent refusal to do what he has committed to do--to ask \nthe Czech government if it objects to release of the cable--now takes \non the character of a continuing cover-up.\n  I believe decisionmakers should have to face the full, unadulterated, \nunredacted truth about their decisions. The American people should know \nthe full story, not just so we can understand the decisions in 2002 and \n2003 that took us to war, but as a warning to future leaders against \nthe misuse of intelligence and the abuse of power.\n  Very briefly, what I am doing in this statement, which is now in the \nrecord, is I am asking CIA Director Brennan to fully declassify a March \n13, 2003 cable from CIA field officers to headquarters. This cable \nprovides information about the Bush administration's campaign to build \npublic support for the Iraq invasion.\n  One part of that campaign was the repeated misleading suggestion that \nMohammed Atta, leader of the 9/11 hijackers, had met with an Iraqi \nintelligence official in Prague.\n  I received a letter from Director Brennan making public for the first \ntime some of the cable's contents. He quotes the cable as saying:\n\n       There is not one USG [counterterrorism] or FBI expert that \n     . . . has said they have evidence or ``know'' that [Atta] was \n     indeed [in Prague]. In fact, the analysis has been quite the \n     opposite.\n\n  In my statement just entered into the Record, I also discussed recent \nrevelations by the former head of the Czech intelligence agency about \nU.S. pressure to confirm the report of that meeting.\n  The American people deserve to know the full truth about this episode \nand particularly in light of the new revelations from a top Czech \nofficial.\n  I have renewed my request to Director Brennan to declassify the \nentire cable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                         Farewell to the Senate\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, it is my pleasure to take a few \nminutes on the floor to give a farewell message, and I thank you for \nyour courtesies. I begin with a Scripture, Philippians 4:7, New \nAmerican Standard Bible, that reads: ``And the peace of God, which \nsurpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and your minds in \nChrist Jesus.''\n  Truly for the first time in my adult life I have felt that \nextraordinary peace about something that was unexpected, but is \ncertainly something that I accept. It has really been amazing as a \nChristian, as an adult, and as a leader to find myself in this place in \na time that should be a time of sadness, but all I can feel is actual \njoy. It is quite amazing.\n  It has never happened to me before, so I thought it would be \nwonderful to share--with so many of my friends, supporters, family, \nstaff, and colleagues listening in--for a few minutes to say that it is \nabsolutely true, and I am a testimony to this extraordinary peace since \njust a few days before the election and since then. I think it is \nbecause I feel and know that God has called me to another place.\n  Before being a Senator, a wife, and a daughter, I am a Christian, and \nmy faith really is central to my life. My parents always taught me to \nput my faith where it belongs--in God himself. So it is really with \nthat sense of gratitude and joy that I have been given an opportunity \nto serve my State, my region, and my country for now almost 34 years--\nwhich is quite amazing--having started at a very young age and still \nbeing relatively young.\n\n  So let me just share some remarks about that time, and particularly \nthe time here in the Senate. I want to begin by thanking my family, and \nparticularly my extraordinary husband Frank, who has been a partner \nand, as I said on election night, not only an encouraging and \nsupportive partner but one who has literally egged me on. When I wanted \nto quit, he would say: No, you have to continue to serve. He is not \nonly an accomplished lawyer and professional, but also an elected \nofficial in his own right, he came from a family that was dedicated to \npublic service, having both of his parents being very active in party \npolitics--first the Republican Party and then the Democratic Party. But \nthat is a whole other story. They are both strong civil rights \nleaders--my husband as well--and always encouraging me and being \nwilling to share the burdens of public life as well as sharing in the \ngreat joy.\n  Our son Connor is now 23 years old, and our daughter Mary Shannon is \nnow 17. The reason I mention that is because Connor was 5 when we were \nelected to the Senate. Mary Shannon was adopted the first year we were \nhere. On election night, she looked at me--and she is just so beautiful \nat 17--and she said: Mom, it is going to be a little strange. I have \nonly known you as a Senator. So I warned her that now that I am going \nto be a full-time mom this is going to be a real problem for her. She \nis not looking forward to it.\n  To our new daughter-in-law Emily, and especially to our precious \nlittle Maddox Parker Snellings, who many people saw on election night--\nnow, Maddox gets the distinction. He is 10 months old, but he gives me \nthe most joy, and I used to keep a picture of him during all my \ndebates. There were only three, as you all will remember, but I would \nkeep a picture of him because\n\n[[Page S6618]]\n\nmy staff kept telling me: You have to smile more. I kept saying: But I \ncan't, because I am really aggravated. They said: No, you have to \nsmile. So my solution was to put a picture of Maddox on my podium and, \nof course, I then smiled through the whole debate. That is a trick for \nthose who will be continuing to debate.\n  To my mother and father, who are the light of not only our family but \nthe light of our community, the light of the Nation in many ways--they \nhad 9 children, 37 grandchildren, and now 6 great grandchildren. They \nare in wonderful health, they are watching right now, and I can only \nsay they are two of the most extraordinary individuals I have ever \nknown. Our family is truly blessed by their sacrificial leadership.\n  Let me also mention my eight siblings--eight brothers and sisters: \nMark, Melanie, Michelle, Mitchell, Madeleine, Martin, Melinda, and \nMaurice, Jr.--all m's. That is another story. There are all of our \nspouses, my nieces and nephews, who campaigned with me up until the \nlast day. My godchild Sasha literally knocked on doors with me. I was \nteaching her how to knock on doors before the campaign was over so the \ntradition could carry on in our own neighborhood where we have lived \nsince I was 5 years old--Broadmoor in New Orleans.\n  When I first got here 18 years ago, I literally could not find the \nside door. I didn't know anything. I wasn't even expecting to be here. \nIt was kind of like a dream that I got here, because I had run for \nGovernor, wanted to be the Governor, and served 16 years in my State. I \nknew that was what I was being called to do--and I see Lamar \nAlexander--to change our education system, to do some coastal work, and \nthen I landed here. But I literally knew nothing of how to be a \nSenator.\n  I stumbled a great deal in my first years. But I want to thank my \nchiefs of staff, Norma Jane Sabiston, Ron Faucheux, Jason Matthews, \nJane Campbell, and Don Cravins. I had five of the most remarkable \nchiefs of staff, who, with me, learned how to do this job and to do it \nwell. We never forget where we came from, and they are still--all of \nthem--with me, and all of us are still working to make our State the \nvery best that it can be and to make our country the very best that it \ncan be.\n  To three staffers who have been with me for almost 20 years--Alicia \nWilliams is the longest serving office manager, I think, in the Senate. \nShe was here when I arrived and stayed with me. She was with Bennett \nJohnston. T. Bradley Keith has been with me for 22 years as a former \nstaffer in a former life, before I was a Senator, and now as my long-\ntime State director. And Shannon Langlois has been, I think, with the \nSenate for almost 30 years. She is a caseworker. She was, again, with \nBennett Johnston and stayed with me. She has literally given her life \nto thousands, hundreds of thousands of cases in Louisiana and trained \nevery caseworker that I had for 18 years, and they just did phenomenal \nwork.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record my current \nstaff, all of whom are here--my personal staff, my energy staff, and my \nhomeland security staff.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Personal Staff of Mary Landrieu\n\n       Alexander Damato, Alex Sewell, Alicia Williams, Alyson \n     Azodeh, Andrew Holleman, Ashley Scott, Christina Jones, \n     Christopher Etienne, DerKirra Wilkerson, Don Cravins, Eva \n     Kemp-Melder, Jaren Hill, James ``Wes'' Kungel, Jim Simpson, \n     Katie Lewallen, Lauren Spangler, Leslie Leavoy, Libby \n     Whitbeck, Matthew Lehner, Marianna Knister, Megan Blanco.\n       Rob Sawicki, Ross Nodurft, Will Harris, Whitney Reitz, Zach \n     Butterworth, Zephranie Buetow, Kelsey Teo, Meghann Morin, \n     Shannon Langlois, T.

Madam President, I want to thank Don Cravins, again, as \nmy chief of staff; Liz Craddock, Staff Director of my energy committee; \nand Stephanie Gupta, head of homeland security. I know I am leaving \nthem in good hands with what they are going to be doing in the future \nand with the great leadership that remains here.\n  I only have a few minutes, so I will just run through a couple of the \nhighlights of some of the accomplishments that I am most proud of and \nreally take this opportunity to thank so many who helped, because the \none thing I have learned that most certainly is true, is that if you \nwant to accomplish really big things here--really great things, \ngenerational things--you most certainly cannot do that alone. So the \nfirst thing you need to do is look for a really good partner--and I \nmean a partner that will be with you through thick and thin. Sometimes \nyou are lucky enough to find those kinds of partners, and I found them \non both sides of the aisle.\n  The first major piece of legislation I introduced was something that \nwas in my heart for so long, and that was the Conservation and \nReinvestment Act. The cosponsors of that bill, amazingly, were Frank \nMurkowski from Alaska, Trent Lott from Mississippi, John Breaux from \nLouisiana, and Senator Dianne Feinstein from California. Chris Dodd \njoined me a few days later after we introduced it--and Ron Wyden, Chris \nBond, John Warner, and Thad Cochran, just to name a few.\n  At the end of this effort--although this particular bill didn't pass; \nwe missed it literally by inches, and I will describe what that was in \na minute--we had 4,500 organizations throughout the country, from the \nSierra Club to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and everyone in between in \na broad coalition to fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund--and \nLamar Alexander knows more about this than I could ever know, and he \nwill tell you one day the details about the Land and Water Conservation \nFund. The Udalls and the Udalls' fathers were very instrumental in the \ncreation of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. It was a promise made \nbut never kept--that this country would set aside about $900 million a \nyear to purchase land, to build our parks, and to secure recreational \nopportunities. This country is so blessed--more than any on Earth--with \nthe amount of natural resources we have, and we have not lived up to \nthat promise.\n  So I introduced this bill as a young legislator. John Breaux said you \ndon't even know what you are doing; how are you introducing a bill like \nthis? I said: I don't know, but I am just going for it because I \nbelieve in it. So we never passed it, but it has been in part of almost \nevery piece of energy legislation--in pieces and parts since that day \nwe introduced that. I am very hopeful that war will go on under Senator \nMurkowski, the daughter of Frank Murkowski, and Maria Cantwell, who in \nmany ways got to the Senate because she defeated one of the gentlemen \nwho opposed us on this bill and used it as a platform to get here. So I \nknow she will be committed to finishing the work.\n  The bill did three things. It fully funded the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, a trust fund that will go on for generations. It \nwould fully fund coastal restoration, which is so important not just to \nLouisiana, because we are literally falling away into the Gulf of \nMexico, but it will help Sheldon Whitehouse in his work. It will help \nDick Durbin along the Great Lakes, and it will help Cory Booker in New \nJersey. If you allocate the funding correctly, it will be grants that \nthese coastal communities can use until we figure out how to clean our \natmosphere and how to stop the tremendous pressures that are coming on \nour coast. Louisiana knows this. We have experienced the worst \ndisasters literally in the history of our country, and they are only \ngetting worse. I will talk about that more in a minute.\n  But it was because we had laid the groundwork for CARA, Pete Domenici \nliterally felt so sorry for me--he knew how hard we had worked and the \ncoalition was so disappointed when we\n\n[[Page S6619]]\n\nlost--that he directed, literally with the stroke of a pen, $1 billion \nto the gulf coast in the energy bill for 2005. That money was divided \n50 percent to Louisiana and 50 percent to the other States.\n  Now, I can promise everyone here that for the $500 million that went \nto Louisiana, we can account for every penny of it. We know exactly \nwhere it went, and we put that down as a downpayment to restoring our \ncoast, which doesn't just belong to us--it belongs to the whole Nation. \nThis is the greatest, the seventh largest delta on the planet. It is \nwhat Thomas Jefferson leveraged the whole entire Treasury of the United \nStates to purchase. It is something worth fighting for. We would not be \na country without the Mississippi Delta, and we could never have found \nour way west if we couldn't have supplied the great center of this \nNation with the commerce they needed.\n  Every State along this river--19 of them--use this river and \nunderstand what I am talking about. Amy Klobuchar understands this. She \nis at the top of this river, and I am at the bottom, and we have talked \na lot about how important that corridor is. That needs to continue.\n  Then there was the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, which I \nfinally passed with Pete Domenici's help, who was my dear friend and \none of the most wonderful leaders I have ever worked with. He came from \na family with eight children. We had nine, and we are both Catholic and \ncame from the same sort of background. He served with such passion. So \nhe joined with me in passing the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, \nwhich finally secured a permanent stream of revenue for coastal \nrestoration and protection.\n  But as Lamar Alexander knows, it left out the land and water, and it \nleft out wildlife. We just couldn't lift it all, so that needs to be \ncorrected.\n\n  Finally, there is the RESTORE Act, which I worked on with my \ncolleagues when the BP oil spill killed 11 people in the gulf and \nspilled 5 million barrels of oil in the gulf. Thanks go to Barbara \nBoxer, this extraordinary woman who has been a partner with me. We \nthink very differently about the world. We see things very differently. \nCalifornia is very different from Louisiana. But I will say one thing \nabout Barbara Boxer. If I had to be in a foxhole with someone, I would \nwant to be with her because she never stops fighting. She and I are \nvery much alike in that regard. Once we set our minds to something \nthere is no dividing us.\n  People asked why did I send her money for her reelection? Why did I \nraise so much money from Louisiana? I said that I would do it again \nbecause when no one would stand up--well, not no one, but if she hadn't \nstood up when that BP oil spill went down, and said, I am chair of this \ncommittee and I believe the gulf coast deserves this funding, we just \nwouldn't have had it. It is as simple as that. People do not know how \npowerful a chairman is here. When a chairman makes up their mind and \nthey say this is what we are going to do, the rest of the committee, \nfor the most part, goes along. And so Barbara said that.\n  With Senator Vitter, of course, who is the ranking member on that \ncommittee put his shoulder to the wheel, and we were able to get--well, \nit is still in court, but we think--a serious downpayment to recover \nfrom one of the great ecological disasters of our State, of our \ncountry, which is the loss of the gulf coast. This just isn't in \nLouisiana. This is Texas and Mississippi, and it is going to affect \nparts of the whole country. But we are on the mend.\n  I came here to do that work. I came to find money. I found it, and we \nare going to continue that work. I am thrilled to work with so many of \nyou to get that done.\n  On education--Lamar has to leave, but I am glad he is here because I \nfound a great soulmate in Lamar Alexander--former Secretary of \nEducation, former Governor, a Presidential candidate, and absolutely \nextraordinarily committed to finding a better way for our children in \nAmerica to be educated. As proud as we are of the public school system, \nat the turn of the century, when people in the world were wondering how \nto build the middle class in the world and lots of countries were \nstruggling with how to do that, America knew. America knew that if you \neducated your citizens--women, boys, and girls; not just boys, which is \nwhat half the world still does, which is a tragedy--if we open up our \nschools for universal, free education, along with other things, it \nwould lift your country to greatness unsurpassed in the history of the \nworld.\n\n  What breaks my heart is to walk into schools today--and Mark Warner \nknows this because he was Governor of Virginia--and see children's eyes \njust completely dulled, sitting there completely bored, teachers who \nare just sort of going through the motions. It breaks my heart because \nI know that not only does it limit their lives but it limits the \npotential of our Nation.\n  With Lamar Alexander and a handful of Democrats, I was proud to work \nwith Presidents Bill Clinton and George Bush to pass a series of laws. \nEvan Bayh comes to mind, Joe Lieberman, John Breaux, and a group of us \nstood up and said: It is time to stop sending money to the States \nwithout accountability. If we need to send money, we need to hold \nStates accountable, and we need to give opportunities for choice to \nparents and public charter schools.\n  I am reluctant to go too far on vouchers. You have heard my speech on \nthat. You heard Senator Feinstein's speech on that. But both of us have \nagreed to support some kinds of strategic vouchers that help poor kids \nget out of failing schools until we can fix them.\n  Most importantly, I support high-performing public charter schools, \nand I will continue to fight that for the rest of my days. I thank all \nof you who helped on that and particularly Tom Carper on the Democratic \nside and Lamar Alexander. Cory Booker has been an amazing leader and \nwill hopefully continue on that. I thank Dick Durbin, who is on \nAppropriations. I had to twist his arm a little bit on some of it, but \nhe ended up coming around and has been an amazing fighter for the right \nkinds of public schools that serve the children first and the \nbureaucracy and administration second. I respect teachers. I respect \nadministrators. But our schools should work for the children and their \nfamilies who so desperately want them to have a great education.\n  The third issue I wish to speak about, which is a legacy issue, is \nadoption. I hope I can get through this without tearing up. I don't \nknow why I have always had such passion for this issue.\n  My mother had nine children without one single problem. As a young \nchild, I remember my aunt adopted two children. I think it might have \nbeen that; I can't remember exactly. I started to think about all the \nchildren in the world who don't have parents. Maybe I was just always \nso proud when I filled out those forms in Catholic school. I can \nremember sitting there filling them out: Are your parents divorced or \nmarried? I loved checking ``married.'' How many siblings do you have? I \nloved putting ``eight.'' I was always so proud of my family.\n  I thought, what do children without parents do? I just could not \nimagine. So I got very passionate about it. I ended up, of all things, \nmarrying an orphan. My husband was adopted out of an orphanage. So I \nthought, yes, this is going in the right direction. I thought I would \nadopt children. I thought he could not say no since he himself was \nadopted, and so this would work out. Sure enough, we ended up adopting \ntwo children.\n  But this was my passion before I met my husband and before I even \nthought about adopting. It was as if God put this in my heart, so I \nhave taken it and carried it.\n  I thank Dave Camp; Jim Oberstar, who is deceased; Tom Bliley from \nVirginia, who is a great leader among us; Larry Craig, who is no longer \nhere, who served as my cochair; and Senator Jesse Helms. Amazingly, I \ndidn't know to be afraid of Jesse Helms; I thought he was a really nice \nguy. Later, everybody had to tell me how hard he was to get along with. \nBut I went up to him, and I thought he would surely want to help \nbecause he had adopted a child. I don't think a lot of people realize \nthat. Sure enough he did, and we passed a great treaty together that \nserves as the model for international adoption today. Joe Biden was the \nranking member on the committee. With Jesse Helms's and Joe Biden's \nsupport, we passed a great treaty years ago, and we are still in the \nprocess of making that possible and working it through.\n\n[[Page S6620]]\n\n  The accomplishments are really quite long, so I am going to submit \nthem for the Record. I will only say that the adoption tax credit which \nBob Casey worked on and took up that cause when he got here--I am \nthrilled and hope we can keep it. I would like to say to Amy Klobuchar \nhow much I appreciate her agreeing to step in and take over the \nleadership of the adoption caucus on this side and Roy Blunt, who I \nthink will take it up on the Republican side and continue this great \nwork.\n  There are over 100,000 children who are waiting for families in the \nUnited States. There are over 500,000 children in foster care. These \nchildren think it is their fault they are there, and it is not. It is \nnot their fault that their family disintegrated around them. It is not \ntheir fault that they got pregnant at 11 and were kicked out of their \nhouse. Instead of the family wrapping that child in their arms and \nhelping them to grow, they just kicked them out on the street. It is \nnot their fault.\n  We need to realize that God does not make trash. He never has, and he \nnever will. Everybody he has made has a purpose and dignity, and we \nneed to honor that and do better work. I have spent a lot of time here \non it. I am going to continue to do so. I will never stop working on \nit. I am very proud of the work we have done.\n  I will put the rest into the Record.\n  On energy very quickly and then finally disaster recovery, I couldn't \nhave been prouder when I became the chair of this committee. It was \nquite a miracle. I didn't expect it. I never thought I would last long \nenough to become the chair because there were so many people ahead of \nme. It kind of worked out when Max Baucus left to go to China and Tim \nJohnson was retiring that it fell to me. It has been my great joy for 9 \nmonths to serve as chair, with Lisa Murkowski as my ranking member. Of \ncourse, I worked with her father. I didn't sit next to him because I \nwas a junior member, but I worked with him closely, and it has been \nwonderful working with her. I am so proud that Maria Cantwell will step \nup and take that leadership. I know the two of them work beautifully \ntogether. They do see the world differently, but they are two women who \nknow how to compromise and who will be respectful of each other and \nfind a way for our country to move forward.\n  I can tell you all that in my whole life--which isn't that long, but \nit has been a pretty good run in public office--there has never been a \ntime when America has been closer to energy independence. What that \nmeans to our country is beyond description. We don't have to listen to \nparts of the world that don't hold our values. We can lift up our \ncountry. We can move forward. And it has to be with a combination of \nfossil fuels, weaning our way to a greener, cleaner environment, and \nmanufacturing right here in America.\n  I hope you all will put down the swords and pick up the plow and \nreally plow together because this is an amazing opportunity for our \ncountry. I sure hope we don't miss it. It is going to benefit and make \nthe whole country, not just our part of the country, more prosperous.\n  People desperately want to move up into the middle class and stay \nthere and not feel so fragile and feel as if they can have the \nmanufacturing jobs and good energy jobs and really eliminate some of \nthe geopolitical nightmares we have been in, fighting wars for oil. It \nhas to come to an end.\n  Finally, I will say a word about disaster recovery. When I got to the \nSenate, my husband and I were looking at each other saying: How did we \neven end up here? We had no idea. When Katrina hit, it became very \nclear that this is why I needed to be here.\n  I had been an appropriator since I was 23 years old. I knew a little \nbit about budgets. I knew a little bit about how the system worked. I \nknew how the State and local governments depended on the Federal \nGovernment so much funding. I understood the power of HUD and the power \nof housing and the power of building schools and levees and the Corps \nof Engineers. So I was perfectly positioned to be able to lead the \neffort for my State, and they desperately needed a leader. I wasn't \nperfect. I made lots of mistakes. But I wasn't afraid to try because \nthat is all you can do.\n  The devastation was so great and it was so unbelievable. Eighty \npercent of the east bank of the city and much of Jefferson Parish--not \nquite as bad as New Orleans--and all of St. Bernard--67,000 people in \nSt. Bernard lost everything. Everyone in the Lower Ninth Ward lost \neverything, which is like a small city unto itself. In New Orleans \neast, which is like a small city unto itself, 60,000 people lost every \nschool, every house. It was unbelievable.\n  I say to my colleagues: Thank you for being there for us. I know I \naggravated you to death. I know I never stopped asking. But you were \nthe only hope because there was just no way these communities could \nrecover. New Orleans has been there for 300 years. You have heard me \nsay this: We didn't move down there recently to go sunbathing or to \nbuild condos; we have been down there for 300 years. The city is going \nto stay there. The region is going to stay there. And had this \ngovernment just invested a little bit of the money back that we have \ngiven it over time--from our energy resources, from our manufacturing, \nfrom the wealth we have created along that great mouth of the river--if \nthe country had just given us a little bit of money--$500 million here, \n$500 million there--and built levees that wouldn't have broken in 52 \nplaces, we wouldn't have had $140 billion in damage.\n  So when I came to Robert Byrd because President Bush was not that \nforward-leaning--I will just leave it at that. There will be a lot more \nin my book about it, but I will just leave it at that, not very \nforward-leaning. The person I went to was Robert Byrd. In his old age, \nhe was so wise. He just looked at me. He didn't say much at that time, \nbut he just took my hand and he said: I will be there with you.\n  He was the chair of the Appropriations Committee, so that meant \nsomething. Boy, he was. He helped me write things in a bill that could \nprobably never be possible today. That was when chairmen understood the \npower to help people to heal wounds and to bring hope and to be \ncompassionate. That is what government is there to do. If government is \nnot there when you have lost everything, then what in the heck is the \nuse of having it?\n  So we hope we will be able to repay this country for the investments \nthat have been made, and we will. We will do our best. With all of the \npeople who come to New Orleans and all the conventions that come--and \nwe hope we bring joy and happiness when people come--we hope to pay our \nway and to pay this back over time for what you have done to help us. \nWe are doing a good job of helping ourselves by planning better, doing \nmore smart-growth, sustainable development, building our levees to the \npoint where they won't break again, and we will continue to do that.\n  So those are some of the legacy pieces I have worked on. It is kind \nof amazing that these were the things that were in my heart when I was \na little girl. I didn't learn this when I was a Senator. I can remember \ntaking a bus when I was in the eighth grade down to the coast and \nlooking at LaFourche Parish for the first time, and for a girl from the \npoor part of uptown, I kept looking at the nuns who took me, and I \nsaid: What world is this? I had no idea about Bayou LaFourche.\n  When I got to be a Senator, I remembered LaFourche, the bayou, and I \nremembered how fragile it looked to me even as a child, and I thought, \nif I can do anything to save this place, I will. I have spent a lot of \nmy time saving it, and it is stronger now. It is still not completely \nsafe, but it is much stronger now.\n  I tutored in public school. My passion started when the nuns of \nUrsuline sent me to tutor in a public school, and the little girl whom \nI tutored, who was my age, couldn't read. I can remember going home to \nmy mother and saying: This is the strangest thing. I just met a little \ngirl. She is my age, and she can't read. Mama, is that possible, that \nchildren don't know how to read?\n  I can remember her sitting me down and explaining to me why some \nchildren couldn't read, and I said: That doesn't seem right to me. I \nmade up my mind then that I would work.\n  The reason I say this is because there are a lot of young people \nlistening to this, and I just want you to know, just listen to your \nheart because God puts these things in your heart at very\n\n[[Page S6621]]\n\nyoung ages. If you don't block it out, if you are not cynical and if \nyou hope and live openly, those dreams can come true. Then you can make \na profound difference in rebuilding a school system, which I am \ncontinuing to work on, or make sure every orphan in the world knows \nthat they are loved and that we are going to work hard to find them a \nfamily; to build this great gulf coast, where I spent my life growing \nup as a child and knowing that it is worth saving. It may not be as \nsexy as the west coast or as prosperous as the east coast, but the gulf \ncoast is really worth fighting for. It is a very special place in our \ncountry. I learned to love it as a child, and I will fight for it as an \nadult.\n\n  Finally, let me just say a few thank-yous in closing. A thank-you to \nmy mentor Lindy Boggs, who coached me every step of the way; to my \nmentor John Breaux, who got me into this gig in the first place.\n  I thank Bennett Johnston, who taught me about being a proud member of \nthe Energy Committee; Senator Tom Daschle, who saved my skin more times \nthan I can tell you; Kent Conrad, who taught me about the budget; Chris \nJohn and Jim McCrery and Richard Baker in my delegation, who were \nDemocrats and Republicans--we worked together to do amazing things. I \nalso thank Cedric Richmond, who still works closely with me, and \nCharles Boustany, whom I admire a lot. I thank other Members who are no \nlonger here: Olympia Snowe--we were the first two women to chair a \nmajor committee--well, actually a minor committee, the small business \ncommittee; and Lisa and I were the first to chair and be a ranking \nmember of a major committee. I couldn't have worked with two more \nremarkable women. I thank Senator Joe Lieberman, who was a leader of \nthe DLC and a great mentor of mine on foreign policy issues; Senator \nTed Stevens, who was as grumpy as could be but really did take me under \nhis wing and teach me a lot; Senator Danny Inouye; Senator Robert Byrd. \nAnd I am going to put others into the Record: Senators Mikulski, \nCarper, Heitkamp, Manchin, Cantwell, Begich, Pryor, and Hagan.\n  I want to say a special word to the Black Caucus. I represent 30 \npercent African Americans in my State. You know, all groups of people \nare hard to represent, and my State is so diverse, and I have tried so \nhard to be respectful of all the different groups in my State.\n  I thank the Black Caucus--both the local elected officials and the \nNational Black Caucus--for being such a great partner with me and \nhelping me to understand about compassion, forgiveness, faithfulness, \nand for trust. Their spiritual strength is so amazing. I thank them \nvery much for coming down to help me.\n  I thank labor, who brought me here. They encouraged me to run when I \nwas 23 years old, and I tried to never leave them. Only 8 percent of my \nState is now organized. I have never left them. I think you should \nleave with the people who brought you to the dance, and they most \ncertainly did.\n  I thank Harry Reid, who has been an amazing friend to me and who, \nmost importantly, has been a great friend to my family. He has honored \nus in so many small ways, and I just love him for his tenacity and his \nleadership.\n  I thank you all. I hope I didn't leave anyone out. It has been a joy, \nbut I know God is calling me to a different place. I am not the least \nbit sad and I am not the least bit afraid because it has been a \nremarkable opportunity to serve with all of you, and I thank you very \nmuch.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Walsh). The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Mary Landrieu\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to thank Senator Landrieu for her \ntireless service in the U.S. Senate to our State and to the country. I \nhave had the pleasure of knowing Mary for a long time. She was in her \nsecond year of service in the Senate when I first came to Washington to \nthe U.S. House, but it is far longer than that, probably longer than \nanyone in this Chamber realizes. Both sets of my grandparents live all \nof 3 blocks from where Mary grew up, and I grew up all of 10 blocks \nfrom there. Mary and my brother Jeff were grammar school classmates \nstarting at kindergarten.\n  Of course, here in the Senate I had the honor of working with Mary on \nso many important issues and challenges. From the moment we worked \ntogether on key Louisiana issues, we determined on those issues to put \naside any partisan concerns when those crucial priorities were at \nstake.\n  As she alluded to, the most challenging and trying time in all of \nthat experience was just a few months after I first came to the Senate \nwhen Hurricanes Katrina and Rita struck. Neither of us could have ever \nimagined facing the challenges our State and Mississippi and others \nfaced and facing the challenges we faced in the Senate trying to \nrespond in a robust and full and responsible way. I am sure it was the \nmost trying work for both of us in our careers.\n  Louisiana faced unprecedented disaster and desperation, and that \nbrought us together all the more to work for those crucial Louisiana \nneeds and priorities. We traveled together, of course, to see the \ndamage and meet with our neighbors and local leaders all around the \nState. Her staff and mine worked directly together around-the-clock, \nreally, for months, sometimes in my office, sometimes in hers, always \nwith the same goal of doing everything possible to help our neighbors \nand Louisiana citizens get through that disaster and get through to a \nfull recovery.\n  Those trials, of course, didn't end with Katrina and Rita. There were \nother similar challenges which brought us together and on which Mary \nwas a distinguished leader. She was always a champion for domestic \nenergy production, and Louisiana will enjoy a far fairer share of oil \nand gas revenue under the legislation commonly referred to as Domenici-\nLandrieu.\n  After the infamous BP oilspill in 2010, Mary pushed for the RESTORE \nAct legislation to dedicate revenue from the fines to oilspill recovery \nin the affected areas.\n  As Louisiana fights continually against the loss of coastal wetlands, \nmajor restoration work is moving forward because of Mary's years of \nhard work directly related to that.\n  Due to Mary's strong support of our Nation's military, our fighting \nmen and women are better off. The bases in Louisiana, which are \nimportant to our communities and to the Nation's defense, continue to \nhave what they need for their vital mission. Our veterans face \nchallenges and most recently faced the crying need for new health care \nclinics in Louisiana, and Mary helped make those finally happen, \nfinally move forward, including pushing the case fervently and directly \nto administration officials.\n  In a very personal and dramatic way, Mary is enthusiastic in \npromoting children's welfare and supporting adoption. Her dedication \ninternationally was recognized when Russia banned her travel after her \ndirect and well-founded criticism of Russia's action to curb adoption \nby Americans.\n  In all of this work, one thing is always crystal clear--certainly \ncrystal clear to me--with Senator Landrieu: Louisiana has always been \nfirst in her heart and her top motivation, and she has had a \ndistinguished career of service in the Senate on all of those issues I \nmentioned and many more. All of us in Louisiana gives her our sincere \nthanks for that.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  With Senator Mary Landrieu's permission, I want to do a quick \ninterlude to send a bill over to the House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/11/senate-section/article/S6621-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6621-S6622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CENTRAL OREGON JOBS AND WATER SECURITY ACT\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY.

A bill to protect the Social Security Disability Insurance \nprogram and provide other support for working disabled Americans, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, as a father, grandfather, and doctor, \nthere are few issues that are more important to me than making sure \nSocial Security benefits are protected for both current and future \ngenerations. While both the Social Security Disability Insurance \nprogram and the Social Security Insurance program will be exhausted \nduring my kids' lifetime, the disability program's finances are \nparticularly dire.\n  Since 2005, the disability trust fund has paid out more in benefits \neach year than taxpayers pay back in. Last year alone the shortfall was \n$32 billion. As a result, the trust fund will run out of money by 2016, \nafter which the Social Security Administration, the ``Agency,'' will \nonly be able to pay 81 percent of disability benefits to the 11 million \nAmericans currently dependent on them. This outcome is unacceptable.\n  Faced with the impending insolvency of the disability program, \npoliticians have debated the principal causes of the trust fund's \nrapidly expanding shortfall. Some argue the program does not need \nreform, believing that the increase in the disability rolls is due to \nfactors beyond our control. Citing aging baby-boomers and the rise of \nwomen in the workplace, opponents of reform argue that dramatically \nrising disability spending was and is unavoidable.\n  That is simply wrong. Since 1989, the percentage of working-age \nAmericans receiving disability benefits has more than doubled, while \nthe percentage of Americans reporting a work limitation has remained \nfairly stable. A paper published by the Center for American Progress \nand the Brookings Institution noted that even among middle-aged men, \nthe fraction receiving disability benefits has risen by 45 percent \nsince 1988.\n  A significant driver of the program's increased cost is fraud, waste, \nand abuse. Over the past 4 years, the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs, the ``committee'', and the U.S. \nSenate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, the ``subcommittee'' \nhave conducted several bipartisan investigations into aspects of the \nAgency's disability programs and uncovered significant problems with \nthe program that Congress and the Agency need to correct.\n  In 2012, the subcommittee looked at a random sample of 300 disability \ncases and found that one-quarter of the decisions made by the Agency \nwere not supported by the medical record. Much of this was the result \nof the Agency's poor supervision of its 1,500 Administrative Law Judges \n``ALJs''. This was not just the subcommittee's judgment; the Agency \nagreed. After conducting its own study, SSA similarly found that 23 \npercent of ALJ decisions nationally were not supported by the record.\n  In 2013, the Committee issued a report showing how the disability \nprograms could be gamed by attorneys, doctors, and ALJs. The report \ndetailed how attorney Eric C. Conn, ALJ David\n\n[[Page S6628]]\n\nDaugherty, and several doctors conspired to manufacture fraudulent \nmedical evidence to award benefits. Mr. Conn got rich and also paid a \nfew doctors millions of dollars to sign fraudulent medical evidence, \nwhich Judge Daugherty then used to approve claims without a hearing. \nThe result of their plan was millions in potentially fraudulent \ndisability awards. Mr. Conn became the third highest-paid disability \nattorney in the country, and we found a number of large, unexplained \ncash deposits in Judge Daugherty's bank accounts that were not reported \non his taxes or his public disclosures.\n  Both reports highlighted how the Agency's push to reduce the hearings \nbacklog came with significant costs: the Agency paid little regard to \nthe quality of decisions being made by ALJs, and focused only on \nencouraging ALJs to decide as many cases as possible.\n  The Agency's Office of Inspector General recently issued a report \nestimating that a group of high-approving judges granted at least $2 \nbillion in improper benefits. As a result, the Agency will pay out \nanother $273 million in improper benefits each year.\n  This is only a sample of the work the Committee and Subcommittee have \ndone in the last few years, and it does not crack the surface of the \nexcellent work done by the Agency's Office of Inspector General, \nincluding uncovering huge fraud schemes in New York and Puerto Rico.\n  The program's antiquated, subjective, and ambiguous rules make it \neasier for lawyers, doctors and claimants to game the system.\n  Changes in program criteria used to determine eligibility for \nbenefits has made determinations less objective. Researchers at the \nNational Bureau of Economic Research attributed 53 percent of growth \nfor men and 38 percent of growth for women not to age, workforce \nparticipation, or economic factors, but to weakened eligibility \ncriteria.\n  Since changes by Congress in 1984, the Social Security Administration \nno longer makes benefit decisions based strictly on medical evidence, \nbut instead determines whether vocational factors such as age, \neducation, and skills prevent an individual from working ``any job in \nthe national economy,'' a standard that should be hard to meet. But the \nnumber of applicants approved based on this standard has more than \ndoubled.\n  Eligibility criteria are not the only rules that can be gamed. Most \nrecently, I examined how some claimant representatives systematically \nwithhold medical evidence from the Agency to help their clients win \nbenefits and engage in other misconduct to pad their pockets and clog \nthe disability program.\n  What I found is a program that offers backward incentives for \neveryone from the applicant and representatives to the beneficiaries. \nBecause the program accepts applicants only after they quit their job, \nand provides them with rehabilitation services only after they start \nreceiving benefits, applicants must leave their job and often go years \nbefore they receive services they need. Because beneficiaries will lose \ntheir benefits if they make too much money, there are discouraged from \nworking to their abilities. Because the program rewards representatives \nonly if they win, and awards greater fees the longer the case sits, \nrepresentatives hide bad evidence, delay decisions, and provide poor \nrepresentation to disabled Americans.\n  For most Americans, disability benefits should not continue \nindefinitely for their lifetime. Yet only one-half of 1 percent of \nindividuals on disability rolls leave because they have returned to \nwork and earned over the amount allowable by the Agency.\n  Additionally, scholars believe 23 percent of applicants are on the \nmargin of program entry--that is, whether they are awarded benefits \ndepends on who reviews their case. Accordingly, there is a relatively \nhigh percentage of beneficiaries that can work, but choose not to, \neither because they do not want to lose their benefits, both monetary \nand Medicare, or because they need supports that are not currently \noffered to them.\n  Our Federal laws, including the Americans with Disabilities Act and \ndozens of Federal work programs, are designed to assist disabled \nAmericans in leading integrated, self-sufficient lives. Yet we have \nfailed to target and coordinate the resources they need before they \nhave to leave their jobs. The Social Security Advisory Board, SSAB \nattributes Ticket to Work's low success rate to the fact that \nintervention ``comes too late in the process--after the individual's \nconnection to employment has been severed and frequently after the \nindividual has undergone a lengthy process of proving inability to \nwork.''\n  According to the SSAB, ``focusing all of the return-to-work efforts \ninside the structure of the disability program seems to be too late for \nmany individuals. In order for the intervention to be effective, it \nneeds to occur before the individual comes to SSA, before he applies \nfor SSDI or SSI, and before the attachment to the workforce is lost.'' \nThe SSAB has advocated for comprehensive front-end services, arguing \nthey are ``a real chance to access tailored services that can enhance \nreturn to work efforts.''\n  When the trust fund is exhausted in 2016, many Members of Congress \nwill say we just need to move funds from the Social Security retirement \nprogram\n  Let me be clear: this is not a solution; it is a Band-Aid, a \ntemporary fix that takes money away from seniors and will eventually \nhurt taxpayers when both funds go broke in 2033.\n  I hope there will be a rigorous debate in the next year about how we \ncan better serve disabled Americans with a program that gives them the \nresources they need to work to the extent they are able and protects \nbenefits for those who are forced to rely on them. The disability \nprogram is an important safety net, but it does not serve the disabled \nor the taxpayers to treat it like an early retirement program or long-\nterm unemployment.\n  This is a conversation that will take place after I have left the \nSenate. Accordingly, after 4 years of research, investigations, and \nthoughtful meetings with other interested, engaged parties, today I am \noffering a bill I believe can be used as a blueprint to shore up the \nfund before its exhaustion in 2016, fix systemic problems with the \nprogram, and provide targeted resources for the millions of disabled \nAmericans who want to work to the best of their abilities.\n  The Protecting Social Security Disability Act of 2014 was drafted \nwith three goals in mind: first, to make systemic changes to the \nprogram that preserve it for future generations; second, to ensure \nbenefits are adequate and quickly available for those who need them by \nadding program integrity measures that root out fraud, waste and abuse; \nand third, to provide resources and incentives to those disabled \nAmericans who want to work and have the ability to do so.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the section-by-section \nsummary of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               II. Section-by-Section Summary of the Bill\n\n     Title: To protect the Social Security Disability Insurance \n         program and provide other support for working disabled \n         Americans, and for other purposes.\n     Short Title: Protecting Social Security Disability Act of \n         2014\n\n\n Title I--Ensuring the Long-Term Solvency of the Disability Insurance \n                               Trust Fund\n\n     Sec. 101. Application of actuarial reduction for disabled \n         beneficiaries who attain early retirement age.\n       Requires that disabled worker beneficiaries be converted to \n     retired worker status at the Earliest Eligibility Age.\n       Any individuals who are categorized as Medical Improvement \n     Not Expected (see below) are exempt.\n     Sec. 102. Reviews and time-limiting of disability benefits.\n       Disability Classifications. Mandates that all beneficiaries \n     be classified as follows when they are admitted on to the \n     rolls:\n       Medical Improvement Expected (MIE, improvement within 1-2 \n     years);\n       Medical Improvement Likely (MIL, improvement within 3-5 \n     years);\n       Medical Improvement Possible (MIP, improvement not likely \n     to be within 5 years, but improvement is possible); and\n       Medical Improvement Not Expected (MINE, there is no known \n     effective treatment). Age may not be used as a factor to \n     categorize someone in the MINE category who otherwise would \n     not be.\n       Continuing Disability Reviews.\n       MILs and MIPs will have mandatory full medical continuing \n     disability reviews during\n\n[[Page S6629]]\n\n     the 5th year and 7th year of benefits, respectively.\n       Any individual may be subject to an earlier review if the \n     Commissioner of Social Security has reason to believe the \n     individual is not under a disability, but such a review \n     cannot be initiated on the basis of income earned under \n     Section 301 (below).\n       Reviews under this paragraph are in addition to, and do not \n     substitute for, other reviews required by the Social Security \n     Act.\n       The standard of review will be the same as conducted for an \n     initial determination, rather than the medical improvement \n     standard, except that any income the individual is now \n     earning under Section 301 (below) will not be considered.\n       Time-limiting Disability Benefits for MIE Individuals.\n       Benefits will be time-limited to 3 years for MIEs.\n       MIEs may file a timely reapplication for benefits during \n     the last twelve to fourteen months of their benefit period.\n       Notwithstanding the above, a reapplication may be deemed \n     timely if the individual can show good cause for failure to \n     submit during the period described above and it is submitted \n     no later than 6 months before the end of the termination \n     month applicable.\n       There will be no waiting period for benefits/Medicare if an \n     individual's timely reapplication is approved.\n       If an initial decision has not been made on a timely \n     reapplication when the individual's benefit term ends, the \n     individual's benefits will continue until an initial \n     determination is made.\n       If an final decision has not been made on a timely \n     reapplication when the individual's benefit term ends, and \n     the individual requests a hearing to review an unfavorable \n     initial decision, the individual may request to have benefits \n     extended until a hearing decision is made. If the individual \n     is determined not to be disabled, any benefits paid after \n     benefit term has ceased will be considered overpayments.\n       A previous award of benefits shall have no bearing on the \n     reapplication, and the continuing disability review rules do \n     not apply.\n     Sec. 103. Adjustment of age criteria for social security \n         disability insurance medical-vocational guidelines.\n       Age cannot be considered as a factor using the grids for \n     any individual aged less than the Normal Retirement Age minus \n     12 years. This means every time the Normal Retirement Age is \n     increased, so too will the age for disability purposes.\n       SSA must consider the share and ages of individuals \n     currently participating in the labor force and the number and \n     types of jobs available in the current economy when \n     considering vocational factors.\n       Starting in two years, and every year thereafter, SSA must \n     keep a current jobs list so examiners are considering the \n     current economy when determining whether an individual can \n     work any job in the national economy.\n     Sec. 104. Mandatory collection of negotiated civil monetary \n         penalties.\n       Mandates SSA collect the penalties negotiated by the \n     Inspector General in cases of fraud by beneficiaries.\n     Sec. 105. Required electronic filing of wage withholding \n         returns.\n       Requires that all W-2s be submitted electronically but \n     provides a hardship exemption for small businesses with 25 \n     employees or less for the first five years, and then moving \n     to 5 employees or less after that.\n\n\n  Title II--Program Integrity: Reforming Standards and Procedures for \n  Disability Hearings, Medical Evidence, and Claimant Representatives\n\n     Sec. 201. Elimination of reconsideration review level for an \n         initial adverse determination of an application for \n         disability insurance benefits.\n       Removes the reconsideration review in the remaining states \n     that still have it so cases can move quickly to a hearing \n     before an ALJ.\n     Sec. 202. Deadline for submission of medical evidence; \n         exclusion of certain medical evidence.\n       Closing the Record. Prevents SSA from considering evidence \n     submitted less than 5 days before a hearing with an ALJ and \n     provides a ``good cause'' standard for failing to meet that \n     deadline that is the same as used in federal court. In no \n     case can evidence be submitted if it was obtained after the \n     ALJ's decision or submitted 1 year after an ALJ's decision.\n       Applicants, their representative, or a disability hearing \n     attorney (defined in section 203 below) may request that a \n     hearing be postponed to complete the record for no more than \n     30 days if it is made at least 7 days prior to the hearing \n     date and if the party shows good cause.\n       Exclusion of Medical Evidence. Makes it clear that \n     claimants and their representatives must submit all known, \n     relevant medical evidence to SSA, whether the evidence is \n     favorable or unfavorable, and requires that claimants certify \n     to the ALJ at a hearing that they have done so. Evidence may \n     not be considered otherwise. There is an exception for \n     attorney-client privileged communications. It also provides \n     clear civil and criminal penalties for the failure to follow \n     these rules.\n       Prohibits SSA from considering evidence furnished by a \n     physician who is not licensed, has been sanctioned, or is \n     under investigation for ethical misconduct.\n     Sec. 203. Non-adversarial disability hearing attorneys.\n       Creates a disability hearing attorney position to develop \n     the record, represent the government in hearings where the \n     claimant has representation, recommend on the record \n     decisions where clearly warranted, and to refer cases to the \n     Appeals Council if they disagree with the ALJ's grant of \n     benefits.\n       Requires the Agency to properly vet and train the staff.\n     Sec. 204. Procedural rules for hearings.\n       Requires SSA to create and publish procedural rules for \n     hearings.\n       Allows ALJs to impose certain fines and other sanctions for \n     failure to follow these rules.\n     Sec. 205. Prohibits attorneys who have relinquished a license \n         to practice in the face of an ethics investigation from \n         serving as a claimant representative.\n       Any representative seeking payment for their services has \n     an affirmative burden of certifying to SSA they meet the \n     rules.\n       Attorneys must certify to SSA they have never been \n     disbarred or suspended from any court or relinquished a \n     license to practice in the face of a misconduct \n     investigation.\n     Sec. 206. Applying judicial code of conduct to administrative \n         law judges.\n       This makes ALJs subject to the Judicial Code of Conduct.\n     Sec. 207. Evaluating medical evidence.\n       Removes the controlling weight standard given to opinion \n     evidence provided by treating physicians.\n       For any healthcare providers filling out a Residual \n     Functional Capacity form, the claimant has to provide them \n     with a Medical Consultant Acknowledgement Form (created by \n     SSA) that discloses how medical evidence will be used by SSA, \n     instructions on filling out RFC forms, and information on the \n     legal and ethical obligations of a practitioner providing \n     such an assessment. The practitioner must sign and certify \n     they read and understand the contents of the form and include \n     it with the RFC or the evidence cannot be considered by SSA. \n     This also provides penalties for forging the certification.\n       Allows ALJs to request and use Symptom Validity Tests and \n     social media and requires SSA provide training on how to \n     weigh such evidence.\n     Sec. 208. Reforming fees paid to attorneys and other claimant \n         representatives.\n       Representatives must account for work performed on a case \n     even if there is a valid fee agreement.\n       SSA can no longer reimburse representatives for travel \n     expenses.\n       The IG must perform annual reviews of the highest-earning \n     claimant representatives that look for repetitive language in \n     their evidence, any licensing problems, and whether there is \n     a disproportionate number of the representatives' cases being \n     determined by a particular ALJ.\n       Representatives cannot receive fees from the Equal Access \n     to Justice Act for: (1) hearings before an ALJ; and (2) if \n     they submitted new evidence after the hearing.\n     Sec. 209. Strengthening the administrative law judge quality \n         review process.\n       The Division of Quality shall conduct an annual review on a \n     sample of cases by ``outlier'' ALJs (those with 85% or higher \n     approvals and 700 or more cases that year) and report to SSA \n     on its findings.\n       Any cases determined to be granted in error must have a \n     continuing disability review within six months.\n     Sec. 210. Permitting data matching by the Inspector General \n         of the Social Security Administration.\n       Exempts Inspectors General from the applicable Computer \n     Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 restrictions, \n     which mandate cumbersome rules to approve agreements with \n     other agencies to share records for investigations.\n     Sec. 211. Accounting for Social Security Program Integrity \n         Spending.\n       Amounts made available for program integrity spending shall \n     be in a separate account within the federal budget and funded \n     in a separate account in the appropriations bill.\n     Sec. 212. Use of the National Directory of New Hires.\n       Mandates that SSA consult the National Directory of New \n     Hires when determining whether an individual is making above \n     the substantial gainful activity limits.\n\n\n      Title III--Providing Support For Working, Disabled Americans\n\n     Sec. 301. Encouraging work through the Work Incentive Benefit \n         System\n       Removes Ticket to Work.\n       Implements the Work Incentive Benefit Program created by \n     Dr. Jagadeesh Gokhale, member of the Social Security Advisory \n     Board. The program incentivizes disability beneficiaries to \n     go back to work to the extent they are able by allowing them \n     to keep more of what they earn while receiving diminished \n     benefits. The program is different from the Benefit Offset \n     National Demonstration (BOND) in that it uses a sliding scale \n     (similar to the Earned Income Tax Credit) to encourage \n     beneficiaries to maximize their earnings.\n\n[[Page S6630]]\n\n       Puts in place a reimbursement structure for state \n     vocational rehabilitation agencies that shares the savings \n     accrued when a beneficiary returns to work under the Work \n     Incentive Benefit Program and thus receives a lower benefit. \n     The share of these savings state VR agencies are entitled to \n     will increase based on the severity of the disability, to \n     ensure VR agencies are targeting those who need the most \n     help.\n     Sec. 302. Early-intervention demonstration project and study. \n         Requires SSA to implement two projects to:\n       Identify disability applicants who have not yet entered the \n     program but who are highly likely to be approved, yet who \n     would have some work capacity if given the appropriate \n     supports. Directs the Commissioner to provide targeted \n     vocational rehabilitation, as well as the possibility of \n     health benefits and cash stipends, to selected individuals \n     who voluntarily suspend their disability application in \n     exchange for these supports; and\n       Study the feasibility of incentives for employers to \n     provide private disability insurance and other support \n     services by reimbursing a portion of payroll taxes when \n     employers can reduce their disability rates (voluntary \n     experience rating).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN:\n  S. 3005. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor a progressive consumption tax and to reform the income tax, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Progressive \nConsumption Tax Act of 2014.\n  We need a tax code that is fair for American employers and fair for \nAmerican families. We need a tax code that makes our U.S.-based \nbusinesses more competitive. Finally, we need a tax code that allows us \nto responsibly and reliably collect reasonable revenues.\n  I applaud the contributions of my colleagues in both the Senate and \nthe House for their efforts in also trying to achieve these goals in \ntax reform. However, I am adding this bill to the tax reform debate, \nbecause I think we need to seriously reconsider the framework for that \ndebate.\n  Today, we seem to be stuck on 1986-style tax reform--lower the income \ntax rate, and broaden the base by eliminating tax preferences.\n  The 1986 reform was a tremendous effort. But, I would argue that that \nreform lasted less than one year before Congress began tinkering with \nour income taxes once again. Since then, innumerable changes have made \nour tax code more and more complicated and, for many taxpayers, less \nand less fair.\n  Another issue with reform efforts focusing on our current tax system \nis this--the extent to which we rely on income taxes is very out of \nstep with the rest of the world.\n  Compared to other countries that are in the OECD--developed countries \nwith advanced economies, countries that we want to be competitive \nwith--all taxes as a percentage of GDP in the United States are low.\n  But, the U.S. is not a low income tax country. Our income tax \nrevenues as a percentage of GDP are higher than the OECD countries. As \nmany of my colleagues have pointed out, we have some of the highest \nstatutory income tax rates in the world.\n  What accounts for the difference is that all OECD countries except \nthe U.S. have a consumption tax. In fact, about 150 countries now have \na consumption tax, many of which were enacted decades ago.\n  Unlike the U.S., these countries can tax imports and subsidize \nexports by rebating their consumption taxes for exports--without \nviolating current World Trade Organization, WTO, rules. As important, \nthese countries can sustain reductions in their corporate income tax \nrates, because they have an alternative and more pro-growth revenue \nsource--a consumption tax.\n  The Progressive Consumption Tax Act puts this country on a level \nplaying field by providing for a broad-based progressive consumption \ntax, or PCT, at a rate of 10 percent. The PCT would generate revenue by \ntaxing goods and services, rather than income.\n  This is not simply an add-on tax. The revenues generated by the Act \nwould be used to eliminate an income tax liability for a significant \nnumber of households. Those who do still have an income tax liability \nwould see a much simplified income tax with their marginal rates \nreduced--the top marginal individual income tax rate, applying to \ntaxable income over $500,000 for joint filers, would be 28 percent. The \ncurrent top marginal rate, applying to taxable income over \napproximately $450,000 for joint filers, is 39.6 percent.\n  The act would also slice our corporate rate by more than half, to 17 \npercent.\n  Finally, the act would provide rebates to lower- and moderate-income \nfamilies to counteract heir consumption tax burden and to replace \nessential support programs like the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child \nTax Credit. Like the EITC and CTC, Individuals and families who do not \nhave an income tax liability would still be able to receive these \nrebates.\n  A key part of the act is progressivity. By eliminating an income tax \nliability for a significant number of households and providing rebates, \nthe Act is meant to be at least as progressive as the current system.\n  The act is also meant to responsibly produce reasonable revenues. I \nknow that some have concerns that the act would just provide a new \nlever for the government to raise funds. That is why the act contains a \nrevenue ``circuit breaker'' mechanism that returns excess PCT revenues \nto taxpayers if a certain threshold is met.\n  Overall, the Progressive Consumption Tax Act has many advantages \ncompared to our current reform efforts.\n  First, it encourages saving. Under current law, families and \nindividuals are taxed on income, which includes savings. Under the act, \nmost households would be exempt from the income tax, and thus would be \nable to save tax free.\n  The act enhances U.S. economic competitiveness. The U.S. corporate \nincome tax rate would be lowered to 17 percent, encouraging \nmultinational corporations to locate here, not abroad. OECD countries \ncurrently attracting U.S. multinationals often impose higher \nconsumption or corporate tax rates than those envisioned by the act.\n  For instance, this year, we heard of many companies that were \nconsidering relocating to the U.K. That country's corporate income tax \nrate is 21 percent and its general consumption tax rate is 20 percent. \nUnder the Act, the U.S. corporate tax rate would become 17 percent and \nthe consumption tax rate would be only 10 percent.\n  In fact, if the Progressive Consumption Tax Act became law, every top \nstatutory rate in the United States--our individual income tax rate, \nour corporate tax rate, our consumption tax rate--would be at least \nfive percentage points lower than the OECD average.\n  The act encourages economic growth. In study that examined 35 years \nof data on 21 OECD countries, consumption taxes were found to be more \ngrowth-friendly than both personal income taxes and corporate income \ntaxes. Corporate income taxes, especially, appear to have the most \nnegative effect on GDP per capita. Growth-oriented tax reform should \nmove away from income tax revenues and towards consumption tax \nrevenues, as the act does.\n  The act also enhances U.S. trade competitiveness. Countries with \nconsumption taxes can adjust their taxes at the border by rebating \nexports. That means that these countries can agree to reduced tariffs \nunder trade agreements, can still tax imports with their consumption \ntaxes, and can export their own goods without a full tax load. Because \nthe PCT is border-adjusted, the U.S. would be able to maintain export \nand import tax parity in the same way as these other countries.\n  The act reduces income tax compliance costs. Most households would \nnot have an income tax liability under the act--although they would \nneed to provide key pieces of information to the IRS in order to obtain \ntheir rebates.\n  Finally, the act protects low- and middle-income families from an \nunfair tax burden. Through the income tax exemption and rebate feature, \nthe Progressive Consumption Tax Act aims to ensure that this new tax \nsystem is at least as progressive as the current income tax system.\n  When my colleagues and others talk to me about comprehensive, \nresponsible, pro-growth tax reform, this to me is what we need to do.\n  That's why I am pleased to introduce Progressive Consumption Tax Act \nin this Congress. The Act is meant as an opening for serious discussion \non this type of reform. We can't just stand by, fight the same tax \nreform fights we did\n\n[[Page S6631]]\n\nnearly 30 years ago, and in the meantime watch American jobs move \noverseas and our income tax system become further riddled with \nloopholes. I hope we will stand for what is right in our tax code, and \nenact the type of reform that allows our country to have among the \nlowest tax rates in the industrialized world, and the fairest system \nfor all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/11/senate-section/article/S6631-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 599--RECOGNIZING THE 100-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF BIG \n             BROTHERS BIG SISTERS SOUTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY (for himself and Mr. Casey) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

This reflects \n     research findings that gambling disorders are similar to \n     substance-related disorders in clinical expression, brain \n     origin, comorbidity, physiology, and treatment.\n       (b) Policy and Programs to Prevent and Treat Gambling \n     Problems.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Defense shall develop a \n     policy and programs on prevention, education, and treatment \n     of problem gambling, including the following elements:\n       (A) Prevention programs for members of the Armed Forces and \n     their dependents.\n       (B) Responsible gaming education for all members of the \n     Armed Forces and their dependents.\n       (C) Establishment of a center of excellence for the \n     residential treatment of the most severe cases of gambling \n     addiction among members of the Armed Forces.\n       (D) Policy and programs to integrate gambling addiction \n     into existing mental health and substance abuse programs in \n     order to--\n       (i) prevent problem gambling behavior among members of the \n     Armed Forces and their families;\n       (ii) provide responsible gaming educational materials to \n     members of the Armed Forces and their family members who \n     gamble; and\n       (iii) train existing substance abuse and mental health \n     counselors to provide gambling addiction treatment within \n     current mental health and substance abuse treatment programs \n     for members of the Armed Forces and veterans.\n       (E) Assessment of gambling problems and factors related to \n     the development of such problems (including co-occurring \n     disorders such as substance use, post-traumatic stress \n     disorder, traumatic brain injury, stress, and sensation \n     seeking), and the social, health, and financial impacts of \n     gambling on members of the Armed Forces by incorporating \n     questions on problem gambling behavior into ongoing research \n     efforts as appropriate, including restoring them into the \n     Health Related Behaviors Survey of Active Duty Military \n     Personnel.\n       (2) Consultation.--The Secretary of Defense shall develop \n     the policies described in paragraph (1) in coordination with \n     the Interagency Task Force on Military and Veterans Mental \n     Health.\n       (3) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit \n     to the congressional defense committees a report on efforts \n     undertaken pursuant to paragraph (1).\n       (c) Comptroller General Study on Gambling and Problem \n     Gambling in the Armed Forces.--Not later than one year after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller \n     General of the United States shall conduct and submit to the \n     congressional defense committees a study on the number, type, \n     and location of gambling installations (including bingo) \n     operated by each branch of the Armed Forces, the total amount \n     of cash flow through the gambling installations, the amount \n     of revenue generated, and how the revenue is spent. In \n     addition, the study shall include an assessment of the \n     prevalence of problem gambling in the Armed Forces, including \n     recommendations for military policy and programs to address \n     it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4096. Mr. SCHUMER (for himself and Mr. Cornyn) proposed an \namendment to the bill S. 1535, to deter terrorism, provide justice for \nvictims, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Justice Against Sponsors of \n     Terrorism Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) International terrorism is a serious and deadly problem \n     that threatens the vital interests of the United States.\n       (2) The Constitution confers upon Congress the power to \n     punish crimes against the law of nations and therefore \n     Congress may by law impose penalties on those who provide \n     material support to foreign organizations engaged in \n     terrorist activity, and allow for victims of international \n     terrorism to recover damages from those who have harmed them.\n       (3) International terrorism affects the interstate and \n     foreign commerce of the United States by harming \n     international trade and market stability, and limiting \n     international travel by United States citizens as well as \n     foreign visitors to the United States.\n       (4) Some foreign terrorist organizations, acting through \n     affiliated groups or individuals, raise significant funds \n     outside of the United States for conduct directed and \n     targeted at the United States.\n       (5) It is necessary to recognize the substantive causes of \n     action for aiding and abetting and conspiracy liability under \n     the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 (22 U.S.C. 5201 et seq.).\n       (6) The decision of the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the District of Columbia in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 \n     (D.C. Cir. 1983), which has been widely recognized as the \n     leading case regarding Federal civil aiding and abetting and \n     conspiracy liability, including by the Supreme Court of the \n     United States, provides the proper legal framework for how \n     such liability should function in the context of the Anti-\n     Terrorism Act of 1987 (22 U.S.C. 5201 et seq.).\n       (7) The United Nations Security Council declared in \n     Resolution 1373, adopted on September 28, 2001, that all \n     countries have an affirmative obligation to ``[r]efrain from \n     providing any form of support, active or passive, to entities \n     or persons involved in terrorist acts,'' and to ``[e]nsure \n     that any person who participates in the financing, planning, \n     preparation or perpetration of terrorist acts or in \n     supporting terrorist acts is brought to justice''.\n       (8) Consistent with these declarations, no country has the \n     discretion to engage knowingly in the financing or \n     sponsorship of terrorism, whether directly or indirectly.\n       (9) Persons, entities, or countries that knowingly or \n     recklessly contribute material support or resources, directly \n     or indirectly, to persons or organizations that pose a \n     significant risk of committing acts of terrorism that \n     threaten the security of nationals of the United States or \n     the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the \n     United States, necessarily direct their conduct at the United \n     States, and should reasonably anticipate being brought to \n     court in the United States to answer for such activities.\n       (10) The United States has a vital interest in providing \n     persons and entities injured as a result of terrorist attacks \n     committed within the United States with full access to the \n     court system in order to pursue civil claims against persons, \n     entities, or countries that have knowingly or recklessly \n     provided material support or resources, directly or \n     indirectly, to the persons or organizations responsible for \n     their injuries.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide civil \n     litigants with the broadest possible basis, consistent with \n     the Constitution of the United States, to seek relief against \n     persons, entities, and foreign countries, wherever acting and \n     wherever they may be found, that have provided material \n     support, directly or indirectly, to foreign organizations or \n     persons that engage in terrorist activities against the \n     United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. FOREIGN SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY.\n\n       Section 1605(a) of title 28, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by amending paragraph (5) to read as follows:\n       ``(5) not otherwise encompassed in paragraph (2), in which \n     money damages are sought against a foreign state arising out \n     of physical injury or death, or damage to or loss of \n     property, occurring in the United States and caused by the \n     tortious act or omission of that foreign state or of any \n     official or employee of that foreign state while acting \n     within the scope of the office or employment of the official \n     or employee (regardless of where the underlying tortious act \n     or omission occurs), including any statutory or common law \n     tort claim arising out of an act of extrajudicial killing, \n     aircraft sabotage, hostage taking, terrorism, or the \n     provision of material support or resources for such an act, \n     or any claim for contribution or indemnity relating to a \n     claim arising out of such an act, except this paragraph shall \n     not apply to--\n       ``(A) any claim based upon the exercise or performance of, \n     or the failure to exercise or perform, a discretionary \n     function, regardless of whether the discretion is abused; or\n       ``(B) any claim arising out of malicious prosecution, abuse \n     of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, \n     interference with contract rights, or any claim for emotional \n     distress or derivative injury suffered as a result of an \n     event or injury to another person that occurs outside of the \n     United States; or''; and\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (d) the following:\n       ``(e) Definitions.--For purposes of subsection (a)(5)--\n       ``(1) the terms `aircraft sabotage', `extrajudicial \n     killing', `hostage taking', and `material support or \n     resources' have the meanings given those terms in section \n     1605A(h); and\n       ``(2) the term `terrorism' means international terrorism \n     and domestic terrorism, as those terms are defined in section \n     2331 of title 18.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. AIDING AND ABETTING LIABILITY FOR CIVIL ACTIONS \n                   REGARDING TERRORIST ACTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 2333 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(d) Liability.--In an action under subsection (a) for an \n     injury arising from an act of international terrorism \n     committed, planned, or authorized by an organization that had \n     been designated as a foreign terrorist organization under \n     section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1189), as of the date on which such act of international \n     terrorism was committed, planned, or authorized, or that was \n     so designated as a result of such act of international \n     terrorism, liability may be asserted as to any person who \n     aided, abetted, or conspired with the person who committed \n     such an act of international terrorism.''.\n       (b) Effect on Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.--Nothing in \n     the amendments made by this section affects immunity of a \n     foreign state, as that term is defined in section 1603 of \n     title 28, United States Code, from jurisdiction under other \n     law.\n\n[[Page S6639]]\n\n     SEC. 5. PERSONAL JURISDICTION FOR CIVIL ACTIONS REGARDING \n                   TERRORIST ACTS.\n\n       Section 2334 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by \n     inserting at the end the following:\n       ``(e) Personal Jurisdiction.--The district courts shall \n     have personal jurisdiction, to the maximum extent permissible \n     under the 5th Amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, over any person who commits or aids and abets an act \n     of international terrorism or otherwise sponsors such act or \n     the person who committed such act, for acts of international \n     terrorism in which any national of the United States suffers \n     injury in his or her person, property, or business by reason \n     of such an act in violation of section 2333.''.\n\n     SEC. 6. LIABILITY FOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN CIVIL ACTIONS \n                   REGARDING TERRORIST ACTS.\n\n       Section 2337 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to \n     read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 2337. Suits against Government officials\n\n       ``No action may be maintained under section 2333 against--\n       ``(1) the United States;\n       ``(2) an agency of the United States; or\n       ``(3) an officer or employee of the United States or any \n     agency of the United States acting within the official \n     capacity of the officer or employee or under color of legal \n     authority.''.\n\n     SEC. 7.

Mr. President, I will just say a couple words before I \nturn it over to the Chair and to my colleague from West Virginia.\n  When I think of Mary Landrieu, I think of the most tenacious person \nin the Senate standing here, holding court, fighting for her cause, \nfighting for her values, fighting for her State. I think particularly \nof the hard work she did on flood insurance, on this issue that was so \ncritical to the State of Louisiana and very important to my State of \nOregon and to our other States but particularly Louisiana. She was \ndetermined. Every time I was on the floor, she would say: Jeff, have \nyou done this and Jeff, have you done that. She would grab someone \nelse, and she would say: And now we have to do this. That is how \nlegislation gets done.\n  Senator Landrieu really drives things through the Senate. It is one \nthing to be here and express your ideas in kind of a social manner--\nwell, wouldn't this be nice or wouldn't that be nice; it is another to \nstand here and say: I am going to make this happen because it is \nimportant to my constituents and important to our Nation. I have seen \nMary Landrieu do that on issue after issue, and certainly for all who \ncame in with my class 6 years ago, it has been a wonderful education on \nhow to make maximum use and effectiveness from this privilege of \nserving in the Senate.\n  Thank you for everything you have done, Mary Landrieu. It is an honor \nto serve with you, and we are going to miss you greatly.NOTICE\n\nIf the 113th Congress, 2nd Session, adjourns sine die on or before \nDecember 24, 2014, a final issue of the Congressional Record for \nthe 113th Congress, 2nd Session, will be published on Wednesday, \nDecember 31, 2014, to permit Members to insert statements.\nAll material for insertion must be signed by the Member and \ndelivered to the respective offices of the Official Reporters of \nDebates (Room HT-59 or S-123 of the Capitol), Monday through \nFriday, between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. through \nTuesday, December 30.

SCHUMER, Chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. All of us came here at one time or another, and the \nfirst impression you have is how they kind of ingratiate you and bring \nyou into the\n\n[[Page S6650]]\n\nfold. I am often asked--I am sure most of our colleagues are asked the \nsame question--whom do you consider your best and closest friend and \nwhom do you associate with and whom do you feel comfortable with? In \nany category, without a doubt, it is always Mary Landrieu. We come from \na similar background--rural States. We come from the same culture--\nhard-working people who basically don't ask for an awful lot and give a \nlot more back. Both of us come from large Catholic families, and we \nhave an awful lot in common. We and our spouses have bonded, and we \nhave done things together. That was the way I heard the place used to \nwork, that you build relationships and there is camaraderie and you \nshare dinners at people's homes. It is such a different atmosphere when \nthat happens because you really do forge a bond that is so much missing \nin this body.\n  Let me say one other thing. The great losers in this whole election \nprocess we just had were the great people of Louisiana. They lost a \nchampion. They lost a fighter. That is what Senator Merkley said. There \nis nobody who said: I think you ought to be careful about that because \nI think Mary is interested. We knew there could be problems.\n  With that being said, the best thing to do is to go talk to Mary on \nthis subject or issue, and we would work through it. How do we \ncompromise and bring everybody together? And Mary would say: We will \nwork through it.\n  Coming from an energy State and Mary having an energy State and the \ntwo of us being Democrats, on our side sometimes our individual caucus \nis not as large as we would like for it to be--let's put it that way--\nbut we talk an awful lot about how we are moving an energy policy. As \nMary said, we need it all in this country. We should be totally energy \nindependent. We shouldn't be looking to other countries and buying \ntheir products and giving them the resources to be used against us, and \nwe don't have to do that. We can do it in a sensible and balanced way \nwith the economy and the environment. Mary has always had the economy \nand environment first and foremost. That type of balance is hard to \nfind, and it is definitely hard to find in Washington.\n  So I just want her to know that there is nobody who is going to miss \nMary Landrieu more than I, being in this body, going shoulder to \nshoulder with her and trying to bring an even keel to this whole \nprocess.\n  Mary, I feel for the people of Louisiana. I truly do. I am hoping \nsomebody can come along and have the same spirit and fight that you \nhave, but no one is going to be able to replace you and what you have \nbeen able to do and what you have been able to make us aware of.\n  My little State was involved in helping Katrina, helping the State of \nLouisiana. The State of West Virginia came immediately. When that \nhappened, we were so proud to be part of that, and we now have a lot of \npeople from Louisiana living in West Virginia today because of that \neffort.\n  There has been a wonderful relationship and a wonderful friendship, \nbut more importantly, there has been a wonderful person who has graced \nthe Halls in this tremendous body for 18 years who will not be replaced \nin this Senate and this body. Again, the people of Louisiana should be \nextremely proud to have someone who is a fighter, who gave every drop \nshe had of public service for her State and never forgot where she come \nfrom. So with that, that is a tremendous tribute in itself.\n  I say to my dear friend, thank you for your service on behalf of the \ngreat State of Louisiana. Thank you for all the important work you have \ndone for our country. God bless you, and I love you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, you can see that Mary Landrieu has a \nlot of friends on both sides of the aisle, and that is because Mary has \nstood up and been a mentor to so many of us. She taught us how to fight \nfor our own States because that is what she has done every day for \nLouisiana.\n  I was thinking about our States earlier. Mary mentioned in her talk \nabout how Minnesota is at the top of the Mississippi and Louisiana is \nat the bottom and how hard we fought for river issues and barges and \nlocks and dams. We will actually have success at the end of the year \nwith the ABLE Act, which is really important for other reasons, but we \nare going to finally start the funding for lock and dam improvements, \nand that kind of work would not have happened without Mary and the work \nand support she has provided with the RIVER Act. So a river doesn't \ndivide us, it unites us, and Mary is a uniter and brings people \ntogether on so many issues.\n  She said before that she was going to put some things on the Record \nabout adoption, but I thought I would take the opportunity to fill \npeople in.\n  First of all, Mary established the Congressional Coalition on \nAdoption Institute. If you have not gone to some of the events where \nshe literally brings the angels--people who have adopted children in \nthe most dire circumstances--to Washington to celebrate these adoptions \nand talk about the policy changes that need to be made.\n  Anyone who has adopted one of the foster kids or brought them into an \noffice and adopted them--the reason you can do that is because Mary \nLandrieu started that program so that foster children, who otherwise \nwould not have the connections and wherewithal to be able to get a job \nfor the summer, spring, or fall in Washington, DC, would be able to \nwork, and then she has all of these kids to her house every single \nyear.\n  Mary doesn't just fight for adopted kids at home, she fights for them \nall over the world. I would hate to be the bureaucrat in Guatemala when \nMary Landrieu shows up to fight them off. I see her staff, and some of \nthem were probably with her on that trip. I think she knew the name of \nevery child who was waiting to be adopted in Guatemala.\n  How can we forget the meeting with the Russians when they started to \nuse these poor little children as pawns in a political game? Mary stood \nup to them. As a result, as many of us know, she has now been banned \nfrom the country of Russia. I don't think everybody knows that the \nreason she was banned was because she was fighting for these kids who \nwere waiting to be adopted. Many of the parents are in my State, and \nthey actually have siblings and they are trying to adopt the other \nsibling. That is a very sad story and Mary stood up for them. In the \nwords of her dad, Putin didn't like it, and so Mary was banned. I guess \nthat is not where she is going on vacation after we are done here.\n  The other thing about Mary I will never forget--how kind and sweet \nand fun she is for her friends in the Senate--is the time when we had a \nbet on the Saints-Vikings game in the playoffs. We bet some food from \nour States. If anybody remembers that amazing playoff game, the Vikings \nlost, and I had to wear a Drew Brees jersey and walk over to Mary's \noffice with a pot of gumbo, which is really hard to make. When I got to \nher office, all of her New Orleans press was there, and when she tried \nthat gumbo, she said, this is Minnesota gumbo. This gumbo just needs \nsomething special. She got out an enormous bottle of hot sauce from her \ndesk drawer--as only a Louisiana Senator would have--and dumped it in \nmy Minnesota gumbo. That is the spice that Mary has added to all of our \nlives.\n  What we have learned from her we will never forget. As I said, she is \na role model for so many of us on how to fight for our States.\n  We see it in the eyes of those little adopted children and the great \nsuccess we are starting to see on the coast because of all the recovery \nyou brought to your State. We know you will never be forgotten and we \nwant you to keep fighting.\n  Thank you, Mary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I can't leave the floor without speaking \nto Mary. Mary has been such an incredible inspiration to me. I have \nbeen in the Senate now for 13 months, and I have had a number of \nconversations with her, but the best way to teach somebody is to show \nsomebody.\n  Senator Landrieu is prodigiously persuasive, tirelessly tenacious, \ndoggedly determined. Just to watch Senator Landrieu is to watch what \nevery American should hope for in a Senator--someone who is unyielding \nin their work and service to them.\n\n[[Page S6651]]\n\n  If you look at the myriad of interests in the State of Louisiana, I \nwas amazed by what I saw firsthand. Mary stood up and fought for the \npeople who were loud and ornery but still had a good cause as well as \nthe people who were voiceless and humble. Mary stood up for them. Mary \nstood up for people in her community who were from every different \nbackground and from every different race. Mary stood up to them in a \nway that is a model to my State.\n  I heard my senior Senator mention you by name about how essential you \nwere when my State had its back against the wall and crushed by a \nsuperstorm. When there were battles to get my State's funding, and Mary \nhad no skin in that game, my senior Senator mentioned you as a champion \nfor New Jersey and that is what blows me away about you.\n  I yearn for a government that has moral courage, more than we have \nnow, people who will risk popularity for purpose and will risk \nsubstance for some kind of celebrity. Senator Landrieu has done things \nagainst her political interests, but that were for the people. That is \nwhy I have a great deal of reverence for you and why I travel down to \nyour State.\n  Now the Senator knows this because I must have said it hundreds of \ntimes when I was down in Louisiana, that that is my ancestral State. I \nwill end by saying this: My grandaddy was born in Monroe. He was born \npoor. As my family likes to say, he was so poor he couldn't afford to \nbe poor, he was po, P-O. He was born to a single mama. He was born \nBlack at a time of immense segregation, when people who walked the \nhallways of power couldn't give a damn about him. He taught me love for \nyour State, and more importantly, the urgency to stand up and fight for \nthose people that most folks won't fight for.\n  I am telling you right now, my grandaddy died during my first big \nelection, but if he knew you, he would be so proud of your service.\n  Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I wish to echo all the comments people said today, but I \nhave to be honest. When I was elected, I was scared of Mary. People \nsaid very politely that you should check with Mary to see if she has an \nissue with something. I was terrified of what people told me she would \ndo if I was not on her side.\n  If you remember, when I came in, we doubled the oil and gas caucus in \nthe Democratic caucus by me just joining, and so we had an immediate \nconnection, which was unique in itself. Our connection was not just \nthat, but also, as Mary mentioned, her mentor, Lindy Boggs, and our \nfamily knows the Boggses very well.\n  I can still remember a call I got when I won my mayor's race in 2003 \nfrom this woman in Louisiana. My staff came in and said some woman from \nLouisiana is calling, and we don't know who she is, but she wants to \ntalk to you, and so I said, OK. I took the phone call, and it was Lindy \nBoggs. You know how she would start a conversation with ``Hi, darlin', \nI just want to check in with you and see how you are doing, and \ncongratulations.'' Then she said, ``One moment, someone is at my \ndoor.'' She came back and said, ``The exterminator is here,'' and that \nis classic Lindy Boggs.\n  What was so real about her--and I can see it in Mary's style--and \nthat is she is real. The work Mary has done--and I didn't know it until \nI came to the Senate--for foster kids and adoption is remarkable. Amy \nKlobuchar went into great detail about that, and it shows that it is \nnot always about the policy and fights on the floor here, but there is \nso much that individuals do outside this Chamber. What Mary has done \noutside of the Chamber is to use this position to make a difference for \nyoung people, and that is powerful. As Mary has said, we fight over \npolicies and issues, but every one of those young people has been \ntouched in some way. I guarantee--and I am sure you have seen it over \nthe years where someone might come up to you and say, I don't know if \nyou remember me, and then they tell you the story of how you met them \nwhen they were a foster kid and just getting adopted or when you were \nat one of the ceremonies or one of the events they were at. Those are \nthe things I will remember about you.\n  The tenacity that people talked about--there is no question about it. \nI was glad when I got on the Appropriations Committee because I \nthought, finally, I will be on there with someone who will chew it up \nwith me, and I just had to hang on to your coattails when you were \nfighting on issues.\n  When we sat in on those leadership meetings on Tuesday morning, I was \nalways thankful when you came in. You were right across from me. I \ndon't know if they all figured it out--maybe, again, as I said, it is a \nlittle bit of confession--we had our signals, or maybe eye contact, and \nthen we went to work. You were really incredible.\n  When you were in caucus--and many people don't see those, except as \nMembers--you were always passionate about what was important to \nLouisiana. You never forgot what was important to Louisiana.\n  People made the comment that you are tenacious. I would say that any \ntime something did move in the Congress, you were a part of it in some \nway. When we were trying to figure out how to fix the health care bill, \nyou were right there. You didn't hesitate. You knew it was a hot \npotato, but it was also something that we knew we had to make better, \nnot just for people but for decades to come. You were not afraid of \nthat even though you said you knew it could cost you your election \nbecause you knew generationally it would have an impact.\n  It wasn't about the moment, it was about 10, 15, 20 years, you could \nlook back and say you helped make that happen, and you did, every time \nyou tried to move in and push an item or idea. Even though we will not \nbe serving here, you will have an impact.\n  I could tell, as we were shaking hands here, it was amazing to watch \nyou, you never stop. You were already talking to each person about the \nwork they need to be doing. When I shook your hand, you were talking \nabout fisheries. I am like, Mary, just relax. But you are already \nworking it, and that is what is so unique about you. You will not be in \nthis body, but you will be in this body because of the way you do your \nwork. It is not about being in this office, it is about caring about \nLouisiana, and as I said, I saw it just in this last moment here. It is \nunbelievable. You will never give up on the people of Louisiana because \nyou care so deeply.\n  It has been an honor to know you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. I wish to make some remarks about the Senator from \nLouisiana. I had the pleasure of serving as ranking member of the \nHomeland Security Appropriations Committee, and Mary Landrieu was the \nchairman. I wasn't sure about what to expect when I joined that \ncommittee. I knew of Mary's passion and her persuasion, which is given \nin a gentle but effective way. She reaches out. I thought, she is going \nto convince me out of just about everything. I will not be able to hold \nmy own with her, but she was so gracious in terms of working together \nwith me as we worked through some very tough issues.\n  She was a knowledgeable and effective leader. She couldn't ask enough \nquestions, couldn't gain enough information, making wise decisions, \ngiven the limitations that we had relative to appropriations and given \nthe process that, unfortunately, was not the way the Appropriations \nCommittee should go forward. Nevertheless, working together on that and \non a whole number of issues turned out to be a very pleasant experience \nbecause of the nature of the leader of the committee and their \nwillingness to work together.\n  You get to learn something about someone when you spend 3 days \ntrekking along the southern border on the immigration issue. We climbed \ninto tunnels, driving along fences, talking to Border Patrol agents, \nlooking at the enormous channels that exist relative to that border and \nour Border Patrol people and immigration control people. Both of us \nwere right there in blue jeans and tennis shoes in hot weather, and \nlearning firsthand the challenges this country faces relative to \ndealing with immigration.\n  Her passion for children and her State has been talked about. I think \nthe word that best describes Mary is passion. She has passion for the \nengagement in anything that she engages\n\n[[Page S6652]]\n\nin and doing it in a way that is relentless and reaches results. I \nthink it is a great tribute to her character and to the kind of person \nshe is.\n  One thing we will not be able to do is meet together somewhere in \nRussia. I have been banned from Russia and Mary has been banned from \nRussia. I was banned because I took significant exception to the \nRussian takeover of Crimea and its activities in Ukraine. I was \nsurprised by that. Mary was banned for an unnecessary reason, and that \nwas trying to help Russian children who were trying to find adoptive \nparents. Obviously she was successful, and obviously she was as \nrelentless there as she was on all the other issues because Russia saw \nthat as a threat. Here is someone reaching out for all the right \nreasons and doing something for all the right reasons--passion for \nchildren and finding them a home.\n  I wish Mary the very best going forward in her next chapter of life. \nI can testify to you from personal experience that there is life after \nCongress, and it can be a pleasant life. Knowing you, you will be \nengaged in something very significant--whether for your State or your \ncountry. Your life of service, and your family's life of service, is \nwell recognized. So I wish the Senator from Louisiana the very best as \nshe goes forward. It has been a pleasure working with her.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to follow the comments of my \nfriend, the Senator from Indiana, although I do think the Record should \nbe corrected. I would say to my colleague I have also dealt with the \nSenator from Louisiana a number of times on a number of issues, and I \nhave thought of lots of words to describe her style, but ``gentle'' \nwould not be one to come to mind.\n  I know this is a day to pay tribute, so I wish to echo some of the \ncomments of the Senator from Indiana.\n  I first met part of the Landrieu family when I had a chance to meet \nMary's dad when he was serving as the Secretary of HUD and I was a \nyoung staff person. Mary talks a lot about her family. Her family was \nkind enough to host me a variety of times when I was in Louisiana. She \nhas a great family, a great tradition.\n  So many folks have spoken about specific issues regarding Mary's \nservice in the Senate. I am not going to talk about her focus on issues \nand the relentlessness she brings, but I wish to acknowledge her \ngenerosity and heart and spirit. She and Frank would always open their \nhome for whatever cause. Again, I heard the comments about her enormous \nheart and commitment for adoption. I think about so many events that we \ngo to, but those Angels of Adoption events at her house touched all of \nus in a way that is not often the case. I also can acknowledge now that \nshe has a great love for the Commonwealth of Virginia and has spent \nsome time there due to her love of horses and her daughter's riding and \nher own riding. As has been mentioned by so many--and I know from our \nown conversations--this is not somebody who wants to look backward but \nis clearly already looking forward. I know life holds for you and Frank \na number of extraordinarily exciting additional chapters. I hope I have \nthe opportunity to be a part of those chapters and to be subject to \nthat gentle persuasion on whatever issue comes to mind as you go \nforward.\n  I know I speak for so many of our colleagues when I say we all have a \nlot of unique characteristics, but with Mary Landrieu they broke the \nmold.\n  I yield the floor to my good friend the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, one of the truly nice things about serving \nin the Senate is the people we meet. Myrna and I consider Frank and \nMary to be our friends. She is an incredible person and has given \nincredible service. I am sorry the people of Louisiana could not see \nMary in our caucuses as she fought on different issues for the people \nof Louisiana and what she did as an advocate on behalf of people who \notherwise would not have had their voices heard. She did it in a very \neffective way.\n  I heard some of the conversations about what happened with Katrina \nand the people of New Orleans. Mary Landrieu brought us down to \nLouisiana for us to see firsthand. It was incredible for me, not to \njust see the physical devastation, but thanks to Mary Landrieu, we saw \nthe people. We saw the spirit in the people, but we saw people who \nneeded help. It is that type of emotional involvement that Mary gives \nto every cause she believes in.\n  So I want the Senator from Louisiana to know how much I deeply \nrespect your model of public service and the people you stood up for.\n  Senator Landrieu spoke about the adoption issue. She got into it \nbecause she has such a big family. I think I got into it because of \nher. She is pretty persuasive. We all feel better because of that. \nSenator Landrieu is the one who really led us in those efforts. What an \nincredible legacy.\n  I want to speak a minute about small business issues. Senator \nLandrieu chaired that committee during a particularly important time. I \nwant to relate a couple of stories to my colleagues. There are many \ntimes I was in the Democratic caucus and we would be talking about an \nissue and Senator Landrieu would stand and say, Well, how about small \nbusinesses? Under her leadership we brought some major initiatives to \nthe floor to help small businesses because of Mary Landrieu and her \nability to put together a commonsense package. She understood small \nbusinesses are the growth engine of America. That is how jobs are \ncreated and that is where innovation takes place. I can tell my \ncolleagues--I worked with her. I know what we got done. I know how we \ntook on our own governmental agencies to make sure they did right for \nsmall businesses and how we fought the bundling. Contract officers love \nto take small contracts and make them into big ones because it is less \nheadache for them but less opportunity for small businesses. Mary \nLandrieu stopped that practice and put a spotlight on it. It was an \nincredible experience for me because it showed me that each of us can \nmake a difference.\n  I knew what I was trying to do. One of the issues I got involved with \nwas to raise the surety bond issues and I didn't see much chance of \ngetting it done and Mary gave me the opportunity to get it done. She \ncoached me on how to get it done, and that is now a permanent law of \nthe land.\n  She made us all relevant on the committee, individually and \ncollectively. We have a great legacy to help small businesses in this \ncountry, thanks to the leadership of Senator Landrieu.\n  To the people of Louisiana, they could not have had a stronger \nadvocate, a stronger friend, a person who accomplished more for that \nState during some extremely challenging times. To the people of this \ncountry and the work Mary Landrieu did on the Appropriations Committee \nfor our national security and standing up for and protecting and \ndefending our own country, the record of Senator Landrieu is \nincredible. To those who are voiceless but had Mary Landrieu to speak \nfor them, the disadvantaged; to small businesses--and the list goes on \nand on and on--this is one incredible legislator. She is a model to \nmany of us. I thank her so much for her service and her commitment to \npublic life. It will always be an inspiration to me, the fact that I \nwas given the honor to serve with you in the Senate of the United \nStates.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Walsh). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I rise to add my words of admiration for \nthis great person, for this great legislator. Just to tell a brief \nstory, it was back in 2006, in a lameduck session just like this. The \nDemocrats had won and were about to take over the Senate. The Democrats \nhad just won and were about to take over the House--a different passage \nin time. But throughout all of 2006, even in the minority, Mary \nLandrieu was moving a bill to open up a vast new area in the Gulf of \nMexico for drilling for oil and natural gas.\n  I was over in the House. I was from Massachusetts. I did not want \nthis bill to pass. I wanted to actually save it for 2007 when the \nDemocrats were in control. We could pass it in an energy bill by the \nend of 2007, which would have included this provision. Mary passed it \nthrough the Senate--bipartisan, as usual. If we look up bipartisan, if \nwe Google it, Mary's picture actually comes up.\n\n[[Page S6653]]\n\n  Over in the House, because of all of her momentum, I lost and that \nbill passed. Again, tens of thousands of new jobs fell to Louisiana \nthrough Mary Landrieu.\n  It was about a week later when I was out shopping and here comes Mary \nright toward me with her daughter in her riding outfit.\n  Mary said: I want to introduce you to Congressman Markey.\n  I said to her daughter: Well, you have to add a few additional words \nbecause your mother just defeated me quite badly just last week and \npassed a big bill for Louisiana, for whom your mother always calls her \npeople, the people of Louisiana.\n  There isn't anybody who understands better the spirit of legislating, \nabout protecting your home State and respecting those who are maybe not \nin agreement with you but are not your enemy but somebody whom you try \nto work with.\n  After the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico I was the lead Democrat in \nthe House on the Natural Resources Committee with jurisdiction over \nthat, and Mary again was outraged that such damage could be done to her \nfishermen, to her tourism industry, to her people in Louisiana. She \nworked hard to make sure billions of dollars would ultimately go back \ninto the gulf to ensure that her fishermen, her tourism industry, and \nher people were protected.\n  Then, after having served in the House for 37 years, I arrived in the \nSenate with a great concern that a bill I had been working on in \nMassachusetts, which was the dramatic rise in the insurance rates for \nhomeowners and businesses right along the coastline of Massachusetts, \nand I had to introduce legislation not only to work on the issue, but \nwhen I arrived in the Senate, Mary Landrieu was already here, already \nworking on that bill, all ready to protect her homeowners, her small \nbusiness people from outrageous increases in insurance rates that would \nhave basically made their homes unaffordable.\n  Throughout my career, all I can tell my colleagues is one constant is \nthis great, legendary legislator, somebody who embodies all the best of \nwhat this institution stands for. I just want to let her know how proud \nI have been to be able to serve with her here and how proud I am to be \nable to tell a story of the time when she just beat me flat-out because \nthat is just how she plays. She plays it for her State every time, and \nno waiting if it is Louisiana. I know all the people of Louisiana know \nthat about her.\n  So congratulations on your great career.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, as I start my comments on the land title \nlegislation before us, I would be remiss if I did not mention the \nincredible work our chair Mary Landrieu has done on this legislation. \nAs we just heard from the tribute to her service over the last few \nminutes, as the Presiding Officer said in his comments, if you Google \n``bipartisan,'' there will be a picture of Mary Landrieu. I think this \ntitle sort of embodies that. We owe great gratitude to Chairman \nLandrieu and to Ranking Member Murkowski for the incredible negotiation \nand work they have put into this package.\n  We stand on the cusp of passing one of the most significant pieces of \npublic land legislation since the omnibus bill of 2009. I stand here to \nspeak on behalf of this well-balanced package which is absolutely \ncritical for jobs across the Western United States and particularly \nfrom the perspective of my home State of New Mexico.\n  I want to say that absolutely none of this would be possible were it \nnot for the years of effort and support from the local communities that \nhelped to craft this legislation. Thanks to their work, New Mexico's \ncritical public land-based economic engine will continue to grow and \nthe energy, tourism, and sporting and recreation sectors. New \nwilderness and National Park Service units will continue to make New \nMexico an unmatched destination for world travelers as well as to the \nlocal families who have known for centuries that New Mexico truly is \nthe land of enchantment.\n  I wish to start by talking a little bit about a place that is located \nin the Carson National Forest in northern New Mexico.\n  This is a picture of Lobo Peak, which is part of this area called \nColumbine Hondo. Lobo Peak is 12,000 feet and change. It is quite a \nspectacular view--the kind of view most people associate with Montana \nor Colorado or Wyoming. The Sangre de Cristo mountains in northern New \nMexico are unmatched or could match any of those mountain ranges in \nStates found farther north in the Rockies.\n  Columbine Hondo has been managed as a wilderness study area since \n1980. It is an area that is cherished by all who know it and is a key \nattraction for the local tourism and outdoor recreation economy.\n  When I was a young outfitter guide and the executive director of the \nCottonwood Gulch Foundation, Columbine Hondo was one of the spectacular \ndestinations where our students backpacked and slept under the stars \nand learned to navigate in the backcountry. This area has some of the \nbest elk, mule deer, and bighorn sheep habitat in New Mexico. People \ncome from across the Nation to experience a true wilderness elk hunt in \nits aspen and fir forests.\n  Fishermen will tell you that it is home to some of the last, best \nhabitat for our native Rio Grande cutthroat trout, which is, \ncoincidentally, New Mexico's State fish as well.\n  Columbine Hondo is home to the headwaters of the Red River and the \nRio Hondo. There is nothing more precious in a State such as New Mexico \nthan our water. Those are major tributaries of the Rio Grande. The \nsnowmelt from Lobo Peak, seen here, and from Gold Hill provide critical \nirrigation water to local acequia associations that carry on centuries-\nold agricultural traditions.\n  For millennia now, these mountains, rivers, and wildlife have \nsupported New Mexico's traditional communities. The first evidence of \nhuman habitation here stretches back 11,000 years. Nearby Taos Pueblo \nhas been continuously inhabited for more than 1,000 years. Spanish \nsettlers first came to the area in the 16th century. Hispanic families \nhave relied on these mountains and their bounty for their way of life \never since.\n  Today Columbine Hondo is a central attraction to visitors to Taos \nCounty, where outdoor recreation and tourism drive the local economy \nand contribute to a 68,000-job-strong public land recreation industry \nin our State.\n  In addition to finally designating Columbine Hondo as a full-fledged \nwilderness area, this package would also expand the Wheeler Peak \nWilderness by approximately 650 additional acres while modifying a \nboundary in order to create a loop trail accessible by mountain bikes \nalong the Lost Lake Trail from Taos Ski Valley, to the East Fork Trail, \nto Red River.\n  This proposal has broad community support, including Taos Pueblo, \nmany local government leaders, hunters, fishermen, business owners, \nland grant heirs, ranchers, acequia parcientes, conservationists, \nmountain bikers, veterans, and literally the list could go on and on.\n  In October, on my birthday--I could not have asked for a better \nbirthday gift--I was able to join the Columbine Hondo Wilderness \nCoalition as well as regional stakeholders and local elected officials \nfor a hike into the area to highlight the conservation and water \ninitiatives they support. Local residents discussed why they support \npermanently protecting Columbine Hondo and what the area means to them \nand their livelihoods and their lives.\n  Esther Garcia, an acequia commissioner and the former mayor of \nQuesta, expressed her support well when she said:\n\n       Columbine Hondo is very important to all of us. To preserve \n     this beautiful wilderness area, we preserve our hunting, our \n     pinon picking, our herb gathering.\n\n  I thank all of the residents of Taos County who have worked hard for \ndecades--literally decades--to make this wilderness area a reality.\n  Also included in this public land package is a provision to \ntransition the \n\n[[Page S6654]]\n\nValles Caldera National Preserve in New Mexico to new management to \nincrease public access. This proposal was developed after extensive \ninput from local residents, sportsmen, business owners, elected \nofficials, and is supported by a number of local chambers of commerce. \nTogether they decided that a national preserve, managed by the Park \nService, with a mandate for hunting and fishing to remain central to \nthe management of the area, was the best way to ensure expanded public \naccess while preserving the incredible landscape for future \ngenerations.\n\n  As you can see from this photo, Valles Caldera is often called New \nMexico's Yellowstone for a reason. It is literally an area that was \ncreated as a collapsed supervolcano, where cinder cones rise up out of \nthe high-elevation grassland and where the cinder cones and the \nmountains that encircle this collapsed crater are covered in Douglas-\nfir and fir and aspen forests. It is a spectacular landscape. The \nCaldera is home to crystal-clear trout streams and some of the best elk \nhabitat in the country.\n  Since this area was transitioned to public ownership, the preserve \nhas been managed by a board of trustees charged with generating enough \nrevenue from user fees and other sources to make the preserve \nfinancially self-sustaining--literally the same model used for the \nPresidio in San Francisco, but, as you can see, this is not San \nFrancisco. This management regime has led to drastically limited public \naccess, with relatively high entrance and permit fees, blocking many \nNew Mexicans and other Americans out of this public land. By shifting \nto Park Service management, we can open the Valles Caldera to the \npublic while conserving the incredible, really one-of-a-kind unique \nresources that are found here.\n  As someone who has been lucky enough to draw an elk tag in the \nCaldera, expanding hunting opportunities for the public is one of the \nprimary reasons I am supporting this proposal. The preserve model \nensures that hunting and fishing remain a central activity for the \npublic to enjoy. National Park Service management will help balance \nexpanded public access with conserving both the natural and the \nincredible cultural resources that are found in this area.\n  Park Service management will also help bring more visitors and will \nraise the national profile of the preserve for visitors from outside \nNew Mexico. The increase in visitors at the preserve is expected to \nbring more than 200 jobs and $8 million in wages to the local \ncommunities in the region. That is great news for places such as Los \nAlamos, Espanola, and Jemez Springs.\n  We have seen elsewhere how protecting public lands spurs economic \ndevelopment. According to Headwaters Economics, rural counties with \nprotected Federal lands such as national parks and preserves saw a 345-\npercent increase in jobs over the last four decades, whereas rural \ncounties without commensurate protected public lands saw job increases \nof only 83 percent in the same period.\n  I thank the local communities and all the elected officials who have \nworked so hard for decades to make this proposal possible. I thank \nSenator Tom Udall and former Senator Jeff Bingaman for their leadership \non this issue.\n  We all literally stand on the shoulders of giants in this community \neffort, as it was Senator Clinton P. Anderson of New Mexico who helped \npass the Wilderness Act and who first proposed National Park Service \nmanagement of the Valles Caldera in the early 1960s.\n  Additionally, as the son of a Navy sailor who literally saw the last \nof the aboveground atom bomb explosions and the first of the hydrogen \nbomb explosions firsthand, I am especially pleased to see that the \nManhattan Project National Historical Park Act, which was introduced by \nSenator Maria Cantwell, is also included in this title. It will \nestablish three different educational sites--one in Los Alamos, NM, one \nat Oak Ridge in Tennessee, and one at Hanford in Washington. Los \nAlamos, NM, has made incredible contributions to our Nation's nuclear \nhistory. These parks will conserve historic sites and artifacts that \nplayed a key role in the dawn of the nuclear era, while telling the \nstory of the creation of the world's first atomic bomb and exploring \nits consequences for our society and our world.\n  Finally, I would like to mention the provision in this package that \nwill benefit New Mexico's energy economy. It is one that I know Senator \nLandrieu was very supportive and excited about. It is a bill that I \ncosponsored, but it was authored by my colleague Senator Tom Udall, who \nchampioned this effort to ensure that the Bureau of Land Management has \nthe staff it needs to streamline the oil and gas drilling permit \nprocess, while at the same time strengthening the review system that \nhelps them meet important environmental and safety standards.\n  Thousands of jobs and a sizable portion of our State's economy are \nsupported in New Mexico by the oil and gas industry. Increasing \ncooperation among Federal agencies and business is an important way to \nboost job creation, while at the same time expanding domestic energy \nproduction.\n  Like other Americans who value our shared lands as assets to be \nutilized, to be enjoyed, and to be passed along to future generations, \nthese are all things worth fighting for. I am committed to carry on my \nState's rich conservation history, and this legislation makes an \nenormous contribution to that ever-evolving story.\n\n  I yield the floor to my colleague the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his comments on \nthe land portion of the national defense authorization. I very much \nappreciate the work he has done and his hard work fighting for the \npeople of New Mexico since his time in the Senate.\n  We thank you very much for your leadership, Senator Heinrich.\n  Mr. President, 1 million people live in the great State of Montana. \nWe are home to farmers, ranchers, working families, small business \nowners, and to bold sports men and women who explore until they are too \nexhausted to take another step.\n  Our lands are famous worldwide, from Glacier National Park and \nYellowstone National Park to wild and scenic rivers such as the North \nFork of the Flathead River. We attract the best explorers, the best \nhunters and anglers, and all those who simply want to get away from it \nall.\n  But our outdoors just aren't for out-of-staters. Montanans deeply \nvalue our land. Many Montanans remember their first hunting trip. Many \nrecall where they landed their first trout. I remember riding horses \nwith my father in the Bear Paw Mountains.\n  Montanans come with a lot of opinions, but one issue that unites us \nis taking care of our public lands and keeping our public lands in \npublic hands. We want to make sure our kids and grandkids can hike in \nthe Bob Marshall Wilderness, that they can catch their first fish in \nthe clean waters of the Madison River, and that our outdoor traditions \nremain strong for generations to come.\n  As a Senator from Montana, it is my responsibility to make sure we \npreserve these treasured places, that we responsibly use our lands to \nadvance the interests of our State and of our country. That is why I am \nproud to support the Montana lands bills that will probably be voted on \ntomorrow.\n  These bills are a product of years of negotiations. Ranchers and \nconservationists started working on the Rocky Mountain Front Heritage \nAct before I became Senator. These bills are a product of compromise \nled by folks on the ground--the folks who live and breathe Montana's \noutdoors every day--and these bills are a product of Montana's \ncongressional delegation working together to move Montana forward.\n  We all know Congress fails to agree on much these days. Gridlock and \nroadblocks are common. Few people are willing to compromise, but when \nyou give a little, you get a lot. That is how Montana's lands bills \nbecame a part of this legislation.\n  These bills have been vetted on the ground by Montana ranchers such \nas Dusty Crary, Karl Rappold, and many others. They have been approved \nby committees and negotiated for many years. They not only deliver on \nour promises to Montana's ranchers but also to the outdoors men and \nwomen, business owners, and Native American tribes. They are Montana-\nmade bills.\n  Take the Rocky Mountain Front Heritage Act for example. This bill \nprotects public access along the Rocky Mountain Front for hunters, \nanglers,\n\n[[Page S6655]]\n\noutdoors men and women. The Front is a special place in Montana lore. \nIt is where the Rocky Mountains shoot straight out from the plains into \nthe sky. It is a breathtaking, magnificent sight.\n  It is an ecosystem like none other in the lower 48 States. The \nheritage act designates 208,000 Front acres as a conservation \nmanagement area, adds another 67,000 acres to the Bob Marshall \nWilderness, and supports a noxious weed management plan.\n  At the same time, it allows for continued grazing access for Montana \nranchers, follows BLM recommendations on approximately 14,000 acres of \nwilderness study areas, and requires new assessments of oil and gas \npotential in two others.\n  Some will question the details of this bill and others in the \npackage, but Montanans know how to responsibly manage our lands. We \nknow what irresponsible development looks like.\n  More than 100 years ago mining corporations pillaged our lands in \ntheir search for copper, silver, and other minerals. Not only did they \nturn our mountains inside out and pollute our waters, they ignored \nworkers' rights and bought influence over Montana's elected leaders.\n  In response, Montana passed legislation to limit corporate influence \nin elections in 1912. We followed that in the 1970s with one of the \nmost progressive State constitutions to date, enshrining protections \nfor a clean and healthy environment into law.\n  A fellow by the name of Max Baucus got his first taste of politics \nduring that Constitutional Convention, the same Max Baucus who worked \non and introduced the Rocky Mountain Front Heritage Act in 2011. \nPassing this land bill helps fulfill Max's legacy in Montana and honors \nthe hard work of his staff and the bill's many supporters.\n  Before Max introduced this bill, he received a letter from a rancher \nalong the Front. Ben Pierce was his name. Ben told Max he wanted to see \nthe Front remain a place with both well-managed working ranches and \nvibrant wildlife values.\n  Ben supported the bill because he knew that preserving the ranching \nculture was critical to Montana's economy and our way of life, but he \nalso supported the bill because he knows we must preserve Montana's \nmost special places.\n  That is because Montana's outdoor treasures are not only symbols of \nour heritage, they are also incredible economic drivers. Montana's \noutdoor economy, thanks to places such as Glacier and Yellowstone, \ncreates or sustains some 64,000 jobs and contributes nearly $6 billion \nto the State's economy every year. That is impressive in a State of \njust 1 million people.\n  From outdoor stores to park cafes, Montana's economy thrives when \nMontana's outdoors are preserved and accessible. Preservation and \naccess are also the cornerstones of the North Fork Protection Act, \nanother legacy of Senator Baucus. The bill permanently protects the \nAmerican side of the North Fork of the Flathead River watershed by \nbarring future mining or drilling.\n\n  The land is adjacent to Glacier National Park. It is bound by snow-\ncapped mountains, ringed by awe-inspiring valleys, and bisected by \nbeautiful blue-green waters that are home to some of the Nation's best \nwhitewater rafting.\n  Its Canadian cousin across the border is already protected. Thanks to \nthis bill, the American side of the watershed will be protected from \noil and gas development forever.\n  Preserving the North Fork is not only good for the wildlife or the \nhiker who enjoys it, it is also good for our economy and our nearby \ncommunities.\n  That is why this bipartisan bill is supported by the local chamber of \ncommerce and by the mayor of nearby Whitefish, who said this bill's \npassage ``means permanent protection of our community's water supply,'' \nand we all know how important water is.\n  These two measures are not the only bills that will benefit Montana \nin this lands package.\n  My Cabin Fee Act provides economic certainty for folks who have seen \ntheir fees skyrocket on Forest Service cabins. Many of these cabins \npass from generation to generation, and this bill makes sure family \ncabins can be enjoyed by those who cherish them.\n  This package also does right by our Native American friends. The \nNorthern Cheyenne Lands Act restores the tribe's mineral rights to \n5,000 acres within its boundaries, strengthening the tribe's control \nover its lands, resources, and trust funds.\n  It corrects an error that was made by the Federal Government more \nthan 100 years ago. That, in and of itself, makes it a worthy endeavor.\n  But there are other areas where we can work together. Just as these \nbills are Montana-made solutions, we can--and I believe we will--come \ntogether over Montana-made solutions to better manage our forests.\n  For decades folks in Montana have argued over our lands, battled over \naccess, and we have fought over resource development. We have sued and \ncountersued over logging, but in Montana we haven't had a new \nwilderness designation in 31 years. Why? Because we haven't been able \nto compromise, but now we have. It means progress for Montana.\n  This agreement is bipartisan, and I was proud to work with Senator \nWalsh and Senator-elect Daines to bring it to reality. I hope we can \nfind more ways to compromise over lands issues and other legislation \nmoving forward because, after all, it is the future that matters most. \nWhether this body is debating immigration reform or an education \nsystem, how to rebuild infrastructure, we must always look to the \nfuture.\n  We want the best for ourselves and for our communities. We want to \nleave this world in better shape than we inherited it, and we want to \npass down our treasured lands and outdoor traditions to our kids and \nour grandkids wherever they may live. Places such as the Rocky Mountain \nFront and the North Fork are living legacies to Montana's greatness.\n  There are many reasons to preserve these places, but the best I have \nheard comes from Gene Sentz, who hails from Choteau, MT. Gene wrote a \nbook about the Rocky Mountain Front. In it he quoted another Montanan \nwho said: ``Some places on Earth should be left alone, even if solid \ngold lies beneath it them.''\n  I couldn't agree more. Montana is home to sky-touching mountains and \nbeautiful plains that roll on as far as the eye can see. It is home to \nmany hard-working men and women and to Native Americans with deep \nconnections to the land.\n  But it is the last best place because we are all of these things and \nbecause we are willing to work together to preserve and strengthen \nthem.\n  I am very proud of this historic agreement, and today I am \nparticularly proud to be a Montanan.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Vietnam Veterans\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I was struck by the last two great \nspeakers, Senator Heinrich and Senator Tester, showing us amazing \npictures of the beauty of the Western part of our wonderful country. I \nthought, well, those are really beautiful pictures--not quite as \nbeautiful as North Dakota, but we will acknowledge that these are areas \nthat will open your soul, open your eyes, and make it possible for you \nto see the beauty that is this great country and the resilience of the \npeople who settled in the areas of the West.\n  It made me think--and I think, more importantly, understand--that all \nof what we are in this country is only possible because men and women, \nfor centuries, have stepped up to serve our country and to serve our \ncountry in the Armed Forces.\n  I rise to talk about an issue that hasn't gotten a lot of attention \nin this country, this quiet thing that is going on in the VFW halls, \nthe AMVETS, the DAVs, and the American Legion halls in my State.\n  I am talking about not only that kind of sacrifice but recognizing \nand moving to a special recognition this year. So I want to talk about \nNorth Dakotans because we are all extraordinarily proud of our States, \nbut we\n\n[[Page S6656]]\n\nknow in North Dakota that North Dakotans have always answered the call \nto serve, in particular, my friends within the Native American \ncommunity, who have answered that call to service in record numbers.\n  I have made it a priority during my time in the Senate to meet as \nmany of my State veterans as I can. I want to hear their stories and I \nwant to learn about the challenges of their everyday lives and what we \nneed to do to fulfill our obligation and our sacred trust to live up to \nthe commitments we made, as they lived up to the commitments they made \nto serve our country and to protect our freedoms on the battlefields \naround the world.\n  Through these trips I have met a lot of wonderful veterans--World War \nII veterans and their proud stories of their service in the Pacific and \nEurope. I have met Korean war veterans with memories of what is often \nreferred to as the forgotten war. It may be forgotten by others, but it \nis not forgotten by me or the people in my great State of North Dakota.\n  Then there are our newest veterans, with new challenges, from the \nconflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the overall war against terror. \nThese young veterans, men and women, face difficult challenges, and I \nthink many different challenges than perhaps their counterparts from \nprevious service relationships. But I think they are helping change the \nway our Nation sees our veterans.\n  All of these veterans, without a doubt, deserve a place of honor in \nour society. All of them served and deserve our thanks for their \nservice and their sacrifice. Together, they have protected our freedoms \nand allowed our Nation to flourish. But today--today--I want to talk \nand focus on America's Vietnam veterans--North Dakota's Vietnam \nveterans.\n  We are in the midst--and I am not sure a lot of people know this--of \na remembrance of the 50-year anniversary of the Vietnam war. On May 25, \n2012, President Obama issued a proclamation. I have the proclamation \nhere. This proclamation was issued to honor our Vietnam vets--those \nbrave servicemen who gave their lives--and their families. It is to \nhonor all the veterans' service, but particularly to recognize those \nwho lost their lives. I want to quote from this proclamation:\n\n       As a grateful Nation, we honor more than 58,000 patriots--\n     their names etched in black granite--\n\n  That monument is not too far from this symbol of American democracy, \nour Nation's Capitol.\n\n     --who sacrificed all they had and all they would ever know. \n     We draw inspiration from the heroes who suffered unspeakably \n     as prisoners of war, yet who returned home with their heads \n     held high. We pledge to keep faith with those who were \n     wounded and still carry the scars of war, seen and unseen.\n\n  This special period of honoring our Vietnam veterans runs through \n2025, since our involvement in the war stretched through 1975. That is \nthe period which we are going to recognize as the 50-year commemoration \nand anniversary as this period continues.\n  It remains important to talk about the Vietnam war and its veterans \nas much as possible. The Vietnam war represents a difficult time in our \nNation's history. By taking time to thank our Vietnam vets and honor \ntheir service, our Nation makes another great attempt to bind up the \nunhealed wounds left behind.\n  In North Dakota, there have already been a number of veterans events \nrelated to the 50th anniversary of Vietnam. I am sure such events are \nhappening in many other States. In fact, there is a Web site--if you \nwant to check it out--where you can look at what is happening in every \nState across the Union honoring Vietnam veterans in ceremonies being \nprepared and mainly driven by veterans groups. Hopefully--and one of \nthe purposes in coming here is to urge my colleagues to participate in \nthose events--to participate as they do every day in saying thank you \nto our Iraqi war vets and our Afghanistan war vets--participate in any \nevent that you can to say thank you to our Vietnam veterans and to the \nfamilies of those people in your State who lost their loved ones in \nservice to their country.\n  For myself, I plan to host an event to honor all Vietnam veterans \nthroughout North Dakota next year. Through this effort I hope to help \nmake our Nation remember and never forget the needs of our Vietnam \nveterans. The Congress needs to make policy decisions so the VA can \nmeet the needs of the next generation of veterans, but we can't forget \nthe unique needs of our Vietnam era veterans.\n  I have spent hours talking to Vietnam veterans who tell me \nrepeatedly: When I got out of the service, the last thing I wanted to \ndo was go to the VA. And there are a lot of reasons for that. In the \n1970s, the VA wasn't a place where people thought they could go for \nquality health care, where they thought they could go for help. They \nwanted to forget that part of their service. So a lot of those unseen \nwounds of servicemen from the Vietnam war went unhealed, and it \nmanifests itself in a high rate of homelessness, a high rate of \npoverty, a high rate of substance abuse, and a high rate of despair.\n  We are seeing now that our Vietnam veterans--in both those who have \nlived incredibly fruitful lives and are now aging into the system--\ncoming back to our VAs across the country, coming back to our \ncommunity-based outreach clinics, coming back to our VA hospitals, and \nfor the first time asking for access to service. They are finding they \ndo not always see the level of service they are entitled to.\n  I recently worked to restore and provide the appropriate paperwork so \na Vietnam veteran who had clearly earned a Purple Heart actually \nreceived the benefits of a recipient of the Purple Heart in the VA. All \nof these issues will now begin to work their way through the VA. They \nwill continue to work their way through our veterans service \norganizations.\n\n  It is time, I think, to take a pause, as the President did in this \nproclamation. And to understand the basis of this, it was required by a \nbill similar to the one we are debating today--NDAA--to begin this \ncommemoration. It was a mandate from this Congress--not this particular \nCongress, but from the U.S. Congress--to begin to have this ceremony.\n  I was struck by the fact that when our veterans have lost their lives \nin Iraq and Afghanistan, most of us have pictures in our offices. We \nhave a poster or some kind of commemoration in our office of that \nsacrifice. Yet we have never seen that kind of commemoration or that \nkind of depiction for our Vietnam veterans. So along with the AMVETS in \nthe great city of Bismarck, which has done tons of research in \ncollecting pictures and collecting images of the 198 veterans, the 198 \nservicemen from North Dakota who lost their lives in Vietnam, I thought \nit an appropriate commemoration for my office to have something that we \nwalk by every day and, therefore, say to the families of all these \nyoung men who are on this poster that every day we honor their \nsacrifice, we honor your loss, and we honor the fact that we will never \nknow what these 198 young men could have been had they survived this \nwar. We don't know if they could have been standing here giving a \nspeech instead of me. We don't know if they would have been mayors of \nour small towns or the industrial leaders who invented a product as \nlucrative and as innovative as the Bobcat, which originated in North \nDakota. It was invented in North Dakota and it is manufactured in North \nDakota. We will never know.\n  But one thing we do know--the one thing we do know--about all of \nthese men is they lost their lives and sacrificed to the greatest \nextent that one can sacrifice in honor and service of this country, and \nthey deserve to have this period of remembrance. They deserve to have a \nrecognition, and their families deserve to have the United States of \nAmerica pause--pause for a period of time to say thank you--thank you \nfrom a grateful nation.\n  So posters like this will be in every one of my offices across North \nDakota and certainly here in the Nation's Capitol. I know for States \nsuch as that of the Presiding Officer's State of Massachusetts, just \nlooking at the numbers, it is probably not possible to have a \nphotographic image of every Vietnam veteran or every person who served \nin Vietnam and who, unfortunately, lost their life, but it is possible \nto have their name. It is possible to have a place of remembrance where \nthey can be honored during this time period mandated by this body and \napproved\n\n[[Page S6657]]\n\nand proclaimed by the President of the United States. It is possible to \nhave a place of honor and remembrance.\n  So I intend, over the next year, to come and talk a little bit about \nthe lives of each one of these young men, to talk about the challenges \nof Vietnam veterans, to talk about what it is we need to do today to \nmake up for past sins of this country in not recognizing this service. \nI challenge the other Members of this body to do the same thing during \nthis period of remembrance and recognition and honor, and to think \nabout not just the past but to think about the future; think about the \namazing sacrifice of 198 North Dakotans who gave their lives in service \nto our State and in service to our country and for the betterment of \nall humankind.\n  With that, Mr. President, the challenge is issued.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/11/senate-section/article/S6657-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6657-S6660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               JUSTICE AGAINST SPONSORS OF TERRORISM ACT\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 560, S. 1535.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1535) to deter terrorism, provide justice for \n     victims, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill, \nwhich had been reported from the Committee on the Judiciary, with an \namendment to strike all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu \nthereof the following:\n\n                                S. 1535\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Justice Against Sponsors of \n     Terrorism Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) International terrorism is a serious and deadly problem \n     that threatens the vital interests of the United States.\n       (2) The Constitution confers upon Congress the power to \n     punish crimes against the law of nations and therefore \n     Congress may by law impose penalties on those who provide \n     material support to foreign organizations engaged in \n     terrorist activity, and allow for victims of international \n     terrorism to recover damages from those who have harmed them.\n       (3) International terrorism affects the interstate and \n     foreign commerce of the United States by harming \n     international trade and market stability, and limiting \n     international travel by United States citizens as well as \n     foreign visitors to the United States.\n       (4) Some foreign terrorist organizations, acting through \n     affiliated groups or individuals, raise significant funds \n     outside of the United States for conduct directed and \n     targeted at the United States.\n       (5) It is necessary to recognize the substantive causes of \n     action for aiding and abetting and conspiracy liability under \n     the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 (22 U.S.C. 5201 et seq.).\n       (6) The decision of the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the District of Columbia in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 \n     (D.C. Cir. 1983), which has been widely recognized as the \n     leading case regarding Federal civil aiding and abetting and \n     conspiracy liability, including by the Supreme Court of the \n     United States, provides the proper legal framework for how \n     such liability should function in the context of the Anti-\n     Terrorism Act of 1987 (22 U.S.C. 5201 et seq.).\n       (7) The United Nations Security Council declared in \n     Resolution 1373, adopted on September 28, 2001, that all \n     countries have an affirmative obligation to ``[r]efrain from \n     providing any form of support, active or passive, to entities \n     or persons involved in terrorist acts,'' and to ``[e]nsure \n     that any person who participates in the financing, planning, \n     preparation or perpetration of terrorist acts or in \n     supporting terrorist acts is brought to justice''.\n       (8) Consistent with these declarations, no country has the \n     discretion to engage knowingly in the financing or \n     sponsorship of terrorism, whether directly or indirectly.\n       (9) Persons, entities, or countries that knowingly or \n     recklessly contribute material support or resources, directly \n     or indirectly, to persons or organizations that pose a \n     significant risk of committing acts of terrorism that \n     threaten the security of nationals of the United States or \n     the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the \n     United States, necessarily direct their conduct at the United \n     States, and should reasonably anticipate being brought to \n     court in the United States to answer for such activities.\n       (10) The United States has a vital interest in providing \n     persons and entities injured as a result of terrorist attacks \n     committed within the United States with full access to the \n     court system in order to pursue civil claims against persons, \n     entities, or countries that have knowingly or recklessly \n     provided material support or resources, directly or \n     indirectly, to the persons or organizations responsible for \n     their injuries.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide civil \n     litigants with the broadest possible basis, consistent with \n     the Constitution of the United States, to seek relief against \n     persons, entities, and foreign countries, wherever acting and \n     wherever they may be found, that have provided material \n     support, directly or indirectly, to foreign organizations or \n     persons that engage in terrorist activities against the \n     United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. FOREIGN SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY.\n\n       Section 1605(a) of title 28, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by amending paragraph (5) to read as follows:\n       ``(5) not otherwise encompassed in paragraph (2), in which \n     money damages are sought against a foreign state arising out \n     of physical injury or death, or damage to or loss of \n     property, occurring in the United States and caused by the \n     tortious act or omission of that foreign state or of any \n     official or employee of that foreign state while acting \n     within the scope of the office or employment of the official \n     or employee (regardless of where the underlying tortious act \n     or omission occurs), including any statutory or common law \n     tort claim arising out of an act of extrajudicial killing, \n     aircraft sabotage, hostage taking, terrorism, or the \n     provision of material support or resources for such an act, \n     or any claim for contribution or indemnity relating to a \n     claim arising out of such an act, except this paragraph shall \n     not apply to--\n       ``(A) any claim based upon the exercise or performance of, \n     or the failure to exercise or perform, a discretionary \n     function, regardless of whether the discretion is abused; or\n       ``(B) any claim arising out of malicious prosecution, abuse \n     of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, \n     interference with contract rights, or any claim for emotional \n     distress or derivative injury suffered as a result of an \n     event or injury to another person that occurs outside of the \n     United States; or''; and\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (d) the following:\n       ``(e) Definitions.--For purposes of subsection (a)(5)--\n       ``(1) the terms `aircraft sabotage', `extrajudicial \n     killing', `hostage taking', and `material support or \n     resources' have the meanings given those terms in section \n     1605A(h); and\n       ``(2) the term `terrorism' means international terrorism \n     and domestic terrorism, as those terms are defined in section \n     2331 of title 18.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. AIDING AND ABETTING LIABILITY FOR CIVIL ACTIONS \n                   REGARDING TERRORIST ACTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 2333 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(d) Liability.--In an action under subsection (a) for an \n     injury arising from an act of international terrorism \n     committed, planned, or authorized by an organization that had \n     been designated as a foreign terrorist organization under \n     section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1189), as of the date on which such act of international \n     terrorism was committed, planned, or authorized, or that was \n     so designated as a result of such act of international \n     terrorism, liability may be asserted as to any person or \n     entity that aided, abetted, or conspired with the person who \n     committed such an act of international terrorism.\n       ``(e) Non-applicability of Law of Preclusion.--Any civil \n     action or claim that seeks recovery under this chapter for \n     conduct that was the basis of a civil action or claim \n     previously dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction \n     for failure to meet the requirements for an exception under \n     section 1605(a) of title 28 is not subject to dismissal under \n     the law of preclusion.''.\n       (b) Effect on Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.--Nothing in \n     the amendments made by this section affects immunity of a \n     foreign state, as that term is defined in section 1603 of \n     title 28, United States Code, from jurisdiction under other \n     law.\n\n     SEC. 5. PERSONAL JURISDICTION FOR CIVIL ACTIONS REGARDING \n                   TERRORIST ACTS.\n\n       Section 2334 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by \n     inserting at the end the following:\n       ``(e) Personal Jurisdiction.--The district courts shall \n     have personal jurisdiction, to the maximum extent permissible \n     under the 5th Amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, over any person who commits or aids and abets an act \n     of international terrorism or otherwise sponsors such act or \n     the person who committed such act, for acts of international \n     terrorism in which any national of the United States suffers \n     injury in his or her person, property, or business by reason \n     of such an act in violation of section 2333.''.\n\n     SEC. 6. LIABILITY FOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN CIVIL ACTIONS \n                   REGARDING TERRORIST ACTS.\n\n       Section 2337 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to \n     read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 2337.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Justice Against Sponsors of \n     Terrorism Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) International terrorism is a serious and deadly problem \n     that threatens the vital interests of the United States.\n       (2) The Constitution confers upon Congress the power to \n     punish crimes against the law of nations and therefore \n     Congress may by law impose penalties on those who provide \n     material support to foreign organizations engaged in \n     terrorist activity, and allow for victims of international \n     terrorism to recover damages from those who have harmed them.\n       (3) International terrorism affects the interstate and \n     foreign commerce of the United States by harming \n     international trade and market stability, and limiting \n     international travel by United States citizens as well as \n     foreign visitors to the United States.\n       (4) Some foreign terrorist organizations, acting through \n     affiliated groups or individuals, raise significant funds \n     outside of the United States for conduct directed and \n     targeted at the United States.\n       (5) It is necessary to recognize the substantive causes of \n     action for aiding and abetting and conspiracy liability under \n     the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 (22 U.S.C. 5201 et seq.).\n       (6) The decision of the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the District of Columbia in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 \n     (D.C. Cir. 1983), which has been widely recognized as the \n     leading case regarding Federal civil aiding and abetting and \n     conspiracy liability, including by the Supreme Court of the \n     United States, provides the proper legal framework for how \n     such liability should function in the context of the Anti-\n     Terrorism Act of 1987 (22 U.S.C. 5201 et seq.).\n       (7) The United Nations Security Council declared in \n     Resolution 1373, adopted on September 28, 2001, that all \n     countries have an affirmative obligation to ``[r]efrain from \n     providing any form of support, active or passive, to entities \n     or persons involved in terrorist acts,'' and to ``[e]nsure \n     that any person who participates in the financing, planning, \n     preparation or perpetration of terrorist acts or in \n     supporting terrorist acts is brought to justice''.\n       (8) Consistent with these declarations, no country has the \n     discretion to engage knowingly in the financing or \n     sponsorship of terrorism, whether directly or indirectly.\n       (9) Persons, entities, or countries that knowingly or \n     recklessly contribute material support or resources, directly \n     or indirectly, to persons or organizations that pose a \n     significant risk of committing acts of terrorism that \n     threaten the security of nationals of the United States or \n     the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the \n     United States, necessarily direct their conduct at the United \n     States, and should reasonably anticipate being brought to \n     court in the United States to answer for such activities.\n       (10) The United States has a vital interest in providing \n     persons and entities injured as a result of terrorist attacks \n     committed within the United States with full access to the \n     court system in order to pursue civil claims against persons, \n     entities, or countries that have knowingly or recklessly \n     provided material support or resources, directly or \n     indirectly, to the persons or organizations responsible for \n     their injuries.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide civil \n     litigants with the broadest possible basis, consistent with \n     the Constitution of the United States, to seek relief against \n     persons, entities, and foreign countries, wherever acting and \n     wherever they may be found, that have provided material \n     support, directly or indirectly, to foreign organizations or \n     persons that engage in terrorist activities against the \n     United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Madam President, I rise today on a very important \nbipartisan bill that has just been approved by this body unanimously, \nthe Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA.\n  I thank my cosponsor and partner in this and many other issues, I am \nhappy to say, Senator Cornyn, the Senator from Texas; and I thank \nChairman Leahy, our chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Under his \nleadership, it has twice been passed by the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  I feel so strongly about this bill because it would allow the victims \nof 9/11 to pursue some small measure of justice by giving them a legal \navenue to hold foreign sponsors of terrorism accountable for their \nactions. This bill, quite simply, does right by the 9/11 victims.\n  We New Yorkers can never forget the terrible day 13 years ago when \nterrorists attacked our city and murdered more than 2,700 of our \nfriends, neighbors, and relatives. We were shocked and our hearts were \nbroken. The whole Nation mourned with us.\n  But I am proud to say that New York--and America--came back stronger \nafter that horrific attack. I am also proud to say that Congress and \nPresidents Bush and Obama have been there to help New York heal, but \nnever forget.\n  From the first days after 9/11, it has always been the families of \nthose we lost who have been at the vanguard of advocacy. The families \nhave accomplished so much along the way in terms of remembrance, and \njustice and change in national security policies. I so salute them, not \nonly those who worked with me on this legislation but all the families \nwho have worked on so many bills.\n  When something so evil and so terrible befalls you--when you lose a \nloved one through an abject act of evil, such as was committed on 9/11/\n2001--the natural reaction is to curse the dark, to say: Why me? Why \nwas this so unjust? But the Bible tells us that it is the great part of \nhumanity, almost saint-like, to light a candle, to try and rectify the \ninjustice that you can never undo for the loved one you lost but might \nundo for others.\n  These families--and I know them well. I have cried with them, worked \nwith them, and struggled with them--have all lit candles. They are \namazing. They are saint-like. And there are so many families and loved \nones who have stepped up and petitioned for help after 9/11. As I said, \nit would be easy for them to sit and curse the dark, but they have \ninstead chosen to light that candle and shine a way forward--not back. \nThe bill I hope the Senate will pass today helps victims of terrorism \nseek justice, one of our most cherished American values.\n  Let me tell you about Ms. Terry Strada, who is seeking justice for \nher husband Tom. Tom lost his life in the north tower on September 11. \nTerry didn't just lose a husband, she lost a father to a young son of \n7, a daughter of 4, and a newborn baby boy. She lost a loving father \nand her best friend.\n  But Terry Strada is strong. She is a profile in courage, and she \nseeks what we all would be compelled to seek if we suffered such loss \nat the hands of hate and evil. She seeks justice.\n  Terry and her three children have championed this bill for over a \ndecade now. I thank them and all the other families for their tireless \nadvocacy and patience.\n  Of course, no amount of compensation will ever repair the broken \nhearts of a family who lost a loved one to mindless hate. But right now \nthese families are being denied the ability to hold accountable foreign \nsponsors of terrorism because of a major loophole in our legal system.\n  The courts in New York have dismissed the 9/11 victims' claims \nagainst certain foreign entities alleged to have helped fund the 9/11 \nattacks. The courts are following what I believe is a nonsensical \nreading of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. But for the sake of \nthese families, I want to make clear, without a shadow of a doubt, that \nevery entity, including foreign states, will be held accountable if \nthey are found to be sponsors of heinous acts such as 9/11.\n  Our bipartisan legislation that Senator Cornyn and I are so proud to \nsupport closes that loophole and amends the Foreign Sovereign Immunity \nAct to allow victims and their families to sue foreign states and \nfinancial partners of terrorism.\n  Terrorists need an unfathomable amount of hate in them--but they also \nneed a great deal of money and material support--to carry out attacks \nsuch as what occurred on 9/11. And, unfortunately, some countries \nprovide that lifeblood with no legal repercussions.\n  For countries to aid the evil of terrorism and walk away scot-free \nwhile families suffer silently every day with the loss of loved ones is \nwrong, it is unfair, and it is unjust. It adds insult to an \nunimaginable injury to these families.\n  JASTA, our bill, hopefully to become law soon, will finally help the \nvictims of 9/11 pursue justice by allowing them to sue countries that \nfund terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda. The Foreign Sovereign Immunity \nAct has been amended, and amended again, in its relatively short life, \nin order to continue to strike the proper balance between our interests \nabroad and the rights of our citizens to obtain redress when they are a \nvictim of wrongdoing, no matter who the perpetrator is.\n  Specifically, our bill brings the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act \ncloser to that balance by ensuring that victims of terror inside the \nUnited States receive the same protections of victims of terror outside \nthe United States; that liability clearly exists for aiders and \nabettors of terrorism; and that foreign states that commit terrorist \nacts can be held accountable under the Anti-Terrorism Act.\n  Cognizant of that ideal balance I just mentioned, we have extended \nlegal protections for victims and expanded liability in a very focused \nway.\n  In response to concerns from the business community as well as \nMembers of Congress, we have made substantial changes to the bill so \nthat those who are liable under the changes to the Foreign Sovereign \nImmunity Act are only the really bad actors.\n  We have worked hard so this bipartisan bill enhances the original aim \nof the Foreign Service Immunity Act: to create a uniform and \npredictable means for protecting the immunity of sovereign states with \nlimited exceptions that are consistent with our own national, as well \nas international, norms.\n  JASTA is a long overdue fix--a responsible fix--to a law that has \nextended too large a shield to foreign actors who finance and enable \nterrorism on a massive scale. The victims of 9/11 and other terrorist \nattacks have suffered such pain--physical pain and heartache--but they \nwill not be denied justice.\n  The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act will take measured \nsteps toward making sure these bad actors are held accountable and that \nvictims can pursue justice where justice is to be had. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues to see that it becomes law.\n  I know Senator Cornyn will want to say a few words, but first I wish \nto enter into a colloquy with my friend from Texas because it is \nimportant to underscore one point: The purpose of the Justice Against \nSponsors of Terrorism Act is to hold foreign sponsors of terrorism that \ntarget the United States accountable in Federal courts.\n  One thing that has come up in our discussions of this bill is whether \nthe bill's provisions would extend civil liability under the Anti-\nTerrorism Act to situations where someone has been forced to make \npayments or provide aid to a foreign terrorist organization under \ngenuine duress or, for example, as ransom payments for the release of \nsomeone taken hostage. This type of conduct is outside the scope of \ntraditional aiding and abetting liability, and our bill does not seek \nto change that.\n  I recognize Senator Cornyn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I thank the senior Senator from New \nYork, my friend, Senator Schumer, for working on this bipartisan \nlegislation. It is a good example of the kinds of things we can do \nworking together. Even though he and I come from different parts of the \ncountry and different political parties, he has been a good partner on \na number of things that we have worked on together, and I am hoping we \nare setting in place some good habits that will continue on in the next \nCongress.\n\n[[Page S6660]]\n\n  I agree with Senator Schumer that JASTA is a good example of the kind \nof good work we can do together to solve problems facing our Nation. \nThis bill passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee without \nopposition because of the careful work we were able to do to ensure the \nbill accomplished its goals while addressing concerns about unintended \nconsequences.\n  So I appreciate our work together and look forward to continuing both \nfor the duration of the 113th Congress and the 114th Congress.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank Senator Cornyn for his good work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/11/senate-section/article/S6660-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6660-S6665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PROTECTING VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS AND EMERGENCY RESPONDERS ACT OF \n                            2014--Continued\n\n\n                               Dodd-Frank\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. The House is now considering the funding bill for fiscal \nyear 2015, and the risks of not passing it are extremely high. But \ntucked into this must-pass bill is yet another attempt by Republicans \nin the House of Representatives to gut Dodd-Frank. What is really scary \nabout this is that this is just the beginning. We can expect much more \nof this in the 114th Congress.\n  Dodd-Frank was designed to reduce the systemic risks that large banks \nposed to our financial system. It was meant to prevent another taxpayer \nbailout of these massive institutions that were and continue to be too \nbig to fail. By chipping away at Dodd-Frank we are once again letting \nspecial interests prevail over the safety of the financial system and \nprotection for consumers.\n  There were many roots of the financial crisis, but economists agree \nthat the unregulated and pervasive trading of derivatives was a major \ncontributing factor. We permitted financial institutions to gamble and \nregulators looked the other way. When these financial institutions made \nbad bets and nearly took down the financial system, we had to bail them \nout on the taxpayers' dime. Working families who are struggling in a \nslow economic recovery are still paying the price.\n  So one of the goals of Dodd-Frank was to get the banks to go back to \ndoing the normal business of banks--to collect deposits and extend \ncredit. That means no longer allowing banks to leverage FDIC-insured \ndeposits and their access to the Federal Reserve for speculative trade. \nIn part, Dodd-Frank accomplished this through the swap push-out rule. \nThe swap push-out rule, which is section 716 of Dodd-Frank, makes \nfederally insured institutions move their swap trades into a separate \nuninsured entity that does not have access to the Federal Reserve \ndiscount window or other fed assistance. These trades are incredibly \ncomplex and risky, and there is no public policy justification for the \ngovernment to effectively subsidize them.\n  Before we even passed section 716, the biggest financial institutions \nwere able to water it down. They wanted exemptions for swaps for \n``hedging purposes'' which could be interpreted to mean a wide range of \nactivity. But that was not enough. Now they want to do away with \nsection 716 by making the exemptions so broad that the rule becomes \nmeaningless.\n  Let's be very clear. This change primarily benefits the five biggest \nfinancial firms in the country. They account for well over 90 percent \nof swap transactions. These activities net them over $4 billion in \nprofits. Before the crisis, swaps brought in over $7 billion. One of \nthese firms actually wrote the language in the House bill. These \nfinancial institutions and their lobbyists know what they are doing, \nand they are doing just fine. They know that when something as \nimportant as funding of the government is on the line, they can \nconvince Republicans to slip their priorities into a must-pass bill at \nthe last hour. But again, this is just the beginning. Make no mistake \nabout it. This portends much worse things when it comes to the \nRepublicans taking over the majority in the Senate and the 114th \nCongress.\n  This is a big problem because we have been down this path before. We \nknow where it leads. We let risk build in our financial system before, \nand the fallout was disastrous for our economy and the well-being of \nworking families. It is on us to hold back against special interests. \nWe have a responsibility to protect the public from this attempt to \nroll back Dodd-Frank. We cannot take our eye off the ball. We have to \ncontinue to guard against systemic risks in our financial system, and \nwe have to put a stop to the practice of holding the government hostage \nover the pet issues of special interest groups.\n  The House is in a recess subject to the call of the Chair, and they \nare trying to round up votes for the omnibus spending bill which \ncontains this provision. But they have another option. They can strip \nthis provision. If they find that they don't have sufficient votes, \nthey don't have to pass a 3-month continuing resolution. They can \nsimply remove this provision from the omnibus bill which was negotiated \nin good faith with both parties in both chambers. Remove this \nprovision, and I have no doubt we will have a resounding bipartisan \nsupermajority in both Chambers. We should remove section 716, and pass \nthe omnibus properly.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BOOKER. I really appreciate the words of Senator Schatz, which \nare spot-on. People are so frustrated right now with Congress, and it \ndoes not take a Ph.D. in political science to figure out why common \nAmericans of all backgrounds are frustrated with Congress. It is \nbecause people are frustrated with business as usual here in the Senate \nand the House. In this case, as Senator Schatz points to, here we are \nat the end of the 113th Congress facing a $1 trillion spending bill--a \nbill with funding that is critical to our national defense. It is \ncritical to the health and well-being of Americans. It is critical to \nthe strength of our community.\n  I know the sincerity and passion with which Senate and House \nnegotiators have been working to get this done. They have been focusing \non making sure the American public has those critical services that we \nneed. I give tribute to many of the leadership in this body for working \non it. Senate leaders should get credit, also--Barbara Mikulski for \nholding the line on so many critical priorities, for putting in this \ntrillion dollar spending plan some very important items that should \narouse the gratitude of many people. They also stood up against, \nfought, and prevented from getting into this some very extreme \nproposals. But to the many people watching this unfold in New Jersey, \nin Hawaii, and across this country, what they are also seeing, \nunfortunately, is a bill passed with policies pushed by very connected \nspecial interests--special interests with armies of high paid lobbyists \nlooking out for their own protection. There are special interests with \narmies of high-paid lobbyists looking out for their own protections and \nlooking to roll back commonsense protections for people who cannot hire \nthose high-priced lobbyists or make donations to political candidates \nand elected officials.\n\n  This omnibus--this CRromnibus, as it is called--is a jagged, bitter \npill for anyone to swallow.\n  I will start with the provision that Senator Schatz mentioned, the \nprovision that is rolling back aspects of Dodd-Frank. Risky \ntransactions involving asset-backed derivatives were at the heart of a \n2008 fiscal crisis. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas \nestimated that the financial crisis cost the United States between $6 \nand $14 trillion. This amounts to $50,000 to $120,000 for every U.S. \nhousehold or the equivalent of 40 to 90 percent of 1 year's economic \noutput. It was cataclysmic.\n  I don't need economists to describe the pain that Americans felt. I \nsaw it myself. I felt it as a mayor of a big city in America--Newark, \nNJ--New Jersey's largest city. When the Nation goes through a \nrecession, rural and urban areas, vulnerable populations, people living \nat the margins go through a cataclysmic depression. Many Americans,\n\n[[Page S6661]]\n\neven today, remain unemployed or underemployed and are still struggling \nto make ends meet because of the risky behaviors we saw within the \nfinancial industry.\n  Now, Dodd-Frank--this Wall Street protection act--was passed to \nenhance consumer protection and increase safeguards against risky \nactivities so we, as a country, do not go through this again. Dodd-\nFrank is not perfect. I am the first to admit there are ways to change \nit and improve it and implement its provisions, frankly, that still \nhave yet to be fully implemented.\n  Changes to financial regulations should be done through a much more \ntransparent process and in the public eye. We should openly debate \nthese issues on the floor of the House and the Senate. It should not be \ndone like this was, behind closed doors and definitely through what \nthey call a must-pass omnibus bill. This is wrong.\n  Here we are in the last moments on an omnibus spending bill with a \nprovision which goes to the heart of protecting American taxpayers from \nthe risky, reckless schemes that helped to launch the crisis in the \nfirst place.\n  This provision is literally called the Prohibition Against the \nFederal Government Bailouts of Swap Entities, which ensures taxpayer \ndollars will not be used for the more risky Wall Street speculation and \ngambling. It looks to make sure that Americans are on the hook for the \nrisky gambling of a few people seeking to make extraordinary gains.\n  I am outraged. I am frustrated that we are not on the floor debating \nthis, and, instead, are having this put into a bill that everyone says \nmust pass.\n  There are arguments on both sides that we should be having. If the \nprovisions of Dodd-Frank come up, we should discuss them. The public \nshould see it and know about it.\n  I will not condemn the entire financial services industry, and, \nindeed, we need in this country a robust network of financial \ninstitutions that support the vibrant economic activity in the United \nStates. However, we must ensure that the necessary and important \nprotections that shield taxpayers and our economy from the failures of \n2008 remain in place.\n  I rebuke the slick and secretive ways that this has been done, and I \nwill echo the concerns of people all over New Jersey that this kind of \nbusiness as usual must end.\n  But there are other concerns that should be out in the public eye. \nTake, for example, truck safety. There is this ``hours of service'' \nlanguage which protects America's highways, but now the language that \nprotects us has been changed and altered in this bill. It was inserted \nthrough the appropriations process. This language suspends the \nadministration's rules designed to prevent driver fatigue.\n  I will read from the rule that is now being suspended under the \nomnibus. It states:\n\n       Only drivers who drive nights and work more than 60 or 70 \n     hours in a week will be impacted. . . . Drivers who will be \n     impacted by this provision work heavy and irregular schedules \n     that include some nighttime driving. . . . The limitation \n     reduces maximum time during which a driver may drive up to an \n     average of 70 hours in 7 days, a decrease from the 82-hour \n     average allowed under the 2003 rule . . . Working long daily \n     and weekly hours on a continuing basis is associated with \n     chronic fatigue, a high risk of crashes, and a number of \n     serious chronic health conditions.\n\n  These right here are commonsense rules put in place to protect \nAmericans who are driving to and from work with their families or to \nchurch to protect them against these heavy, irregular vehicles \nbarrelling down the highway that might now have an overfatigued driver.\n\n  These regulations were put in place to try to limit those drivers \nfrom straining human endurance, but now they are being suspended within \nthis omnibus bill.\n  These rules are based on years of sound scientific study, and I am \noutraged that despite the efforts of my colleagues and the safety \ncommunity, the provisions to suspend these safety rules were included \nin this omnibus bill.\n  Each year nearly 4,000 Americans are killed in truck accidents, and \nover 100,000 Americans are injured on our highways in truck accidents. \nThese drivers who drive trucks are hard-working men and women, and they \nhave, unfortunately, been pushed to tread on the limits of human \nendurance.\n  The number of fatalities caused by truck accidents has risen 16 \npercent since 2009, and the number of people injured in these crashes \nhas increased 40 percent. At a time when accidents are on such a savage \nrise, we are in no position to be crippling existing safety measures \ndesigned to keep our roads safe. For the sake of our Nation's security \nand the untold anguish and loss that comes from these highway \naccidents, this provision should be taken out of the bill.\n  There is more in this omnibus, and I feel compelled to mention \nanother objectionable thing. The very idea of taxation without \nrepresentation and self-determination is at the core of our democratic \nideals as a nation. Yet, despite this, Washington, DC, with a \npopulation larger than two of our States, sees the constant undermining \nof this very principle. I believe it is an offense to Americans of all \nStates, to Americans in the District of Columbia, and to all those who \nbelieve in our cherished ideals that this is done so.\n  When the District of Columbia votes, just as in Colorado, Washington, \nOregon, and Alaska, to change marijuana laws--when Washington, DC, is \ngrappling with the devastating impact of the drug war and sees the pain \nand the challenges and the struggles involved therein, when the people \nof the District come together and decide to try a different way \nforward--should we not honor their results? Should we not respect their \nself-determination as is going on in other States? This provision in \nthis omnibus, undermining the democratic will of the District of \nColumbia--these great Americans--should be taken out.\n  My list of concerns in this bill could go on. I could continue. We \nshould be having a discussion and debate on issues of this magnitude.\n  Take, for example, the rules on pensions that will slash benefits for \nthousands of retirees. Make no mistake. We need to address the state of \nmulti-employer pension plans, and we need to discuss the tough choices \nthat have to be made, but this is not the way to do it--not business as \nusual with no discussion and no debate.\n  This bill also includes provisions that roll back protections for \nwildlife and endangered species. This is not how we should do this--\nbusiness as usual with no discussion and no debate it.\n  There are provisions that keep the USDA from addressing an array of \nfraudulent, deceptive, anticompetitive, and retaliatory practices which \nwill now undermine important protections for farmers against unfair \npractices. This is not the way to do it--business as usual, no \ndiscussion, no debate.\n  When people wonder how Washington does things in such a manner that \nis skewed in favor of the connected, skewed in favor of high-priced \nlobbyists, and skewed in favor special interests, when they see how the \ncommon good and common sense gets undermined, this is how it happens. \nThis is how it happens.\n  I have been in this body for a little over 12 months, and the way we \nare doing this is offensive. The American people deserve better. We \nshould do better.\n  I object to so much being put in this that deserves to be on this \nfloor, discussed and debated in the light of the public. This is no way \nto run the globe's greatest democracy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                   Tribute to Kelly McKellogg Swaine\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask that my colleagues join me in \nthanking my State Department foreign policy fellow, Kelly McKellogg \nSwain, for her exemplary service to the Senate and to wish her well as \nshe returns to the State Department as her fellowship in my office \ncomes to an end.\n  I think the Presiding Officer would agree with me that, the fellows \nprogram we have here in the Senate is so valuable. We get people who \nare real experts in their areas from the State Department who serve in \nour office and can advise us and work with us and give us the expertise \nwe need in order to make the right policy.\n  I think it also helps the State Department because they will have an \nindividual on their staff who will have a better working understanding \nas to\n\n[[Page S6662]]\n\nhow the Senate operates so that the Senate and the State Department can \nwork closer together on the foreign policy considerations of our \ncountry. That has certainly been my experience during this past year \nwith Kelly.\n  Kelly has been an incredibly valuable member of my staff, advising us \non so many important issues that we have to deal with, and she has \nreally stepped in to be a valuable member of my staff.\n  The uncertain working hours has placed a strain on her family, and I \nthank her very much for being willing to entertain these long hours.\n  I wish to take this opportunity to thank her husband Brian and son \nFinley for sharing her with the Senate.\n  Kelly has been a key member of my foreign policy and national \nsecurity team over the last year. Before she joined my office, she was \nthe Deputy Director in the Office of Public Affairs in the Bureau of \nEast Asian and Pacific Affairs at the U.S. Department of State.\n  She brought her expertise in matters pertaining to East Asia and the \nPacific, and her expertise and counsel has been critical to me. Over \nthe last 2 years, I have chaired the East Asian and Pacific Affairs \nSubcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  This has been a particularly busy year, as President Obama has moved \nforward on his policy to rebalance Asia, recognizing that Asia is \ncritically important to the United States for our security interests, \nour economic interests, and our environmental interests. Kelly has been \nan extremely important part of our team, working on the East Asian and \nPacific Affairs Subcommittee in carrying out that responsibility during \nthis past year.\n  Kelly's hard work enabled us to hold five subcommittee hearings \nranging from ``Economic Engagement in the Asia Pacific'' to ``Combating \nForce Labor and Modern Day Slavery in East Asia and the Pacific.'' In \naddition to developing and executing my subcommittee agenda, she \nensured that I was up-to-date on the latest regional developments and \nmore than adequately prepared for office visits with foreign officials \non my trips to the region. So she gave me the expertise I needed.\n  During this past year, we have had significant challenges in East \nAsia. We have had maritime security issues involving China and Vietnam. \nWe have had the current crisis in Hong Kong. We have had North Korea \nand the problems it has created. We have had the relationship between \ntwo of our close allies that have been strained--Japan and the Republic \nof Korea. In each of these instances, Kelly gave me the type of help I \nneeded so the Senate was properly exercising its functions on foreign \npolicy.\n  Kelly's outstanding work does not stop there. When my permanent \nforeign policy adviser went on maternity leave this summer, Kelly \nstepped into that role. Within the first few weeks of her expanded \nrole, Malaysian Air flight 17 was shot down in Ukraine, Israel and \nHamas went to war, and militants for the Islamic State in Iraq and ISIL \nterrorist groups were expanding their siege over Iraq and Syria. All \nthat happened when my staff person went on maternity leave, and Kelly \nstepped right in and took on the responsibilities and helped our office \nmeet our responsibilities. This summer was a particularly busy and \nchallenging time around the world, and not surprisingly Kelly rose to \nthe occasion.\n  This fall I had a chance to get to know Kelly even better when I went \nto the United Nations General Assembly in my capacity as the United \nNations delegate. I represented the Senate along with Senator Johnson \nat the 69th session of the United Nations General Assembly. Kelly not \nonly accompanied me for the trip and prepared me for all of my high-\nlevel meetings, but she also became a trusted adviser. As I told my \ncolleagues just a little while ago, as I walked through the halls of \nthe United Nations, my ego was a little bit affected because more \npeople knew Kelly than knew me, but that was all right. She was \nincredibly important to me in carrying out my responsibilities in the \nU.S. delegation to the United Nations. While Kelly came to the Senate \nwith a background in East Asia and Pacific matters, she has \ndemonstrated to me and to the Senate, too, that her foreign policy \nextends far beyond that region.\n  My staff and I will miss Kelly's calm demeanor, sense of humor, and \nextraordinary work ethic. She has been a tremendous asset not just to \nmy office but to the Foreign Relations Committee and the entire Senate. \nI urge my colleagues to join me in thanking Kelly for her long service \nto our Nation. We are fortunate to have such people devote their life \nto public service. It has been incredibly helpful to us in the Senate \nand I know she is going to go back to the State Department and continue \nto serve her country. I thank her.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nomination of Carolyn Colvin\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I wish to take a few minutes to speak \nabout the nomination of Carolyn Colvin to be the Commissioner of the \nSocial Security Administration.\n  In recent weeks a number of disturbing facts have come to light about \nMs. Colvin and her tenure as the Acting Social Security Commissioner. \nThese revelations, coupled with the fact that there is an ongoing \ninvestigation of the conduct of people in her immediate office, raise \nserious questions about whether she is qualified to serve in this \nposition.\n  Let me make one thing clear. My doubts about Ms. Colvin's nomination \nhave nothing to do with partisanship. I, along with 20 of my colleagues \non the Senate Finance Committee, voted to report her nomination out of \nthe committee in September. At that time I believed she had the \nnecessary qualifications for the job and saw no reason to oppose her \nnomination. I have to say I liked her personally, but as I said, since \nthat time, new facts have come to light that are extremely \ndisconcerting.\n  Just days before Ms. Colvin appeared before the Finance Committee, we \nbecame aware of allegations concerning potential waste and \nmismanagement at the SSA, as well as allegations regarding the possible \ncoverup of that waste and mismanagement. Several sources, including the \nHouse Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security and the House \nOversight and Government Reform Committee, and individual \nwhistleblowers reported that SSA had, over a 6-year period, burned \nthrough $300 million in a failed attempt to develop and implement the \nDisability Case Processing System or DCPS.\n  These sources derived their information from a report issued in June \nby a private contractor commissioned by SSA. This report was \nsubsequently provided to Congress by SSA whistleblowers.\n  According to the report, mismanagement and poor planning at the SSA \nstalled the development of the DCPS. This, in turn, resulted in the \nsubstantial waste of taxpayer dollars.\n  Once again, the amount was, I am informed, roughly $300 million. \nThese allegations were just breaking when Ms. Colvin appeared before \nthe Finance Committee, but I did mention them during the hearing.\n  Needless to say, as we have learned more details about the failure \nsurrounding the DCPS, the picture has only gotten even cloudier. At a \nminimum, these allegations call into question the quality of SSA's \noverall management and the leadership skills of those managing the \nagency. It certainly calls into question their commitment to preventing \nwaste and preserving SSA's already scarce resources.\n  Sadly, it gets worse. On July 23, 2014, the House Committee on \nOversight and Government Reform sent a letter to Ms. Colvin that raised \neven more issues about the failures of SSA, partially under Ms. \nColvin's leadership as Acting Commissioner, including possible actions \nby agency officials designed to intentionally mislead Congress and the \nIG's office about the deficiencies and the development of the DCPS. \nIndeed, the allegation is that Congress may have been intentionally \nmisled so as to facilitate approval of Ms. Colvin's nomination to be \nthe next Social Security Administration Commissioner.\n  Subsequently, on November 18, 2014, a press release from the House \nWays\n\n[[Page S6663]]\n\nand Means Subcommittee on Social Security indicated that the ``results \nof a criminal investigation regarding the implementation of DCPS is \nstill pending.''\n  In addition, whistleblowers have informed the Senate Finance \nCommittee that the ongoing IG investigation has centered on high-level \nofficials at the SSA, including members of Ms. Colvin's immediate \noffice, and that alleged criminal conduct may extend to irregularities \nin the award of contracts for the DCPS project. This is a serious \nproblem. I do not know how the Senate can with good conscience vote to \nconfirm anyone with this type of ongoing investigation going on around \ntheir immediate office. It may very well turn out that Ms. Colvin did \nnothing wrong, but we need to know for sure.\n\n  This is a very important position. That is why I, along with all of \nthe Republican members of the Senate Finance Committee, sent a letter \nto Ms. Colvin last week asking for more details about the DCPS and her \noffice's conduct. She has since responded claiming that she is not \nresponsible for any mismanagement of the DCPS project and that she \ncommitted no criminal conduct. As I said, that may very well be the \ncase. I hope it is. But the specter of an ongoing investigation still \nhangs over her nomination; therefore, I do not believe the Senate \nshould proceed toward confirming her until this matter is resolved. I \nwant to be fair to her, but this is an important problem that needs to \nbe resolved.\n  I want to make one thing clear: This is about more than just \nmismanagement of funds or bureaucratic incompetence; this is about an \nongoing investigation of people in Ms. Colvin's direct office for \ncontract issues and allegations that they purposefully misled Congress \nin order to move her nomination through.\n  Once again, this is not partisan. I supported Ms. Colvin's nomination \nin committee and continue to believe she has the right credentials and \nexperience for this important job. Of course, if these allegations \nprove to be true, my assessment of her qualifications will most \ncertainly change.\n  Put simply, with this investigation--which may very well have a \ncriminal element to it--still ongoing, I cannot support moving forward \non Carolyn Colvin's nomination. I hope this matter can be resolved \nquickly and cleanly, but until such time, I plan to vote against \nconfirming her as the next Social Security Commissioner unless we \nresolve these matters beforehand.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Rural Health Care\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I have visited hospitals many times in our \nState. In fact, there are 128 community hospitals in Kansas, and I have \nvisited each and every one of them once and, in many instances, two or \nthree times. In fact, last weekend while I was home in Kansas, I \nvisited my hometown hospital, Mercy, in Manhattan, KS.\n  It is a very useful exercise. I would encourage my colleagues to \nspend time with health care providers. In the case of hospitals, it \ngives you the opportunity to visit with hospital administrators, the \nCEOs, the opportunity to visit with the nurses, patients, with \nphysicians, and get a feel for what is going on in the delivery of \nhealth care in your State. I certainly know how valuable that is to me.\n  One of the interests I have in serving in Congress is a belief that \nthe way we live our lives at home in Kansas is something very special, \nand it is something that is worth trying to make certain is around for \nmany years to come--in fact, for generations to come.\n  One of my early conclusions, in looking at public policy and looking \nat the future of the communities of Kansas and the people who live \nthere, is the access to health care, to affordable health care, is \ncritical. It is a component in which many communities will not continue \nto exist if there is not access to hospital care, a physician, a \nhometown pharmacy--all the things that make up the opportunity for \nsomeone to be cared for in every aspect of their lives related to their \nhealth. I know this from my own circumstance, my hometown of Plainville \nwith a population of about 2,000.\n  My parents called Plainville home into their nineties. My parents are \nno longer living, but I know well before the time in which they passed, \nmy sister and I would have had a conversation with my parents talking \nabout: Mom, Dad, I am sorry, but you need to move, and you need to move \nwhere you can have adequate health care. You need to move where there \nis a good hospital and a set of physicians who will care for you.\n  But because that exists in my hometown and continues to exist in my \nhometown, those kinds of conversations are not necessary. Wherever the \nplace that you are telling your parents they have to move to access \nhealth care--wherever that place is--and it may be a very desirable \nplace, but it is not home. My parents would have lived someplace in \nwhich they had not lived all of their lives, would not have been \nsurrounded by the people they know and who knew them--particularly as \nthey lived, my dad, until the age of 98. They would not have had the \npeople who checked in on them, made sure they were doing OK each and \nevery day, gave them the opportunity to continue to live at home, the \npeople who would have given them a hug and a pat, and the pharmacist \nwho said to my dad: Ray, you probably need to have your blood pressure \ntaken. Those are very special things about many places many of us come \nfrom.\n  In the absence of those kinds of opportunities for health care, our \ncommunities--certainly across my State and across the country--\nespecially in rural America begin to disappear, the point being that in \nthe absence of access to health care, the ability to keep a community \ntogether to encourage senior citizens to remain at home in their \nhometowns and for us to be able to recruit and encourage young families \nto move to our communities is not going to happen, is not going to be \navailable, unless we have access to health care.\n  In the discussions I have with those health care providers, the \ndoctors, the nurses, the CEOs, the administrators of the hospital--\nincluding the patients--they continued to remind me that what is going \non in our Nation's Capitol, in Congress, and certainly in the \nadministration, are barriers, are burdens to the chances of that \nhospital and those health care providers continuing to be in business.\n  Every visit involves the raising of concerns to me. Often it is: What \nyou are doing about this, Senator Moran? What are you doing to reduce \nthe Federal regulatory burden that our hospital faces? Are you working \nto make certain we are able to provide the health care our local \nresidents need?\n  Last month I introduced legislation that was bipartisan, a resolution \nthat unanimously passed the Senate. It recognized the importance of \naccess to hospitals and other health care providers, particularly in \nrural areas of our country. It indicated how special they were and how \nimportant they were to the success and survival of the communities in \nour country.\n  The point I would make about that resolution is it passed \nunanimously. While the importance of rural providers is overwhelmingly \nacknowledged, as evidenced by the unanimous passage of that resolution, \nthe Affordable Care Act and unnecessarily burdensome Federal \nregulations fail to demonstrate that we follow through on that \nunderstanding of the importance of hometown health care.\n\n  Among the regulatory concerns I hear about in those hospital visits, \nserious flaws with what is called RAC, the Medicare Recovery Audit \nContractor Program, is it is causing many problems for hospitals and \nproviders across Kansas.\n  Our hospitals and health care providers have been required to divert \nsignificant resources away from caring for patients, their mission to \nappeal incorrect audit decisions that are almost always ultimately \noverturned through an appeals process. This broken RAC Program places a \ntremendous burden on the providers, and it has created a 2-year appeal \nin backlogs within the Department of Health and Human Services. This \nprogram diverts the resources hospitals are devoting to caring for \npatients, to going through the\n\n[[Page S6664]]\n\nprocess of trying to get their money back. That is certainly a problem \nand increasing the expense of providing health care. But the other \naspect of that is often the hospital's money is tied up for 2 years, \nheld by CMS, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, while it \nis adjudicated. Again, the overwhelming number of cases is decided \nultimately in favor of the hospital, but it is certainly diverting \nresources and increasing costs.\n  I met with Secretary Burwell at Health and Human Services to discuss \nwhat is an urgent need to improve the Medicare RAC Program. I have \nrequested from HHS a timeline and objectives, measurable objectives, to \naddress the RAC problems and the appeals backlog that is in existence \nnow.\n  Another concern in addition to the RAC audits is the Federal \nGovernment's inflexible supervision rules. CMS passed a rule that was \ndelayed but now ultimately put in place. It requires that many pretty \nroutine services that occur in a hospital--that includes things such as \na drug infusion or blood infusions, cardiac and pulmonary \nrehabilitation--that they require supervision. That is just not an \noption in many rural hospital health care settings. There is a lack of \nunderstanding and a lack of common sense as to what a small hospital in \na small town faces when CMS puts this regulation in place. They make it \ndifficult for those hospitals to continue to provide those necessary \nservices.\n  Fortunately, we have had some success in addressing this issue. \nCongress passed legislation that prevents the Federal Government from \nenforcing that regulation through the near future. I have introduced \noriginal legislation to make that change, that regulatory prohibition, \npermanent. I will reintroduce that legislation in January in the new \nCongress as we try to capitalize upon the temporary success we have had \nin fighting back this regulation from CMS to make it permanent so that \nwhen the temporary prohibition expires that we will have the \nopportunity to keep them from reintroducing that provision.\n  I will say that hospital administrators and employees, when I have a \nconversation with them, the discussion typically involves serious and \nstrong opposition to a number of proposals that come from the Obama \nadministration each year.\n  One of those is to change the number of miles that you must be apart \nfrom another hospital in order to qualify to be a critical access \nhospital. It is a program under Medicare and Medicaid Services that \nallows for a reimbursement that is more based upon cost than otherwise \nwould be the case.\n  Also the administration has continued to propose a 1-percent \nreduction in the funding for those critical access hospitals.\n  Those are pretty much life-and-blood issues for community hospitals \nacross Kansas and around the country. That critical access hospital \ndesignation in receiving that cost-based reimbursement means that a \nhospital with few patients, one that doesn't have hundreds of patients \neach day, can still be reimbursed at a rate in which they can almost \nmake ends meet, that they can cover their costs but still rarely is \nthere any profit or extra revenue generated from that so-called cost-\nbased reimbursement.\n  Cutting reimbursements to the hospitals, removing them from the \ncritical access program, I have little doubt but that it would \neliminate many, if not most, of those hospitals currently in that \ncritical access hospital program. There would be no place else for them \nto go, no other category within Medicare that would allow them to \nsurvive. I believe the number now is 88 of Kansas's 128 hospitals are \nthose critical access hospitals.\n  The other topics of conversation that arise in those conversations in \nvisiting with health care providers at a hospital--the physician, the \nnurses, the physical therapists, the CEO of the hospital, the trustees, \nthe board of directors of the hospital--is the Affordable Care Act.\n  Again, we symbolically say we care a lot about rural health care \nproviders, but the reality is the Affordable Care Act is creating \nsignificant problems, challenges, for the survival of hospitals, \nparticularly the smallest hospitals in my State and across the country.\n  The Kansas Hospital Association projects that the Affordable Care Act \nwill cost Kansas health care providers approximately $1.3 billion in \nMedicare funding over the next 10 years. These Affordable Care Act cuts \ninclude reductions to hospitals' Medicare reimbursements and a payment \ncalled disproportionate share that the hospital receives in order to \ncover the high level of uninsured patients.\n  These cuts are taking place on top of what Congress and the President \nagreed to under sequestration--a 2-percent across-the-board cut--that \nmany, if not all, of our providers are now receiving. So what was \nsupposed to be cost-based reimbursement, which nearly never covered the \ncost, is being reduced by another 2 percent as a result of \nsequestration. Again, this is something this Congress--and if not this \nCongress, the new Congress that begins in January--needs to deal with, \nthe issue of sequestration.\n  For this and for other reasons sequestration is a significant \nproblem. While I certainly support the reduced spending aspects--what \nthe goal was of sequestration--the idea that we would do across-the-\nboard cuts is irresponsible. We ought to be establishing the \npriorities--the things Congress, on behalf of the American people, \nthinks are the most important and beneficial to the American people, \nthe things that are allowed for under our Constitution. Those are the \nthings we ought to be funding, as compared to taking a step back and \njust having automatic cuts because we don't have the ability to decide \nin a responsible way what we can afford and what we cannot afford.\n  Further, I would say the Affordable Care Act forced States to adopt--\nthe original act as passed by Congress--an expansion of Medicaid. The \nU.S. Supreme Court, in its 2012 ruling, indicated that Medicaid \nexpansion was optional, not mandatory under the Constitution. So that \nportion of the Affordable Care Act was determined to be \nunconstitutional.\n  States are now faced with the difficult decision that involves \nMedicaid and long-term costs associated with potential expansions, and \nhospitals face tremendous uncertainty about how they will care for an \nincreased number of patients while they are already absorbing the \nAffordable Care Act's Medicare cuts. So States are struggling to figure \nout what to do about expansion of Medicaid.\n  Hospitals are suffering from the consequence of not having additional \nMedicaid dollars. That is on top of the cuts that occur as a result of \nchanges in Medicare. Really, in most hospitals across my State, two \ncomponents are so important: Medicaid and Medicare cover a significant \nportion of the number of patients that are admitted to a hospital, and \nin many instances there are not many private pay patients who have \ntheir own health insurance to add additional revenue to the hospital's \nrevenue stream.\n  This scenario of Medicare and Medicaid both creating problems, being \nsqueezed from both programs, presents significant problems for rural \nhospitals. Again, those reimbursements--Medicare and Medicaid--make up \nabout 60 percent of those hospitals' revenues.\n  The Affordable Care Act also put hospitals in the difficult position \nof having to balance increasing regulatory burden with reduced \nrevenues. So in addition to the Medicare-Medicaid pressure, there is \nalso the problem of increasing costs associated with more and more \nregulations emanating from the Department of Health and Human Services \nand other places across the Federal Government at the same time the \nreimbursement rates are declining. So increased cost, reduced revenue--\nagain, a significant problem.\n  In 2011, the average Medicare margin for hospitals in Kansas was a \nnegative--not enough to cover the cost--4.9 percent. These losses have \nto be offset somewhere, and that often results in a reduction in \nstaffing. It sometimes means a reduction of services. The end result is \na hospital that is not always able to meet the needs of their \ncitizens--their patients.\n  In many instances it is the hospital that may be among the largest \nemployer in a county or community in our State. In addition to reduced \nstaffing, an inability to buy equipment, and reducing certain specialty \nprograms offered at the hospital, we are also seeing\n\n[[Page S6665]]\n\na significant depletion in their cash reserves and a freeze on capital \nexpenditures. This circumstance is just not sustainable, and so we are \nseeing hospitals close.\n\n  Since about 1990, the number of rural hospitals across the country \nhas remained stable at around 2,000, but last year 15 rural hospitals \nclosed. We have to be concerned there are more to follow. This is an \nalarming trend. These hospitals play a vital role in health care to \nthose rural communities. It can determine whether a community has a \nfuture--whether individuals and families will decide to live there. The \nloss of a hospital has huge ripple effects and it harms patients. Their \nprimary purpose is to save lives and improve health care, but it is \nalso a tremendous loss to the community itself.\n  I outlined problems that I believed would occur for hospitals with \nthe passage of ObamaCare long before the law became law. I also would \nsay it doesn't mean I don't believe there aren't significant \nimprovements to be made to our health care delivery system, but I think \nthe reality is that the Affordable Care Act causes more problems--\nsignificantly more problems--than those it solves.\n  Many Kansas hospitals struggle to meet the needs of the aging \npopulation in their States and the Affordable Care Act cuts are an \nexacerbation of their circumstance. Again, the Affordable Care Act had \nthe promise of: If you like your plan, you can keep it. If you like \nyour health insurance plan, you can keep it. If you like your \nphysician, you can keep him or her. That didn't turn out to be true.\n  In fact, if you liked your policy, you were probably not able to keep \nit, and that something else now--that replacement policy--often \ninvolves increased copayments and deductibles. That certainly is a \nproblem for the policyholder and his or her family. It is a problem for \nthe business and their employees. But we may have forgotten it is a \nhuge problem for the health care provider.\n  Almost every hospital I have visited, now that the Affordable Care \nAct is being implemented, will tell me about the increasing amount of \nunpaid hospital bills--the amount of money that is owed that is \nattempting to be recovered. The reason that occurs is because the \ncopayments and deductibles are so significantly higher that patients \ndon't have the ability to pay a $5,000 copayment or even a $1,000 \ncopayment. So the hospital's bad debt is increasing because patients \ndon't have the necessary amount of money to pay for their portion of \nwhat their health care insurance policy now requires of them.\n  Again, this comes from a law that was described to us as going to \nincrease the affordability and the availability of health care. I guess \nwhat I would point out is, in the circumstance we are now in, the \npolicies are so expensive, so much more costly both in premiums and \ncopayments and deductibles, that the affordability is a problem again \nand not just for the patient, not for the policyholder but for the \nhospital that is now left holding the bag because so many of their \npatients can't pay the copayments or the deductibles.\n  When the Affordable Care Act passed, the President's own Medicare \nChief Actuary noted that the cuts would cause as many as 15 percent of \nhospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and home health agencies to be \nunprofitable by 2019. While that point in time may have seemed a long \ntime away, 2019 is now just about 5 years away. If ObamaCare remains in \nplace, the estimated percentage of unprofitable providers is projected \nto increase, reaching roughly 25 percent in 2030 and 40 percent in \n2050. So by 2030 25 percent of the hospitals, health care providers, \nwill be unprofitable, and by 2050 40 percent--nearly half--of the \nhealth care providers will be unprofitable.\n  Again, in particularly rural communities, if you can't make it on the \nrevenues that come from patients, from providing health care to \nindividuals, often the option is to increase taxes--property taxes, \nsales tax--or something to keep your hospital doors open. That ought \nnot be the consequence of legislation passed by Congress--to require \ntaxes to be raised for a Federal program called Medicare because it is \nfailing to meet the needs of American citizens, our patients. These \nproviders, our hospitals, just simply can't sustain in the circumstance \nthey find themselves in. The Affordable Care Act has put us on a path \nthat I think is dangerous for individuals, for businesses, and now for \nthe health care providers themselves.\n  In addition to the bad debt experience, many of the new health care \nplans have limited or restrictive provider networks, so that a local \nhospital may be eliminated from their network. This means that while \nunder their previous insurance policy they could see a hometown \nphysician or be admitted to their hometown hospital, because of these \nnetwork restrictions they must go someplace out of town to access \nhealth care. This again is a terrible consequence for the individual, \nfor the patient, but also something that drives revenues away from the \nhometown provider, much to the detriment of everybody who would want to \nmake certain that provider, that doctor, remains in the community and \nthat the hospital doors remain open.\n  There is lots of evidence that the problems we are facing are real. \nThey demand attention. Access to affordable health care is something \nthat still deserves our attention. I look forward to trying to make \ncertain we have that opportunity. Again, that is nothing that is going \nto happen in the next few days, but we have a responsibility to see \nthat the things that are reducing the access to affordable health care \nare addressed. The efforts that resulted from the Affordable Care Act \nare exacerbating the problem, not solving the problem.\n  I look at elections as like a new year. There is this optimism that \nmaybe something good can come from a new Congress; that we can \nestablish our New Year's resolutions and we can begin working, and I \ncertainly make the offer to my colleagues throughout the Senate--all 99 \nof my colleagues--to be someone who wants to be problem solving, \noriented toward finding solutions, and working together to make sure \nthose health care providers that are so important to our lives, our \nsafety, to our health, are around for a long time to come and that the \ncommunities that depend upon those hospitals--those 128 hospitals in my \nhome State--have a viable future.\n  We have to get the regulatory environment under control, we have to \nresolve the problems created by the Affordable Care Act, and we need to \nmake certain that health care is an opportunity for people who live in \nplaces across my State to still have the opportunity to see the \nhometown physician, to have a prescription filled by the hometown \npharmacist, and to make certain those hometown hospital doors remain \nopen for today and for future generations of communities across my \nState.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to address the Senate this afternoon, \nand I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KING. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY AWARENESS AND PREPAREDNESS \n                   CAMPAIGN.\n\n       (a) National Cybersecurity Awareness and Preparedness \n     Campaign.--The Director of the National Institute of \n     Standards and Technology (referred to in this section as the \n     ``Director''), in consultation with appropriate Federal \n     agencies, shall continue to coordinate a national \n     cybersecurity awareness and preparedness campaign, such as--\n       (1) a campaign to increase public awareness of \n     cybersecurity, cyber safety, and cyber ethics, including the \n     use of the Internet, social media, entertainment, and other \n     media to reach the public;\n       (2) a campaign to increase the understanding of State and \n     local governments, institutions of higher education, and \n     private sector entities of--\n       (A) the benefits of ensuring effective risk management of \n     the information infrastructure versus the costs of failure to \n     do so; and\n       (B) the methods to mitigate and remediate vulnerabilities;\n       (3) support for formal cybersecurity education programs at \n     all education levels to prepare skilled cybersecurity and \n     computer science workers for the private sector and Federal, \n     State, and local government; and\n       (4) initiatives to evaluate and forecast future \n     cybersecurity workforce needs of the Federal government and \n     develop strategies for recruitment, training, and retention.\n       (b) Considerations.--In carrying out the authority \n     described in subsection (a), the Director, in consultation \n     with appropriate Federal agencies, shall leverage existing \n     programs designed to inform the public of safety and security \n     of products or services, including self-certifications and \n     independently verified assessments regarding the \n     quantification and valuation of information security risk.\n       (c) Strategic Plan.--The Director, in cooperation with \n     relevant Federal agencies and other stakeholders, shall build \n     upon programs and plans in effect as of the date of enactment \n     of this Act to develop and implement a strategic plan to \n     guide Federal programs and activities in support of the \n     national cybersecurity awareness and preparedness campaign \n     under subsection (a).\n       (d) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and every 5 years thereafter, the \n     Director shall transmit the strategic plan under subsection \n     (c) to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation \n     of the Senate and the Committee on Science, Space, and \n     Technology of the House of Representatives.\n\n\n                      IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF S. 1353\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I ask consent to engage \nin a colloquy with Senator Rockefeller, Chairman of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, regarding important aspects of S. 1353, the Cybersecurity \nEnhancement Act of 2014.\n  Yesterday I held a hearing on the importance of improving information \nsharing between agencies on cyber security. As I said yesterday, law \nenforcement, the intelligence community, Treasury, and financial \nregulators each may have different missions, but in addressing cyber \nsecurity concerns they all must be united in what some call a ``whole \ngovernment'' approach. Cyber security is one of the most important \nissues facing the financial system and I hope next Congress can work \ntogether to pass a comprehensive cyber security bill. I thank my \ncolleague, the Senator from West Virginia, for his work on this \nimportant matter and for strengthening the public-private collaboration \non cyber security with this bill.\n  However, I would like to ensure that the language in this bill does \nnot have\n\n[[Page S6669]]\n\nunintended consequences on the abilities of financial regulators to \neffectively oversee our financial system. As chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, I am mindful of the importance of strong regulators \nexamining and supervising our financial institutions. This is \nparticularly important in the case of the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau, the agency that was created in 2010 to police areas of the \nfinancial market that previously were not regulated at the federal \nlevel, as well as the prudential regulators. A provision in S. 1353 \nstates that information shared with the National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (known as NIST), may not be used by a government agency \nto regulate the activity of any entity. However, other existing \nstatutes and regulations provide government agencies with the authority \nto require entities they regulate to provide them with information.\n  Moreover, a regulatory agency may discover such information on its \nown, through the entity, or through other sources. For example, a bank \nregulatory agency may discover cyberthreat information during a routine \nexamination of a bank and, might want to exercise its existing legal \nauthority to require the bank to adjust its systems to protect against \nfuture cyberthreats. I seek clarification from the Senator from West \nVirginia with respect to the provision in the proposed legislation.\n  Can my colleague from West Virginia confirm that this provision is \nnot intended to prohibit an agency from taking regulatory action, if \nthe agency independently obtains such information pursuant to other \nstatutory or regulatory authority, even if a regulated entity has \nshared this information with NIST?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank Senator Johnson for his interest and support \nfor this legislation and for his shared interest in strengthening cyber \nsecurity. I also thank my colleague from South Dakota for drawing \nattention to the potential impact of this provision on financial \nregulatory authorities under the Banking Committee's jurisdiction, \nincluding those of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the \nprudential regulators. I would like to assure the Senator that the \nconsensus-based voluntary process for developing cyber security \nstandards established in Title I of this bill is not intended to alter \nor limit financial regulatory agencies' regulatory authority in any \nway. Title I, particularly new section (e)(2) of the National Institute \nof Standards and Technology Act, encourages private entities to \nparticipate in NIST's standards development process, but is in no way a \n``safe harbor'' for participants who are subject to the jurisdiction of \nfinancial regulatory agencies. An entity that participates in the \nstandards development process established in Title I is still fully \nsubject to the regulations, supervision, and other requirements of its \nfinancial regulatory agency. Sharing information with NIST as part of \nthe process established in Title I is not a valid basis for withholding \ninformation from a regulator, including information about cyber \nthreats.\n  NIST is the Federal government's premier science and standards \nagency. It is not a regulatory agency, nor is it a national or homeland \nsecurity agency. NIST's unique role is to bring together knowledgeable \nplayers from government and industry and to build consensus around \ncommon technical standards. NIST has no authority to require any \nprivate entity to follow standards it develops. The cybersecurity \nstandards development process established in Title I is therefore not a \nrulemaking process. It in no way imposes new or duplicative regulations \non entities that are subject to the authority of financial regulatory \nagencies, and it in no way disturbs or diminishes agencies' authority \nto exercise their important oversight duties.\n  It is not intended to prohibit an agency from taking a regulatory \naction, such as an action to require an individual entity to protect \nagainst future cyber threats, if the agency independently obtains such \ninformation pursuant to other statutory or regulatory authority--even \nif an entity has shared this information with NIST. Nothing in this \nbill is intended to modify, limit, or otherwise affect the authority of \nthe federal financial regulators under any other provision of law.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. I thank the Senator from West Virginia \nfor his work on this important matter and for working with me to \nclarify the scope of this bill.\n  Mr. KING. I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported \nsubstitute be agreed to, the Rockefeller-Thune substitute be agreed to, \nthe bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, and the motion \nto reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee-reported amendment in the nature of a substitute was \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4097) in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The bill (S. 1353), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed.\n  Mr. KING. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/11/senate-section/article/S6669-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6669-S6681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PROTECTING VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS AND EMERGENCY RESPONDERS ACT OF \n                            2014--Continued\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     tribute to departing senators\n\n                               Tom Coburn\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to make some remarks about \nSenator Coburn.\n  Tom Coburn is one of the more remarkable Senators who have served in \nthis body--certainly since I have been here. He is a man with absolute \ncourage, conviction, and dedication to make this country better. He \ndidn't come here to go through the job and go through the motions; he \ncame here to invest his great skills and his great intellectual ability \nand to pour his drive and effort into making America a better place. It \nis very special. It is unusual. I have not seen anything like it, as I \nsaid, since I have been here.\n  I always had great reluctance to disagree or oppose anything Tom \noffered. They were not always perfect, but basically I opposed them so \nseldom because I agreed with him time and time again. I always hated to \nvote no because I knew he had studied the issue, understood it, and was \ndoing what he believed was right.\n  His whole philosophy and approach to government, had it been more \neffectively followed by other Members of this body, would have led us \nto a better country. To support what he said, I think in a way, was \nsupporting high ideals for America.\n  I want to say I am going to miss him. People have no idea how many \ntimes he has stopped or altered bad legislation to make it better and \nless problematic and more principled. He believes that ours is a \nconstitutionally limited government. He didn't just believe that, he \nacted on it and has acted on it consistently.\n  I understand, and I have no doubt of this--we don't need to run a \ntest--but I understand and have no doubt that he has offered more \namendments since I have been in the Senate than any other Senator. They \nhave been amendments to stop waste, fraud, and abuse, to make the \ngovernment more efficient, leaner, to consolidate multiple programs \nthat should be consolidated for efficiency.\n  He has worked across the aisle on a host of issues. He has sought \nbipartisan support for matters that are small and large. It is \nremarkable. I have to say that we are going to lose someone who is of \ngreat value. He would easily have been reelected had he run again.\n  I remember him saying one time--and this is his philosophy--if you \nwant to be reelected, don't worry about being reelected, just do the \nright thing, and you won't have any difficulties. He never had any \ndifficulties in his election, because people trusted him. They\n\n[[Page S6670]]\n\nknew every day, night and day, long hours, whatever, he was working to \nadvance the common interest of our country. They trusted that he was \nnot seduced, bought out, compromised by the powers that be in \nWashington, DC, and he remained true to those who sent him here.\n  I would say this: Part of the strength he has--as a matter of fact, \nmaybe the greatest part of his strength he has is his faith. He is \nintelligent, sophisticated, knowledgeable, a scientist, a doctor, but a \nman of simple Christian faith which impacts his life as much as anybody \nin this body. He understands the true meaning of life, and he gives \nhimself to others in a most remarkable way.\n  Thank you and colleagues for the opportunity for me to share these \nremarks. We are going to miss our friend Tom Coburn, who is going to \nobject to those bills that require a lot of effort to make them better \nor stop some that are so bad they cannot be passed. A lot of us are \ngoing to have to pick up the slack.\n  Maybe Tom would say, ``What are you doing down here, Jeff, wasting \ntime talking about me when you ought to be studying this bill and \nfinding some of the bogus spending that is in it? You should be \nspending your time fixing it.''\n  But every now and then I think we should stop and recognize an \nextraordinary life and an extraordinary Senator.\n  I wanted to share these remarks.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Clay Hunt SAV Act\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, Mr. Clay Hunt is a marine veteran who \ncommitted suicide in March of 2011 at the age of 28. Clay enlisted in \nthe Marine Corps in May of 2005 and deployed to the Al Anbar Province \nnear Fallujah in January of 2007. He was shot in the wrist by a \nsniper's bullet that barely missed his head, and it earned him the \nPurple Heart.\n  Clay recuperated at Twentynine Palms, CA, and then graduated from \nMarine Corps scout sniper school in March of 2008, and he was \nredeployed in southern Afghanistan a few weeks later. His unit returned \nto the United States in late October 2008 and he was honorably \ndischarged from the marines in April 2009.\n  After he returned home, Clay suffered from post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, PTSD. He struggled for many years and he struggled with \ninadequate care from his local VA hospital before taking his own life.\n  The Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act passed the House of \nRepresentatives a little while ago this week. I believe this is an \nimportant piece of legislation. I serve on the Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee and we had testimony related to suicide prevention, suicide \namong our veterans, a few weeks back, and it is so clear in Kansas and \nacross the country that many veterans and their families deserve \nsomething much more than we are able to provide--than we are providing \nnow--and this legislation which will help in that regard deserves swift \npassage by the U.S. Senate.\n  This bill, the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act, would be \ninstrumental in developing a VA system capable of offering first-class, \nfirst-rate mental health care services as well as utilizing the \nexpertise of outside organizations to provide support for those \nstruggling with the invisible wounds of service.\n  The legislation would require third parties to conduct an annual \nevaluation of suicide prevention programs within the Department of \nVeterans Affairs and within the Department of Defense. It would also \nprovide for a new Web site that would offer veterans information \nregarding available mental health care services, and it would create a \njoint pilot loan repayment program for VA psychiatrists. There is a \ntremendous shortage of VA professionals that this would help alleviate, \nand it will improve the exchange of training, best practices, and other \nresources among the VA veterans service organizations and not-for-\nprofit mental health organizations to enhance the cooperation of their \nefforts in suicide prevention.\n  During that Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing on November 19, last \nmonth, we were honored to hear Clay's story from his mom, Susan Selke. \nSusan shared her son's story of reliving the traumatic experiences of \nwar and his disappointment when the VA failed to offer him the care he \nneeded to treat his stress disorder.\n\n  In fact, it was one of the most compelling--again, I have served on \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee since I came to Congress, and this \nmother's testimony was one of the most important pieces of information \nI have heard from a witness during the committee hearing. What she \nindicated was that in her belief--and she indicated that she believed \nher son thought this as well--that it was the VA bureaucracy, the \ninability, the unwillingness, the falling through the cracks, the \nculture that we have heard described in the Department of Veterans \nAffairs that was the straw that broke the camel's back and that caused \nher son to commit suicide.\n  We have ranted, we have raved, we highlighted, we pointed out, we \nhave discussed the VA and its problems, its bureaucracy, its culture, \nits failure of leadership, its service to the VA as compared to its \nservice to veterans many times over many years. We often bemoan \nbureaucracy among all Federal agencies, but it is especially important \nat the Department of Veterans Affairs, because while it is easy to talk \nabout the bureaucracy, the paperwork, the shuffling, the falling \nthrough the cracks, this mother's testimony about the death of her son \nindicated that it is not just about bureaucracy, it is not just about \npaperwork, it is not just about a culture. Those circumstances \ncontributed to the death of a human being. In this case it contributed \nto the death of one who served our country nobly.\n  So we can bemoan the bureaucracy, but we need to remember that it is \nthat circumstance that causes the loss of life. Suicide is something \nthat needs to be addressed. We need to have a concerted effort, and \nlegislation that is now pending before the Senate that needs to be \npassed before this Senate concludes is one step we can take to make \ncertain there are less circumstances in which a soldier or a veteran \ncommits suicide.\n  I cannot imagine the heartache, the difficulty, the challenge, that \ncomes from a mom who comes to DC to testify about the suicide death of \nher son. I don't know how to put myself in that position, but I know it \nhas to be a tremendously difficult, traumatic experience. The reason \nshe must do that is because she wants to make certain that other sons \nof other parents of other mothers have a different experience than the \none she, her family, and her son, experienced.\n  It is clear we have a problem. It is critical that the VA follow \nthrough on its commitment and its responsibilities to our Nation's \nveterans. It is critical that they must follow through to those \nveterans who are just returning home, those who have been home a long \ntime, and to their families who need to have the love and support and \ncare of the VA and the American people. We have to keep working to find \nsolutions to the issues of mental health our service men and women and \nveterans now face, and we must hold the VA accountable for their \nresponsibilities when it comes to providing for the needs of those \nveterans. And that care and treatment must be provided in a timely, \nhigh quality, and in a specialized way that meets the needs of each \nindividual veteran and their family.\n\n  My presence on the Senate floor this evening is to highlight the \nimportance of the message of the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act, to \npay honor and tribute to Clay Hunt and to his family, and to the \nhundreds of individuals and families across the country who have faced \nsimilar circumstances, and call us to the point that we recognize that \nsteps taken today can make certain there are no more Clay Hunts, no \nmore mothers who face the circumstance of the loss of their son, and \nthat America lives up to its commitment to those we have called to \nduty.\n  I urge my colleagues to make certain that this legislation passes the \nU.S. Senate before we recess for this holiday period.\n\n[[Page S6671]]\n\n  Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity to speak this evening. I \nyield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Tribute to Departing Senators\n\n                            Jay Rockefeller\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to share a few remarks as we mark \nthe end of the long tenure of Senator Jay Rockefeller and his service \nto his country and to the Senate. He has served in the Senate for 30 \nyears. He served two terms as Governor of West Virginia, and served as \nSecretary of State, and in the House of Delegates.\n  He came to the State of West Virginia as a young VISTA volunteer. I \nhave heard him tell the story about that, how he really wanted to \nparticipate and reach out and help others. He came to West Virginia as \na young man and stayed. He worked with people in a small mining \ncommunity. His heart was right to try to be helpful. He came from a \nprestigious family, but he wanted to help others.\n  He has been a remarkable Member of the Senate for now 30 years. He \nhas a brilliant mind, capable of grasping all sorts of thoughts, but he \nalso has the ability to delight in little things. One of those is \nsports. He has a tremendous capacity to have in that brain of his \nsports trivia. He likes the Atlanta Braves. He knows Southeastern \nConference football. I have been pleased to be able to chat with him on \noccasion on the floor.\n  It just goes to show a lot of times people don't realize that we get \nalong pretty well in this body personally. We may disagree on issues, \nbut we care about one another. Jay Rockefeller has always been nice to \nme. He has always been a friend. He has always been courteous. He has \nalways been collegial to me, and I have appreciated that over the \nyears. So I wish to thank him for his service to his country, his \ncommitment to others, and I wish him Godspeed in his further endeavors.\n  I thank the Chair, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Saxby Chambliss\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to share a few thoughts about the \nservice in the Senate of our good friend and colleague Saxby Chambliss.\n  Saxby is one of the best liked and most respected Senators in this \nbody. Every Member knows him. Every Member likes him. Every Member \nrespects him. I truly share that view. And on matters particularly \nrelated to national security, intelligence issues, and terrorism, I \nconsistently want to know what Saxby has to say about it.\n  He has done a whole lot of things in this Senate. He has been a \nparticipant and a contributor on many issues. He worked really hard to \ntry to create a bipartisan solution to our debt crisis. That didn't \nquite develop, but it was a positive part of the discussion this Senate \nwent through.\n  What I really want to say is that as Chairman or Vice Chairman of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, and having been a longtime Member of the \nHouse Intelligence Committee, and here in the Senate, he has become the \ngo-to person with regard to the sensitive issues relating to the \nsecurity of our country. I consistently have looked to him because I \ntrust his judgment, trust his integrity, and trust his wisdom to help \nsort through all the political news articles and debates and hot \nissues, and to distill down to the bottom of what is important, what we \nshould be focused on, and what the right thing is for America.\n  Truly, he has been a remarkable Senator. We are going to miss Saxby. \nI am going to miss Saxby, as so many of us will. He is the son of an \nEpiscopalian minister. He is a man of faith.\n  He has a delightful wife, Julianne. My wife is a good judge of \ncharacter and she thinks Julianne hung the Moon, and that is so true. \nThey are a great family and great partners.\n  Saxby has given so much to the Senate. Georgia has produced some \ngreat Senators, particularly Senators known for their commitment to \nnational security and the defense of America: Richard Russell, for whom \nthe Russell Senate Office Building is named; Sam Nunn, who was so long \na leader in the Congress with regard to national defense.\n  Saxby Chambliss is in that category. That is the kind of Senator he \nhas been--from defending America to helping his colleagues sift through \ndifficult issues and make good, wise decisions. It has been a great \npleasure for me to serve with him. I wish him every success in his \nfuture endeavors and look forward to seeing him back in this area many \ntimes.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Mark Begich\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would also just say that we will be \nlosing a good friend, Mark Begich. Mark and I served on the Armed \nServices Committee together for a number of years. We were very active. \nI was Ranking Member and he was Chairman of the Armed Services \nSubcommittee on Strategic Forces, dealing with missile defense, which \nAlaska was deeply involved with as a state.\n  Mark was an expert on those issues. We dealt with nuclear issues and \nouter space and satellite issues. That was a particularly good time \ntogether. I believe every committee--every decision we reached--was a \nbipartisan decision that came out of committee. We supported the \nSubcommittee report that was made a part of the Armed Services bill and \nthen became law. For the most part I think not too many changes were \nmade in it.\n  I think a lot of people may not appreciate that Senators do get \nalong. We do work together on issues important to the country, such as \nspace and military space necessities that are so valuable to our men \nand women as they are in harm's way, to be able to produce a missile \ndefense system that ensures that this country is not vulnerable to \nattack by a missile from an adversary.\n  That system is up, standing, and operating today. It was great to \nwork with Mark in establishing it. He is a delightful person to work \nwith, always with a positive attitude. I know he will be successful in \nwhatever future endeavors he undertakes. He was mayor of Anchorage. \nAnybody who has been a mayor has learned some things and has had to \ndeal with constituents face-to-face. He loved actually meeting his \nconstituents and talking with them.\n  I wish Mark every success in his future endeavors and would like to \nexpress my appreciation to him for the courtesies he has shown me and \nthe effort we made together to improve the defense of the United \nStates.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Hours of Service Regulations\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, at this time of year, Thanksgiving and \nthe holidays that are upcoming, a lot of Americans are on our roads. A \nlot of us know that Americans are on the roads because my colleagues \nand I travel using the highways of our States so frequently.\n  We know as parents, as family members, that in the back of our minds \nwhen a son or daughter is driving, there is a tiny bit of apprehension \nand anxiety about safety. It is safety not only concerning people on \nour roads but also on our railways. As a member of the commerce \ncommittee, where the Presiding Officer served, I know he has young \nchildren and he probably has the same apprehensions and anxieties that\n\n[[Page S6672]]\n\nall of us share when our family members are driving, particularly late \nat night, early in the morning, hours when weariness, fatigue, and \ntiredness are one of the main enemies--particularly when the weather is \nbad.\n  The omnibus funding measure, soon to be under debate, has many good \nprovisions, but it also has a provision that is antithetical and deeply \ndestructive to the principle of road safety because it affects truck \ndrivers who are on the roads for long periods of time. I am referring \nto section 133 of division K, one paragraph. I am here to talk about \nit, to ask that my colleagues oppose it. If there is any way to strip \nit from the bill, I urge that it be done. It is a provision that is \nvirtually incomprehensible to the average American on the roads or in \ntheir homes as to what it means and what its ramifications are and what \nits consequences may be to their safety and the safety of others in \ntheir families on the road.\n  The fact is that nearly 4,000 people who are killed each year in \ntruck crashes and the nearly 100,000 each year who are injured show the \ntoll of fatigue and weariness of our truck drivers.\n  According to NHTSA, truck crash injuries in fact increased by 40 \npercent between 2009 to 2012. We all have seen the consequences of \nfatigue on the roads when we drive--the truck driver who may pull his \nrig in front of us or slide over into our side of the road, not because \nhe is not well trained, experienced, able. In fact, the vast majority \nof truck drivers are experienced and able and well trained and \nextraordinarily prudent in the way they drive.\n  But fatigue is an enemy to them as it is to all of us who drive. Many \nof the headlines we have seen recently have concerned hours of service \nregulations governing truck drivers, as many truck crashes involve \ntired truck drivers. There are rules that have been enacted by the \nFederal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, rules that have been \nimplemented to curb the number of fatigued truck drivers on our roads, \nimplemented after years of rulemaking and analysis and study and even \nlitigation. They are fact-based rules. They are supported by science. \nThey are rules that move American roads and drivers in the right \ndirection, truly, literally on the right path.\n  I am not the only one who supports these rules. They are supported by \nthe Secretary of Transportation. Secretary Foxx is to be commended for \nhis steadfast, strong, courageous defense of these rules. His integrity \nand intellect in support of these rules I greatly appreciate. But he is \nnot alone any more than I am alone. The folks who are most adamant and \npassionate about it are the truck drivers themselves.\n  The Teamsters and the United Transportation Union, they have inspired \nme to be as passionate and steadfast as I am on these rules. They are \nnot alone either. Law enforcement, the International Association of \nChiefs of Police, the National Troopers Coalition, the National \nSheriffs' Association, the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance, and the \nFederal Law Enforcement Officers Association all support these rules.\n  They are also supported by consumer and public health groups and \nsafety groups such as Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, Citizens \nfor Reliable and Safe Highways, the Consumer Federation of America, the \nAmerican Public Health Association, the John Lindsay Foundation, the \nTruck Safety Coalition, KidsAndCars.org, the Trauma Foundation, and \nPublic Citizen. These are the preeminent public and safety consumer \nadvocacy groups in this country. They all support these rules.\n  Tragically and unfortunately, there are organizations representing \nvictims such as Parents Against Tired Truckers and Roadsafe America \nwhich also have been inspired to support these rules. I say tragically \nand unfortunately, because none of us welcome the fact that there are \nvictims of crashes resulting from tired truckers. Most regretful are \nthe truckers themselves, which is why they are supporting these rules. \nBut the families and loved ones of victims of these crashes support the \nrules, and even many trucking companies like those represented by the \nTrucking Alliance support these rules.\n  The fact is there is good reason for the rules and there is good \nreason to strip the bill of a provision that negates, in effect, \nundercuts, and eviscerates these rules, section 133 of Division K. \nThere is good reason. The 2005 study conducted by the Federal Motor \nCarrier Safety Administration demonstrated that before the current \nrules were implemented, 65 percent of drivers reported feeling drowsy \nwhile driving and 48 percent admitted to falling asleep while driving \nat some point the previous year.\n  But under the current rules, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration says that it will save 19 lives, prevent about 1,400 \ncrashes, 560 injuries each year, see an estimated $280 million in \nsavings from fewer large truck crashes, and see $470 million in savings \nfrom improved driver health.\n  These are dry, abstract statistics, but they measure compelling \nlosses in human lives and in dollars.\n  Unfortunately, the folks who want to stop these rules have found a \nhome in the omnibus appropriations bill that may be coming over from \nthe House later today. In addition, while the rules are blocked, the \nlanguage in the House bill would also require that this issue be \nstudied further.\n  The rules have been studied a lot. If there is a need for further \nstudy, fine. I am completely on board with study and factfinding. But \nin the meantime, let's keep the rules as they are, as prescribed by the \nFederal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. They are in the business \nof safety. They have said these rules are necessary. Let's keep the \nrules implemented, but we can study them. If we are going to make any \nchanges, it should be done with proper analysis and debate--not in a \nspending bill. It ought to be in the committee with jurisdiction, the \ncommerce committee, where I serve.\n  That is why in late July my subcommittee held a hearing on truck \nsafety and this issue featured prominently. We gave everyone a chance \nto testify, to debate all points of view. Until then, the only \ndiscussion was in the context of appropriations and spending bills, not \nin the context of real policy.\n  The hearing I held highlighted some real issues. First, with these \nchanges, drivers will be able to drive nearly 80 hours a week. In other \nwords, if this provision is adopted, if the rules are rolled back, \ndrivers will be able to drive nearly 80 hours a week and hundreds more \na year.\n  It is more likely that trucking companies will push their drivers to \ndrive the maximum limit, which is about twice the average American \nworkweek. That is exactly what the rules are designed to prevent, truck \ndrivers being forced to work too many hours, getting exhausted, and \nthen endangering themselves and other drivers on the road.\n  All we are trying to do with the rules is take tired truckers off the \nroads--not tell them when they must sleep or what they must do while \nthey are off the roads. It is about taking tired trucker drivers off \nthe road. The changes in the omnibus would enable drivers to drive \nnearly 80 hours a week and hundreds more hours a year and would really \nimpede truck drivers' resting, which they should be doing instead of \ndriving more.\n  The rules implemented by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration were the result of compromise. To roll them back further \nundermines that compromise. If anything, we ought to be instituting \ngreater safeguards.\n  If there is factfinding that justifies stronger precaution and \nprotection, we welcome that study. But in the meantime, allow the rules \nto work and protect drivers, truck drivers and other drivers on the \nroad. Americans are in favor of these rules. They are in favor of truck \nsafety.\n  Polling data released in October shows why so many Americans are \nconcerned about allowing drivers to be on the roads while they are \nfatigued. Americans simply don't want these large trucks, which in many \nrespects operate like missiles zooming down the road. A missile out of \ncontrol can do huge, humongous, enduring damage to life and limb and to \nthe futures of people whose lives may be transformed by a fatal or \nserious crash.\n  Let's make sure we have a real conversation about this issue in the \ncommerce committee. Let's make sure we do the factfinding and have the \nrules in place while that factfinding takes place. Let's make sure that \nAmericans are protected against weary and tired\n\n[[Page S6673]]\n\ntruckdrivers. Let's give them the same attention and care as we would \nwant for our families during this season, on the roads, while they are \ndriving late at night, maybe in bad weather, because there are going to \nbe storms as there are, inevitably, in December, January, and February.\n  But every day, every season, these rules deserve to be in place. That \nis why this provision, which would roll back those rules--making \nchanges endangering the lives of ordinary Americans on the road--is so \nantithetical to safety and such an anathema to the values of saving and \npreserving life and increasing the safety of our drivers on the road.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Clay Hunt SAV Act\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I wish to inform my colleagues, \nalthough the hour is late, that the Clay Hunt bill, H.R. 5059, has been \ncleared on the Democratic side and I hope we will have unanimous \nconsent to move it tomorrow in the session that we have on Friday.\n  This bill is of tremendous importance to not only me as a member of \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee and my colleagues--many of them \nincluding, I believe, Senator McCain, who introduced an updated and \nimproved version of the Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, \nbut also to the families who have been affected, I want to say in \nparticular to Susan Selke, who testified before the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee--and I was there for her testimony, speaking on behalf of \nherself and her husband, Richard, as the mother of Clay Hunt, a marine \ncombat victim who died by suicide in March of 2011 at the age of 28.\n  I am not going to speak at length about the reasons of why we need \nmore assistance and support to prevent more wonderful young men and \nwomen like Clay Hunt, who served and sacrificed for our Nation, the \nkind of resources and support that are necessary to prevent them from \nbecoming victims at this time of tragic circumstances.\n  We owe it to Susan Selke, Clay Hunt's mom, and all the families who \nlose loved ones to suicide, to do better, to do more, and do it now.\n  The reforms and programs directed by this legislation hopefully will \nenable the VA to better serve and treat veterans suffering from the \nhidden or invisible injuries of war, and the mental health and other \nconditions that ought to be addressed to save young men and women such \nas Clay Hunt.\n  I will seek to move this bill tomorrow by unanimous consent, and I \nhope my colleagues will enable me to do so.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the bill we are on--the \nNational Defense Authorization Act--by taking a look at the condition \nof the world today. This is an important time to do it, as we enter the \nend of this year and begin to look forward to the new year. We should \ntake a moment to take a snapshot of the world and the threats that \nexist around us and the complexities in the world because I think they \nare directly on point as to what our military capabilities are going to \nneed to be in the 21st century.\n  I note that the tendencies have often been on a number of occasions, \neven in my lifetime, where we have tried to take, for lack of a better \nterm, what is known as a peace dividend--the end of the Cold War, for \nexample, and then again after the events of 9/11--it is the idea that \nsomehow the threats around the world and the challenges we face have \nsomehow ebbed and it is time to nation build at home. I am always in \nfavor of nation building at home. The problem is that today, now, in \nthe 21st century more than ever, there is no such thing as a remote \nproblem. There is no such thing as any issue that is of major \nimportance abroad that doesn't somehow impact us here at home. This has \nalways been true, but it has never been more true than it is today \nbecause of the global nature of our economy.\n  As we look around the world--and I want to take a brief moment to go \nover some of the parts of the world--we start to see what the need for \nAmerican leadership is and the need for a strong national defense \ncapability on the part of the United States and how important it is in \nthis new global economy.\n  Let's begin by looking at the Middle East, the most troubled region \nof the world, and that has been true for a very long time. We begin by \ntalking about the negotiations that are going on with Iran. Look, I \nwould hope--we all do, I think--to wake up one day to the news that \nIran has decided to walk away from sponsoring terrorism, that Iran has \nwalked away from its desire to blow up Israel, that Iran has rejected \nthe human rights violations it commits against its own people, and that \nthey have abandoned their nuclear ambitions. We would all love to see \nthat happen. That is the ideal outcome. It is also, frankly, the least \nlikely.\n  The truth is, while we shouldn't root against the negotiations that \nare going on with Iran, we shouldn't be naive enough to believe they \nhave a serious chance at success, and I say this for a couple of very \ndifferent but simple reasons.\n  The first is because I think Iran looks at what has happened with \nNorth Korea--a country that barely has an economy; it is not even a \ncountry in the sense we think of, having a government. It is really an \narea of land run by a criminal syndicate. Iran has seen how North \nKorea, because it has a nuclear weapon, has been able to be immune to \ninternational pressures, up to a certain point. Then Iran looks to \nLibya and it looks to Iraq and it says: Look what happens to people who \ndon't have nuclear weapons. So I am convinced the Supreme Leader wants \nthat nuclear capability. Whether he will ever actually build the \nweapon--it may not be something they have decided yet, but the ability \nto build that weapon--I have no doubt that is what they want.\n  I have no doubt--and I believe the administration knows this to be \ntrue--that they have gone into these negotiations with a very clear \nobjective; that is, we want you, negotiator, to get rid of as many \nsanctions as possible without agreeing to any irreversible concessions.\n  It is an interesting plan because their idea is to get rid of the \nsanctions, thinking they will do what they need to do in the short \nterm--whatever that may be, as long as they are not irreversible--and \nat some point in the future they will restart the weapons program. It \nis going to be easier for Iran to restart the weapons program than it \nis going to be for the United States and the nations of the world to \nreimpose sanctions. So I think they have figured that out, and that is \nwhat their mandate has been. But even that has its limits because when \nwe look to these negotiators--and there is a history of this, when we \nlook to these negotiators--there have been times in the past when \nIranian negotiators might have agreed to something at the table, but \nthen they have to come back and pull the offer because when they take \nit to the Supreme Leader, he says no.\n  We have to understand that the Supreme Leader is an isolated \nindividual. This is not a person who travels the world or interacts \nwith other national leaders of other nations. This is a person who is \nan ideologue, a religious fanatic. And I don't care what the \nnegotiators agree to or what the President of Iran agrees to, \nultimately it is the Supreme Leader's decision. I hate to say this, but \nthey are not going to agree to any sort of deal that is good for the \nnational security of the United States. I believe that to be true, and \nwe need to be prepared for that.\n  I hope one of the first items we take up in this Chamber in the new \nyear, in the new Congress, will be a bill to require congressional \nauthorization for any deal, and I think we should also consider putting \nin place sanctions for the day when that deal fails.\n  In the meantime, as we talk about those negotiations that are going \non--and Iran has already acquired a concession on the part of the West \nthat they\n\n[[Page S6674]]\n\ncan leave in place some level of the infrastructure they need to enrich \nuranium and reprocess plutonium--they are still expanding their missile \ncapability, they are still sponsoring terrorism all over the world, \nthey are still deeply embedded and aligned with Shia militias in Iraq \nwho pose a danger to the United States--and I will touch more upon that \nin a moment--and they still have plans to one day destroy Israel. So we \nshould not be naive about the situation with Iran, and I hope in the \nnew year more clarity will come to that.\n\n  The second issue that directly touches upon our national security is \nthe conflict between Iraq and Syria with regard to ISIL and the speed \nby which they have spread throughout two countries. Their goals are \nvery simple. The goal of ISIL is to establish an Islamic caliphate that \nstretches from Europe--literally from Spain all the way through the \nMiddle East, into India and Afghanistan, and in through north Africa. \nThat is their very clear goal. They have said so. That is their plan, \nand it began in Syria, and it is spreading to Iraq. They made some \npretty impressive gains before they started getting hit from the air. \nBut even with that, they are the best funded and the best armed \nterrorist organization in modern history.\n  We already are beginning to see the spread of ISIL. One place to keep \nan eye on is Libya. They control an entire province in Libya. An \naffiliate of theirs, a group who has pledged allegiance to them, now \ncontrols an entire province in Libya, and here is what is dangerous \nabout that. For a group such as this to prosper and grow, they need an \nungoverned space. They need a piece of territory where no one is \nshooting at them, where no one is protesting their presence and they \nhave no one to fight against them. That is why al Qaeda was able to \ngrow so fast in Afghanistan--because the Taliban gave them that \nungoverned space. That is why ISIL was able to grow so quickly out of \nSyria and into Iraq--because they were able to carve out an ungoverned \nspace where the Syrian Government wasn't.\n  In Libya they have no one to fight. There is no functional government \nright now. There are no rival rebel groups to shoot at them. And they \nare going to use that ungoverned space to grow their capability. In \nfact, it would not surprise me, unfortunately, if in a few months, \nmaybe a year, the hub of ISIL's activities is located largely in that \nprovince of Libya and beyond.\n  By the way, ISIL's presence isn't just a threat to Iraq and Syria; \ntheir immediate threat as well is to the Kingdom of Jordan, a critical \nU.S. ally. And if they are a threat to Jordan, they are a threat to \nIsrael and, ultimately, to Saudi Arabia. They are a threat to Turkey \nalready. They are a threat to Lebanon, and, as I said, they are present \nin north Africa as we speak. This is a very dangerous development, and \nit must be dealt with seriously.\n  We also can't anticipate the alliances that ISIL might make. We have \nto understand what is happening. As they make these gains--or supposed \ngains--they have also become very good at propaganda. They are \nconvincing young, radicalized individuals--including here in the United \nStates--that they are the preeminent jihadist group on the planet, that \nthey are the most successful jihadist group on the planet, that they \nwill inevitably succeed, and that they are an unsurmountable force. \nThey are convincing people to abandon other groups and join them. They \nare convincing donors to stop giving money to other groups and give to \nthem. We don't know what this is going to develop into, but we can \nforesee in the very near future where other groups begin to align \nthemselves with them just to remain relevant.\n  By the way, as a side note, there is an additional danger to ISIL's \nspread, and that is that the other jihadist groups in the world, who \nare now losing donors and losing recruits, are now feeling an urgency \nto go out and carry out some spectacular attack, such as here in the \nhomeland against American interests or air travel somewhere. They now \nhave an interest in carrying out a spectacular attack because they need \nto do something to reattract donors and reattract members.\n  But back to my original point. The danger is that these new groups, \nin order to remain relevant and not lose their fighters, may decide \nthey are going to pledge their allegiance to ISIL. The host of groups \nalready exploring that are dangerous--the Taliban in Afghanistan, the \nTaliban in Pakistan, the Haqqani Network that is in both Afghanistan \nand Pakistan, and there are other groups in north Africa as well that \nat least nominally have pledged some level of allegiance and support \nfor what ISIL is doing. We need to keep an eye on this threat because a \nyear ago, if I had stood on this floor and said we need to take ISIL \nseriously, no one would have known what I was talking about. That is \nhow quickly this threat has spread, and we have no idea what it can \nmorph into in the next few years, not to mention the next few months.\n  There is one additional point I wish to make. The city of Mosul has a \nuniversity with a significant research capability, and one thing for us \nto be very cautious about is that ISIL is not using that university and \nits research capabilities to develop rockets or, God forbid, chemical \nweapons or even a dirty bomb. That is something to keep an eye on in \nthe months and weeks to come. That is another example of the complex \nnational security threats our Nation faces.\n  Our ally Israel--their struggles and their challenges are well \ndocumented. It begins with Iran. We have talked about the fact that \nsingle greatest threat facing Israel today is the prospect of a nuclear \nIran and what it would mean to Israel's security in the long term. They \nface a very difficult challenge with the Palestinian Authority.\n  There was a poll I read about this morning that talked about a large \nmajority of people--Palestinians--who believe it is morally right to \nkill Israelis, to kill Jews. I am not saying that I believe all \nPalestinians think that, but it bears noting what that poll found. It \nshould not surprise us when the educational institutions of the \nPalestinian Authority--not to mention what is being taught in Gaza--\nteaches people that not only is it right, it is heroic to kill Jews and \nto be an anti-Semite.\n\n  Then they are being pressured, including by this administration--\nIsrael is--to enter into a peace agreement with these individuals, with \nthose so-called leaders. How can you enter into a peace agreement with \npeople who want to destroy you? How could you possibly enter into a \npeace agreement with an organization that wants to eradicate you? What \nare you going to negotiate--the terms of your destruction?\n  I don't know of any nation on Earth that wants peace more than Israel \ndoes. What do they have to gain from this constant conflict? How can \nyou have peace with an organization, with a group that is committed to \ntheir destruction?\n  Instead of saying: Israel, your No. 1 problem right now is--we know \nwhat it is--the threat of an Iranian nuclear weapon, this \nadministration and some political leaders even in this Chamber believe \nwe should be pressuring them that their No. 1 objective should be \nentering into some sort of peace agreement with an organization that \nwants to destroy them, that in some quarters won't even recognize their \nright to exist, an organization that harbors individuals who deny that \nJews were ever present on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, which is \nabsurd. Of course, I would just encourage them to do a little \narcheological research to confirm the longstanding Jewish presence in \nthe region.\n  Suffice it to say that Israel is our strongest ally in the region. It \nis everything we wish the Middle East was--a prosperous, free \nenterprise economy, a stable democracy with a vibrant political \nprocess, and a loyal friend to the United States in international \nforums. I wish there were more countries in the world like that. We \nshould do everything we can to support Israel and stop putting pressure \non them because every time we put pressure on them on these things, we \ncreate daylight between the United States and Israel, we imperil their \nsecurity, and we encourage their enemies to become even more \naggressive.\n  The last point I will make about Israel: Let there be no doubt that \nthere is a global effort to delegitimize their right to exist as a \nJewish state. It has infiltrated throughout Europe, and we are starting \nto see it rear its ugly head in academia here in the United States.\n\n[[Page S6675]]\n\nWe should not let that stand. We should speak out against it and \ncondemn it for what it is.\n  As if the Middle East were not complicated enough, we turn our focus \nto Europe and the threat Russia now poses. Interestingly enough, a year \nand a half ago, Mitt Romney, the former Governor of Massachusetts, the \nRepublican Presidential nominee, said that Russia was our most serious \ngeopolitical threat in the short term. He was universally mocked by \nelitists and the press, even by some here in Washington--many here in \nWashington. It turns out he was right, as were many of us who were \nsaying the same thing.\n  The truth is that Vladimir Putin many years ago concluded that the \nUnited States was a threat to Russia, many years ago concluded that he \nwanted Russia to be reestablished as a world power and that the only \nway he could achieve that was by confronting the United States and \nbeing seen as a counterbalance to the United States on the global \nstage, and we see that in place after place. In international forums, \nwhen it comes to Syria, on issue after issue Russia is against us \nbecause Putin believes it gives them relevancy on the global stage.\n  But there is a second issue and do not take this lightly. We don't \nspend all day obsessed about Russia. We don't spend all night thinking \nthe Russians are going to invade us. But they do. There are leaders in \nthe Russian Government who believe the United States wants to get into \na military conflict with them, and they increasingly believe that now \nmore than ever. We can see it in the military moves they are making. \nThese are not just provocations. This is an all-out change to their \ndefense posturing, to their defense theory, a defense theory that is \nincreasingly looking like a Cold War one, a defense theory that is \nincreasingly looking like they need to have the ability to prevent a \nU.S. first strike or to somehow be able to react to a U.S. first \nstrike.\n  I know for us it sounds absurd that the United States would ever \nlaunch a nuclear attack against Russia. But there are Russian leaders \nat very high levels that believe that is plausible, and we are seeing \nit rear its head in every part of the world. Not a day goes by that \nthere is not a report of a Russian intrusion here or a submarine \nappearing somewhere or an airplane--Russian bombers that have been \nintercepted by NATO or even the United States. These are not just \nprovocations. They are muscle flexing.\n  This is a change in their defense theory, and it is a very dangerous \nchange, not to mention the fact that I believe evidence now exists that \nRussia is in violation of multiple treaties they have signed with the \nUnited States, and there needs to be consequences for that.\n  Then, of course, as part of that strategy they believe they need \nstrategic depth, which means they need all the countries that border \nthem, especially the former Soviet Republics, to be in their camp. They \ndon't want anyone near them turning toward the West. The best example \nof that is what is happening in Ukraine.\n  What is happening in Ukraine is easy to understand. As Ukraine turned \nwestward, Russia said that was unacceptable; they invaded Crimea and \ntook it, and they are now engaged openly in a conflict with Ukraine \nthat is, by the way, an outrageous one.\n  First of all, Russian troops have entered Ukrainian territory. Maybe \nthey were disguised as something else, but Russian troops have made \nincursions into Ukraine territory and carried out combat operations \nagainst the Ukrainian Armed Forces.\n  The Russians are supplying the Ukrainians with weapons and armored \nvehicles.\n  They will claim: No; these armored vehicles are armored vehicles we \nseized, and they are clever about the armored vehicles they supply them \nwith. They are only supplying them with armored vehicles that look like \nthe ones the Ukrainians already have in their current stockpiles. But \nthey are arming, equipping, and training Ukrainian separatists, and \ntheir goal is to achieve one of two things:\n  Their first objective, plan A, is to force Ukraine, because of the \npressure they are putting on them through these separatists, because of \nthe economic levers they hold on a very fragile Ukrainian economy \nthrough energy and exports and so forth--their first objective is to \nforce Ukraine into a federation system of government; basically, a \nsystem of government that gives those eastern provinces and areas more \nautonomy because that would keep the country sufficiently divided so it \ncan never turn toward Europe and the West.\n  If that doesn't work, however, then plan B that they are perfectly \ncomfortable with is to freeze the status quo, to basically freeze the \ncurrent conflict as the status quo for the long term. After the next 15 \nor 20 years, there will be armed and trained separatists, supported by \nRussia, carrying out combat operations against the Ukrainian Government \nin the eastern parts of the country.\n  Plan A is the federation; plan B is to freeze the status of the \ncurrent conflict. That is the reality we are facing.\n  What is interesting is here is what Russia is banking on. They are \nbanking on the sanctions which have been imposed will not be sustained; \nthat eventually, after a couple of years, Europe will say: OK. It is \ntime to accept what has happened and move on and that sanctions will be \nlifted. In fact, that is what Putin is probably telling his inner \ncircle and the people around him: Don't worry. We are going to get \nthrough this. These sanctions will eventually be lifted off of us, and \neverything will be back to normal.\n\n  But those sanctions are hurting right now. I would hope those \nsanctions don't fall apart. I would hope the European nations \nunderstand what a direct threat this poses to them if Russia could just \ninvade a country and take it over. But time will tell.\n  I think a strong American leadership is critical. I think a \nreinvigoration of NATO is critical. That is why it is so important that \nwe focus on our defense capability.\n  But that is Putin telling everyone around him: Don't worry about \nthese sanctions. They are going to be gone in a while. We will get \nthrough this.\n  Interestingly, to give some insight into Putin, the inner circle \naround him, the elites who are closest to him, they are being shielded \nfrom the impact of these sanctions to a certain point. In fact, one of \nthe people, Igor Sechin, who was specifically sanctioned by the \nsanctions that were passed here and in Europe--he actually convinced \nPutin to indict an energy rival of his, take his property and his \nassets, and give it to Igor Sechin as compensation. That is how cynical \nthis has become.\n  So the elites that surround and are closest to Putin, they are being \nprotected by the impact of the sanctions. Everybody else is paying a \nterrible price, not the least of which are the people.\n  I also think there is clear evidence that Putin is increasingly \nisolated in terms of whom he listens to, whom he takes advice from, and \nwhom he consults with, and it is going to have a devastating impact on \nRussia. Next year their economy is predicted to contract. Yet despite \nthis--just to give a true indication of where Russia is headed and to \ngive insight as to where we should be headed--contraction of their \neconomy, despite the collapse of oil prices which has been devastating \nto their economy, Putin just announced budget cuts throughout every \npart of their government except for one--the one part of the budget \nthey are holding harmless--military spending. I hope that gives some \ninsight as to where they are heading.\n  My last point on Russia is they are increasingly present in the \nWestern Hemisphere. They are actively seeking lease agreements in \nNicaragua, Venezuela, and Cuba to be able to have naval assets and \naircraft stationed in our own backyard, in the Western Hemisphere.\n  Let's talk about Asia for a moment, another place that poses some \nvery significant national security and military implications for the \nUnited States.\n  I talked about North Korea earlier. I think it bears repeating. North \nKorea doesn't have a government. It is a nation or is a territory \ngoverned by a criminal syndicate run by an insane and erratic leader--\nbut an insane and erratic leader with nuclear weapons, an insane and \nerratic leader who is developing long-range missile capabilities, and \nan insane and erratic leader that may end up overestimating his \nmilitary capabilities, miscalculating, and\n\n[[Page S6676]]\n\ntrigger a dispute with South Korea that could quickly escalate and \nimplicate the United States, which has a very strong and important \nmilitary and defense agreement arrangement with South Korea and our \nallies in the south. It bears watching.\n  Let's focus for a moment on China. First of all, we cannot ignore \ntheir aggressive territorial claims against both the Philippines and \nJapan. Interestingly, they picked on the Philippines first, a nation \nthat doesn't have much of a military to speak of. This is the first \nnation they have gotten into a sort of conflict with, but they have \nthem also with Japan and with Vietnam, and they have been pretty \naggressive about it. To understand that, we have to understand a little \nbit about history.\n  For thousands of years, China was the dominant nation in that region. \nFor them, the last 200 years is an aberration, and their increasing \nassertiveness is an indication that they believe it is time to go back \nto normal, which is their dominance of the region. Their dominance, by \nthe way, doesn't mean they are going to invade these countries and take \nthem over. They are not going to invade the Philippines. They are not \ngoing to invade Japan.\n  What they believe is that all these countries should be tributary \nstakes, that all these countries should fold underneath China's \nleadership, that all these countries should recognize China is big and \nthey are small, and they should listen to China's directives and \norders.\n  So we see the silk road initiative. We see them trying to come up \nwith an alternative to the other global institutions that have served \nthe world so well since the end of World War II. They want to displace \nthe United States and the global order that existed since the end of \nWorld War II with their own order, run by China to China's advantages, \nand that begins with territorial claims.\n\n  The next time you have a chance to see in some Chinese passports, \nthey have a map that indicates the nine-dash line. The nine-dash line \nis what they think the world looks like in terms of territories. If we \nlook at what that means, they basically believe the entire South China \nSea is their territory. That is why they have made these aggressive \nmoves against these islands. Let me tell you how the strategy works.\n  They send fishermen to these areas to fish or others to exploit \nresources. The other countries send out their coast guard to defend it. \nThey send out their coast guard or navy to push back. They basically \nshow you: Even if you wanted to fight against us, there is nothing you \ncan do about it.\n  Eventually what they want these nations to conclude is: There is no \npoint in fighting China because we can't win. The United States is not \ngoing to come to our defense. So we might as well cut a deal with them \nand accept their dominance.\n  That is their plan, slowly but surely to change the facts on the \nground, to assert themselves, to convince these other countries there \nis nothing they can do about it. They can't count on the United States \nanymore, and eventually these countries will say: Fine, China. We will \ndo whatever you want and cave. That is their plan and they are carrying \nit out.\n  They have also shown their true colors in Hong Kong. When the \nagreement was signed to turn Hong Kong over from the United Kingdom to \nthe Chinese, one of the things that was important in that agreement was \nautonomy; that Hong Kong couldn't have its own foreign policy, but it \ncould have its own domestic system of government autonomous from the \nChinese system.\n  But now things have changed. Now the Chinese basically want to have \nveto power over who can run for office and who can lead Hong Kong. In \nfact, the criteria they have established is: You have to love the \nnation. But I will translate what that means: You have to love the \nChinese Communist Party and do what they want you to do. So this is an \nimportant development that we need to keep an eye on.\n  Beyond that, going back to military affairs for a moment--because we \nare on the NDAA--just look at what China is doing in its military \nexpenditures: dramatic increases in military expenditures, the true \nnature of which we don't know because China doesn't pass a budget like \nours for public knowledge. We know what they have spent, but we don't \nknow how much more they have spent than what they have declared. But we \ncan tell you they are developing anti-access/anti-area denial weapons, \nanti-access weapons. They have tested supersonic missiles fired off \ntheir ships designed to penetrate U.S. missile defense.\n  Here is why they develop these: They want us to know that if we were \nto somehow encroach upon these territories, if there was a conflict in \nAsia and the United States responded militarily, the Chinese can \ndestroy one of our aircraft carriers. The Chinese could destroy one of \nour expensive naval capabilities. That is what they want to be able to \nprove to us. What they hope the calculation will be is that the United \nStates goes: Look. If one day China invades Taiwan, there is nothing we \ncan do about it because we are not going to lose two aircraft carriers \nover a conflict.\n  So that is why they are investing so much in these denial \ncapabilities.\n  They are also investing in space warfare, the ability to blow up our \nsatellites because they know how dependent American national security \nis on having technological advantage. So China is racing to militarize \nspace. It is a very serious threat to keep an eye on.\n  A couple more points on the military. I will close by talking about \nthe Western Hemisphere. The Western Hemisphere poses its own set of \nchallenges as outlined earlier.\n  Let's start with Venezuela. We took up a bill this week on Venezuela. \nIt was an important bill and I am glad we passed it. It is on the way \nto the President's desk. It sanctions human rights violations.\n  The Government of Venezuela is not an ally of the United States. They \nvote against this country in every international forum they can. They \nactively undermine U.S. national security interests. They are serial \nhuman rights violators at home, and we passed a bill that is going to \nsanction the human rights violators. The President has indicated he is \ngoing to sign it, and I think they are going to have a real impact.\n  But Venezuela is headed for catastrophe. This is a rich country, by \nthe way, headed toward economic catastrophe. Basic goods such as \ntoothpaste and toilet paper are unavailable in Venezuela. The \nVenezuelan economy today resembles the Cuban economy. By the way, there \nis no embargo against Venezuela. It just shows socialism doesn't work. \nThey have run out of things to give away.\n  It is not a democracy. Venezuela is no longer a democracy. They have \nsomething called the National Electoral Commission, and they are \nactively, as we speak, trying to replace people not loyal to the \ngovernment on that commission with people loyal to the governing party.\n  The second thing I predict you are going to see is that the current \nPresident of Venezuela, Maduro, is going to move up the elections to \nJuly or June of this year because he knows the longer this crisis goes \non, the less and less popular the government party is going to be. So I \npredict that the Venezuelan elections are going to be moved up, but I \nalso predict financial disaster.\n  In fact, here is a curious thing that we received calls about in the \nlast few days. Venezuela is now begging the Petrocaribe nations, the \nMercosur nations, and the Alba nations to buy Venezuelan products. In \nfact, they are going to the Petrocaribe nations and saying: Instead of \npaying us back in cash, you can pay us by buying our products.\n  There is going to be a financial disaster in Venezuela. The price of \noil and its collapse is not helping them.\n  What I predict is not just financial disaster but severe depression, \nand I predict that in the year 2015 we are going to see severe human \nrights violations, severe repression on the part of the Maduro \nGovernment and everything that goes with it, all the impact that it is \ngoing to have on the region. It is something we need to be beginning to \nthink about because that will lead to mass migration into Colombia and \ninto the United States. That is going to lead to instability in the \nregion that could potentially lead to armed conflict between the \nprofessional armed services of Venezuela and the Cuban agents who now \nfor all intents and purposes run the Cuban Government.\n\n[[Page S6677]]\n\n  Talking about Cuba--a nation I talk a lot about because my parents \ncame from there--I live in a community of people who came from there \nand had to leave for a free economy.\n  Let me begin by saying that Alan Gross is still a hostage. Alan Gross \ncommitted no crime. He did nothing wrong. He is a hostage in a Cuban \nprison, a hostage the Cubans are holding because they want to exchange \nhim for five Cuban spies convicted in the courts of the United States. \nAlan Gross is not a spy. All he wanted to do was help a small Jewish \ncommunity in Cuba, and for that he was jailed. It is outrageous. It \nshows the true nature of this government.\n  We shouldn't be surprised. They still detain as a matter of course \ninnocent people who disagree. Every Sunday they beat up and harass the \nLadies in White, which is a group of mothers who have sons in jail or \nfathers who have been killed or husbands who have been killed or \njailed, who every Sunday march and dress in white to protest the \ngovernment, and every Sunday the government thugs come after them. It \nis shameful that the people know this and look the other way, but that \nis the reality that is happening every single day in Cuba. It is still \ngoing on. It is the most repressive government in the Western \nHemisphere and one of the most repressive governments in the world.\n  They are also a violator of international agreements. We know for a \nfact that a ship going through the Panama Canal from Cuba to North \nKorea was carrying equipment and material in violation of the U.N. \nsanctions on North Korea. The U.N., which is not an easy place to get \nto condemn Cuba, found the exact same thing. And our response to that \nhas been nothing--absolutely nothing. The Cuban Government assisted \nNorth Korea in evading U.N. sanctions, and we have done nothing about \nit.\n  On the contrary, we have people who are saying: Let's lift the \nembargo and normalize relations--which leads me to a point directly \nrelated to this, which is the nomination of Tony Blinken that is before \nthis Senate. I would use every procedural method available to me to \nensure that this Senate will have to take as long as possible to \nconfirm him, and I will tell you why. On three separate occasions I \nasked Mr. Blinken: Is your government going to ignore U.S. law and \nunilaterally change policy toward Cuba? And he would not answer my \nquestion. So until I get a clear answer on that, I intend to hold his \nnomination as long as the rules allow me to.\n  I would like to make one more point about Cuba. In addition to being \nthe ally to every tyrant on the planet--from Assad, to Iran, to Qadhafi \nbefore he fell and died--by the way, Cuba is the home of a significant \nnumber of Medicare fugitives, people who have come to the United States \nand stolen money from Medicare. That is a subject for another day, but \nMedicare fraud in South Florida is rampant. It is out of control. In \nfact, law enforcement officials in South Florida will tell you that if \nyou are only willing to steal $200,000 a month, they will never catch \nyou. An inordinate number of people are coming from Cuba, stealing from \nMedicare, and then when they are about to get caught, they go back to \nCuba with all that money. There are numerous Medicare fugitives in \nCuba. It is hard to believe that they came here and were able to mount \nsuch operations so quickly without assistance from somebody.\n\n  Now we see signals from the White House that we are going to invite \nCuba--that we are open to them being invited to the Summit of the \nAmericas--the Summit of the Americas is a forum for democracy, not for \n20th-century relics such as the Cuban Government. And now there is talk \nof unilateral policy changes. I want us to change policy toward Cuba, \nbut the first step that has to happen is from the Cuban Government. \nThey have to change first.\n  Let me tell you what would happen if we lifted the embargo on Cuba \ntomorrow. What would happen is what is happening now with China. We \npassed a bill today out of Foreign Relations on the issue of Hong Kong, \nand I am getting phone calls in my office from American companies that \ndo business in China that are saying: Hey, why don't you guys drop \nthat? What they are really saying is: Hey, why don't you guys drop \nthat? It is bad for the deal we have going with the Chinese.\n  That is the same thing that will happen. If we lift the embargo, \nAmerican companies will become invested in whatever deal the regime \ngives them, and they will come to DC and lobby on behalf of the \ninterests of that regime without any interest of the freedom and \nliberty of the Cuban people.\n  I will fight with all the marrow in my bones against any sort of \nunilateral change in U.S. policy toward Cuba.\n  From a military perspective, Cuba is not a benign country, although \nthey don't have the military they once had. In fact, there have been \nopen source reports that Cuba is looking to restart, with Russian \ncooperation, an intelligence-gathering station in the city of Lourdes \nin Cuba whose sole purpose is to collect intelligence against the \nUnited States, particularly Southern Command in South Florida. So as we \nlook at the NDAA, that is something to keep in mind.\n  I would close with four points that we should think about as we get \ninto the new year and we debate this bill on national security and \nnational defense.\n  The first is this: We should stop confusing tactics with strategy. We \nhad a debate today in the Foreign Relations Committee about authorizing \nthe use of military force. Everyone wants to debate tactics: Should it \nbe 3 years or 1 year? Should we have ground troops or no ground troops? \nShould we define the geography of where it is and where it isn't?\n  Tactics are not the same thing as strategy, and time and again around \nthe world with many of these problems, this administration has not \narticulated a strategy. They are telling us what we are tactically \ndoing. We are doing airstrikes, imposing sanctions. But they don't tell \nus what the strategy is. What is the strategy behind all these things? \nThe strategy should be clear.\n  We are in favor of a world that is free and a world that is \nprosperous, where more people than ever live in a prosperous middle \nclass so they can buy the things we sell and invent and innovate and \nmake and the services we offer. We want there to be peace and \nprosperity throughout the world, and we believe the best system for \nthat is an international order that respects human rights and democracy \nand freedom and the dignity of every individual. That is our overlying \naim, and of course the security of the United States is deeply tied to \nall of this.\n  In each region of the world, we would have a strategy--a strategy \nthat, because it is backed up by strong national defense, tells our \npartners in Asia that we are here for the long haul. And not only are \nwe here to pivot to Asia, we have something to pivot with through our \nmilitary capability that tells NATO: You still do have a purpose, and \nthat purpose is to ensure the territorial integrity of the nations of \nEurope; a military strategy that tells our partners in the Middle East: \nWe stand with you, and we will do what we need to do to defeat radical \njihadists and prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon. So that is \nimportant.\n  The second thing is that we have to spend money on these things. The \nsequester cuts to the military are unsustainable. At a time when the \nworld has gotten more complicated, where the threats that this Nation \nfaces have gotten more complicated and more difficult to deal with than \never before, we are severely cutting back our military spending in an \nunsustainable way. In fact, no one believed that the budget cuts we are \nfacing in the military now were realistic or sane, for that matter. \nThat is why they put them in that bill I voted against--because they \nthought these budget cuts were so bad, they would force them to \nactually do something about the debt. They underestimated the \nwillingness of this Congress to do bad things, because those cuts are \nhere to stay, and we have the smallest Air Force and Navy at least \nsince the end of World War II, while our potential adversaries are \nramping up military spending and their military capabilities.\n  My third point is directly related to national defense and national \nsecurity. We cannot continue to try to erode our intelligence-gathering \ncapabilities. The threats we face around the world are real and they \nare significant. They are threats from nation states such as Russia and \nChina. They are threats from rogue states such as Iran and North\n\n[[Page S6678]]\n\nKorea. They are threats from nonstate actors such as al Qaeda and ISIL. \nThey are threats from transnational criminal groups who steal the \npersonal data of Americans and who could potentially conduct other \ncyber attacks against our infrastructure.\n  These threats are real, and I hope the day will never come, but if it \ndoes and if another major attack occurs here in the homeland--perhaps \none even worse than 9/11--the first question people are going to ask \nwill be, Why didn't we know about it and why weren't we able to stop \nit? And the answer cannot be because we took apart our intelligence-\ngathering capabilities, because we took down our ability to identify \nthese threats, and we took them down because of conspiracy \ntheories, because we have people running around telling people that all \ntheir phone calls are being listened to, that all their cell phone \ncalls are being tracked. That is false. That is categorically and \npatently false. That is not true. Yet we are prepared to dismantle our \nability to acquire information that could prevent those sorts of \nattacks.\n\n  By the way, these are intelligence capabilities that also give us a \nstrategic advantage over potential adversaries and intelligence-\ngathering abilities that also inform our diplomacy. Yet there are \npeople advocating taking that apart. In fact, just today we had someone \ncome to the floor of the Senate and divulge classified information on \nthe floor of the Senate. Unprecedented, outrageous, irresponsible, and \nunacceptable.\n  Last but not least, we have to truly believe with all our hearts that \nthe world is a safer and better place when America is the strongest \nmilitary power in the world. No nation is perfect. Ours never has \nclaimed to be. But I know of no nation that has used its power more \nbenevolently than we have. It is Americans who have sent their sons and \ndaughters abroad to fight for the freedom and liberty of other people. \nIt is America that has gone abroad to fight against communism and \nradical Islam and nazism and Imperial Japan and other threats to human \ndignity and the survival of mankind, and we did so without taking a \nsingle inch of territory. We didn't turn Iraq into the 51st State. We \ndidn't turn Afghanistan into a U.S. territory.\n  This is a nation that, after we defeated Japan and Germany in World \nWar II, helped to rebuild those countries. Today they are among our \nstrongest allies. This is the country that, even after a ceasefire in \nthe Korean war, still stands so many years later on the frontlines of \nSouth Korea protecting her freedom and territorial integrity to a point \nwhere South Korea--a nation that just two decades ago was a beneficiary \nof global aid--is now a donor; a country that has gone from having an \neconomy smaller than North Korea's to now having one of the top 10 \neconomies in the world. This is the Nation that did that.\n  We are not perfect, but I challenge you to find another nation in \nhuman history that has used its military power for the good of mankind \nmore than we have. The world knows that too. When you talk about \nnational defense, it is not just about bombs and bullets.\n  Let me close with a story I picked up earlier this year when I \ntraveled to Asia. I went to the Philippines, an area badly hit by the \nstorm last year. This area was devastated. These people were already \npoor to begin with, and the typhoon made things even worse.\n  I got to speak to some of the people. I asked them: When did you \nfinally know there was hope? Was it when the humanitarian aid groups \nshowed up or when the U.N. got here? When was it that you finally \nthought that there is hope here?\n  A gentleman turned to me and said: Do you know when I knew there was \nactually some hope? When I woke up one morning and looked to the \nhorizon and there was a U.S. aircraft carrier. That is when I started \nto believe that maybe we are going to make it, maybe things are going \nto be OK.\n  That aircraft carrier didn't stay long, but it stayed long enough to \nmake a difference in those early days after that storm, and it stayed \nlong enough to give people hope. It is the same aircraft carrier they \nsaw off the coast of Haiti after the terrible earthquake. It is the \nsame aircraft carrier they saw off the coast of Japan after they had a \nnuclear accident. That is also America's military power. That is also \nwhat we have done with our national defense capabilities.\n  We have not been perfect, but America has been a source for good in \nthe world. No nation in the history of mankind has ever done more good \nfor the planet and for the people of this Earth than we have, and we \nshould be proud of that. Now is not the time to dismantle that \ncapability. The world needs a strong America today and now more than it \never has.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we are going to pass, sometime tonight, \nbefore 12 o'clock, a resolution that will ensure that the government \ndoes not shut down. The House passed the omnibus. It was by a nice \nmargin--not overwhelmingly, but a nice margin. As a result of that, we \nwill take up the long-term spending bill tomorrow.\n  Senators who want to debate this legislation will have that \nopportunity. The Senate will vote on the long-term funding bill as soon \nas possible. In the Senate, ``as soon as possible'' could be tomorrow, \nit could be 2 days after cloture is filed on it, it could be a lot of \ndifferent times.\n  But we are going to work as hard as we can to expedite things around \nhere. But if we are going to do this tomorrow, we need cooperation from \neveryone. As I indicated, we had a number of things we had to do. We \nhad to keep the government functioning. We are going to do that \ntonight. We are going to do a short-term extension, as I have \nindicated, until we finish this bill. I think the extension will be for \n2 days. That means we have to finish this bill in the next 2 days.\n  We have to finish the defense bill that is now before the body. That \ntime runs out tomorrow afternoon. No one can stop us from the time \nrunning out tomorrow afternoon. We hope to be able to expedite that. \nThere are conversations going on now to make that so we can finish that \nsometime early tomorrow afternoon.\n  I want to take this time, though, to spread on the Record my \nadmiration for the work done by Senator Barbara Mikulski, the \nchairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. This good woman came \nto the Senate when I came. We came together. I was fortunate to be on \nthat Appropriations Committee as a freshman. That was really a big deal \nfor this young Senator. Seniority-wise, there was always one person \nahead of me, and that was Barbara Mikulski. She has done a remarkably \ngood job as a Senator. I have said many times, when we came to the \nSenate together, she was it. There was no other woman here. Look at \nwhat she has done as the matriarch of this body. Everybody looks up to \nher--men and women. She is someone who is admired by everyone. Her \ntaking over this Appropriations Committee was something she had wanted \nto do for a long time. She has done such a good job.\n  She is proud of the committee. She is trying to reestablish the \ncommittee to what it used to be. We as legislators have to recognize we \nhave three separate branches of government. In terms of the \nConstitution they are supposed to be equal. We have had a lot of our \npower taken from us by the executive branch of government. Barbara \nMikulski is trying to reestablish that so we have three separate, equal \nbranches of government.\n  What took place in the House today, a few minutes ago, will help her \nestablish the Appropriations Committee for what it should be. We have \nan obligation as legislators to have congressionally directed spending. \nThat is in the Constitution. All the decisions as to where the money \ngoes should not be made down at 16th and Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  So the bill that she and Congressman Rogers worked on is not a \nperfect bill. But as the Presiding Officer knows as a legislator, there \nare no perfect bills. There are some people who are upset about items \nin this bill. To be candid\n\n[[Page S6679]]\n\nwith you, I am kind of upset about some items in the bill. But this \nbill is so much better than a short-term CR. It would have been--when I \nsay ``short term'' I mean 3 months and do it all over and over again, \nthreatening the government to shut down, especially about the same time \nwe have to raise the debt ceiling again. So I want to end by saying \nthis would never ever have happened but for Barbara Mikulski.\n  Tomorrow should be a very interesting day. With a little bit of good \nfortune, we could complete the spending bill for the country for the \nfiscal year that is fast upon us. We could finish the defense bill and \nthen look to do the tax extenders and completing the work on TRIA, \nwhatever that may be.\n  From that point forward we would work on nominations. We could be out \nof here fairly quickly. But everyone is going to have to work together \nto get this done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                         Omnibus Spending Bill\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I rise to speak on the omnibus spending bill for fiscal \nyear 2015.\n  I wish to thank the Democratic leader, the majority leader, for his \nkind words. But it is not only about his kind words about me, it has \nbeen his advocacy to make sure that as we look at the need for funding \nfor the entire government that there would be no government shutdown \nand no government on autopilot.\n  Just a few minutes ago, the House of Representatives did their part. \nThey passed the omnibus spending bill, passing it 219 to 206. It was \nwell debated and the vote speaks for itself. It now comes to the \nSenate, and I am here tonight to kick off that debate.\n  For hours after hours after hours in the past several days, I have \nheard what is wrong with this bill. I don't dispute my colleagues' \nanalysis, I will debate it, but now we have to start talking about what \nare the good aspects of this bill and why we did this bill in the first \nplace. Tonight I want to remind people what we are doing.\n  First, we are funding the entire U.S. Government's discretionary \nspending. We have $550 billion in the bill for national defense, to \nstand for America, to make sure our troops have the best weapons, the \nbest support, and the best medical treatment--$550 billion, for more \nmoney for peacekeeping, for money to fight ISIL, to refuel an aircraft \ncarrier. We did our job. You will hear more about that.\n  We wanted to also fight Ebola, which had the American people near \npanic this summer. We said we have a plan, working with the \nadministration, and some of the best scientists and thinkers in our own \ncountry, and brave and gallant people such as Doctors Without Borders \nover there. While they make the cover of Time magazine, they are now \ngoing to make the Federal checkbook in the United States of America.\n  We have $5.4 billion to deal with Ebola, a huge sum of money to fight \nit in Africa. It is also to make sure we are ready for any pandemic in \nthe United States.\n  We also have a Samaritan set of money to deal--that is my word--with \nthe Samaritan communities who were willing to take the Ebola patients, \ncare for them, treat them, and make sure there was security for them \nand their surrounding communities. Millions of dollars were spent, \nwhether it was in Nebraska, whether it was in Georgia at Emory.\n  My own home State is home to the National Institutes of Health, where \na patient flew in to a small rural airport. They were ready to accept \nand provide the security down route 270 to get them to the beds at NIH. \nThose communities need to be recognized. We do that.\n  We have money in the bill for national security, but we also have \nmoney for veterans. Oh, we love our veterans. We love to sing songs, we \nlove to wear yellow ribbons, we love to go to concerts. We even love to \nvote for an authorizing bill. I did it. But without money in the \nFederal checkbook, it is a hollow opportunity.\n  So guess what. Your Appropriations Committee, on a bipartisan basis, \nsaid we are going to do something that was never done before. We are \ngoing to put in the money not only to meet what we said we would do--to \nreform health care. No more wait lists, no more backlogs. No more them \nbeing a victim of the dysfunctional Congress if there is a shutdown or \na gridlock.\n  We then did something. We, working with the veterans service \norganizations and the authorizing committee, by Senator Sanders, we \nhave advanced appropriations. So even if there is a shutdown or delay, \nour veterans will be taken care of.\n  There is more money in there for research. There is more money in \nthere for care. There is an extra $40 million to add to the close to $2 \nbillion to deal with the backlog. These numbers are mind-numbing, but \nthe results are not.\n  We have that money and we also increased the DOD defense money for \nmedical research for prosthetic devices, for stunning achievements such \nas in my own Johns Hopkins where they did a limb transplant. Working \nwith Department of Defense dollars, our gifted and talent surgeon was \nable to take a veteran and reinstitute limbs, muscle, and nerve \nendings.\n  This enables them to also come up with a technique to prevent the \nrejection that often comes with transplants. It is stunning. That man \nwill be able to have the use of his arms because of this type of work \nthat we do here and what we do to help him will be able to help \nhundreds, and one day we will be able to help thousands.\n  That is what we do in appropriations. We take good intentions and \nmake them as big dreams as possible. We are very proud of that.\n  The other item we are proud of is on a bipartisan basis we passed the \nchild care and development block grant. Working with Senators Risch and \nBurr of North Carolina, I led that. With the superb help of Senators \nAlexander and Harkin, we passed it.\n\n  But we also wanted to reform our quality standards, regulation \nwithout strangulation. We now know that we are going to have fire and \nsafety inspection facilities, better training for providers, and \nbackground checks to make sure our vulnerable populations are \nprotected. But for everything that we ask, we put in $75 million to be \nable to deal with this. I think that is pretty impressive.\n  The other issue we worked out was how we worked out the college \naffordability. In this program that we passed, we will increase the \nmaximum Pell grant by $100 for a total maximum of $58,530, $100 more. \nThat means you will be able to buy a book, you will be able to pay that \nlab fee if you want to be a nurse or an inhalation therapist, a \nsurgical tech, and so on. But we also reformed the Pell grants, so any \nstudent who simultaneously is working on a GED and a college degree \nwould be eligible for Pell grants.\n  As part of the listening tours that Senator Cardin and I had, we \nfound out that there were many people who at a certain point in life \ndropped out of school. They made a particular choice that they now are \ntrying to compensate for. So they are working on their GED, making \ngreat progress. They have to show that, but simultaneously they are \neligible for that Pell grant so they don't lose time. We have been able \nto do that.\n  There are other aspects related to college affordability, but we also \nwanted to focus on safety issues. We have money now for the 149 air \ntraffic control facilities in rural communities. Those 149 air traffic \ncontrollers--we have the Maryland 5: Salisbury, Easton, Frederick, \nHagerstown, and Baltimore County. I know the Presiding Officer has them \nin Wisconsin. That is taken care of.\n  We also wanted to look at other areas of safety such as food safety. \nThanks to what we have done in this bill, we have funded the FDA so \nthey can meet the new food safety standards we are concerned about.\n  I am also particularly happy and proud of what we did for women. I \nwon't go into all the discussions on ObamaCare, the usual provocative \ntopic such as funding for abortion and very special circumstances. Yes, \nwe will talk about that tomorrow.\n  Do you know what I am happy about? What we did for victims of \nviolence. This legislation has $430 million for the Violence Against \nWomen Act. It is at an all-time high. Again, taking what the \nauthorizers wanted--but they all do conference calls in their home \nState. We actually put money into the Federal checkbook.\n  We also paid special attention to the situation of what happens to \nrape victims. Very often--and I know you talk\n\n[[Page S6680]]\n\nwith the rape victims in your own State or those who are their \nadvocates--they feel doubly victimized. They often feel there was a \nviolent attack on them--so repugnant I don't want even to talk about it \non the Senate floor, which is horrible enough. But when they turn to \nthe system, they often find that the very forensics that are needed to \ngo after the perpetrator are either stuck in a crime lab somewhere in a \nbacklog or, even worse, sitting in a police locker instead of being \ntested. So they wait days, weeks, months, and even years.\n  We have gotten into this, thanks to our Vice President, Joe Biden, \nwho was the originator of the Violence Against Women Act. He asked the \nJustice Department to go to police departments and say where is this \nevidence and why isn't it being processed?\n  They found there were over 400,000 sexual assault kits sitting in \npolice lockers instead of getting tested. Can you imagine? Four hundred \nthousand.\n  Thanks again to the advocates, the best ideas come from the people--I \nthink somebody is calling me now about it.\n  What we have now is we have added a $40 million grant program, again \na bipartisan effort, to go work with local police departments to bring \ndown--where we already know where they have gotten underway with \nexisting funds, they are finding that some of these predators have been \nserial rapists. Some of their cases go back 5, 10, 15 years because of \nthe DNA things we can do. We can do this. We are going to change it.\n  There are other issues I can talk about, droughts, forest fires, all \nof these kinds of things. I will talk about them more tomorrow, but I \njust wanted to show the American people tonight, as we kick off this \ndebate, while we focus on three items--and I don't minimize their \nimportance, I don't minimize the value to debate them. I want people to \nknow what is in this bill.\n  When we had to deal with the omnibus, we had to deal with $1 trillion \nbecause we were stiff-armed, and also we couldn't bring up the bills \none at a time, so we have to bring all but the Homeland Security up \nnow.\n  We faced 98 riders, some of which were highly controversial. We did \nthe best we could with them, and I will have more to say about those \ntomorrow.\n  But while everybody talks about one item or this item, I wanted to \ntalk about some of these items. I really hope we pass this omnibus \nbill, because when we do, our country will be safer because of threats \nover there. We will be safer because of threats at home.\n  But I believe the biggest threats we face are gridlock, deadlock, and \nthe way we paralyze ourselves by making the perfect the enemy of the \ngood. No piece of legislation is perfect. I will be the first to say \nthat in this bill.\n  By the way, people might say: Boy, this is a big bill, Senator \nMikulski. It really is. It is discretionary funding for our entire \nFederal Government, but it is also on the Web site. People can go to \nour individual subcommittees in Defense, Labor-HHS, Interior, \nTransportation and Housing, and read about what we did.\n  I had to summarize here. I was prepared to read them all night, but I \nknow we are anxious to bring this evening to a close. But I wanted to \nopen the debate today to talk about how we tried to govern on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  We have reached across the aisle and we have reached across the \nCapitol dome. The House has done its job. Now I hope we do our job and \nthat within the next 24 hours we pass the omnibus spending bill and \nshow that we can govern, that we will not have a government shutdown, \nwe will not have government on autopilot, and we will be able to fund \nour responsibilities, protect America, and really prepare America for \nboth today and the rest of the 21st century.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, once again, the Senate has an opportunity \nto consider the National Defense Authorization Act. This bill is named \nfor the two retiring chairmen of the Senate and House Armed Services \nCommittees, Senator Carl Levin and Congressman Buck McKeon. Carl Levin \nhas been a fierce defender of Michigan, strong advocate for the men and \nwomen of our armed services, and a friend. When the Senate passes this \nbill, and the President signs it into law, it will be a fitting tribute \nto Senator Levin's storied legacy of public service.\n  This compromise--a comprehensive authorization of the Nation's \nmilitary arm--is far from perfect. No bill is. But this authorization \nprovides support and resources for the men and women who serve in the \nArmed Forces, who defend our Nation, and whose families sacrifice so \nmuch in the name of public service. The bill prepares our country to \nface future challenges, and promotes the goals and values that have \nbecome a hallmark of our national defense.\n  Of primary importance to me, this defense authorization bill protects \nthe Leahy law, the requirements by which we vet the individuals and \nunits of foreign security forces we train and equip. While one \ncomponent of the Leahy law, traditionally incorporated annually in the \nDepartment of State and Foreign Operations appropriations bill as it \nrelates to the activities of the State Department, was made permanent \nin 2012 as section 620M of the Foreign Assistance Act, this Defense \nauthorization bill makes the component of the law as it relates to \nDefense Department activities permanent law.\n  This provision permits human rights training, which is narrowly \ndefined, for individuals who are members of units of foreign security \nforces that have been deemed ineligible under the Leahy law. However, \nthose individuals must not have been involved in violations, the \ntraining must have the concurrence of the State Department, it may only \noccur in the individuals' home countries, the State Department must be \nconsulted on the content, methodology, and intended beneficiaries, and \nthe training is not sufficient for meeting the accountability \nrequirement for purposes of the exception in the law.\n  Some in the Pentagon have suggested that the Leahy law has impeded \ntheir ability to engage with foreign security forces. Not only do the \nfacts prove otherwise, that is the same discredited claim of those who \nhave argued that the CIA's torture of prisoners was legal and made us \nsafer.\n  The United States may have the most powerful military, but that power \nis immeasurably weakened if we fail to uphold the values and principles \nthis Nation was founded on: due process, respect for the rule of law, \nand respect for the laws of war.\n  We should learn from history. When we abandon those values and \nprinciples and support or associate ourselves with foreign forces who \ncommit atrocities, we pay a heavy price.\n  This defense authorization also includes a provision I authored with \nSenator Lindsey Graham to establish a commission on the future of the \narmy. The President's fiscal year 2015 budget proposal reflected many \ntough choices about the future size and shape of each of the services. \nIt also included decisions about the U.S. Army that would irreversibly \nchange the nature of that branch. Most dramatically, the proposal \nincluded a plan to eliminate the Nation's reserve of Apache helicopters \nby consolidating all of them within the active component. Such a move \nraises serious questions about the ability to sustain long-term \noperations or be ready for unexpected contingencies. As cochairs of the \nSenate National Guard Caucus, Senator Graham and I, with the support of \n47 other Senators, proposed legislation to minimize the budgetary \nimpact of these decisions by providing for additional review while \nallowing tough, but noncontroversial changes to go forward. I am \ngrateful to Senator Levin and our partners in the House for supporting \nits inclusion in this broader bill.\n  This authorization bill will provide important support to the men and \nwomen of our Armed Forces and their families. While I do not support \nsome of the included changes to benefits, those that are part of this \nfinal bill are far less severe than originally proposed. With the \nMilitary Compensation and Retirement Commission soon to report, I hope \nwe can finally put an end to what has become an annual effort by the \nDepartment of Defense to draw back benefits already earned by our \nservicemembers. There should be no bait and switch.\n  Unrelated to defense policy, I am grateful that this legislation \nincludes\n\n[[Page S6681]]\n\nan important designation for Vermont. The National Wild and Scenic \nRivers System recognizes and preserves rivers with remarkable scenic \nand recreational value. With the passage of this legislation, Vermont \nwill join 40 other States with designated national wild and scenic \nrivers. This designation of the Upper Missisquoi and Trout Rivers is \nthe capstone of more than 7 years of work, including intense study and \nplanning by the local communities that want to protect the natural, \ncultural, and recreational qualities of these rivers.\n  This defense authorization bill is not perfect; politics as much as \npolicy makes that the case. I am disappointed that this authorization \nfails to build on important progress made last year to streamline the \ntransfer of detainees from Guantanamo Bay and move closer to finally \nshuttering the detention facility there. This compromise bill will \nmaintain the status quo by continuing to prohibit the transfer of \ndetainees to the United States for detention or trial. I am \ndisappointed that a provision contained in the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee version of the authorization that would have provided \nexceptions to this prohibition was removed during negotiations. \nHowever, I am pleased that the bill does not contain the statutory ban \non detainee transfers to Yemen that also was contained in the Senate \nbill.\n  As long as the detention facility at Guantanamo remains open, it \nserves as a recruitment tool for terrorists, and tarnishes America's \nhistoric role as a champion of human rights. The prison facility at \nGuantanamo remains a tremendous waste of taxpayer dollars--costing this \ncountry billions of dollars at a time when budgets are tight and that \nmoney is needed elsewhere. Closing Guantanamo is the morally \nresponsible thing to do; my commitment on that has not wavered.\n  With regard to some of the provisions included in this bill that \nrelate to combatting the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria \n(ISIS), I expect the Department of Defense to abide by the Leahy law. \nThese terrorists pose a threat to the United States and to our \npartners; they must be stopped and brought to justice. But we cannot \nignore our own laws or permit the United States to be implicated, \neither directly or indirectly, in gross violations of human rights when \nwe support either governments or irregular forces in the fight against \nISIS.\n  There have been multiple reports that some in the Iraqi Army and the \nmilitias they fight alongside engage in reprehensible conduct similar \nto the barbaric crimes of ISIS. As a matter of law and policy, we must \ncondemn this. I cannot--and will not--support any effort to weaken the \napplication of the Leahy law to the Iraqi Army or to any entity it is \naligned with.\n  As in every defense authorization bill, there are things in here that \nI support and things I wish were not in here. Compromise is inherent in \nthis process. But we cannot forsake our principles and ideals when it \ncomes to supporting our national defense and the men and women who \nserve. I will support this compromise bill and remain committed to \nensuring that we preserve the values that make this Nation a beacon of \ncivil and human rights around the globe.\n  Madam President, I am grateful that the fiscal year 15 National \nDefense Authorization Act includes an important designation for \nVermont. The National Wild and Scenic Rivers system recognizes and \npreserves rivers with remarkable scenic and recreational value. With \nthe passage of this legislation, Vermont will join 40 other States with \ndesignated National Wild and Scenic Rivers. Designation of the Upper \nMissisquoi and Trout Rivers is the capstone of more than 7 years of \nwork, including intense study and planning by the local communities who \nwant to protect the natural, cultural and recreational qualities of \nthese rivers.\n  This has not been a Federal-led initiative; instead it was an \noccasion for Vermont citizens to work together. The communities along \nthe rivers contacted me in 2006 to request the initial Federal study \nfor this designation. The decision to move ahead was made by local \ncommunities that agreed to specific goals and priorities for these two \nrivers. This designation was put to a vote at the communities' town \nmeetings and was approved by every town that is included in the \nlegislation.\n  National Wild and Scenic status for these rivers will help the local \ncommunities promote recreational use, while also protecting the rights \nand values of landowners who make their homes and livings on the banks \nof these rivers. I am proud that this process has been driven by the \nimpacted communities, working to ensure that the Upper Missisquoi and \nTrout Rivers will forever be enjoyed by fishermen, hunters, and \npaddlers and that water quality will be protected. The benefits will \nextend downstream as far as Lake Champlain and beyond.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President I would like to take a moment to thank a \nwoman whom most Americans do not know but whose name is well-known to \nevery employee of the United States Senate because--among other \nreasons--she signs our paychecks. Nancy Erickson will be leaving the \nSenate at the end of this session.\n  For the last 7 years, Nancy has served as the Secretary of the United \nStates Senate. All told, she has worked for the Senate for 26 years.\n  For those who may not know, the Secretary of the Senate is this \nbody's top appointed position. It is like being CEO of a large \ncorporation. The Secretary oversees two dozen departments--from payroll \nand printing to the Congressional Record. Nancy Erickson is the 32nd \nperson--and the sixth woman--to hold that position. Nancy is a \nconsummate professional who has won the respect of Senators on both \nsides of the aisle. She is unfailingly cheerful and unflappable.\n  Nancy Erickson loves the United States Senate even more than she \nloves the Green Bay Packers--and that is saying a lot. Nancy got the \npolitical bug early. As a fifth grader in Brandon, SD, she campaigned \ndoor-to-door for South Dakota Senator George McGovern in his 1972 \nPresidential campaign. She moved to Washington, DC, after college to \nwork for the Government Accountability Office, which was then known as \nthe General Accounting Office. After 2 years of desperate homesickness, \nshe was ready to pack her bags and head back to South Dakota when she \ngot a better offer.\n  A young South Dakota congressman with a bright future offered her a \njob as his scheduler. His name was Tom Daschle. Over the next 16 years \nTom Daschle moved from serving as a House Member to Senator to Senate \nmajority leader. Nancy moved up the ladder, too, eventually becoming \nSenator Daschle's deputy chief of staff. When Senator Daschle left the \nSenate in 2005, Senator Reid immediately snapped Nancy up to serve as \nhis representative to the Senate Sergeant at Arms. Two years later \nSenator Reid became majority leader and asked Nancy to serve as the \nSecretary of the Senate. Nancy calls being Secretary of the Senate her \n``pinch me job.''\n  Over the course of her 26-year Senate career, there have been \ntraumatic moments. On the morning of September 11, 2001, Nancy was at \nher desk in the Capitol when Capitol Police rushed in and ordered that \nthe building be evacuated immediately, fearful that the Capitol was \nunder terrorist attack.\n  One month later Nancy was one of 28 people in the Senate who were \nexposed to anthrax when a letter carrying the deadly bacteria was \nopened in Senator Daschle's office. Experts estimated that the affected \nstaffers were exposed to between 1,000 and 3,000 times the lethal dose \nof anthrax. Fortunately, with expert medical assistance, no one in the \nSenate was seriously injured in the anthrax attack.\n  To walk back into the Capitol the day after 9/11 took courage. To \nkeep coming back after living through a potentially deadly anthrax \nattack required not just courage but a true devotion to public service \nand a love of this Senate.\n  You can see Nancy's love of this Senate and its history in the \nexquisitely restored Old Senate Chamber, whose renovation occurred on \nNancy's watch. You can see her love of the Senate in the ongoing \nrestoration of the Capitol's magnificent Brumidi Corridors, a project \nthat Nancy has championed.\n  You can see Nancy Erickson's reverence for the U.S. Senate in a \nmassive portrait of one of the giants of Senate history, former \nKentucky Senator Henry Clay. That painting, measuring 11 by 7 feet, was \ndiscovered a few years ago in a storage room in New York State. The \npaint was peeling, and there were holes in the canvas created when a \nhigh school had used it as a basketball backboard. Nancy spearheaded \nthe effort to procure and restore that lost masterpiece. Today, the \npainting of the Senate's ``Great Compromiser'' hangs just off the \nSenate floor--a reminder to all of us of the noble art of principled \ncompromise. We thank you, Nancy, for that reminder and for your many \nyears of service to this Senate and to America.\n  I also want to take a moment to acknowledge Sheila Dwyer, who has \nserved as Assistant Secretary of the Senate since 2007. Majority Leader \nHarry Reid, who paid tribute to Sheila on the Senate floor yesterday, \nappointed her to this post. Sheila has done an outstanding job \noverseeing the departments within the Office of the Secretary and \nassisting in the day-to-day legislative, financial, and administrative \noperations of the Senate. Sheila never forgets the little touches, or \nas any Democratic Senator can tell you, the meals that make the U.S. \nSenate an enjoyable place to work.\n  Sheila first came to Washington, DC, in 1980 as a House page for \nSpeaker Tip O'Neil. Immediately after graduating from Suffolk \nUniversity in Boston, she returned to DC and was hired to work in New \nYork Governor Mario Cuomo's Washington office. She went on to work for \nSenators Charles Robb and Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\n  Sheila was responsible for logistics of not one--but two--Democratic \nnational conventions.

Madam President, I rise today to honor my colleague \nfrom North Carolina, Senator Kay Hagan, who is departing from the \nSenate at the end of this year. Senator Hagan has been a strong voice \nfor North Carolina's families, first during her decade in the North \nCarolina State Senate and during her service here in the United States \nSenate. Over the last two years, I have been consistently impressed \nwith Senator Hagan's compassion for and advocacy on behalf of her \nconstituents and her willingness to forge the tough, bipartisan \ncompromises that our country needs.\n  Kay actually first came to the Senate in the 1970s as an intern in \nthe Capitol, where she operated the elevator that continues to carry \nSenators to and from the Chamber. After finishing her college education \nand pursuing her law degree, Kay became an attorney for North Carolina \nNational Bank and eventually became a vice president in the estates and \ntrust division.\n  Senator Hagan's business and banking experience has been a tremendous \nasset during her time as a member of the banking committee, where we \nserve together. Senator Hagan's understanding of the housing finance \nsystem and commitment to affordable housing was invaluable as she and I \nworked together with a bipartisan group of committee members to draft \nand advance legislation reforming the system to make sure the American \ntaxpayer is protected and made whole. During the debate Senator Hagan \nused her expert knowledge of the industry to craft a commonsense, \nbipartisan solution. Our proposal makes sure taxpayers are never left \nholding the bill again, while preserving the 30-year mortgage and \nsupporting affordable housing--a huge accomplishment.\n  Senator Hagan comes from a family and a State with a rich military \nhistory. Her father and brother both served in the Navy, and her \nhusband, Chip, is a Navy Vietnam veteran. She has diligently supported \nand honored servicemembers and veterans as a member of the Armed \nServices Committee. She visited North Carolina troops in the Middle \nEast to better understand their mission and needs, and she helped found \nthe Military Family Caucus to raise awareness of the difficulties faced \nby those with loved ones abroad. In conjunction with her work on the \nsmall business committee, she introduced legislation to reduce veteran \nunemployment by providing employers a work opportunity tax credit for \nhiring a member of the National Guard.\n  As a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee \nand Chair of the Subcommittee on Children and Families, Senator Hagan \nhas consistently fought to make sure America's children have the \neducation, tools, and resources to build a better tomorrow. In fact, \nSenator Hagan's first bill was on a subject very dear to me--financial \nliteracy. Far too many young Americans fall victim to financial scams \nor take out too many loans because they haven't been given an adequate \neducation on personal finances. Senator Hagan's legislation--which she \nhas pressed every Congress--would have helped States integrate \nfinancial literacy into middle-and high school curriculums. That is the \nkind of commonsense legislation Senator Hagan is known for and Congress \nshould be passing.\n  Senator Hagan has been an outstanding public servant for the people \nof North Carolina. Although I am saddened to see such a well-respected \nfemale colleague depart from the Senate, I know Kay will continue to be \na champion for North Carolina's families in the years ahead, and I wish \nher all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/11/senate-section/article/S6683-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  AMENDING CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE FAA MODERNIZATION AND REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I join my colleague Senator Inhofe in the \npassage of S. 2614. This legislation corrects a glitch in the law that \nwas doing great harm to 100,000 American Airlines employees, including \napproximately 10,000 employees working out of or residing in Ohio. \nNinety-five percent of these workers were unionized.\n  We are talking about pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, ramp \nworkers, and dispatchers, all unionized. Part of the collective \nbargaining agreement was a defined benefit pension plan. These are \nplans where you earn benefits through your hard work, and those \nbenefits provide you with annuitized income for life.\n  When American Airlines went bankrupt, these workers all received a \nsingle lump sum payment. For pilots, these payments were as much as \n$162,000, but the average payment was $120,000. For other workers, \nthese payouts were much, much less.\n  Now, $162,000 may sound like a lot of money, and it is a lot. But not \nwhen it is meant to take the place of your entire pension for what \ncould easily be a 20- or 30-year retirement. What we have done in the \npast for employees at United, Delta, Northwest, and US Airways is allow \nthem to roll this entire amount over into an Individual Retirement \nAccount or IRA.\n  It is important to understand what this is. When you roll over, you \ngenerally do not pay tax on it until you withdraw it from the new plan. \nThe assets in the account continue to grow tax deferred. Deferred is \nthe operative word.\n  This does not mean that the employees do not pay taxes. It means they \nwill pay them as they make withdrawals to finance their own retirement. \nThis bill is needed to give the American Airlines' employees that same \nopportunity. It is a simple fix, and it is the least we can do for \nworkers who work hard and play by the rules, but lost their pensions \nthrough no fault of their own.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/11/senate-section/article/S6683-3", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6683-S6684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BRIAN AHLBERG\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, as I prepare to depart the Senate, I \nwould like to take a few minutes to express my deep appreciation to \nBrian Ahlberg, my chief of staff for the last decade. Of course, every \nSenator knows that the title ``chief of staff'' encompasses a vast \nrange of roles and responsibilities--counselor, confidant, kibitzer, \ntrouble-shooter, day-to-day manager, strategic planner, and, in Brian's \ncase, trusted friend. Brian has excelled in all of these critical \nroles, and I am very grateful to him.\n  Knute Rockne was fond of saying: ``I've found that prayers work best \nwhen you have big players.'' As Senators, we know that it is not enough \nto be on the side of the angels; we have got to have big players. For \nme, that means big intellect, big work ethic, big heart. And those are \nqualities that Brian Ahlberg possesses in superabundance.\n  Brian originally joined my staff in 2003 as legislative director, \nafter a decade of service in that role and others for my great friend \nSenator Paul Wellstone. In short order, I promoted him to chief of \nstaff, and he has served in that role with enormous skill and \nprofessionalism ever since.\n  Staff directors on committees have the challenge of managing large \nstaffs. As chief of staff, Brian has had what is arguably an even \nbigger challenge: managing me. He has done so with great loyalty, \nintelligence, tact, and consistently good judgment. He is the \nproverbial calm amidst every storm. When my Irish is up, Brian's \nNorwegian cool serves as a calming counterweight. He has never \nhesitated to speak up when he thinks I am wrong or misguided--an \ninvaluable service. He has done a great job of allowing me, as Senator, \nto get into just enough trouble to be effective in my own job.\n  It has been said, perhaps only half jokingly, that Senators are a \nconstitutional impediment to the smooth functioning of staff. I long \nago learned to get out of Brian's way and let him manage my far-flung \noperation. We call ourselves Team Harkin--staffers on my Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, on my Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related \nAgencies, and on my personal staff, both in Washington and back in \nIowa. Brian is the impresario who skillfully coordinates their work as \na single, collaborative team, skillfully resolving conflicts and \nkeeping people focused on the mission at hand. I believe that Brian's \nskill in this role is a major reason for Team Harkin's remarkable \nlegislative productivity over the last decade.\n  Brian has a great way of keeping my staff and me focused on what is \ntruly important and strategic, avoiding detours and sidetracks. In \nmeetings and\n\n[[Page S6684]]\n\none-on-one, he functions like a whetstone--his aim is to make things \nsharper, and to cut to the heart of an issue or task.\n  I also appreciate the way Brian interacts with staff. He helps me to \nhire seasoned professionals, and then he empowers them to do what they \ndo best, giving them confidence that he will be there to back them up \nwhen the going gets tough. His authoritative but soft-spoken, even-\ntempered approach seems to bring out the best in people around him.\n  Brian's focus is always on the task, not his ego. Washington is to \nself-promotion what Iowa is to corn and soybeans; but self-promotion is \nthe opposite of Brian's style. He is always quick to spread the credit \naround, especially if that is what it takes to strengthen the team or \nseal the deal.\n  The questions you can always count on Brian to ask are: ``How does \nthis help people in Iowa?'' and ``How does this give a hand up to \npeople who truly need it and deserve it?''\n  Over the years, Brian Ahlberg has become a consummate Washington \nplayer. But he remains a Midwesterner through and through, a passionate \nprogressive like his early mentor Paul Wellstone, with a passion for \nfairness and justice, a determination to make life better for ordinary \nworking Americans.\n  Finally, I want to note that Brian has always been wonderfully \nattentive to my staff members' family needs, doing everything possible \nto accommodate them in times of sickness, bereavement, or emergency. \nCertainly, family comes first in Brian's own life. On that score, I \nrealize that Brian's wife Jodi and sons Anders and Lucas have \nsacrificed because of his long hours at work, and for that I owe them a \ndebt of gratitude.\n  Brian Ahlberg is my colleague, my confidant, my trusted friend. He is \nalso a wonderful public servant. I will always be grateful to him for \nthe personal sacrifices he has made to help me advance my agenda here \nin the Senate. Likewise, I will always be grateful to him for his \nextraordinary service to the people of Iowa and, more broadly, the \npeople of the United States. I wish Brian and his family much happiness \nand success in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/11/senate-section/article/S6684-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DEREK MILLER\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, as I prepare to relinquish the gavel as \nchair of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, I \nwould like to take a few minutes to express my deep gratitude to our \nstaff director, Derek Miller, for his sterling service in one of the \nSenate's most demanding staff positions.\n  Knute Rockne was fond of saying: ``I've found that prayers work best \nwhen you have big players.'' Successful committee chairs in the Senate \nhave the same approach. We know that it is not enough to be on the side \nof the angels; we have got to have big players. Here in the Senate, \nthat means big intellect, work ethic, big heart. Those are qualities \nthat Derek Miller possesses in superabundance.\n  Derek originally came to work for me in 2003, during my tenure as \nchair of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, where \nhe was the lead staffer in our efforts to address the childhood obesity \nepidemic by improving the nutritional content of foods available in \nschools. Derek's goal and mine, simply put, was to get junk food out of \nour schools and to get healthy foods in. Our efforts came to fruition \nwith passage of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, which \nreformed the school lunch program and established national nutrition \nstandards for all foods sold in schools, including foods sold in \nvending machines, school snack bars, and a la carte cafeteria lines.\n  In addition, in the 2008 farm bill, Derek was instrumental in \ndramatically expanding a program I created in the 2002 farm bill to \nprovide fresh produce free of charge to students in elementary schools \nthat have a high proportion of children from low-income families. Also \nin that 2008 farm bill, he spearheaded important reforms to the \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as the food \nstamp program.\n  In 2010, Derek moved to my personal office as legislative director, \nwhere he proved himself to be a gifted parliamentary strategist and \nwhere he combined equal measures of humor and commitment to progressive \npolicy to successfully advance my agenda. It is my hope that his weekly \nemail summations of the Senate floor activity live on in posterity.\n  Early this year I tapped him to lead the staff of the HELP Committee.\n  The ``P'' in the HELP Committee abbreviation stands for ``pensions.'' \nBut we also like to think it stands for ``people.'' Traditionally, the \nHELP Committee has been a powerhouse of progressive legislation--\nlegislation to give people a hand up, provide a ladder of opportunity, \nand expand access to health care and a secure retirement.\n  Under Derek's skilled leadership, the committee has been true to that \ngreat progressive tradition. He has played a critical role in passing \nimportant bipartisan legislation to meet the everyday needs of working \nAmericans. Indeed, amidst a Senate too often mired in partisanship, I \nthank Derek for helping our committee to chart a very different \ncourse--a course of bipartisanship and accomplishment. In this 113th \nCongress, the HELP Committee has passed a remarkable 23 bills signed \ninto law by the President, distinguishing our Committee as the Senate's \nmost productive.\n  But beyond legislative accomplishments, I want to pay tribute to \nDerek's excellence as a manager, as not just staff director but a true \nstaff leader. Derek's colleagues respect that he has no ego, he has \nonly a job to get done--and that is so rare here on the Hill, where \nempire-building and self-aggrandizement are all too common.\n  Derek is respected by staff because his approach is to empower those \naround him, to support them in every way, but to give them plenty of \nroom to do what they do best.\n  He sees the professionals on the HELP Committee as people first, and \nas staffers second. If there is an illness, a pregnancy, or some other \nchallenging circumstance, Derek will move heaven and earth to give the \nstaffer the support he or she needs.\n  Derek is attentive to his colleagues' family needs because, in his \nown life, family comes first. Inevitably, Derek's wife Sun and his son \nPhilip have paid a price because of Derek's long hours at work, and for \nthat I owe them a debt of gratitude.\n  On behalf of my Senate colleagues, and in particular on behalf of \nmembers and staff on the HELP Committee, I thank Derek for his \ndedicated service to the people of the United States. I wish him much \nhappiness and success in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/11/senate-section/article/S6684-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6684-S6685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO ZACHARY SCHECHTER-STEINBERG\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President. I wish to pay tribute and to extend my \nthanks to one of my smartest and most passionate staff members Zachary \nSchechter Steinberg. A native of Iowa City, IA, Zach started with the \noffice as an intern in the summer of 2007. He became an official staff \nmember immediately upon his graduation from Wesleyan University in \n2008. Just 6 years later he serves as the Economic Policy Adviser for \nthe Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and my \nmost trusted advisor on tax, budget and banking issues. Zach is perhaps \nthe strongest and most knowledgeable staff voice in the Senate on \neffectively preserving Social Security and on the critical importance \nof maintaining and strengthening the Social Security Disability \nInsurance program.\n  Zach has the ability to quickly develop a full understanding of very \ncomplicated issues and to work with other staff to forge policy \nsolutions. This is perhaps best illustrated with his work on the Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Although newly \npromoted to legislative assistant, when I was appointed to the \nconference committee to resolve differences between the House and \nSenate bills, he advised me on many narrow convoluted issues. He not \nonly performed well, but won the respect of many of the committee's \nprofessional staff for his ideas. Zach also understands that passage of \nprovisions into law is but one step, and has remained a stalwart \nadvocate of successful implementation of the bill.\n  As many of you here in the Senate know last year saw the retirement \nof Richard Bender, my longest serving\n\n[[Page S6685]]\n\nstaff member and a Senate institution in his own right. It is my firmly \nheld opinion that Richard only allowed himself to begin his retirement \nbecause he was leaving Zach to handle his portfolio. I am also quite \ncertain that Zach is the only staff member during Richard's 35 year \ntenure that he would have felt comfortable leaving in charge.\n  That is because not only does Zach possess a keen intelligence, a \nwork ethic second to none and an innate ability to translate arcane tax \nand budget data into understandable prose--but he has the heart of a \ntrue progressive. Zach cares deeply about the people of Iowa, about the \nfuture of the middle class in this country and about making sure that \nevery American has a fair shot at economic security.\n  It has been a pleasure to watch Zach grow personally and \nprofessionally over the past 6 years--as he transformed from a \nheadstrong intern to one of the most skilled and able staffers in the \nSenate, from a new college graduate to a senior advisor newly married \nto Sarah this past summer.\n  This week I am concluding my 40 years in public office. It has been \nan amazing ride. One of the things that makes it easier to say goodbye \nis that I am leaving behind talented people like Zach from whom I know \nI can expect great things in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/11/senate-section/article/S6685-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JOHN S. PISTOLE\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, it is my great privilege to \nrecognize the distinguished career of John S. Pistole, on the occasion \nof his retirement as the Administrator of the Transportation Security \nAdministration. He has been a dedicated public servant and leader for \nthe past 31 years. Next year, John will take on an exciting new \nleadership role when he returns to his alma mater, Anderson University, \nas its president.\n  I am privileged to have worked with John and received his counsel on \nimportant issues like addressing the terrorist threats facing our \nNation in the post-9/11 era, and helping to guide the FBI and TSA to \nsuccessfully meet the challenges brought on by those threats.\n  Throughout his career, John has taken on many of the most challenging \nroles in law enforcement. He's fought against organized crime in the \nFBI and led frontline counterterrorism efforts as head of the TSA. \nHowever, for a person who has had to maintain a tough exterior in these \nroles, John has remained thoughtful, compassionate, and courteous--\nimportant traits which he demonstrated in his appearances before the \nCommerce Committee.\n  After earning his law degree at Indiana University in 1981 and \nspending 2 years in private law practice, John decided to enter public \nservice by joining the FBI. John rose through the ranks as a special \nagent in Minneapolis and New York. He worked hard--first becoming a \nsupervisor at FBI Headquarters, where he was recognized as a role model \nfor new FBI agents, and then chosen to be an instructor at the FBI \nAcademy. A few years later, John was recognized for his capabilities \nwith an opportunity to teach the first sessions at a new International \nLaw Enforcement Academy in Budapest.\n  In the late 1990s, John got involved with the FBI's efforts to fight \nwhite-collar crime. In Indianapolis, he created task forces fighting \nfraud and public corruption, and was promoted to Assistant Special \nAgent in Charge at the Boston Field Office. When Egypt Air Flight 990 \ncrashed off the coast of Rhode Island, John investigated this aviation \nattack that would serve as a prelude to his post-9/11 roles.\n  When our Nation was attacked on September 11, 2001, John had just \nbeen assigned to the Inspections Division at FBI Headquarters though he \nwas quickly reassigned to help build FBI's Counterterrorism Division. \nHe rose steadily through the ranks, eventually serving as the FBI's \nDeputy Director for more than 5 years. John's exemplary service in that \nrole, combined with his experience in counterterrorism and excellent \nmanagement of and care for the FBI workforce, culminated in 2010 when \nhe was nominated to be the TSA Administrator.\n  John assumed the leadership of TSA at a time when the agency had been \nwithout a confirmed administrator for a year and a half. During this \ntime, the agency had been grappling with the fallout from the Christmas \nDay attack of 2009, and had become a political and media punching bag. \nTSA needed a strong leader to take on the formidable task of improving \nthe agency's stature. TSA needed to be effective in its duty to protect \nour Nation, while also finding a way to respond to the public outcry \nover onerous and invasive search procedures. TSA needed to deal with \ndissatisfaction within its own ranks, while navigating a tough fiscal \nenvironment. We were fortunate when John accepted the President's \nnomination and was confirmed by the Senate unanimously to this \nimportant role.\n  Under John's exceptional leadership, the TSA has maintained a \ncompelling track record in preventing terrorist attacks against our \nNation's transportation networks. The agency has taken a more risk-\nbased approach to security so as to lessen the burden on the average \nAmerican traveler. Many people point to the TSA's successful PreCheck \nprogram, which I signed up for last week, as an example of John's great \nwork. PreCheck is popular because it makes airport security more \nconvenient and predictable, while freeing up TSA resources so the \nagency can be more focused on high-risk areas.\n  While John was improving both TSA's effectiveness and the security \nexperience for the traveling public, he was simultaneously focusing on \nimproving the TSA workforce. By exemplifying the traits he expected of \nhis officers, and by taking the time to meet with his workforce and \naddress their concerns, he earned their loyalty.\n  John took important steps to implement policies that would hold TSA \nstaff accountable, and he also demonstrated that security interests can \nbe safeguarded while allowing officers to unionize. This was a great \nstep forward for officers' labor rights, and has provided a \nconstructive way to handle officers' concerns.\n  Appointed from outside the organization, John quickly earned the \nrespect of TSA employees, who then supported him in reforming outdated \npolicies. When TSA moved away from its one-size-fits-all approach, his \nworkforce overcame many challenges to implement a more complex risk-\nbased security process. Without the support John earned from TSA \nemployees, that shift would not have been possible. We will always want \nbetter security and more convenience for less cost, and John has done \nbetter than anyone yet at striking the right balance.\n  John Pistole has long shone as a beacon of integrity in government \nservice. Today it gives me great pleasure to commend him--and thank \nhim--for his enormous contributions to improving the Nation's security. \nI am grateful for his service to this country and it is an honor to \ncall him a friend. I wish John and his family the best as he embarks on \na new chapter in his distinguished career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/11/senate-section/article/S6685-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DANIELLE HANSON\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

Madam President, I wish to recognize Mr. William ``Bill'' \nLovelady, Jr., for his 34 years of service in the U.S. Army.

He also \nworked for the Vicksburg District of the Corps as a trial attorney. In \nthese capacities, Bill played an instrumental role in the successful \nexecution of the command's missions, particularly regarding research \nand development.

He has been recognized by \nchief counsels as an example for other legal managers in the command, \nincluding his selection as a charter member of the Chief Counsel's \nManaging Partners Group, board of directors. This group, comprised of \nsenior Corps attorneys, is responsible for recommendations to improve \nthe delivery of legal services. Bill's exceptional legal advice, \nacumen, and sound judgment were no doubt of immense value to this \ngroup.\n  Bill has also served as an advisor to the ERDC Installation Planning \nBoard, ERDC Program Budget Advisory Committee, ERDC-Vicksburg Site \nPartnership Council, ERDC Special Recognition Committee, and ERDC \nSenior Anti-Terrorism Steering Committee. He is a member of the Federal \nLaboratory Consortium Legal Support Subcommittee and an active \nparticipant in the Department of Defense, DOD, Technology Transfer \nIntegrated Project Team.\n  In 1999, Bill worked tirelessly in the reorganization of the Corps' \nlaboratories to establish the ERDC. He helped develop plans, worked to \nimplement them, and solved numerous leadership, administrative, labor-\nmanagement, and legal challenges. In reviewing all aspects of the \nreorganization plans, he ensured that R leadership was advised of \npotential legal concerns and solutions through the process. Moreover, \nhe effectively assumed leadership over the geographically dispersed and \nformerly independent legal assets of the Corps' laboratory system. \nBecause of the legal team's substantial contributions, ERDC's structure \nand operating mode have served as a model for delivery of legal \nservices across the Corps.\n  Bill has always been a proven manager and adviser. In 1998, a new \nhuman resources system was instituted under one of nine congressionally \nauthorized science and technology laboratory personnel management \ndemonstration projects. Bill applied his leadership and legal \nexperience to identifying the distinctions between the features of the \nproject and the basic Federal personnel system. His advice was critical \nto implementation strategies and problem-solving during the transition.\n  Bill is the coauthor of the ``Research & Development Partnering \nHandbook,'' a comprehensive guide that collected all R partnering \nauthorities, pursuant to the Technology Transfer Act. He has assisted \nin the negotiation and resolution of complicated legal issues involving \nthe licensing of ERDC-developed technologies. He also has played a key \nrole in supporting ERDC's laboratories with the drafting and \nnegotiating of domestic and international patent licenses, cooperative \nresearch and development agreements, education and interagency \npartnership agreements, and service agreements. These instruments have \nseen ERDC partner with State and local governments, other Federal \nagencies, colleges, universities, and private companies.\n  Since the early 1990s, Bill has also provided legal advice and \nassistance for the Department of Defense's High Performance \nSupercomputing Modernization Plan. He was essential to the \nestablishment of DOD's first High Performance Computing Resource Center \nand recently addressed issues involving access to DOD's high \nperformance supercomputing facilities.\n  In short, Bill has been vital to the Engineer Research and \nDevelopment Center management team and its success. His friendly, \noutgoing personality only adds to his professionalism. On a personal \nnote, I would add that he has been a close friend of mine for over four \ndecades and his wife Dianne has been a lifelong friend. I wish them \nboth the best in this new chapter of their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/11/senate-section/article/S6686-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        RECOGNIZING SUN WOO PARK\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, today I wish to recognize \nPortsmouth resident grand master Sun Woo Park--an exceptional New \nHampshire citizen who has devoted his life to teaching martial arts and \nserving his community.\n  Sun Woo Park immigrated to the United States from Korea in 1985. \nShortly after settling in Portsmouth, he opened Park's Taekwondo \nSchool, a world-class taekwondo training center. In fact, Park's is one \nof the only taekwondo schools in the world to have eight practicing \nMasters who learned under the same grand master.\n  During his nearly three decades of teaching taekwondo, thousands of \nseacoast area students have developed self-esteem, self-control, \nconfidence, and fitness through studying the key elements of martial \narts. Sun Woo Park even brought taekwondo to the University of New \nHampshire, founding a taekwondo club there in 1995.\n  On June 16, 2000, Sun Woo Park proudly became a U.S. citizen. True \ncitizenship means serving your country, your community, and your fellow \ncitizens, and Sun Woo Park has done just that.\n  He is a founding member and the current president of the Korean \nAmerican Society of New Hampshire. Every year since 1987, he has \norganized an event to honor the brave service and sacrifice of New \nHampshire's Korean War veterans. He has even been honored by the \nPresident of the Republic of Korea, Noh Moo Hyun, for his service on \nbehalf of Korean war veterans.\n  Sun Woo Park has also been quietly helping his local community in \nmany other ways. He is held numerous fundraisers in support of the \nSaint Charles Children's Home in Rochester, NH, as well as many other \nlocal schools and nonprofits.\n  I am pleased to join the citizens of New Hampshire and all of grand \nmaster Sun Woo Park's students in wishing him all the best in his \nfuture endeavors.

Madam President, today I wish to recognize an \noutstanding New Hampshire citizen, Mr. Gary Frost. Gary will retire at \nthe end of this year after serving as the CEO of the Boys and Girls \nClub of Manchester for 26 years.\n  Gary grew up in Keene and graduated from the University of New \nHampshire. He has devoted his life to improving the lives of children \nand New Hampshire citizens in need. In his 37-year tenure at the Boys \nand Girls Club of Manchester, it has become a safe and welcoming place \nfor Manchester's youth to study, play and find a hot meal.\n  When Gary first joined the organization, the club was housed in one \nbuilding on the corner of Union and Lowell Streets in Manchester. One \nof his greatest accomplishments was spearheading the $7.2 million \ndollar capital campaign to renovate and expand the Union Street Club \nHouse so that the organization could serve more children. Today, under \nGary's capable leadership and steady hand, the Boys and Girls Club now \nextends across an entire city block and serves over 600 children a day.\n\n[[Page S6687]]\n\n  Those who work with Gary describe his deep commitment to and \ncompassion for the children he works with and his community.\n  In addition to his work transforming the Boys and Girls Club, Gary \nhas served Manchester in many other ways. He was an integral member of \nthe committee that brought the Verizon Wireless Arena to Manchester, an \nimportant addition to the city's cultural offerings. He's also been a \nlongtime member of the Manchester Rotary Club.\n  I hope Gary enjoys retirement at his camp on Newfound Lake and \nspending time with his wife Dotti and his two daughters, Abby and Kara. \nI join the City of Manchester and residents across the Granite State in \nthanking Gary for his service and wishing him all the best for a long, \nhappy and fulfilling retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/11/senate-section/article/S6687-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO FRANK BIGGER\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I wish to honor Frank Bigger, \nwho will retire as the Pocahontas Mayor after 4 years of public service \nto the citizens of Arkansas in this elected position.\n  Frank was inspired to run for city mayor at 67, the first political \noffice he has held. Frank ran on the platform of economic prosperity \nand job creation. In that light, he fought hard alongside the Chamber \nof Commerce and the Intermodal Authority to bring a Poultry, Egg \nCompany, PECO, processing facility to the county. This created more \nthan 1,000 local jobs and led to improved infrastructure to accommodate \nthe business.\n  Frank helped the community overcome the worst flooding residents \nremember. Highways, bridges and businesses were closed because of \nseveral feet of water from a levee breach of the Black River. Under \nFrank's leadership, Pocahontas recovered.\n  Before serving as mayor, Frank graduated from Arkansas State \nUniversity and served on the Black River Technical College board of \ntrustees. In 1996, he retired as president from what is now Pinnacle \nFrame and Accent, and has also worked as a part-time bank owner and has \nowned local cattle farms.\n  My staff and I have enjoyed working with Mayor Bigger on the projects \nimportant to Pocahontas.

Madam President, Jermyn and Northeastern \nPennsylvania lost a long-treasured member of the community when Leo \nMoskovitz passed away on November 24 at the age of 109. Although he \nlived for well over a century, his death feels premature to his family \nand his community. His wife of 45 years, Ann, described him as one of a \nkind, a fantastic man in every sense of the word. His contributions to \nthe Commonwealth, both public and private, are many and will not be \nsoon forgotten. As one of Northeastern Pennsylvania's true pioneers, he \nhelped transform the region's economic and cultural outlook over the \npast century. Those who knew him likened him to a real-life history \nbook, reciting stories from 80 or 90 years ago as if they had happened \nthe day before. On any day of the week, he could catalogue the many \nevolutions the greater Scranton region went through with perfect \ndetail.\n  As founder and president of the First National Bank of Jermyn, Leo \npresided over significant growth in the bank's assets, while always \noffering opportunity to the small business owners and people of \nLackawanna County. He was a banker who bet on people and usually won \nfor all concerned. Leo was ahead of his time in many ways, including \npromoting women in an era when such a practice was far from \ncommonplace. From the vocational schools he helped establish, to the \nnumerous art and cultural organizations he and his wife supported \nthroughout the region, Leo Moskovitz's love and compassion for his \ncommunity and its people endured for over a century, and will continue \nto shine for many years to come.\n\n\n                          FAR EXCEPTION THREE\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, the Mercer Engineering \nResearch Center, or MERC, is the nonprofit, research and applied \nengineering arm of Mercer University, a private university founded in \n1833 and located in a state-of-the-art research facility in Warner \nRobins, GA; just a short drive from Robins Air Force Base. For over 175 \nyears, the University has served Georgia as a highly respected \neducational institution.\n  In 1984, the School of Engineering was established at the Macon, GA, \ncampus with the charter class beginning studies in 1985. Two years \nlater, MERC was established under the School of Engineering to provide \nlocally available engineering and scientific services with critical \nspecialized skills to the Warner Robins Air Logistics Center, while \nsimultaneously providing a workload support-base to the Mercer School \nof Engineering in its development of high-technology skills in the \nMiddle Georgia area.\n  MERC has a highly qualified professional staff, complex tools and \ntest equipment, and extensive technical capability in the fields of \naircraft structural analysis and design, flight test instrumentation, \nreverse engineering and prototyping, laboratory structural testing, \nelectronic warfare software algorithm development, web deployed \napplications with integrated database access, industrial engineering \nand logistics.\n  MERC also employs engineering interns providing an avenue for \nstudents to get real world, Air Force-related experience, and today \nthey are the largest source of entry-level engineers for Robins Air \nForce Base while also providing superior support to all other military \nservices, large and small business, and other research agencies.\n  MERC has been able to maintain a successful, strategic relationship \nwith Robins Air Force Base because of its Ph.D-level knowledge of \nsponsors' requirements and problems; its developing capability; its \nbroad corporate knowledge and quick response capability; independence \nand objectivity; freedom from conflicts of interest; and lower costs. \nTheir demonstrated ability to provide efficient, cost effective \nsolutions to pressing research and development problems established \nMERC as the preferred source of real solutions to real problems\n  Over the last few years, however, the Air Force and the Robins Air \nForce Base Small Business Office have emphasized increasing the \npercentage of small business contract awards; an initiative not without \nmerit for sure. However, their interpretation and application of the \nFederal Acquisition Regulations, or FAR, has resulted in MERC \nessentially being barred from providing contracted services the likes \nof which they have provided with unmatched efficiency and significant \nsavings for the Air Force for almost 30 years.\n  Since nonprofit research organizations by definition cannot be small \nbusinesses, they are excluded by law from competing for small business \nset-asides. However, the FAR offers seven equal and independent \nstatutory authorities the U.S. government can apply which authorize, \nunder certain conditions, contracting without providing for full and \nopen competition.\n  Senior Air Force leadership at Robins Air Force Base have long \nsupported the use of those exceptions, specifically, the so-called \n``Exception Three'' which allowed for contacting without providing for \nfull and open competition ``when it is necessary to award the contract \nto a particular source or sources in order to establish or maintain an \nessential engineering, research, or development capability to be \nprovided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a \nfederally funded research and development center.''\n  That application of the FAR allowed Robins AFB to maintain the \nessential engineering capabilities of MERC to augment their own because \nunder FAR Exception Three, MERC received sole source contracts when \ntheir expertise, flexibility and lower costs demanded it.\n  In recent years, however, the Small Business Office at Robins Air \nForce Base has approved the use of only one of the FAR exceptions, that \nbeing when ``only one responsible source and no other supplies or \nservices will satisfy agency requirements.''\n  This application of the FAR, or misapplication if you will, makes it \nvirtually impossible for the Robins Air Force Base to award certain \ncontracts to any entity other than small businesses. It translates to \nhigher costs and greater inefficiencies. Robins Air\n\n[[Page S6688]]\n\nForce Base continues to seek MERC's unique expertise and essential \nengineering skills, but is forced to pass money through small and large \nbusinesses to MERC adding time and cost to the product/service \ndelivery. By demanding more awards go to small businesses, the \ngovernment also suffers a loss of intellectual property, IP, since MERC \ntransfers ownership of all said property back to the U.S. Government, \nwhile small businesses can retain IP for future revenue.\n  You would be hard pressed to find any bigger supporter of small \nbusinesses in the Senate than myself. However, when it comes to \nensuring our men and women fighting overseas for our freedom have what \nthey need to get the job done, there are only three things I care \nabout: cost, schedule, and performance. Our men and women in uniform \ndeserve that.\n  In this era of defense spending austerity, the Air Force can ill \nafford the unintended consequences of precluding entities that supply \nvital complex engineering solutions, along with the added benefit of \ncross pollination of educational experience between government \nemployees, both civilian and military, and the best in the academic \nengineering community, from receiving business simply to meet a set-\naside quota.\n  This issue is about ensuring Robins Air Force Base maintains \nessential engineering capabilities to supplement their own and their \nability to swiftly and inexpensively select the most capable \norganization to provide the best product or service at the best value \nto the government. The Small Business Office at Warner Robins, in their \nattempt to carry out the Air Forces' broader goal of increasing small \nbusinesses participation, is jeopardizing the very survival of \ninstitutions provided for and protected by the FAR.\n  By selectively applying the FAR exceptions, the Air Force is ignoring \nthe intent of the acquisition regulations. It is certain to destroy \nthese few vital educational links between academic institutions and \ngovernment engineers that need that level of expertise. More \nimportantly, by ignoring FAR Exception Three, the government is \nlimiting its ability to pursue the best solutions at the best price. We \ncan ill-afford such consequences in this period of economic austerity, \nsimply in the name of fostering the growth of small businesses.\n  I was encouraged in September when the Air Force took a step in the \nright direction with their approval of a Justification and Approval, \nJ, for the use of other than full and open competition for an \nengineering, research and development contract in support of \ntechnologies and methodologies applicable to aging aircraft and support \nequipment. The contract will maintain essential engineering, research, \nand development capabilities at Robins AFB through support provided by \nMERC.\n  I am hopeful this recent development is indicative of a new way of \ndoing business at Warner Robins. In case it is not, I urge my \ncolleagues here in the Senate to remain vigilant in their oversight \nresponsibilities, and I renew my call to the Secretary of the Air Force \nto ensure local commands apply the FAR as written so as to guarantee \nour men and women in uniform have exactly what they need, when they \nneed it, and at a price that is in keeping with our responsibilities as \nstewards of the American tax dollar.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/11/senate-section/article/S6688-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING MARY ANN MOBLEY\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, my State has lost one of our \nfinest citizens. Mary Ann Mobley, a friend to many and one of our best \nknown Mississippians, passed away Tuesday. Mary Ann was the first young \nwoman from Mississippi to be crowned Miss America, an accomplishment \nthat was a source of great pride to my State. I got to know Mary Ann at \nthe University of Mississippi, where she was really a superstar and a \nfine actress. Incidentally, we were cast in a University Players \nproduction of ``Tiger at the Gates'' at Ole Miss. She made \nMississippians proud of her success as an entertainer in Hollywood and \na person who kept our State close to her heart throughout her career.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a December 11, 2014, article from the \nClarion-Ledger newspaper titled ``Mary Ann Mobley `never forgot her \nroots' '' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Clarion-Ledger, Dec. 11, 2014]\n\n                Mary Ann Mobley `Never Forgot Her Roots'\n\n                           (By Billy Watkins)\n\n       They danced in the streets of Brandon the night one of \n     their own, Mary Ann Mobley, was crowned the 1959 Miss \n     America.\n       ``That's not just a saying, that's a fact,'' said Waymon \n     Tigrett, 70, who grew up with Mobley and has owned Brandon \n     Discount Drugs the past 46 years. ``They put a jukebox out by \n     the statue in the middle of Main Street, ran an extension \n     cord out to it and that thing blared music all night. People \n     danced and carried on for hours. It was a true celebration.\n       ``You have to remember, Brandon was only about 2,000 people \n     back then. It was a small, isolated town. And all of a \n     sudden, a girl we all know is on television and winning Miss \n     America. That was a huge deal back then. And still is to \n     us.''\n       Mobley, Mississippi's first Miss America, died Tuesday \n     after a long battle with breast cancer. She was 77.\n       Services will be 1 p.m. Monday at Christ United Methodist \n     Church in Jackson. Visitation will be Sunday from 4-6 p.m. at \n     Parkway Funeral Home in Ridgeland.\n       Mobley won the crown in September 1958, the same year she \n     graduated from the University of Mississippi.\n       ``She never forgot her roots, where she came from,'' said \n     Tigrett, who lived four houses down from Mobley on what is \n     known now as Mary Ann Drive. ``Rankin County used to own \n     Rankin General Hospital, and we had a big benefit every year, \n     Affair of the Heart, to raise money for it. Mary Ann would \n     come back from Hollywood and emcee it.\n       ``She remembered everybody. She treated us just the same. \n     She never got too big for us. She was the same girl who used \n     to ride palomino horses in the pasture behind her house.''\n       Judy Trott, former dean of students at Ole Miss, said \n     Mobley ``was always generous with her time when it came to \n     Ole Miss.''\n       ``She would come back and oversee the Miss University \n     pageant--the one she won to send her to Miss America--and the \n     Parade of Beauties, another pageant that we still hold,'' she \n     said.\n       Trott wasn't surprised Mobley went on to become a popular \n     film and TV actress.\n       ``Mary Ann was groomed for it,'' she said. ``She had great \n     talent, a great voice. Her mother would often come to \n     pageants up here with her, and she was outgoing and bubbly. I \n     guess that's where Mary Ann got her personality.\n       ``I remember after one of the pageants taking Mary Ann and \n     her mother down to the Holka, a place you could get cake and \n     coffee. We were in there for three hours that night. It \n     wasn't just the students talking to Mary Ann, it was Mary Ann \n     talking to the students. She was interested in them, wanted \n     to know their plans, their goals. She was extremely warm and \n     outgoing. It was easy to love her.''\n       Hometown friends, saddened by her death, quietly reminisced \n     Wednesday.\n       Mobley not only battled breast cancer in recent years but \n     suffered carpal tunnel syndrome in both hands and arms. \n     Emails became shorter as every letter of every word required \n     effort.\n       Phone calls to check on the people of her hometown also \n     became shorter, but no more infrequent. If the conversation \n     ever turned toward her own problems, Mobley would laugh and \n     find a way to quickly change the subject.\n       Some of the memories stirred laughter. Such as the time \n     Mobley was to perform at Brandon High School but the family \n     car wouldn't crank. Her mother saddled a horse for the 5-mile \n     ride, and she and Mary Ann made it there in time.\n       And the night Brandon folks danced in the street, the \n     celebration spread to the capital city. A few town residents \n     decided it would be a good idea to take the volunteer fire \n     department's truck and drive it up and down Jackson's Capitol \n     Street with the siren blaring. Jackson police eventually \n     tired of the racket and impounded the truck.\n       Mobley also became a filmmaker, producing documentaries in \n     Cambodia, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Somalia, Kenya, Zimbabwe and \n     the Sudan.\n       Mobley's husband of 45 years, TV personality Gary Collins, \n     died in 2012. The couple had one daughter, Clancy Collins-\n     White.\n       Collins-White phoned friends Tuesday in Brandon to tell \n     them of Mobley's death.\n       Three other Mississippians have won the Miss America crown: \n     Lynda Lee Mead of Natchez, 1960; Cheryl Prewitt of Ackerman, \n     1980; and Susan Akin of Meridian, 1986.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/11/senate-section/article/S6688-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6688-S6689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING THE NATIONAL FINALS RODEO\n\n Mr. HELLER.

The \nNational Finals Rodeo has been held in Las Vegas for the past 30 years \nof the event's 55 year history. Often noted as the foremost\n\n[[Page S6689]]\n\nchampionship rodeo event in the United States, I, along with my fellow \nNevadans, am proud that it has called the Silver State home for so many \nyears.\n  The National Finals Rodeo was established in 1958 by the Professional \nRodeo Cowboys Association in order to determine the world champions in \nvarious events from bull riding to tie-down roping. First held in \nDallas in 1959, the National Finals Rodeo was held in many different \ncities until 1984, when Las Vegas became its permanent home. An \nintegral part of the Las Vegas community for 30 years, the National \nFinals Rodeo has brought more than 170,000 fans annually to see some of \nour Nation's toughest cowboys and cowgirls compete in 10 days of \ncompetition. This event has become a yearly tradition not only for \nNevadans, but for people across the nation and the world. As rodeo \nlovers and horse enthusiasts, my wife Lynne and I were thrilled to \nattend this year's event.\n  The National Finals Rodeo offers Nevadans and rodeo goers nationwide \na place to truly experience the gritty, energetic entertainment the \nWild West is best known for. In one of the hardest hit regions during \nthe recession, this event plays an integral role in Nevada's tourism \neconomy. Tourism continues to be a prominent economic driver within the \nSilver State, and I am thrilled to learn this event will be a part of \nthe Las Vegas community through 2024.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Nevadans in recognizing the \nNational Finals Rodeo, a special event that has proudly called Las \nVegas home for the past 30 years, and I would like to offer the best of \nluck to all who are participating in this year's events.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/11/senate-section/article/S6689-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BRIAN KROLICKI\n\n Mr. HELLER: Madam President, I wish to congratulate Lieutenant \nGovernor Brian Krolicki, of Stateline, for his decades of service to \nthe State of Nevada.

While attending Stanford University, Lieutenant \nGovernor Krolicki fell in love with Lake Tahoe, NV. After earning a \nbachelor's degree in political science, he moved to Nevada. While \nmaintaining his Silver State residence, he went on to become an \ninvestment banker in New York City and San Francisco. Lieutenant \nGovernor Krolicki's public service career began in 1990 when he was \ntapped to serve as chief deputy treasurer to then-State treasurer Bob \nSeale. His many years of financial experience made him an ideal \ncandidate for State treasurer after the retirement of Treasurer Seale. \nUpon being sworn in as treasurer in 1999, he began to tirelessly devote \nhis efforts to the people of Nevada. He created the Nevada college \nsavings plans, and was responsible for the successful rollout and \nadministration of the Governor Guinn Millennium Scholarship. Under his \nleadership, Nevada saw its first upgrade in credit ratings in nearly 30 \nyears.\n  After serving 8 years as treasurer, he sought the lieutenant \ngovernorship in 2006 and won by a sizeable margin. During Lieutenant \nGovernor Krolicki's two terms of service, he has ably focused on \nadvancing the Silver State's tourism industry all over the Nation and \naround the globe. Lieutenant Governor Krolicki has served as chairman \nof the Reno Tahoe Winter Games Coalition since 2006, and is actively \nfighting for northern Nevada to host the 2026 Olympic Games. This year, \nmy wife Lynne and I were honored to participate in Nevada's 150th \nanniversary celebrations. As chairman of the Nevada Sesquicentennial \nCommission that successfully carried out over 500 events, Lieutenant \nGovernor Krolicki has once more shown his dedication to the State of \nNevada.\n  As a devoted husband and proud father to three girls, Lieutenant \nGovernor Krolicki stands as a shining example of someone who has \ndedicated his life to serving his community. I am grateful for his \ndedication and commitment to the people of the State of Nevada. He \nexemplifies the highest standards of leadership and community service \nand should be proud of his long and meaningful career. Today, I ask \nthat all of my colleagues join me in thanking Lieutenant Governor \nKrolicki for his service to the Silver State and I offer my deepest \nappreciation for all that he has done to make Nevada an even better \nplace. I offer my best wishes for many successful and fulfilling years \nto come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/11/senate-section/article/S6689-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MR. THOMAS WELCH\n\n Mr. KING. Madam President, I wish to honor the career of a \ndear friend and former colleague, Mr. Thomas Welch, who is set to \nretire this year as Chairman of the Maine Public Utilities Commission. \nTom's tremendous 35-year career bridged both the public and private \nsectors and has always been defined by a steadfast dedication to \nservice and, of course, an unwavering love for the State of Maine.\n  As Governor, I had the privilege of calling on Tom to lead the Maine \nPublic Utilities Commission, also known as the MPUC, and that is the \nsame position that he was again nominated for and currently holds under \nGovernor Paul LePage.\n  Serving as Chairman of the MPUC is, at times, a thankless job, but it \nis also one of monumental importance. Tom's job is central to keeping \nthe lights on, the water flowing, the heat coming, and the people of \nMaine connected through reliable phone and Internet services. In my \nadministration--just as he does today--Tom performed those tasks and so \nmuch more with outstanding acumen, keen judgment, and, I might add, \nwith one eye always towards the future. In fact, it is no exaggeration \nto say that Tom, perhaps more than anyone else across the State, played \na pivotal role in ushering Maine's public utilities into the 21st \ncentury.\n  A generation of Maine's young minds can thank Tom for laying the \ngroundwork that hastened their journey into the digital age. Tom \nrecognized early on that the Internet was quickly evolving into a more \ndynamic and powerful tool that, when placed in the hands of our \nstudents and our communities, could become a catalyst for digital \nlearning, a driver of economic growth, and an architect of intra-\npersonal connections that were no longer limited by geographic \nconstraints. With that immense potential in mind, he worked tirelessly \nto implement the Federal E-Rate program, which delivered Internet \naccess to schools and libraries across the State--and with that \nnewfound Internet access, he delivered new and unprecedented \nopportunities to people all across Maine, an achievement so fundamental \nand so critical to our daily lives that it simply cannot be \nunderstated.\n  As high energy prices across Maine continued to weigh heavily on the \npockets and minds of people across the State, Tom endeavored mightily \nto deregulate Maine's electric industry to lower energy prices, and \nmost recently, he lead the charge to expand natural gas capacity \nthroughout the region.\n  In conclusion, I should point out that I often to refer to Tom as \n``SMIM''--the Smartest Maine in Maine. He possesses a vast knowledge of \nlaw and public policy that is matched by very few and that has helped \ninform and shape Maine's telecommunications and energy framework for \nnearly a decade. Indeed, one would be hard-pressed to find an \nindividual with a deeper understanding of our State's public utilities \ninfrastructure. But perhaps more important is his genuine ability to \nteach and share that knowledge with others. These characteristics not \nonly make Tom a remarkable public servant, but a valued role model as \nwell.\n  I, of course, am saddened to see Tom enter retirement because his \ndeparture will be a loss for Maine--but, I, along with the people of \nMaine, am forever grateful for his many years of service on behalf of \nour state.\n  Tom, congratulations and thank you. I hope your retirement is as \nrestful and relaxing as it is well-deserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/11/senate-section/article/S6689-3", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6689-S6690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO KATHERINE GRANT-DAVIS\n\n Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I am honored to recognize Ms. \nKatherine Grant-Davis on the occasion of her retirement from the New \nJersey Primary\n\n[[Page S6690]]\n\nCare Association, NJPCA, after many years of remarkable service to the \nGarden State.\n  Kathy has admirably acted as the President and CEO of NJPCA, a non-\nprofit organization that represents New Jersey's Federally-Qualified \nHealth Centers, FQHC. Under her leadership, New Jersey's FQHC's have \ngrown in both size and capability while modeling high standards of care \nfor all ages and income levels. She represents the best of what NJPCA \nhas accomplished in addressing the primary care needs of our friends \nand neighbors, and we owe her a debt of gratitude.\n  While New Jersey is home to 20 community health centers operating 121 \nsites throughout the State, this robust network would not be possible \nwithout Kathy's tremendous contributions. Under her leadership, FQHCs \nin New Jersey have come to represent quality, comprehensive, and most \nimportantly, accessible care for more than 495,000 patients.\n  In addition to these and many more accomplishments during her tenure \nat the NJPCA, Kathy has also honorably served under two New Jersey \nGovernors within the State's Department of Health and Senior Services. \nThroughout her career, Kathy has demonstrated an innate ability to get \nthe job done without losing sight of the need to ensure the well-being \nof all. Whether working to develop new pharmaceutical funding \ninitiatives, directing the New Jersey WIC Program, or helping to \nimplement Title XX funding, her dedication and commitment has earned \nher the respect and admiration of her peers and colleagues.\n  In 2012, I was honored to recognize Kathy's efforts with the \nEvangelina Menendez Trailblazer Award, an honor bestowed upon the \nstrong women of New Jersey who distinguish themselves in our \ncommunities each and every day. I am not alone in recognizing and \nhonoring Kathy for the work she had done, as she has received \ncommendations from the National Association of Community Health \nCenters, the NJ Biz Power 50 in Health Care, and NJ Citizen Action, \namong others.\n  While the Affordable Care Act brought the importance of access to \nhigh quality, accessible and affordable care to the forefront of the \nnational conversation, it was an issue Kathy had already been working \non for years. Her insight and counsel during the debate on health \nreform, as well as her constant vigilance on the law's implementation, \nhas proven invaluable to me and of immeasurable benefit to FQHCs and \ntheir patients, not only in New Jersey but throughout the country. With \nour health care system evolving to focus on wellness, prevention and \naccess to primary care, Kathy's work building New Jersey's network of \ncommunity health centers into a nationally-recognized model ensures \ncommunities in New Jersey will flourish well into the future.\n  I congratulate Kathy on her retirement and would like to once again \nrecognize, commend and applaud her legacy of extraordinary dedication \nto the New Jersey Primary Care Association and her unwavering service \nto the people of New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/11/senate-section/article/S6690-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RECOGNIZING La PLAZA\n\n Mr. RISCH. Madam President, millions of American businesses \nhave found their start in the living rooms, backyards, and garages of \naspiring entrepreneurs. Harnessing individual creativity and work \nethic, a talent can grow into a lasting enterprise. I wish to honor La \nPlaza, a restaurant from my home State of Idaho, whose hard work and \ndedication to quality has seen growth and prosperity while enhancing \nthe local community.\n  Founded in 2003, La Plaza offers unique and traditional Mexican fare, \nincluding an assortment of moles made with chocolate and dried peppers, \nto diners and visitors in southern Idaho. Guadalupe ``Lupe'' Loza and \nher husband, Chon, originally from Aguascalientes, Mexico, never \nplanned to own a restaurant until their infant son required long-term \nhospitalization and they needed to fund his medical bills. As a self-\ntaught chef, Lupe Loza started making tamales and empanadas in her \nkitchen and selling the food directly to local dairy workers and \nobservers on local soccer fields. As her fans multiplied, and driven by \nthe philosophy that ``farmers can dig the dirt and plant the seeds, but \nthey can't make the plants grow,'' Lupe Loza took a leap of faith and \nopened the restaurant in a converted two-car garage, where customers \nsat at folding tables and ate off paper plates.\n  Today, La Plaza operates out of a 1,992 square foot space on Buhl's \nMain Street, located on the old Oregon Trail in the western half of \nTwin Falls County. The Lozas are dedicated to creating and serving \nauthentic Mexican cuisine and making costumers feel like they are \neating at home with family. It is not surprising that after 11 years, \nLa Plaza has received overwhelming praise from its diners and the \nlarger community. The from-scratch food and ``grandmother's house'' \nfeel have made La Plaza a local staple and traveler's destination. The \nsmall, yet diverse menu is updated frequently, accommodating customer \nfeedback, requests, and favorites. From carne asada tacos to bacon-\nwrapped cheesy jalapeno bites, customers drive many miles out of their \nway to sample La Plaza's authentic Mexican cuisine. The restaurant has \nalso expanded to cater at local venues, including the annual Cinco de \nMayo celebration for the Latinos Unidos at the College of Southern \nIdaho. The Lozas dedication to excellence has earned La Plaza a five-\nstar rating on Yelp, the second-highest rated restaurant in Buhl on \nTrip Advisor, and a 90 percent customer satisfaction rate on Urban \nSpoon.\n  Over the past 11 years, La Plaza has doubled in size, and the \nhomemade ranchero fajitas are now served on china plates instead of \npaper plates. I hope La Plaza's story will inspire others around the \ncountry to chase the American Dream. I congratulate the Loza family and \nthe entire La Plaza team on their success, continued growth, and \nexemplary reputation for quality. La Plaza represents the best aspects \nof American entrepreneurship and is a credit to both Idaho and the \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/11/senate-section/article/S6690-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO CARTER ADAMS\n\n Mr. RUBIO.
