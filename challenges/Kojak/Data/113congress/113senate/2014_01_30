Mr. President, earlier this week President Obama \nexplained to the American people what he hopes to accomplish in the \nyear ahead, and I think it is safe to say that despite the hype, there \nwas not a whole lot in this year's State of the Union that would do \nmuch to alleviate the concerns and anxieties of most Americans. There \nwas not anything in there that would really address the kind of \ndramatic wage stagnation we have seen over the past several years among \nthe middle class or the increasingly difficult situation people find \nthemselves in trying to find stable, good-paying jobs. There was no \ncreative proposal for increasing mobility or opportunity for folks who \nneed it most.\n  Even more remarkable, the President completely ignored the serious \nhardship that folks in Kentucky and just about everywhere else in the \ncountry are dealing with right now as a result of his health care law. \nHe just blew right past it like it was not even happening.\n  There are serious issues that demand a serious response, and if for \nsome reason the President doesn't want to face up to them or offer \nmeaningful solutions, Republicans certainly will. We have a lot of \ncreative ideas on our side that speak to the day-to-day concerns of \nmiddle-class Americans. In the months ahead we will keep talking about \nthem. In fact, just this morning the House Republican leadership \nreached out to the President in an effort to solicit his help in \nencouraging the Democratic leadership in the Senate to take up House-\npassed bills that do the types of things the President said the other \nnight he supports. Maybe that would be a good use of the President's \nphone and his pen.\n\n[[Page S610]]\n\n  This morning I would like to take a moment to address something else \nthe President did not address on Tuesday but that his administration is \nalready quietly planning to do in the months ahead. I am referring to \nthe administration's radical new proposal to codify the same kind of \ntargeting of grassroots groups that an independent inspector general \ndetermined that the IRS engaged in in the run up to the 2012 election. \nI realize it just doesn't seem possible to a lot of people that the \nObama administration would even think of touching an issue this \nradioactive after last year's scandal, but those who think that \nunderestimate the extent to which this administration and its allies \nare willing to go to keep those who disagree with them from speaking \nout or participating in the political process. They underestimate the \nextent to which they are willing to go to hold onto power, and they \nforget how speech is usually stifled.\n  James Madison once wrote:\n\n       I believe there are more instances of the abridgement of \n     freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments by \n     those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations.\n\n  That was James Madison, and that is what is going on. The fact is \nthat right now the Obama administration is getting ready to codify the \nsame kind of intimidation and harassment of its political opponents \nthat stunned the Nation last year, and hardly anybody is talking about \nit--certainly not the President on Tuesday night. It is time we start \ntalking about it because what the administration is planning is nothing \nless than declaring a war, not just on its opponents but on free speech \nitself.\n  Here is their plan. The administration proposes to redefine political \nactivity so broadly that grassroots groups all across the country that \nexist for the sole purpose of speaking out on issues of liberty or \nlimited government or free enterprise or anything else that the \nadministration doesn't want to hear about will be forced to literally \nshut down. Just by speaking out on these issues of broad public \nconcern, they would be ruled out of bounds under new IRS rules--just in \ntime, by the way, for the midterm elections.\n  If you think this kind of speech is precisely what the First \nAmendment was written to protect, you would be entirely right. This is \nexactly what the First Amendment was about. So this is a hugely \nimportant issue, and that is why groups all across the political \nspectrum and the folks who support them are increasingly concerned.\n  As usual, the folks who are pushing this new assault on speech tell \nus that it is some kind of good-government proposal that increases \ntransparency, but the truth is that the only transparency here is the \nadministration's thuggish attempt to shut down its critics. It is \nreally incredible, when you think about it. Democrats think that 2014 \nis shaping up to be a tough year for them politically. So instead of \ntrying to persuade the public that they have the best answers to the \nproblems we face, they try to shut everything else out of the political \nprocess. They try to shut them up, and they have no problem using the \npowers of the government itself to do it--less than a year after \npresiding over one of the biggest abuses of government power in the \nmodern memory. The arrogance here is literally breathtaking.\n  But we have seen this kind of thing again and again from our liberal \nfriends over the years. They just cannot accept a public that disagrees \nwith their plans for the country. They just cannot seem to accept a \nsociety in which ``we, the people,'' establish the rules--not them. \nWhether it is the fairness doctrine or the DISCLOSE Act, they want \nthose who disagree with them to sit down and shut up. Their view is you \ncan fight for your ideals, you can speak out, but only if you agree \nwith me. If you are on the other side, you don't have a right to speak \nout; not only that, but I am going to put you out of business. I am \ngoing to use the IRS--for goodness sake, the IRS--to identify anybody \nwho disagrees with me and shut them up. I am doing it through \nregulation because I cannot pass it through legislation.\n  This is just one way the President plans to go around the people's \nelected representatives this year and every American needs to know \nabout this abuse of power. Let me be clear. What the administration is \nproposing poses a grave threat to the ability of ordinary Americans to \nfreely participate in the democratic process. Rather than reform the \nIRS and root out any hint of corruption or targeting of political \nopponents, they are now proposing to codify it. Fearful of losing the \nSenate, they have decided to double down. Instead of getting the IRS \nout of the business of policing speech, they want to make it the final \narbiter of political speech.\n  Some may ask, why is the IRS, an agency whose purpose is to collect \ntaxes, even involved in muzzling speech? How did that happen?\n  That is a very good question. It should not be. The administration \nneeds to start explaining to the American people why it is engaging in \nthis abuse of power, especially after last year. The administration may \nbelieve the smoke has cleared, but I do not believe the American people \nsee it that way at all. I think that if the American people knew what \nthe administration was really up to, they would react with the same \nkind of outrage they did last year about the targeting of conservatives \nby the IRS, and that is why the new IRS commissioner has a simple \nchoice.\n  We have a new IRS commissioner over there. He has a simple choice. He \ncan either restore the public's trust in an agency whose reputation was \nalready in doubt or he can allow himself to be used as a political pawn \nby an administration that now seems willing to do anything to keep \nthose it disagrees with from fully exercising their constitutionally \nprotected right to free speech.\n  After recent scandals the IRS should not be getting more involved in \nwhat people can and cannot say but less involved. Commissioner Koskinen \nmust take a stand against this kind of thuggery and make it clear to a \nnervous public that his agency will not engage in any more government-\nsanctioned crackdowns on speech.\n  You know, the President made what I think was a pretty revealing \ncomment in a recent interview when he talked about his inability to \nbreak through with certain Republicans. Rather than concede that they \nmay have a different world view or that they disagree with his approach \nto the issues of the day, the President blamed FOX News and Rush \nLimbaugh of somehow convincing folks that he is something he is not.\n  I think a far more likely explanation is that the President does \nstuff like this. I think a more likely explanation is that in the sixth \nyear of his Presidency he would rather blow kisses to his liberal base \nthan work with Republicans to create jobs and increase opportunity and \nprosperity for the millions of Americans who are really struggling out \nthere. Rather than let people from one end of the political spectrum to \nthe other duke it out through robust public debate, he wants to use the \nIRS to drive conservatives right off the playing field. That is a \nbetter explanation for why ordinary conservatives across the country \nare not buying the idea that you are some kind of pragmatic problem \nsolver, instead of a liberal ideologue who seems more interested in \nshutting down your critics than working with us in facing the Nation's \nmost urgent problems.\n  Just 3 months ago the President sought to unite the country around \nthe argument that as Americans we never give up. What I am saying this \nmorning is that even as he is saying that, he is also busy kicking the \nladder out from under anybody who disagrees with him. That is just what \nthis new IRS proposal does, and Republicans plan to fight it every step \nof the way.\n  Mr. President, I say to my friend the majority leader, who deferred \nto me this morning, that I have two more statements. I am sorry to \ndetain him.\n  Mr. REID. No problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/30/senate-section/article/S610-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S610-S611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REMEMBERING STAFF SERGEANT RYAN D. AUSTIN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is my sad duty to report to my \ncolleagues on a young Kentuckian who has been lost while serving his \ncountry. SSgt Ryan D. Austin of the U.S. Air Force passed away on \nAugust 6, 2013, in Maidstone, in the United Kingdom. He had been \nstationed at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, and he was 25 years old.\n  For his service in uniform, Staff Sergeant Austin received several \nmedals,\n\n[[Page S611]]\n\nawards, and decorations, including the Air Force Achievement Medal, the \nMeritorious Unit Award, the Air Force Good Conduct Medal, the National \nDefense Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, \nthe Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Air Force Expeditionary \nService Ribbon, the NCO Professional Military Education Graduate \nRibbon, the Small Arms Expert Marksman Ribbon, the Air Force Training \nRibbon, and the Cyberspace Support Badge.\n  Ryan enlisted in the Air Force in January of 2010. He was deployed to \nGermany with the 435th Air Ground Operations Wing, First Communications \nMaintenance Squadron.\n  Ryan's brother Nathan said:\n\n       Being with [the Air Force] was the best career move he ever \n     made. The Air Force gave him the chance to go overseas, learn \n     new cultures and serve his country just like our father did. \n     It made him feel he gave something back to his country, as \n     well as protect America.\n\n  Ryan was raised in Laurel County, the son of Karen Long and Doug \nAustin, who also served in uniform. He graduated from South Laurel High \nSchool in 2006. Friends remember that he enjoyed golf, cooking, working \nfor charities, and traveling.\n  Nathan remembers:\n\n       When Ryan was around, he was fun to be with. We included \n     each other in our hobbies like tennis, basketball and video \n     games. We had our friends and we always had great times . . . \n     it's really a heavy burden on my heart to know that I have \n     lost a brother.\n\n  While in high school, Ryan worked as a teacher's aide for Joey \nMarcum, a science teacher. Joey remembers:\n\n       Ryan was such an awesome young man. He was honest, \n     hardworking and dependable. You could depend on him for \n     literally anything. He was just a really good guy.\n\n  Ryan leaves behind his wife Jessica. The two of them were married on \nDecember 6, 2009. At the time of Ryan's death, Jessica was pregnant \nwith their first child. She had a boy, named Brayden Kaine Austin. Ryan \n``was really looking forward to being a father,'' his brother Nathan \nsaid.\n  Christa Koeller is a friend of Ryan and Jessica's who lived across \nthe street from them when Ryan and Christa's husband were both \nstationed at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha. She remembers the \ncouple's joy at learning they would have a baby:\n\n       When he found out and Jessica found out that they both \n     would be parents, they were so overjoyed to start that new \n     segment of their lives. Ryan was a family man, devoted to his \n     job, and he was very dedicated as an airman. . . . A baby son \n     lost his father, and will never know him.\n\n  Ryan's funeral service in Corbin, KY, was officiated by Pastor Daniel \nCarmack of Hawk Creek Church. Firefighters, policemen, county health \ncare workers, friends, family, and even those who did not know Ryan but \nwished to pay their respects literally lined the town streets as the \nfuneral procession passed by. Ryan received full military honors from \nthe Honor Guard of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.\n  Pastor Carmack said:\n\n       Ryan Austin was not only a soldier, but a leader that has \n     left an indelible mark on this generation.\n\n  The Pastor continued:\n\n       Ryan will long be remembered as . . . a devoted husband, \n     loving son, leader to his generation, and always a friend. \n     Although he was only 25, he have proved the statement true \n     that ``life is not measured in quantity, but in quality,'' \n     and he lived his life to the full with integrity and honor.\n\n  Pastor Carmack, who was Ryan's youth pastor and watched this young \nman grow up, remembers that ``Ryan was a kid that always served \nothers.'' I think it is clear that as an adult, a husband, a father, \nand an airman, Ryan's commitment to serving others only grew stronger.\n  We in the Senate are thinking today of Ryan Austin's loved ones, \nincluding his wife Jessica; his son Brayden; his father Doug; his \nbrothers Nathan Austin and Dylon Wall; his sister Rachel Austin; and \nmany other beloved family members and friends. Ryan was laid to rest \nnext to his mother Karen Long.\n  I would like Ryan's family to know that the Senate honors Sergeant \nRyan D. Austin's life of service. We are saddened by this very tragic \nloss, and we are grateful for his supreme sacrifice, which reminds us \nall of the meaning of valor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/30/senate-section/article/S611-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       GREENVILLE, KENTUCKY, FIRE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

There are two survivors who have been flown to \nVanderbilt University Medical Center for treatment.\n  Personnel from three fire departments--Greenville Fire, Graham \nVolunteer Fire, and Beechmont Volunteer Fire--responded to the blaze. I \nthank these brave firefighters, as well as the emergency medical \ntechnicians, police officers, and other responders who heroically leapt \nin to save lives.\n  Elaine and I are hopeful for a speedy recovery for the two victims \nwho are still alive, and we extend our prayers and condolences to the \nfamilies of the souls lost in this destructive fire. I will pay close \nattention to this story as events further develop. The entire \nCommonwealth stands behind Muhlenberg County right now, and we will do \nwhatever we can to help recover from this horrific loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/30/senate-section/article/S611-2", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, here in the Senate we work closely with so \nmany people, but no one do we work more closely with than the court \nreporters. They are right here in our face every time we talk, taking \ndown a verbatim transcript of what we say, and they work extremely \nhard.\n  We went through a period of time when we were working through all\n\n[[Page S612]]\n\nthese nominations, and they went for days without going home. They had \na cot in their office, and they never missed a beat.\n  I always watch very closely the court reporters because my brother--\nwho is 22 months younger than I am--was a court reporter. He retired \nfrom doing that, but I watched him work so hard.\n  Court reporting is extremely difficult. It is very intense. In court \nwe rarely have court reporters who take what we call a daily. They will \nhave a couple of court reporters during a trial and they will \ntranscribe their notes sometime later. But here in the Senate they \ntranscribe their notes now--immediately.\n  The reason I mention that today is one of our reporters is going to \nretire. Joel Breitner has been here for three decades in the Senate. \nPrior to coming here, he was a court reporter. He has this designation \nnow--as this young woman in front of me is reporting what I say--as an \nOfficial Reporter for the United States Senate.\n  Joel began working here in this body in 1987, after having been a \ncourt reporter already for 23 years. During his time in the reporters \noffice, he has witnessed both innovation and a lot of history. He was \none of the first reporters to use computer-aided transcription, which \nis a modern miracle--it really is--because the stenographic notes at \nthe same time they type them, are already translating into English. \nThat isn't the way it used to be.\n  I can remember my brother--and, of course, Joel, who was one of the \nfirst here in this body to use the computer-aided transcription and did \nwhat my brother did--you took down what people said with your machine, \nand then you would go back to your office, look over your notes, and \ntranscribe them, and then either you would type them up or have someone \ndo so. So it was a lot of work. It is still a lot of work, but it is a \nlot different than it used to be.\n  He is one of the first, if not the first, in this body to use this \ncomputer-aided transcription, and it really helped modernize the Office \nof Official Reporters.\n  He has reported historic events, countless numbers of them--President \nClinton's first inaugural address, his impeachment. Over the years he \nhas been a friend and resource to the Senate pages. Joel is a very \nnice, quiet person whom I will miss.\n  When we cross--I always see them--I say: ``Saddling up again''--\nputting on the heavy equipment they wear during the time they are here. \nThey work very, very hard, and they transcribe every word we say. There \nare times I wish they hadn't, but they did.\n  Mr. President, it is no surprise, with the affection that Joel has \nshown for the pages, that Jamie, one of his children, has been a Senate \npage.\n  So I thank him on behalf of the entire Senate for his years of \nservice not only to Senators but everybody, for his years of service in \nthe reporters office, and I congratulate him on a very distinguished \ncareer. I wish him the best in retirement. I know he will enjoy \nspending more time with his children and with Carol, his wife of almost \nthree decades.\n\n\n                            working together\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I need to comment on part of what my \nRepublican counterpart said. The President gave a good State of the \nUnion Address to the country on Tuesday night. It was a dramatic \nspeech, and he called upon us to work together. You would never know \nthat from what the Republican leader said today.\n  He also said, as President of the United States, he has the power to \ndo things when the Senate finds itself bogged down, as we have been \nwith countless filibusters. During the years I have been leader of the \nSenate, there have been more than 470 filibusters conducted by the \nRepublicans. Is it any wonder the President is going to do some things \nadministratively because of the logjam we have here? Hopefully we can \ndo better than we have done. I hope that is the case.\n  This country has been hurt by the constant obstruction we have had. I \nam surprised--but not too much--that my Republican colleague would say \nthe President has to do something to help create jobs. One need only \nreflect on when President Obama took office. We were losing 700,000 \njobs a month at that time. But because of his patience and wisdom and \nthe fact that he had a Democratic Senate and Congress for the first 2 \nyears of his Presidency, we were able to do some terrific things for \nthe country.\n  Since then, as we know, the Republican leader has said his No. 1 goal \nwas to defeat Obama for the reelection, and that is how the Republicans \nhave legislated. Over the last 3 years, they have done everything they \ncould to stop the country from moving forward. They actually did it \nduring the first 2 years he was President, but they didn't have the \npower to do much then except obstruct, and we had enough votes to \novercome their obstruction.\n  I don't know if my friend the Republican leader understands that in \nspite of his No. 1 goal to defeat the President that he was reelected \noverwhelmingly because the American people agreed with his view of the \ncountry.\n  I am not going to go into more detail about how I believe my \nRepublican colleague is wrong on what has happened with bogging down \nthe Senate, but I will comment on one aspect of his presentation: \nBecause of the U.S. Supreme Court case called Citizens United, there \nhas been some really untoward stuff going on in the political world. We \nhave two brothers who are actually trying to buy the country. Last year \nthe Koch brothers made billions of dollars. They are spending their \nbillions of dollars by going into State legislatures, Governors races, \nand secretary of state races on a State level, and, of course, spending \nhuge amounts of money around the country in an attempt to defeat \nDemocrats both in the House and the Senate.\n  The Republican leader has long been an opponent of campaign finance \nreform. This has been part of his career. So it is no surprise that he \nopposes the administration's effort for greater disclosure. The abuse \nhere is not the administration enforcing the law, but folks like the \nKoch brothers pretending to be social welfare organizations.\n  The Presiding Officer has dedicated much of his life to improving the \nsocial welfare of people from his State. These social welfare \norganizations are extremely helpful for people who have problems. The \nKoch brothers are not a social welfare organization. They are plainly \nacting as a political organization. They are spending tens and hundreds \nof millions of dollars on political activities. They have not \ncontributed to anything that deals with social welfare. Folks who act \nas political organizations should have to disclose where the money \ncomes from.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, the Koch brothers hide all of their \ncampaign efforts. They disguise themselves, with rare exception, as \nsocial welfare organizations. They have all these fancy names and go \nafter people who are trying to improve the country.\n  We have an important piece of legislation we are going to pass today \nto improve the ability of our country to prosper. The bipartisan \nmeasure called the flood insurance bill will protect the Nation's \nrecovering housing market and save consumers money.\n  I thank Senator Menendez, the chairman of the banking committee, and \nChairman Landrieu, who is chairman of the small business committee. \nThey have done a wonderful job--these two working together with Senator \nIsakson--with their leadership on this issue.\n  I look forward to a strong bipartisan vote on this measure this \nafternoon. I would note that the bipartisan agreement to vote on a \nreasonable number of relevant amendments and on final passage of the \nflood insurance measure is exactly the kind of agreement that \nRepublicans have rejected on other legislative priorities.\n  For example, when Democrats offered to vote on 20 relevant amendments \nto a full offset extension of unemployment insurance a couple of weeks \nago, the Republicans refused. Since then, 150,000 more Americans have \nlost emergency benefits that were helping them to stay above water \nwhile they look for work. In all, more than 1.6 million out-of-work \nAmericans have lost benefits to help them put food on the table and gas \nin the tank so they can focus on their job search.\n  I hope in the coming week Democrats and Republicans will be able \nreach a bipartisan agreement to have an up-or-down vote on the \nextension of unemployment insurance as well. I hope it is not again \nbogged down with obstruction. I am confident that we have the\n\n[[Page S613]]\n\nopportunity to do that, and we should do it. Millions of fellow \nAmericans are counting on us to do this on an affirmative basis.\n  While we work toward an agreement to restore unemployment benefits, \nthe Senate will also, as I mentioned earlier, consider the farm bill \nconference report. America's farms and ranches are the most productive \nin the world. They support 16 million private sector jobs. Smart farm \npolicies will help American farmers thrive. That is an important part \nof our work to keep the economic recovery rolling. The farm bill will \ncreate jobs and cut taxpayer subsidies and save $23 billion which will \nbe used to reduce the deficit.\n  I would also note that we have done an admirable job of reducing the \ndebt. Do we need to do more? Of course we do. We have already reduced \nthe debt during the Obama years by almost $3 trillion, and if we could \nget the Republicans in the House to agree on the bill we passed dealing \nwith immigration reform, it would be another $1 trillion toward \nreducing the debt.\n  I would also note, as I indicated earlier, that when President Obama \nfirst took office, we were losing 700,000 jobs a month. We have now \ncreated more than 8 million jobs. We need to do more and the farm bill \nwill help that. The farm bill will create jobs and cut taxpayer \nsubsidies and save $20 billion which will be used to reduce the debt \nand deficit. The bill includes important reforms to farm programs, and \nwhile this measure doesn't include as much funding for programs to \nreduce hunger as a number of us would like, it is a good compromise and \nit will protect needy families.\n  Senator Stabenow from Michigan has been the chairman of this \ncommittee. She has worked so hard for years to get this done. We have \npassed it twice here in the Senate. We have struggled to get something \ndone in the House, and we were finally able to get this done under her \nleadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/30/senate-section/article/S613-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, the time until 11:15 \na.m. shall be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees, with Senators Menendez and Toomey or their designees \ncontrolling the final 10 minutes.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in very strong support of \nthe Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act and urge my colleagues \nto vote today to pass this legislation that will help millions of \nAmericans across the country.\n  First, I want to recognize the admirable leadership of Senators \nMenendez, Isakson, and Landrieu for helping to put together such a \nstrong coalition amidst some challenging political headwinds.\n  Senator Landrieu, in particular, has been like Paul Revere in the \nnight for not only calling our attention to the detrimental elements of \nthe Biggert-Waters bill but for continuing to emphasize this bill's \nimportance to States from coast to coast.\n  Senator Menendez and I share the New York-New Jersey coast, as does \nthe Presiding Officer, and that, of course, has been devastated.\n  I will briefly say what has happened here. Literally tens of \nthousands of Americans will lose their homes--middle-class Americans, \nworking-class Americans, and poor Americans--if we don't pass this \nlegislation. Very simply, Biggert-Waters was not followed. Before \nincreases were to go into effect, an affordability study was to be \ndone. It was not. As a result, homeowners are having to pay thousands \nof dollars more. Homeowners who paid $500 a year for flood insurance--\nit is mandatory--now pay $4,000 or $5,000. There are some who pay as \nmuch as $30,000. Even worse, many more will lose their homes when they \nsell them because the flood insurance for the next owner will go up so \nmuch they will lose tremendous value on their homes.\n  A home is the middle class's piece of the rock. People struggle long \nand hard to pay that mortgage, and when they are in their later years, \nfifties, sixties, seventies--I guess fifties isn't later years these \ndays--this is what they have. Their nest egg is their home. To all of a \nsudden pull the rug out from under them and say when you sell your \nhome, the next person is going to have to pay $15,000 or $20,000 a year \nin flood insurance, which makes the value of that home plummet, is so \nunfair.\n  We have additional unfairness in our State of New York, as well as \nthe neighboring State of New Jersey. People who were devastated by \nSandy and struggled to rebuild their homes are all of a sudden getting \nwalloped with huge flood insurance bills which they cannot afford. They \nare already in debt. So to allow this to go on makes no sense. If \nAmericans ever want the Government to act, it is in these types of \nsituations where there is an unfairness that is unrelated to any \nindividual action by these homeowners which clobbers them. It takes \naway their financial security, it takes away their home, and makes life \nmiserable.\n  It should come as no surprise that if people cannot afford flood \ninsurance policies, we will see more and more homeowners decide to drop \nout of the program, or communities that decide not to adopt new flood \nmaps proposed by FEMA. On top of that, as rates go higher and higher, \nthose folks who are not required to buy flood insurance but wanted to \ndo the prudent thing, may drop out of the program as well.\n  So, let me emphasize one point for my colleagues that may still have \nreservations about our bill: If folks start dropping out of the \nNational Flood Insurance Program en masse, that would be a much larger \ndrag on the system than a simple delay of rate increases. Without flood \ninsurance, when future disasters hit, these families and communities \nwill be entirely dependent on Federal aid to help them rebuild.\n  I fully support efforts to put the National Flood Insurance Program \non a path to solvency, but it will not happen overnight, and attempting \nto do so in a manner that raises premiums too high too quickly, without \nconsideration for broader affordability concerns, will end up being a \ndecision that they come to regret.\n  We have to prevent the most devastating rate hikes from going into \neffect until FEMA and Congress can figure out a way to ensure the \nsolvency of the National Flood Insurance Program without breaking the \nbank for middle-class homeowners.\n  It's illogical for homeowners to pay higher premiums based on the \nrisk-zone of their home before FEMA accurately determines the actual \nrisk. Yet, that is exactly what is happening today.\n  Currently, millions of policyholders who built to code and whose \nhomes have been subsequently remapped into a higher risk area are \nfacing significant rate increases with no assurance that the FEMA flood \nmaps are accurate.\n  Prematurely forcing individuals and families out of their homes with \nastronomical increases of flood insurance premiums before even \nguaranteeing the reliability of rate maps is asinine.\n  But the legislation before us today delays these rate increases until \nan overseer can certify that FEMA has implemented a flood mapping \napproach\n\n[[Page S614]]\n\nthat utilizes sound scientific and engineering methodologies that \naccurately determine varying levels of flood risk.\n  Not a day goes by that I don't think about the impact that Sandy had \non the millions of families across New York. Their stories and the \nstruggles they face motivate me each day to do whatever I can to make \ntheir lives better.\n  As my colleagues can attest these are not isolated events. Storms are \nbecoming more prevalent and more ferocious. And they are not just in \ncoastal New York, New Jersey and Louisiana, but Montana, Colorado and \ncentral States as well.\n  New Yorkers and families across the country aren't thinking about \nwhether the next natural disaster will impact them, they are thinking \nabout when. This body can act now and prevent a manmade disaster from \nburdening them as well.\n  This bill, the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act, will \nprotect homeowners across the country, many of whom have only just \nbegun to recover, from potentially huge flood insurance premium hikes \nand loss of property value. We must pass this bill today.\n  To reiterate, my colleagues Senator Landrieu, Senator Menendez, \nSenator Isakson and others have worked tirelessly to advance this bill \nand help all our constituents who have built back after seemingly \ninsurmountable loss. I implore my colleagues to stand together, in a \ntrue bipartisan effort, to make this program fairer for middle class \nfamilies struggling to hold onto the homes they rebuilt in the \ncommunities they call home.\n  The bottom line is we have to pass this bill. It makes no sense. We \nrequired a study before imposing devastating rate increases on \nhomeowners to see what the effect would be to put the rates into \neffect. It is putting the cart before the horse. If it is not backward \nthinking, I don't know what it is. It makes no sense to do this.\n  The Toomey amendment will come forward, and it basically is not \npassing any bill. The Toomey amendment says we should put all the costs \non these middle-class and working-class homeowners quickly. It doesn't \nhave any limits, and it would do the same exact thing. So anyone who \nthinks the Toomey amendment is palliative, you may as well vote against \nthe bill.\n  The good news here: Democrats and Republicans have come together. \nThis is how this body should work. We have allowed a limited number of \namendments on each side. I was glad to hear the minority leader talk \nthe other day about how this is how the Senate should work. We agree, \nand I hope this will set the precedent for future bills where we can \ncome together on the floor, have a reasonable number of amendments--\nhopefully relevant and germane that relate to improving the \nlegislation--and then we will have the bill be given an up-or-down \nvote.\n  This bill will pass this afternoon. When this bill passes--and when \nit passes the House--millions of homeowners across America will breathe \na sigh of relief. They will be able to keep their homes. They will be \nable to sell their homes, and they will know there is a process to put \nflood insurance on an even keel that won't be all on their backs.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I understand Senator Toomey and Senator \nMenendez will be coming to the floor to have the last 10 minutes of \nthis debate, so I wish to take a moment to come to the floor to thank \nall of my colleagues who helped so much, particularly in the early \ndays--a year and a half ago--to help make this bill possible today. \nThis truly was a team effort, and I really appreciate the compliments \nfrom my colleagues about the leadership I provided, and I am happy to \ndo so. Believe me, this never would have happened without a great team \nthat was built to spread the word about the disastrous consequences of \na law that had good intentions but with horrific ramifications on \npeople all over the country. Because this is not just a coastal issue \nthat affects New Jersey, the State of the Presiding Officer, and my \nState of Louisiana, we had some extraordinary Senators step up, such as \nSenator Heitkamp, such as Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia--not \nan ocean around or in sight. We had other Senators step up who do not \nhave coastlines but who have States and subdivisions and communities \nand cities and rural areas that are in desperate need of a strong, \ngood, solid, affordable, and sustainable flood insurance package for \nthis country--a flood insurance program.\n  Some people thought that is what we were getting with Biggert-Waters, \nbut it soon became clear, literally before the ink was dry, that it \nwasn't going to work. Sometimes mistakes are made and when they are, we \nhave to step up and fix them as quickly as possible. It has taken us \nlonger than it should have because some Senators have not had an open \nmind or an open heart. They have not dealt in the best of faith, but \ndespite all of that, we are here today because a number of Senators \nstood up.\n  I wish to read their names into the Record: Senator Thad Cochran from \nMississippi, Senator Jeff Merkley from Oregon, Senator John Hoeven from \nNorth Dakota, Senator Tim Scott from South Carolina, Senator Heidi \nHeitkamp from North Dakota, Senator Roger Wicker from Mississippi, \nSenator Vitter from Louisiana, Senator Chuck Schumer was a particularly \nstrong leader, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand from New York, Senator Ed \nMarkey from Massachusetts, as well as Elizabeth Warren from \nMassachusetts, who were early supporters of this bill; Senator Bill \nNelson of Florida, Senator Rubio of Florida--and particularly Senator \nNelson who got on this bill early and began educating people not only \nin Florida but around the country; Senator Al Franken from Minnesota, \nSenator Joe Manchin, Senator Bob Casey from Pennsylvania, another \nSenator who has no ocean, but Pennsylvania has I think the most new \nFEMA maps of any State in the Union. The people of Pennsylvania would \nreally be affected if our bill doesn't pass. Even the amendment that is \nbeing offered by one of the Senators does not solve their problem and \nit is unfortunate, and I hope people will vote strongly against the \nToomey amendment; Senator Kay Hagan from North Carolina; of course, \nyours truly in the Chair, Senator Cory Booker, who came on early and \nwas a huge supporter as soon as he got here. I think this was one of \nthe first bills he cosponsored and I couldn't be more grateful, and I \nknow the people of New Jersey are grateful for his leadership; Senator \nLindsey Graham of South Carolina, Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii, \nSenator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode \nIsland, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Senator Lisa \nMurkowski from Alaska, Senator Ron Wyden from Oregon, Senator Susan \nCollins from Maine, and Senator Debbie Stabenow from Michigan; \nobviously, Senator Menendez has been our leader on the Democratic side, \nand we would not be where we are today without his leadership.\n  We would not be where we are today without the commitment of Senator \nHarry Reid who recognizes he has a flooding problem as well and that \nthis is not just a coastal issue. He stood up early to tell us that if \nwe could build a strong coalition, if we could build 60-plus votes, he \nwould help us get to a point where we could actually have a debate on \namendments, vote them up or down, and then move this bill, with the \nstrongest vote possible, to the House of Representatives, where I am \nproud to say there are 131 cosponsors on this bill. That number is \ngrowing every day. As people hear about what is happening and begin to \nunderstand, as they get notices from their insurance companies--which, \nby the way, are taking 30 percent of every policy off the top and \nassuming virtually no risk, which is an issue we have to address; it is \nnot addressed in this bill--but as people begin to understand, they are \ngoing to be clamoring for real change. They will want something that \nhelps taxpayers for it to be sustainable, that addresses the climate \nissues that are affecting this program, that helps middle-class \nhomeowners be able, as\n\n[[Page S615]]\n\nSenator Schumer said, to stay in their homes and not lose all the \nequity they have literally worked for not only their entire lives but \npotentially for two generations of work which has gone into building \nequity--sometimes three generations of work have gone into building \nequity in homes--just for a misguided piece of legislation to swipe \naway from them, in the blink of an eye, their homes' value.\n  So I hope people will vote strongly against the Toomey amendment. A \nvote for the Toomey amendment will signal a vote against our efforts \nfor reform. He will say his efforts are to reform, that it will only \nallow raises of 25 percent a year. There is no cap on his bill. There \nare no requirements for an affordability study. There are no \nrequirements for accurate FEMA mapping. His bill is a red herring and a \ndistraction from what we are trying to do.\n  Senator Johnny Isakson on the Republican side deserves so much credit \nfor organizing his team.\n  I also recognize the minority leader, the Senator from Kentucky, for \nhis help in getting us to this point, and I thank him.\n  I also want to thank a very important group which is GNO, Inc.--\nGreater New Orleans, Inc.--which is a 16-parish economic coalition in \nour State, made up of parish presidents and elected officials and \nuniversity presidents, that really focuses on the economic vitality of \nour region. Michael Hetch is the executive director--an extremely \ntalented young leader. They recognized immediately, as I brought to \ntheir attention the problems with Biggert-Waters, the disaster it would \nbe to the 16 parishes they represent. Not only did they step up and \nhelp us organize all of our 16 parishes, but they began immediately to \nreach out to New Jersey and to New York and to Pennsylvania and to \nCalifornia and to Oregon--to reach out to the bankers and the realtors. \nThat began an extraordinary development of a very strong coalition. I \nthank them for their leadership.\n  I thank the National Association of Realtors and the National \nHomebuilders Association, NACo. The president of NACo--the National \nAssociation of Counties--was in my office on several occasions working \nvery hard with elected officials all over the country to raise the flag \nabout this issue and to say it is time to take a pause on Biggert-\nWaters--not a complete repeal; not moving back on our reforms, but to \ntake a pause to get it right.\n  It is important to get this right. There are too many homes that will \nbe lost, too many families impacted, too many businesses hurt, too many \ncommunities that will see a downward spiral from a housing market that \nis just now recovering after a very difficult national recession.\n  I thank the National League of Cities, the American Bankers \nAssociation, the Independent Community Bankers of America, and the \nIndependent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America. I really want to \nthank them.\n  There are hundreds of other smaller organizations--neighborhood \ngroups, I am sure, from New Jersey to New York, including Louisiana \nhomeowners groups, that have spoken and are educating people about this \nchallenge. But in a Congress where it is hard to come to a consensus on \nsinging happy birthday to one of our Members, which is unfortunate \ntoday, this is a real accomplishment for such a broad, deep, and strong \ncoalition--bipartisan, bicoastal--to come together and pass a bill that \nwill bring relief to millions and millions of families.\n  This will be a great victory today. I believe we will have a strong \nvote in the Senate. I am confident of that. But we have work to do. \nThis bill has to go to the House. Maxine Waters and Congressman Grimm \nfrom New York are leading this effort. We need all the Senators to talk \nwith their delegations in the House and get them to really step up. We \nneed a lot of communication to the Speaker to say: Mr. Speaker, this \ncannot wait. There is already too much time, too much anxiety, too many \nreal estate agents being put out of business, too many for-sale signs \ncoming down, too many people making decisions because they have lost \nequity in their home. It is time to fix this problem now, and we can.\n  I thank Senator Merkley, who will be the subcommittee chair as this \nsort of new reform is written. And finally, I thank again Senator \nMenendez and Senator Isakson for their extraordinary knowledge of this \nsubject, their leadership, and helping us get to the point where we \nare.\n  I do not see any other colleagues on the floor. When I do, I will \nyield the floor. I understand Senator Toomey and Senator Menendez are \ngoing to come to close out this debate. But I do want to say again that \nthe Biggert-Waters bill was built backwards and upside down. It \nauthorized immediate rate increases on responsible homeowners without \nany understanding of how it would impact their individual policies.\n  I want to also say this, Mr. President--and I think you have heard me \nspeak about this both publicly and we have talked privately--the people \nin Louisiana who have been the victims and survivors of massive \nhurricanes and storms and levee breaks are well aware of the weather \nchanges. We accept it as a reality. We are building our levees as fast \nas we can, with very little help over time. Now, after emergencies, the \nFederal Government comes in with a lot of money, but year in and year \nout we are having a very hard time getting any infrastructure from the \nCorps of Engineers budget, which is woefully underfunded for the whole \ncountry. And the Presiding Officer knows that because his communities \nsuffer as well.\n  We are building levees as fast as we can with a lot of our own money \nand a lot of our own tax dollars. We are raising our homes as fast as \nwe can, elevating them. We are putting in new zoning, and people are \nvery mindful of not developing low-lying areas. But we have to have \npolicies that are well thought out and well balanced to accommodate \ncommunities that have literally been here for 300 years.\n  New Orleans will be celebrating its 300th birthday in just a few \nyears from now, in 2018. This is not about a group of people who went \ndown there 20 years ago for Sun and for vacation. This is about people \nwho came 300 years ago to secure the mouth of the greatest river system \nin North America and one of the greatest river systems in the world.\n  This is not fun and games. This is work and empowerment and wealth \nbuilding and opportunity that the President talked about the other day. \nThat is what this bill is about.\n  We need to start with building a flood program, partnershipped with \nthe private sector, that works for average, middle-class families. We \ndo not have that, and we are going to get the first step toward that \ntoday.\n  I see my colleagues on the floor, so I am going to yield the floor. I \nknow the time has been set aside. When we vote on the Toomey amendment, \nplease vote a strong no. When we vote on final passage, please vote a \nstrong yes. There are a few other amendments Senators Isakson and \nMenendez will speak to more directly, as we wrap up this debate today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, it is good to see my colleague from New \nJersey presiding.\n  I rise in support of this legislation we are about to consider, the \nHomeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act, which, again, is unique \ninsofar as it is a bipartisan, bicameral piece of legislation, to \nensure families will be able to afford flood insurance so they can stay \nin their homes, so that businesses can stay open, and property values \nwill not plummet.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2707\n\n  I also rise in opposition to the Toomey substitute amendment, which \nwould completely undermine our bill and perpetuate a failed policy. \nWhile we support putting the National Flood Insurance Program on a path \nto solvency, current law hikes rates so fast and so high that it will \nactually undermine the solvency of the program. These drastic increases \nwill act as a de facto eviction notice for homeowners who have lived in \ntheir homes and played by the rules their entire lives. That is going \nto drive down property values, as the housing market is struggling to \nrecover.\n  What is most alarming is the fact that FEMA does not even know the \nsize or scope of this problem. They were supposed to complete a study \non the affordability of rate increases mandated by Biggert-Waters by \nlast April, but they failed to do so. That is simply unacceptable.\n\n[[Page S616]]\n\n  While there is no question we need to put the flood insurance program \non a more solvent trajectory, we first need to understand the impact \nthese dramatic changes in Biggert-Waters will have on the housing \nmarket and be sure the mapping process they use to set these rates is \naccurate.\n  That is why our bill would impose a moratorium on the phaseout of \nsubsidies and grandfathers included in Biggert-Waters for most primary \nresidences until FEMA completes the affordability study that was \nmandated in Biggert-Waters and proposes a regulatory framework to \naddress the issues found in the study.\n  Whether FEMA does that in 6 months, 1 year--whatever periods of \ntime--as soon as they do that and propose that regulatory framework, we \nare ready to go. So those who say this is somehow an inordinate amount \nof time, that is going to be determined by FEMA's promptness in getting \nthe affordability study that was supposed to have been done under law \nby last April.\n  It would also require FEMA to certify in writing that it has \nimplemented a flood mapping approach that utilizes sound scientific and \nengineering methodologies before certain rate reforms are implemented.\n  The reason that is important is because, for example, we saw in New \nJersey where FEMA maps were put out, and we ultimately heard a hue and \ncry from communities and counties across the State that said: Look, \nthat can't be right. We have had properties that have never flooded. \nEven in Sandy they did not have virtually any flooding, and now they \nare in the zone, and particularly in the most difficult zones, called V \nzones, where the consequence of being in a V zone may very well be \nwhether you can keep your house. When we challenged and brought \nmunicipal and county engineers to bear, what did we find? In some \ncounties we had an 80-percent reduction. Had we not challenged those \nmaps, where would those families be today? So we want the basis of \nthese maps to be scientific, using engineering methodologies that are \nsound.\n  Also, this new legislation would reimburse qualifying homeowners for \nsuccessful appeals of erroneous flood map determinations. If we are \ngoing to say these maps are somehow sacrosanct, and you go and \nchallenge them, and find out they were wrong, you should be able to not \nhave to bear that burden.\n  It would give communities fair credit for locally funded flood \nprotection systems. It would continue the fair treatment afforded to \ncommunities with floodproof basement exemptions. It would provide for a \nFEMA ombudsman to advocate for and provide information to \npolicyholders. It would streamline the registration process for \ninsurance brokers and agents so they can provide better timely services \nto policyholders during a disaster.\n  Just as important as what this bill does is what it will not do. The \nlegislation would not stop the phaseout of taxpayer-funded subsidies \nfor vacation homes and homes that have been substantially damaged. It \nwould not stop the phaseout of taxpayer-funded subsidies for properties \nthat have been repetitively flooded, including the 1 percent riskiest \nproperties that account for over a third of all claims. It would not \nencourage new construction in environmentally sensitive or flood-prone \nareas. And it would not stop most of the important reforms included in \nBiggert-Waters.\n  This legislation reaches a delicate balance that recognizes the need \nto improve solvency and phase out certain subsidies but tries to do so \nwithout discouraging program participation.\n  Finally, Senator Toomey acknowledges that Biggert-Waters, I think, is \ntotally flawed and must be changed, but basically his amendment falls \nfar short of what all of us who have come together in support will do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss briefly my amendment and \nthe underlying bill. But first I want to thank my cosponsors--Senators \nCoats, McConnell, Coburn, Hatch, Kirk, and Johanns--and I want to thank \nthe bipartisan coalition of Senators who are supporting my approach.\n  There is a real problem with our flood insurance program as a result \nof the reforms, and it needs to be addressed. The problem is that, in \nthe process of reforming this program so it would actually be \nsustainable--so that it actually could become solvent--in the process \nof making those changes, some people's premiums go up very dramatically \nand pretty suddenly. The phase-in is very quick and the increase is \nvery high. That is a huge problem, and it needs to be addressed.\n  The Menendez bill addresses it the wrong way. What this bill does is \nit does kill the meaningful reform. It completely suspends for 4 years. \nThere is no adjustment of premiums toward an actuarially sound market-\nbased level of premiums that do not require taxpayer subsidy. So we \nwill be going back--oh, it busts the budget, by the way--we will be \ngoing back to a system where literally Warren Buffett can buy a home, \nand as long as he makes it his primary residence, he can continue to \nhave taxpayers subsidize his cost of flood insurance. I just do not \nknow how that is even remotely defensible. But that is what we would be \nheading back to if we adopt the Menendez bill.\n  In addition, by throwing out the reform, by throwing out the movement \ntoward an actuarially sound system, we go right back to the insolvent, \nunsustainable program we had before, which means the NFIP, under the \nMenendez bill, will that much sooner reach the day when it cannot honor \nits claims, when the people who have been paying their insurance \npremiums discover there is no money to honor their claim when the flood \noccurs because it does not have the reforms that put it on a \nsustainable basis.\n  Finally, it is flawed because it cannot become law. This approach is \nnot going to become law. We know that. It is not just me who opposes \nthis approach. The administration does not accept this approach. This \nis what the Statement of Administration Policy said that was put out \nthis week by the President of the United States about this bill. He \nreferred to this bill specifically and said:\n\n       Delaying implementation of these reforms--\n\n  referring to the Biggert-Waters reforms--\n\n     would further erode the financial position of the NFIP, which \n     is already $24 billion in debt. This delay would also reduce \n     FEMA's ability to pay future claims made by all \n     policyholders.\n\n  The Speaker of the House and the leadership in the House feel the \nsame way. They are not willing to throw out the reforms and leave us \nwith an NFIP that cannot honor its claims. They are not going to do it.\n  So if you really want to do something for the people who are facing \nthese big premium increases, you have to support a program, an approach \nthat actually works. That is why I have offered this amendment. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this amendment.\n  What we do is simple. We phase in the premium increases gradually. \nFor people facing a big premium increase, we phase it in very \ngradually. It gives people time to adjust, time to mitigate, time to \nchallenge if the map is drawn wrong. They can do that. We preserve the \nimportant, valuable ideas in the Menendez bill, such as the ability to \nrecoup the cost of a successful challenge to a mapping problem for an \nindividual homeowner, also for a community. That is there. That is \nimportant.\n  We preserve the opportunity to have the benefit and force NFIP to \nrecognize the benefit of mitigation measures that have been taken by \nothers. So if your community has built a levee or a dam or some kind of \nflood mitigation system, with or without Federal money, that needs to \nbe acknowledged, that needs to be reflected. If your community, your \nhome is safer because of that investment, your premium needs to reflect \nthe fact that you have a safer situation. We cover that as well.\n  Finally, the administration supports this approach. In the very same \nStatement of Administration Policy, President Obama's administration \nstated this:\n\n       The Administration strongly supports a phased transition to \n     actuarially sound flood insurance rates.\n\n  The Menendez bill absolutely does not do this. My amendment \nabsolutely does because this is what makes sense. This is how we soften \nthe blow. We create a reasonable transition and we maintain a fiscally \nsound, actuarially sound program that does not bust the\n\n[[Page S617]]\n\nbudget. That is what my amendment does.\n  Finally, let me just conclude with this. There are a lot of Members \nof this body on both sides of the aisle who have spent a lot of time, \nespecially in recent years, in sincere, concerted ongoing efforts to \naddress one of the biggest challenges we face as a country; that is, \nthe fiscally unsustainable position of our Federal Government, driven \nby mandatory spending.\n  We have cut discretionary spending significantly as a percentage of \nour budget, as a percentage of our economy. Any way you measure it, \ndiscretionary spending has been squeezed. Mandatory spending has been \nalmost completely untouched. It is growing far too fast. Recently this \nbody, including every Democrat who supports this Menendez bill, voted \nfor a reform, a reform of one mandatory program that makes it \nsustainable, makes it viable.\n  We should not be walking away. If we were at all serious about \ngetting our mandatory spending under control, we should not walk away \nfrom this reform. Please, I urge my colleagues, support the Toomey \namendment.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there be will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. \n2707, as modified, offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. \nToomey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Is my \nunderstanding correct that Senator Toomey has used his minute as part \nof his presentation or is there a minute still pending for each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a minute still pending for each side.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I think I made my case. I will yield back \nthe remainder of my last minute.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, first of all, let me clear up some \nthings. No. 1, the administration has not come and said it supports \nSenator Toomey's amendment. So let's be clear about that. As a matter \nof fact, my understanding is the administration has called him out and \nsaid they do not oppose our legislation.\n  I think we do transition ultimately to a place where we have an \nactuarially sound flood insurance program. There is a CBO score out \nthere of over 10 years of zero. Look. The reality is, if you want the \nreal estate markets to take a real hit, if you want families to be \ndisplaced from their homes, you adopt the Toomey amendment.\n  If you want to do what on a bipartisan basis has been the focus of \nthis legislation, to keep an actuarially sound flood insurance program \nbut at the same time make sure we do not drive people out of their \nhomes and make sure that we get the study done before we get the \nactions done, then you will oppose the Toomey amendment and support the \nunderlying bill.\n  I yield the floor and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote on amendment No. \n2697 offered by the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, what the sponsors claim about my amendment \nis factually incorrect. Their statement is that all the States and \neverybody wants to do the NARAB bill. I agree, we should do it, but if \nall the States really want to do it, my amendment has no effect \nwhatsoever because it allows an opt-out for a State that doesn't want \nto do it. So either it is true that they all want to do it or it is not \ntrue that they all want to do it, and we are going to force some States \nto not do it.\n  An opt-out protecting 10th Amendment privileges of the State is \nhighly required to make sure we do not go outside the bounds of our \nlegal obligations.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, we have been here before. Fifteen years \nago, Gramm-Leach-Bliley offered what the good Senator from Oklahoma is \noffering, and it is why NARAB has never been successful.\n  What this does is it empowers our State regulators, and that is why \nthey support this bill. Notice you haven't heard a lot from States \nabout taking away their rights here because it does not. It empowers \nthem, it brings more competition in the marketplace, and it helps \nconsumers. This is good.\n  I kick it over to my cosponsor and the good Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I thank my cosponsor Senator Tester, and \nhe is 1,000 percent right. We have been down this road. We have worked \nso hard to get everybody on board. States are on board. It does empower \nStates. It does allow them to do what they need to do.\n  I urge my colleagues to be a ``no'' vote on the Coburn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, if this is true, with no opt-out, then why \nnot do it for lawyers? Why not do it for doctors? Why not do it for \nevery other thing that is licensed that would be better for consumers? \nTo not give an opt-out is not right to the individual States.\n  I support the bill; I just think we need to have a protection for the \nStates. And the reason there is opposition to this is because there is \nobviously some people who don't agree that everybody is on board.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This drives homeowners into \nforeclosure, which is not good for families, not good for the \ncommunities, and it is certainly not good for the U.S. Government \nbecause we insure the vast bulk of these mortgages. Therefore, if we \nare going to be responsible from an accounting sense for the investment \nof the U.S. taxpayer, this needs to be addressed.\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment No. 2709, as \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ.

Madam President, let me be clear that my amendment simply \nclarifies existing law. I am trying to provide some clarity that \nprivate flood insurance can be a viable option for homeowners and \nbusinesses. Private insurers are already subject to regulations in each \nand every State by their insurance commissioners, and those insurance \ncommissioners are the best regulators for ensuring proper consumer \nprotection.\n  So I ask my colleagues to support the Heller-Lee amendment so we can \nprovide the American people with more competition, higher quality, and \nless cost when it comes to flood insurance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I have to oppose the Heller amendment. \nThis amendment would weaken consumer protections and completely remove \nminimum standards with respect to private flood insurance policies. In \nparticular, the amendment strips the requirement that the private \npolicy has to be comparable to a national flood insurance policy, \nmeaning that companies would be able to offer inadequate policies to \nconsumers across the country without any requirements as to what is in \nthe policy. For all of those who have talked about solvency, if you \nhave insurance that doesn't meet a minimum standard to ensure that the \nconsequences of flooding can be paid for by the policy, you want to \nvote against this amendment.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the Heller amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote and lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support S. 1926, the Homeowner Flood \nInsurance Affordability Act.\n  While the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act improved many \naspects of the National Flood Insurance Program, it also resulted in a \ndire situation for a number of American families who suddenly found \nthat their insurance rates would be doubled, tripled, or more. And it \nlocked some families into homes they couldn't afford to insure but also \ncouldn't afford to sell.\n  Today's bill will fix many of these problems by allowing the use of \nthe rate structure in place before passage of Biggert-Waters for some \nproperties. In 4 years, when the Flood Insurance Program will be up for \nreauthorization, Congress will be able to look to the results of two \nnew studies, called for in today's bill, for ways to make the Flood \nInsurance Program more equitable.\n  While I am pleased that this fix is being implemented, I still have \nconcerns about the Flood Insurance Program in general. Since the \nprogram's inception, Michigan residents have paid about six times more \nin premiums than they have received in claims. This inequity isn't fair \nfor Michigan homeowners, and I believe we need to take action to \nresolve this issue.\n  I had this inequity in mind in 2012 when we passed Biggert-Waters. I \nwas hopeful that the bill's provisions allowing for the development of \nprivate flood insurance markets would result in lower, more equitable \nrates for Michigan residents. So it was important to me that any action \nwe took today wouldn't make Michigan residents worse off than they are \nunder current law. After consulting with my colleagues and FEMA, I have \nbeen assured that the bill before us would not prevent a homeowner's \nflood insurance rates from decreasing if that rate would have decreased \nunder current law. I thank Senator Menendez for his assurances on this \nmatter, and I appreciate him engaging in a colloquy with\n\n[[Page S619]]\n\nme that will be made part of the record.\n  Again, the bill before us provides some relief for homeowners facing \nhuge rate increases, while preserving rate decreases for homeowners \nthat are currently eligible for them, and I am therefore supportive of \nthis bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/30/senate-section/article/S619-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ.

The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I urge all of our colleagues to cast a \n``yes'' vote on the final passage of the homeowner flood insurance act.\n  I think this has been an excellent week for the Senate. We were able \nto break through what sometimes is partisan gridlock and far too often \npervades this auspicious Chamber. We have had an honest and open debate \non this issue that is critical to the American people. We have had a \nrespectable debate on good-faith amendments that were germane to the \nbill and lived up to the ideals of the Senate, and now we are poised to \npass a critical piece of legislation which I believe enjoys \noverwhelming bipartisan support which will provide real relief to \nmillions of American families.\n  I thank all of our cosponsors and their staffs, including a very \nlarge list of Republican colleagues who support the bill. I \nparticularly thank my lead Republican cosponsor, Senator Isakson, for \nhis efforts and the partnership on this issue and many others. I have \nhad the pleasure to work with Senator Isakson on a number of issues and \nhave come to respect his honesty and his desire to come together and \nget things done, regardless of the issue. I think he is one of the most \nwell-respected Members of the Senate. Together, working with our \ncolleagues, I think we are poised to give some real relief to families \nand to send a strong message to the House and hope they will follow \nsuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

or\n       (B) section 1307(g)(3) of the National Flood Insurance Act \n     of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4014(g)(3)) with respect to any policy \n     described in that section, provided that the decision of the \n     policy holder to permit a lapse in flood insurance coverage \n     was as a result of the property covered by the policy no \n     longer being required to retain such coverage.\n       (3) Expiration.--The prohibitions set forth under \n     paragraphs (1) and (2) shall expire 6 months after the later \n     of--\n       (A) the date on which the Administrator proposes the draft \n     affordability framework;

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Income Inequality\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, on Tuesday evening, President Obama, in \nhis State of the Union Address, made the point that America must be the \nland of opportunity for all. He acknowledged, quite frankly, that for \nmany families in this country the American dream is just that, a dream.\n  Many families have lost hope that their children or grandchildren \nwill be able to achieve the American dream. President Obama made the \npoint that if we all work together, the outlook for this country is \nstrong and that we can make not only the American dream something \npeople can continue to believe but it can become a reality for more and \nmore American families.\n  But he also expressed the reality of where we are. The facts indicate \nthat intergenerational mobility, that is, for a child born into \npoverty, their ability to move up the economic ladder has not changed \nin the last several decades. The American dream has become just that \nfor too many families.\n  Let me point out some of the income disparity we have seen grow in \nthe United States. Some of this is very understandable. It is \nunderstandable that people get paid differently. Some people work a lot \nharder, some people come up with an incredibly ingenious way of doing \nsomething, the American way of developing new technologies, people are \nwilling to take greater risks than others. Yes, the reward will be \ngreater. We do expect and we do appreciate, we do look up to people who \ncan be very successful in our economic system.\n  But what is not understandable is how we have seen a growth in the \nincome disparity among Americans during good times and bad times. \nBetween 1979 and 2007, the top 1 percent in income in America saw their \nincome go up 275 percent, whereas the three middle quintiles--this is \nwhat we usually consider to be the middle class, those from 20 percent \nto 80 percent--saw their income go up only 40 percent. This is in a \nperiod of economic growth in this country from 1979. To see your income \ngo up only 40 percent, whereas the wealthiest are going up close to 300 \npercent, should be of concern to people of this country.\n  As we all know, in 2007 we went through a recession. Since that \nrecession, median income in this country has declined. It went down 31 \npercent during the recession. But for the wealthiest, it actually went \nup. It went up 31 percent. The median income went down for most \nAmericans.\n  We have a problem. During good times, we are seeing the income of the \nwealthiest get larger, in bad times we see wealthy people protected, \nwhereas middle-income families are doing worse. We even have what is \nknown as the birth lottery. If you are born into poverty, we know you \nhave a hard time getting out of poverty today. If you are in certain \ncommunities, it is even much more difficult.\n  So President Obama was right to concentrate on America as opportunity \nfor all. How can we get a growing middle class in this country? What \ncan we do to help everyone do better in our country? Many countries are \ndoing much better than we are. This disparity strikes at the heart of \nwho we are as a nation. We believe that if you work hard, you play \naccording to the rules, you should be able to succeed in this country. \nFor too many families, that is not the reality.\n  What can we do to make a difference? I know there has been a lot of \ntalk as to what we can do to help in that regard, what we can do to \nmake it better. It is very important to do that for the values of our \ncountry. It is important for the families who are affected. But it is \nalso important for our economy.\n  So, yes, we need to increase opportunity for middle-income families \nso more people can live the American dream. We need to do that because \nthat is what we stand for as a country. Those are our values. But we \nalso need to do this for our economy. It is very interesting that the \ncompanies that are making money today are ready to invest in the growth \nof our economy. They need consumers. They need people who will buy the \nautomobiles. They need people who will eat in the restaurants. They \nneed people who will go on vacations. They need people who will buy the \nclothing in the stores. If they do not have the income to do it, they \ndo not buy the products, our economy does not grow. So a growing middle \nclass is critically important to our economy.\n  What steps can we take? First, we have already taken one very \nimportant step with the passage of the Affordable Care Act. The \nAffordable Care Act dealt with health care costs. We have seen a \nreduction in the rate of health care costs over the past couple of \nyears. It is a major cost among American families. It has been growing \nand growing every year. We are now starting to see a slowdown in that. \nWhy? Because we are dealing with health delivery. We are trying to make \nthe health care system more efficient by looking at the total care of \nan individual rather than just looking at a specific episode.\n\n  We are trying to reduce readmissions. We are dealing with healthy \nlifestyles. The Affordable Care Act rewards all of those issues. We \nmake quality affordable insurance available to all Americans.\n  Last year, nearly 2 million families had to go through bankruptcy in \nAmerica because of health care costs. Last year it was estimated that \n56 million American families struggled to pay their medical bills. So \nthis is an issue we need to look at from the point of view of helping \nmiddle-income families.\n  Alan Krueger, the economist, observed:\n\n       We helped the middle class and those struggling to get into \n     the middle class by lowering the growth of health care costs, \n     by preventing those with pre-existing conditions from being \n     denied health insurance coverage, by creating exchanges for \n     small businesses and lower income families to obtain health \n     insurance at competitive rates, and by providing tax \n     subsidies to small businesses and lower income workers to \n     purchase insurance.\n\n  The point Mr. Krueger was making is when we eliminate preexisting \nconditions, when we have health exchanges that allow individuals and \nsmall businesses to be able to get competitive rates, we are helping \nwith middle-income growth in America.\n  There is a lot more we need to do in addition to the health care \nproblems we have in this country. The President mentioned during his \nState of the Union Address that Americans need a pay raise. I could not \nagree with him more. In 1968--that was 46 years ago--the minimum wage \nin this country was set at $1.60 per hour. If you adjust that for \ninflation, the minimum wage would be $10.77. The minimum wage in \nAmerica is not $10.77, it is $7.25 per hour. The tipped employee \nminimum wage is $2.13. For a full-time worker at the minimum wage, \n$7.25 per hour wage, they would be making a little over $15,000 a year. \nYou cannot support your family on $15,000 a year.\n  The National Low Income Housing Coalition has done a study. There is \nnot a single State in the Union where you can afford affordable \nhousing. They defined that as a two-bedroom housing unit on the rental \nmarket. There is not a single State in the Nation where the $15,000-a-\nyear income allows you to be able to afford that housing for your \nfamily.\n  The American dream is on life support. We need to do more about that. \nOne thing we can easily do in this Congress this year is raise the \nminimum wage to $10.10 an hour.\n  We also need to adjust it for inflation. What does that mean? We have \nonly adjusted minimum wages maybe three times in the last 30-some \nyears. We need to have the minimum wage keep up with inflation. That \nway we do not have to deal with abrupt increases. We will have gentle \nincreases, which I think is better for our economy to start off with, \nbut it also keeps the minimum wage at where we want to set it. It does \nnot erode the year after we pass it.\n  I think that makes sense. Let me dispel some of the myths about the \nminimum wage.\n  I hear frequently: Well, we are only taking about teenagers or those \nin their early twenties, it is their first job, and it is not so \nserious.\n\n[[Page S628]]\n\n  Let's look at the facts. The average age of a person earning minimum \nwage is 35. The median age is 31; 36 percent are over 40 years of age, \n40 years of age or older; 56 percent are women--now only 56 percent of \nour workforce is women, but at minimum wage it is much more likely to \nbe a woman than a man earning minimum wage; 28 percent of people who \nare earning the minimum wage have children. These are families trying \nto live on minimum wage.\n  Increasing the minimum wage will help to grow the middle class. It \nwill help our economy. A $10.10 per hour minimum wage will generate \nabout $34 billion in wages into our economy, $34 billion. Do you know \nwhat that means for the local businesses that are there? Do you know \nwhat that means for our economy? I know our economy is on the right \npath, but we have to help it along. We don't have enough jobs in \nAmerica, and $35 billion will allow that local supermarket or that \nrestaurant or that business owner to hire some more people, creating \nmore jobs, helping our economy continue to grow.\n  People who work full time shouldn't live in poverty. Today, with the \ncurrent minimum wage, and even with the tax credits we have available, \nmost individuals will live in poverty. That is unacceptable. At $10.10 \nper hour, we will be above the poverty line with the tax credits.\n  That is what we should do. If we play according to the rules, we \nshould be able to succeed; work 40 hours a week, we shouldn't have to \nlive in poverty, not in the United States of America.\n  Americans understand this. Polls have shown over and over that the \noverwhelming majority of Americans support a reasonable adjustment in \nthe minimum wage. The Gallup poll found that 76 percent of Americans \nbelieve Congress should pass an increase in the minimum wage. President \nObama has already taken action, and I applaud him for that. He is going \nto be signing an executive order. So those people who are Federal \nworkers, from a contractor, Federal contract worker, someone who is \ngetting money from the Federal Government and hires people, they are \ngoing to have to pay the minimum of a $10.10 minimum wage. We should do \nthe same for all workers in this country, and we have it in our power \nto do it.\n  There are a lot of other things the President mentioned. There are \nmany other issues that I think we need to deal with for our agenda for \na growing middle class. We clearly need to do a much better job in \neducation. Education is the key to opportunity in America. It truly \ndoes open doors. We want to open up jobs, but we need people who are \ntrained to be competitive for these jobs, particularly in a global \neconomy. We need people trained.\n  The President is right to say it starts at a very early age, pre-K. \nIn the pre-K through 12, we have to insist on quality education. We \nhave some great schools in America, but not all children have access to \nthose good schools. We need to do a better job at educating our \nchildren in all fields--all fields. STEM is very important, but so are \nthe humanities, so are the arts. We have to do a better job in our pre-\nK through 12. In higher education, we have to make it much more \naffordable.\n  How do we expect to get a growing middle class when so many families \nare looking at tens of thousands of dollars of educational bills but \nthey don't have any idea of how they are going to be able to pay for \nit--or our young workers saddled with these large debts affecting what \ncareer they are going to go into.\n  We have to invest in quality education but also affordable higher \neducation. That is why it is important for us to reauthorize the Higher \nEducation Act, to demand that there be value given for the money that \nwe invest in higher education but that we also make it affordable for \nAmerican families.\n  We need a modern infrastructure, and the President talked about that. \nGood jobs go to where there are good roads, good bridges, and good \ntransit systems. Any morning today, try to get around this region; we \nknow how important the transit system is in the Washington area.\n  In my own State I know we have three major transit projects that we \nneed to get funded so people don't spend hours in gridlock every \nmorning.\n  We need modern infrastructure in Maryland. In my own State of \nMaryland we have had tremendous problems with our water infrastructure. \nWe have had roads flooded and homes damaged. We need to rebuild our \nwater infrastructure and assure that people get clean, safe drinking \nwater and that we take care of our water infrastructure in America.\n  We need a modern energy grid in this country, which is critically \nimportant for economic growth. As President Obama said, good jobs go to \nwhere there is good infrastructure, and we need to do a better job with \nthe infrastructure in America.\n  We will have a chance again in this Congress. We haven't reauthorized \nthe Surface Transportation Act. I hope a WRDA bill will get done with \nsome of our WRDA projects. It is in conference today. Those are things \nwe can do to help grow a middle class.\n  We have to invest in research. I think one of the lines that received \nthe biggest applause in the President's State of the Union Address when \nhe said: We have to restore the cuts we made that we should never have \nmade to the basic research, the National Institutes of Health--\nheadquartered in my State. They are located in every State, but they \nare headquartered in Maryland. The work they do is critically important \nto economic growth in our country. We have to invest in research.\n  We need a progressive tax structure. More and more economists are \ntelling us that to have a growing middle class, we need the revenue. We \nare going to pay our bills--we don't want the debt--but we have to do \nit in a way that is fair and rewards the middle class.\n  Middle-class families don't take advantage of these tax breaks, these \ntax loopholes. At a minimum, we have to close those tax loopholes. I \nagree with the President in that regard.\n  The President also mentioned in the State of the Union Address that \nfor growing a middle class we want to make sure they have a job, we \nwant to make sure they are trained for that job, we want to make sure \nthey are rewarded for that job with fair wages, and we also want to \nmake sure they have a secure retirement. We are not doing enough to \nmake sure Americans have a secure retirement.\n  We have to save more as a nation. The best way to save is through \nretirement savings. We can all come together to do more. This is not a \npartisan issue. We should be able to do this together.\n  Let me end on a quote from a former President, Theodore Roosevelt.\n  He said: ``This country will not be a permanently good place for any \nof us to live in unless we make it a reasonably good place for all of \nus to live in.''\n  I think that was what President Obama was talking about when he said \n``opportunity for all.''\n  That is what this Nation stands for. We have all the reason to \nbelieve we can accomplish this for the people of America, but we need \nto work together with the President to work to implement commonsense \nchanges so we can have a growing middle class in America.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, earlier this month the Quinnipiac poll \nasked voters what the top priority they had for President Obama and \nMembers of Congress in 2014: 18 percent said health care; 16 percent \nsaid jobs and unemployment; 15 percent said the economy in general. By \ncomparison, only 1 percent of the voters said income inequality.\n  In other words, 99 percent of the voters in this Quinnipiac poll felt \nthat income inequality should not be our top priority and that, rather, \nthey would like for us to focus on not only the symptoms of the \nproblems but the root causes: how do we get people back to work; how do \nwe increase upward income mobility, letting people climb that ladder of \nsuccess so they can pursue their own American dream.\n  Yet the most significant economic proposal President Obama mentioned \nin his State of the Union was aimed not at fixing our health care \nsystem, creating jobs or boosting growth but, rather, at this idea of \nreducing income inequality. The American people are pretty darn smart, \nand they understand that we need to grow the size of the pie, not only \ncut up the pie into different pieces.\n\n[[Page S629]]\n\n  The best way to do that is by guaranteeing that people have the \nopportunity to pursue their dreams, not some socialistic notion of \nlet's slice up the pie in Washington, DC. No one does better under that \nkind of system.\n  But I also mentioned the President's--apparently--signature proposal \nfor addressing income inequality; that is, by raising the minimum wage. \nI heard my friend from Maryland talking about the minimum wage as if \nWashington can wave a magic wand and say: You, Mr. Employer, you, Madam \nEmployer, are now going to start paying your employees 40 percent more \nthan you did yesterday because the big bad Federal Government orders \nyou to do so.\n  They act as if that would have no other consequences or costs.\n  As I mentioned yesterday, there are studies that have been done that \nindicate that if we raise the minimum wage to $10.10, for which the \nPresident has argued, it could well dislocate as many as several \nhundred thousand people from their existing jobs.\n  Let's think about this for a minute. A small employer has a \nbusiness--let's say they have a fast food restaurant; I have hundreds \nof them, maybe thousands of them in my State--and the employer is \nworried about bringing money in the front door from selling their \nproduct, selling the food at their fast food restaurant, they know they \nare going to have certain expenses. Some of that is the materials or \nfood they put together. Some of it is their overhead such as \nelectricity and energy, but a significant part of that is going to be \nthe cost of labor, paying people to work there.\n  If we automatically tell that small employer, that fast food \nrestaurant, instead of $7 an hour, they now have to pay 40 percent \nmore, what is that going to do to their ability to not only hire and \ngrow their business but to maintain their current level of employment?\n  Perhaps there is a reason the President has counterintuitively \ndecided to come up with some sort of feel good quick patch such as the \nminimum wage, which would actually make things worse. Perhaps he has \ndecided to focus on this because maybe he is feeling a little bit \nguilty about his record over the past 4 to 5 years.\n  According to the New York Times--hardly a bastion of conservative \npropaganda--the trend of rising inequality ``appears to have \naccelerated during the Obama administration.''\n  The President--and I will get to this in a moment--appeared to \nconcede that much in his State of the Union speech. In fact, one \nmeasure of the income gap suggests the inequality of wages has \nincreased four times faster under President Obama than it did under the \n43rd President of the United States, George W. Bush. The best thing we \ncould do to support upward mobility is not to address the symptom of \nlower wages but to address the root cause, expand the economy, jobs, \nand to give people the tools they need to qualify for good, high-paying \njobs for which they don't have the job skills currently.\n  We know a lot of our community colleges, such as the one I visited \nlast week in Houston, San Jacinto College, does a very good job of \ntraining people for the skills they need in order to qualify for good, \nhigh-paying jobs. That is where we ought to focus our government, not \nby the Federal Government trying to fix prices when it comes to wages \nand actually end up making things worse.\n  Unfortunately, the President seems incapable of embracing an economic \nstrategy that doesn't involve more government, particularly more \ngovernment spending and more government control over the private \nsector. My constituents in Texas tell me one reason they are feeling \nuncertain about the future and the economy, particularly if they are a \nbusiness owner, is they don't know what kind of new taxes, they don't \nknow what kind of new regulation, and they don't know what financial \nburden, such as ObamaCare, will be thrust down on them that will \ntotally change their business model and cause them to go bankrupt--\nperhaps because they hadn't counted on what the Federal Government \nmight do to them, as opposed to the market.\n  But we have tried the President's approach: big government, spending, \nstimulus spending, and the like. That is a big reason why we are \nsuffering through the slowest economic recovery since the Great \nDepression and the highest and longest period of high unemployment \nsince that same time.\n  Even when the President seems to be supporting a fresh approach, he \nis actually selling old ideas in a new package. I remember the \nPresident talking, for example, about tax reform. He called for \nabolishing loopholes in the Tax Code and simultaneously lowering the \nmarginal rates. That sounds pretty good. I would support that, and I \nbelieve we could get strong bipartisan support for that kind of tax \nreform--lower the rates, cut out a lot of the underbrush, the tax \nexpenditures.\n  They are much like the President's own bipartisan fiscal and debt \ncommission, the Simpson-Bowles commission, recommended in December of \n2010. But what did the President do when his own bipartisan fiscal \ncommission reported to him a bipartisan plan to deal with the debt and \nto get the economy moving again? He ignored it. He walked away from it.\n  Unfortunately, the President, when he talks about tax reform, is \nactually talking about a way to raise taxes, to raise revenue. This is \nwhat I mean by that. He talks about tax reform as a vehicle for a tax \nincrease, even though he has already raised the taxes of hardworking \nAmerican families by $1.7 trillion while he has been President. But the \nAmerican people are plenty smart and they can figure out if the \nPresident is going to eliminate their deductions and tax credits and \nthe like that he is going to have to bring down their rate or else it \nwill actually be a tax increase.\n  There is another good reason why we need to do the kind of tax reform \nI am talking about, and that occasionally the President talks about \nwhen he is talking about progrowth tax reform, and that is to make it \nrevenue neutral, to bring down the rates, which will encourage people \nto invest and create jobs because they know the incentives will be \nthere for them. They will be able to reap the fruits of their labor and \nof their risk. That is the kind of tax reform both political parties \nsupported back in 1986 and the kind of tax reform we need to do again.\n  Sadly, the President and the majority leader have chosen to hijack \nthis wonderful idea of tax reform while demanding another $1 trillion \ntax increase. Meanwhile, the President wants to use the Tax Code to \npick winners and losers by discriminating against certain industries \nand increasing government subsidies to others.\n  I heard him talk about the oil and gas industry again. This is \nactually one of the brightest sectors of the economy. But the President \nwants to take the goose that laid the golden egg and burden it with \nadditional regulations and taxes.\n  Truth be known, 80 percent of the tax benefits that flow to the \nenergy sector flow to the so-called green energy sector--many of which \nI think are important--but we have to be realistic. We are actually \nwriting them a check as opposed to the millions and millions--and \nliterally hundreds of millions of dollars--of tax revenue generated \nfrom the oil and gas industry.\n  If there is one sector of the energy economy that is creating more \njobs and opportunity and provides more chance for us to reduce our \nimports from dangerous parts of the world, it is our domestic energy \nsector. But the President wants to raise their taxes.\n  The President acknowledged on Tuesday night that what has happened \nduring the 5-year term of his Presidency is that average wages have \nbarely budged, inequality has deepened, and upward mobility has \nstalled. In other words, he agrees with the assessment of The New York \nTimes. The problem is the solution to that condition would actually \nmake things worse and not better.\n  So I actually agree with the President's assessment: During his 5 \nyears as President, average wages have barely budged, inequality has \ndeepened, and upward mobility has stalled. So why in the world would we \nwant to add another $1 trillion tax burden on our economy and on the \nproductive sector of our economy at a time when average wages have \nbarely budged, inequality has deepened and upward mobility has stalled? \nWhy in the world would we jeopardize the renaissance in American oil \nand gas production, which represents one of our few economic bright\n\n[[Page S630]]\n\nspots? Why in the world would the President continue to reject the \nKeystone XL Pipeline from Canada, which would create thousands of well-\npaying jobs?\n  You will notice, by the way, Madam President, that President Obama \nsaid nothing--zero, zip, nada--about the Keystone XL Pipeline in his \nState of the Union. It really is just mind-boggling.\n  I would like to close by noting something the President said about \nhealth care, and this is another interesting aspect of his State of the \nUnion speech. It was about 40 minutes into his speech before he even \nmentioned health care, when that is the big, looming, 800-pound gorilla \nin the room. People are anxious about this rollout of ObamaCare--first \nthe Web site, then the cancellations, and then the sticker shock. \nPeople are worried about it. But the President waited 40 minutes into \nhis State of the Union speech before even addressing it.\n  But here is what the President said to congressional Republicans. He \nsaid: If you have specific plans to cut costs, cover more people, and \nincrease choice, tell America what you would do differently.\n  The problem is we have been telling the President since 2009, but he \nhas refused to listen. He has refused to listen, and he is still \nrefusing to listen.\n  The President went on to say that Republicans owe it to the American \npeople to say what they are for, not just what they are against. I \nagree with the President, and we have, and continue to do so, but he \ncontinues not to listen.\n  Republicans have been offering health care alternatives for at least \nthe last 5 years, most recently just earlier this week when three of my \ncolleagues: Senator Hatch, Senator Burr, and Senator Coburn introduced \na health reform blueprint that would reduce costs, expand quality \ninsurance coverage, and improve patient access to doctors and \nhospitals. If President Obama wasn't aware of this, then perhaps he \nneeds to spend a little more time outside the White House and the \nDemocratic echo chamber and actually engage with Members of this side \nof the aisle in serious discussions. It is really easy to knock down a \nstraw man, but only when it is not true. Given all the massive problems \nwith the implementation of ObamaCare--not just with the Web site, not \njust with the cancellations, not just with the sticker shock or the \nfact you can't keep your doctors if you like them--and along with all \nof the massive problems still plaguing our economy and stalling wages, \nit is time for the President to show some real leadership. The way he \ncould show that leadership is simply to get in a room with Members of \nthe opposing party and to say: Let's figure this out.\n  This plan or this blueprint that Senators Coburn, Burr, and Hatch \nhave introduced is just one of dozens of ideas that would actually \nbring down the cost of health insurance, which would make it more \naffordable, and that means more people could buy it and more people \nwould get covered. But the difference between our approach and the \nPresident's approach under ObamaCare is that under ObamaCare the \ngovernment gets to choose, and under our alternatives individuals and \nfamilies get to choose what is best for them.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise today to express my support \nfor the Agricultural Act of 2014, which is commonly known as the farm \nbill. It has been quite a journey over the past 3 years, and the bill \nbefore us is the result of many long hours of hard work. This bill, I \nunderstand, will be on the floor come Monday, and hopefully we will \nhave a vote on final passage on this bill on Tuesday.\n  I believe this bill achieves the promise of reform while tackling the \nsingle largest domestic issue facing our country: The debt and the \ndeficit. I commend Chairwoman Stabenow, Chairman Lucas, Ranking Members \nCochran and Peterson, as well as my fellow conferees for finishing what \nhas been a very difficult and complex task.\n  It is my sincere hope the Senate will adopt this bipartisan \nconference report, a bill that reforms critical farm programs, \nstrengthens the Nation's food security, protects the livelihood of our \nfarmers and ranchers and preserves our efforts to remain good stewards \nof the environment.\n  The bill not only works to protect producers in a time of need, but \nit also serves as a safety net for the nutritional well-being of low-\nincome Americans. Our nutrition assistance programs play a key role in \nensuring that needy Americans have access to the food they need to lead \nhealthy, productive lives.\n  We have worked to find savings while still ensuring those in greatest \nneed are provided a helping hand. I commend the important reinvestments \nmade in this bill to local food banks which provide support for so many \nof our communities.\n  Agricultural producers face a combination of challenges, such as \nunpredictable weather, variable input costs and market volatility that \nall combine to determine profit or loss in any given year. The 2008 \nfarm bill provided a strong safety net for producers, and I believe the \nfarm bill before us adheres to and honors the same commitment we made 5 \nyears ago in that farm bill.\n  Notably, Congress has taken a fresh look at our commodity programs. \nMaintaining an effective safety net is critical to America's farmers, \nand the bill before us eliminates direct payments while enhancing \noptions for farmers to manage their risk. We do so in a way that \ndoesn't disadvantage one region over another, a formula I thought was \nlacking in versions of this bill in the last Congress. Since then, I \nhave stressed to my colleagues the importance of producer choice, and I \nam truly pleased with the options that are built into this piece of \nlegislation.\n  One part of this bill I am uniquely proud of concerns cotton, a crop \nthat is particularly close to my heart and close to my home. More than \nany other part of this bill, the Upland cotton program represents \nfundamental reform. It meets our commitments in the World Trade \nOrganization and will resolve our dispute with Brazil.\n  Moreover, our Nation's farmers and landowners deserve to have long-\nterm conservation programs that have certainty to effectively and \nefficiently manage their land and resources for the years ahead. \nLocally led conservation is critical in supporting America's long-term \nenvironmental and economic stability. Not only do farm bill \nconservation programs play a key role in supporting clean air, clean \nwater, and productive soils, they also help producers avoid unnecessary \nregulation and support our Nation's long-term economic and food \nsecurity.\n  I also want to highlight language in this bill that links \nconservation compliance to crop insurance. My amendment led many \nleading agricultural, conservation, and crop insurance groups to come \ntogether and forge a compromise, ensuring crop insurance doesn't \ncompromise our natural resources for generations to come. It also \nprovides an opportunity for wildlife habitat to flourish and, thus, \nthis farm bill is supported by virtually every hunting and fishing \norganization in the country.\n  While all of the regulatory issues I supported were not able to be \nincluded in the final conference report, I am happy that language was \nincluded to clarify forest roads are not point sources and are not \nsubject to permit requirements under the Clean Water Act.\n  We must do what we can to protect producers, businesses, and all of \nour constituents from over-burdensome regulations coming out of EPA. \nAfter all, I am confident we have balanced the needs and interests \nbetween commodities and regions. Ultimately, the reason we are here is \nto represent those who work the land each and every day to ensure that \nAmericans continue to have the highest quality agricultural products in \nthe world.\n  Contrary to popular belief, food does not come from the grocery \nstore. For every piece of fresh produce purchased, every pound of meat, \nevery cotton t-shirt, and for every jar of peanut butter there is a \nfarmer or a rancher somewhere in America working each and every day--\nand working very hard--to get it there. I hope that we never take for \ngranted the ability to get safe quality food to stores across America \nfor consumers to purchase.\n  This will be my fourth and final farm bill as a Member of Congress. \nAs a former chairman and ranking member\n\n[[Page S631]]\n\nof the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, I am \nvery proud of this bill and of all previous farm bills of which I have \nhad the privilege to be a part.\n  As I have said, I have been around the country as a Member of \nCongress over the last 20 years. When I leave Congress, as I will at \nthe end of this year, I want to make sure we have strong agricultural \npolicies in place so that young people, such as my grandson John and my \ngrandson Jay, if they make a decision to come back to the farm, will \nhave an incentive to do so, and they will be able to provide a quality \nof life for their family very much like the quality of life they have \ntoday. Good agricultural policy will incentivize those young people to \nstay in rural America and on the farm, and I think this Farm bill does \nthat.\n  There is no single piece of legislation that impacts as many people \nin my State as this one. I believe it is vitally important to the \nfarmers, ranchers, and consumers of Georgia, as well as to those across \nthis great Nation that we support this legislation.\n  In closing, let me say it has been my distinct honor to represent and \nwork with the people, farmers, and ranchers of Georgia for 20 years. \nYou provide the highest quality food, feed, and fiber in the world. \nThanks for the opportunity to represent you in Congress and to be a \nmember of what I think is an outstanding agricultural committee.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, before he leaves the floor, I wish to \nthank the Senator from Georgia through the Chair for all of his \nextraordinary leadership on the agriculture committee for so many \nyears. As a new member of that committee, I saw firsthand how important \nhe was to our getting to a compromise.\n  So through the Chair, I say thank you to the Senator for his great \nservice, and particularly his great service to farmers and ranchers all \nacross his home State and also across the great State of Colorado.\n  I too wish to speak today on this compromise bill, this bipartisan \nbill, this farm bill which has such a long history. In 2012 the Senate \nagriculture committee was the only committee in the entire Congress \nwith a bipartisan deficit plan. It passed the Senate. The House didn't \ntake it up. I think it was an enormous disservice to rural Americans \nthat we didn't pass this bill 2 years ago, particularly when farmers \nand ranchers in my region are facing an unprecedented drought.\n  I distinctly remember being out during the summer of 2012 on the \neastern plains and the western slope of Colorado right before the \nPresidential election. While this town was completely consumed with who \nwas going to win that election, people in Colorado weren't talking \nabout it at all. They were asking: Why in the world can't we pass the \nfarm bill through the Congress and get it to the President's desk?\n  Now finally, after a series of extensions and half measures, we \nactually got to a conference committee. I think it may be the only \nconference committee in this Congress. This is how we used to do \nbusiness around here, I am told. I was glad to be a member of the one \nconference committee in this Congress. We got to committee on a long-\nterm bill.\n  I have stood on this floor before talking about the land of \nflickering lights. This town has become a place where the standard of \nsuccess is keeping the lights on for 2 more weeks or 2 more months. \nHere we have an honest-to-goodness 5-year farm bill.\n  Agreed to by both Republicans and Democrats, it has now been passed \nby the House of Representatives, and next week we will have a chance to \npass it here. Thanks to the tireless work of Chairwoman Stabenow, \nRanking Member Cochran, and the other conferees, we now will have the \nchance to vote.\n  Our rural communities are demanding the certainty that comes with a \nlong-term bill. Under the last farm bill--and history ought to be our \nguide here--our farmers and ranchers were remarkably productive. They \ndelivered the strongest 5-year stretch of farm exports in the history \nof the United States of America. Now it is time to make some reforms to \nfarm policy and to once again give rural America the stability it needs \nto provide food, fuel, and fiber to the Nation.\n  This bill reflects the values and process we want to see in other \nareas of the budget. We came together as Republicans and Democrats to \nidentify priorities, to streamline duplication, to get rid of things we \ndidn't need to do anymore, and to focus in the areas that were \nimportant--to break away from old, inefficient habits, to eliminate for \nthe first time direct payments issued to farmers regardless of economic \nneeds or market signals. That is a significant reform.\n  This bill prioritizes what is working for producers instead; namely, \ncrop insurance, which is a large part of what keeps farmers and rural \neconomies in business in this country, and that is why it is a \npriority.\n  Beyond crop insurance, another key highlight of this bill is the \ngreat tools it includes for livestock. It includes resources for much-\nneeded livestock disaster programs that are critical to southeast \nColorado, where ranchers are battling dry conditions we haven't seen \nsince the dust bowl.\n  When I visited last August, producers who are facing stubbornly \npersistent drought and feed shortages told me that nearly 70 percent of \ntheir livestock had been liquidated or relocated from the region in \njust 2 years. That is part of a boom and bust cycle that comes with our \nlivestock industry which makes it difficult to build for the future. \nThis farm bill couldn't come sooner for Colorado's ranchers.\n  Beyond livestock disaster, there is a lot to support our ranching \ncommunity in this bill. We have included a revamped conservation \ntitle--and I chair that subcommittee--which will keep our ranching \nlands in the West in their current state, rather than being divided for \ndevelopment.\n  The conference report also carries over important conservation title \nreforms from the Senate bill. Notably, it carries forward a Senate \nprovision to ensure that recipients of government-supported crop \ninsurance comply with basic conservation requirements. That measure was \nthe result of a historic agreement between the commodity groups and our \nconservation groups. It is supported by a wide variety of people, from \nthe Farm Bureau to the National Wildlife Federation.\n  This revamped conservation title is huge for rural America. It is \nhuge for farming and ranching families looking to keep their land and \nagriculture. It is huge for sportsmen. It is huge for anyone who cares \nabout the long-term health of our soil, our air, and our water. I thank \nagain the groups who traditionally represent producers and the groups \nwho traditionally represent the environmental community and \nconservationists and sportsmen for coming together on commonsense \nreforms. These conservation measures will help us improve the \nefficiency and production of agriculture and improve the quality of the \nenvironment in farm country.\n  We recognize that keeping these landscapes in their historical \nundeveloped state is an economic driver--for our State, anyway, and I \nsuspect for many States--for tourism and for wildlife habitat.\n  As I have traveled the State of Colorado, farmers and ranchers are \nconstantly talking to me about the importance of conservation and their \ncommitment to be stewards of the land for the next generation. They \nhighlighted in particular conservation easements which provide the \nDepartment of Agriculture assistance to help landowners voluntarily \nconserve the farming and ranching heritage of their land. I will spend \na couple of minutes sharing a story I have told on this floor before \nabout one of the many Coloradans who have benefited from the easement \nprogram.\n  This is a picture of the Music Meadows Ranch. I actually liked this \nphoto so much when I was on the floor the last time with it that I now \nhave a copy of it hanging in my office here in Washington. It is \noutside of Westcliffe, CO, which is at an elevation of 9,000 feet. \nThere are 4,000 acres in the ranch. Elin Ganschow raises some of the \nfinest grass-fed beef in the country on this family ranch. Thanks to \nthe grassland reserve program, Elin's ranch now has a permanent \nconservation easement, providing critical wildlife habitat for elk, \nmule deer, black bear, and mountain lions--species prized by Colorado's \nsportsmen--that contribute millions to our State's economy. Thanks\n\n[[Page S632]]\n\nto an amendment included in the conference report, we will see even \nmore of these easements happen on high-priority landscapes such as the \nMusic Meadows Ranch.\n  It is critical to our legacy and to the next generation of Coloradans \nto make sure we can find a way, when the land prices are rising the way \nthey are, to keep farms and ranches in the hands of our family farmers \nand our family ranches. That is what this bill will help us do.\n  I thank Chairwoman Stabenow and Senator Cochran for working with me \nto get that amendment approved and carried into the final bill. I thank \nall the Colorado ranchers, sportsmen, and advocates of the outdoors for \ntheir support in drafting this legislation.\n  Also important to the West, this legislation makes great strides on \nforest help. This is a huge issue for Colorado and all Western States \nas we deal with terrible droughts, overgrown forests, and massive \nwildfires--a number of which have occurred in Colorado.\n  This conference report gives the Forest Service new tools to treat \nareas in need of restoration, like acreage suffering from the bark \nbeetle epidemic that has ravaged Colorado.\n  The forestry title also reauthorizes important programs such as \nstewardship contracting and so-called good neighbor authority for our \nnational forests.\n  So all in all, I again say thank you to my colleagues on the \ncommittee for working so hard together, for acknowledging regional \ninterests that we have in the West which may not be shared with \neverybody. Although anybody who is downstream from Colorado--and that \nis basically the entire country--ought to care about forest health in \nColorado and ought to care about water quality in Colorado. I think we \nwere heard in this bill, and I deeply appreciate that.\n  The final point I would make is something which just came up in the \nlast 2 weeks and we were able to resolve. We had an appropriations bill \nwhich passed a couple of weeks ago that failed to include a very \nimportant provision to States that have a high percentage of their land \noccupied with Federal land, and that is the so-called PILT payments, \npayment in lieu of taxes.\n  The program helps rural counties containing Federal land within their \nboundaries offset the revenue they lose because they can't derive \nproperty taxes from their land. Dozens of Colorado counties derive \nsignificant portions of their operating budget from PILT. By the way, \nthey use those operating budgets to help maintain a lot of these \nFederal assets out there by, for example, providing search and rescue \nmissions. I can say, most of the people they are rescuing are not even \nfrom Colorado.\n  So I am very grateful to Chairwoman Stabenow for working with me and \nother Senators from the West to include a PILT extension in the \nconference report. It is only 1 year, however. Unlike the 5-year farm \nbill, this is not going to give us the predictability that we need. I \nwill continue to work with my senior Senator, Mr. Udall, and others to \nmake sure people hear the voice of the West in this Chamber.\n  Finally, this bill reduces the deficit by $23 billion. As I said, it \nis going to bring certainty and continued prosperity to rural America. \nFrom our forests, to our farms, to our ranches and rural communities, \nit is long overdue.\n  This bill has been supported across my home State of Colorado, from \nthe orchards of the Grand Valley, to the wheat fields of Washington \nCounty, and on the editorial pages of the Greeley Tribune and the \nDenver Post.\n  This is a good bill. It passed the House with strong bipartisan \nsupport, and I urge a yes vote when we take up the farm bill conference \nreport next week.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wish to share some remarks this \nafternoon concerning a very important issue; that is, the financial \ncondition of working Americans. Things are not good for them at this \npoint in time.\n  Just a few weeks ago on January 5, Gene Sperling, the key economic \nadviser to President Barack Obama, appeared on CNN's ``Face the \nNation.'' He said most of the people are desperately looking for jobs.\n\n       . . . our economy still has three people looking for every \n     job opening.\n\n  It has been reported that the House is having a retreat today and \nthat they are discussing whether to proceed with immigration reform--\napparently it would have to be somewhat like what passed the Senate or \nit would have no chance of passing the Senate--and they want to move \nthis bill to try to solve a problem out there, but I think it is not \npractical at this point in time.\n  I wish to share some thoughts about what we should consider as we \nevaluate what the proper immigration flow into the United States is at \nthis time. We are a nation that is founded on immigrants. We believe in \nthat. We admit 1 million people a year lawfully now, and that is the \nlargest number of any country in the world. We are about at the point--\nand I think we have reached it--where we have the largest percentage of \nforeign born in the history of the United States.\n  We hear advice from certain businesses. Despite Mr. Sperling's \nstatement that there are three applicants for every job opening--we \nhave advice of a different kind out of the business community: this is \na post from the CEO of Marriott Hotels. Mr. Bill Marriott, by all \naccounts, is a fine citizen. He says the House is ready to tackle \nimmigration. He said: ``As unemployment inches downward, we also need a \nfunctioning immigration system that helps us staff positions that might \notherwise go unfilled.''\n  Apparently, he would like to have even more applicants for positions \nat his hotels and would probably suggest that the Republic would be in \ngreat danger if there is not somebody available at every one of his \nhotel resorts to roll down somebody's covers and put a chocolate drop \non it. I don't know if that is the No. 1 challenge America faces at \nthis time.\n  The Financial Times of London says that business groups are pushing \nRepublicans for immigration reform.\n  I just want to talk about the economics of massive immigration. We \nneed to understand it, and we need to understand it clearly. The proper \nflow of immigration into America is good for our country, but we need \nto be careful about this--particularly at a time of financial stress \nfor millions of Americans who can't get a job or who can only get a \npart-time job or who have not seen their wages increase for many years.\n  Responsible immigration, I would suggest first and foremost, should \nhelp the economy, not hurt it. The great public policy question of \nimmigration reform is now before the House, and given the poor state of \nthe economy and the abysmal condition of the Federal budget, \nimmigration reform has become a cutting-edge debate, and a vigorous \nnational discussion about our country's economic future and reform of \nthe Federal programs that are driving unsustainable annual deficits.\n  Significantly increasing the inflow of immigrants into our country at \nthis time would adversely shock an already weak economy, lower average \nwages, increase unemployment, and decrease each American's prosperity \nand share of total output. As experts tell us, the GDP, growth of \nAmerica's economy per capita, will decline if the bill that was \nintroduced in the Senate were to become law and pass the Senate.\n  The Congressional Budget Office--our own experts, the people who \nadvise us--reported in its evaluation the Senate's effort to increase \nimmigration substantially. So the immigration reform was touted as a \ntough immigration bill that was going to end all kinds of problems, but \nit dramatically increased the amount of immigration.\n  They evaluated this bill and found that the economy would indeed grow \nbigger because it would contain more people, but it would not be a \nstronger economy for Americans. GDP per person would actually decline. \nSo that means the relative financial position of each American here \nwould decline if the legislation were passed based on\n\n[[Page S633]]\n\nthe careful analysis of the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Considering the acute current weaknesses of labor markets and the \nslowest economic recovery from a recession since the end of World War \nII, the last thing the U.S. economy needs is a handicap--much less an \nenormous harmful economic shock.\n  We still have not seen job markets recover to 2007 levels--6 years \nafter the start of the recession. Our economy still has three people \nlooking for every job opening. President Obama's advisers have said \nthat labor markets still have not recovered. A significant expansion of \nthe flow of immigrants into America would be occurring at a time of \nsubstantial weakness in labor markets.\n  It is not the unemployment rate that is so definitive. It is the \nnumber of people who are actually able to find a job and are working. \nThe current economic recovery has been too slow to produce an economic \nrebound. We still have fewer jobs than we had in 2007, when the \nrecession began, even though the population increased each year.\n  This chart is about employment as a share of the population. It shows \nat the period of the recession that we had this rapid drop from 63 \npercent of the population working down to a little above 58 percent, \nand it stuck there and still there today. This represents millions of \npeople who are not working today because they cannot find a job.\n  The concept that we would bring in more foreign workers to take the \nvery limited number of jobs we have, and increasing our flow over the \nnormal generous flow, makes no sense to me. I don't see how it can be \ndefended intellectually. It might give Mr. Marriott the ability to have \nmore cheap labor, and he may have to pay less to get somebody to work \nat his resorts, but that is not our problem. Our problem and our \nchallenge is to help the average American citizen live a better life, \nand we are not doing that effectively. It has not happened, and this is \nyears into this post-recession recovery--the so-called recovery.\n  The economy has produced 4.7 million jobs since the recovery began in \n2009. There are 6.3 million people who have dropped out of the \nworkforce. They have given up. They are discouraged workers who ceased \nto look for a job and do not show up on the unemployment rolls.\n  Some of them have taken disability. Some of them took early \nretirement. Some of them just quit. Maybe they have a spouse who is \nworking and they are no longer able to work. This is an amazing \nstatistic that dropouts exceed newly employed. This is unprecedented in \nthe post-World War II period.\n  As of the end of 2013, 58.6 percent of the adult population was \nemployed. This is down from 62.7 percent at the start of the recession. \nThe percentage has been stuck at about 58.6 percent since September of \n2009. It has not improved since 2009. If the same percentage of the \npopulation worked today as was working at the start of the recession, \nwe would have 10 million more jobs. We would have 10 million more \npeople working, 10 million more people able to support their families \nbetter, 10 million more people who are perhaps not on welfare than \nthere are today.\n  In 2007, there were 146 million Americans employed. Today there are \n144.6 million employed. At the same time, the population of those older \nthan 16 years of age has grown by 13.5 million. So while the population \nis increasing, the number of people actually working is lower than it \nwas in 2007.\n  Moreover, there has been no growth in the income of working \nAmericans. Working American families are stressed. Jobs just are not \nbeing created at nearly the rate to keep up with the population, and \nmillions are simply dropping out. To make matters even worse, the \nCensus Bureau reported in August of 2013 that the incomes of working \nfamilies have been in decline since 2007, adjusting for inflation.\n  This chart shows that it has been a fairly steady decline over a long \nperiod of time.\n  Look at this chart. A median income in 2012 dollars--constant \ndollars--was $56,000 in 1999. Today, in 2012, it is down to \n$51,000. That is a dramatic reduction in the average net income of \nAmerican workers. Someone says: What does that have to do with \nimmigration? I will discuss it. It is a factor in what is happening. It \njust is.\n\n  What does CBO say about immigration and wages? It is against this \ndifficult economic backdrop that immigration reformers want to \nmassively increase the number of work visas--doubling them--by \nincreasing the flow of migrants and legalizing those in the country \nwithout documents. Basically, we would increase the current flow of \nlegal immigrants to America from 10 million over 10 years to 30 \nmillion, and who would get permanent resident status in the United \nStates, over a 10-year period. Each of those 30 million would be \navailable to compete for any job in the marketplace. Having come from \npoor countries, many of them are glad to take a job for even the most \nminimum of wages. That is understandable. We respect that. I am not \ncriticizing them; I am talking about the policy of the U.S. Congress \nand the President of the United States.\n  CBO found that an increase of this kind, if the bill that passed the \nSenate had become law, would do a number of things. No. 1, it would \ndepress wages among low- and high-skilled native-born workers--depress \nwages, further, across the entire economy. That is what they reported \nto us. That is their official analysis.\n  They went on to say, No. 2, it would raise the national unemployment \nrate and increase the number of people unemployed.\n  No. 3, it would slow the growth of per capita output.\n  There may be someone who says this isn't so and insists it is not so. \nBut I would suggest if we bring more iron ore into America, the price \nof iron ore declines. If we bring in more cotton, the price of cotton \ndeclines. If we bring in more textiles, the price of textiles declines. \nAnd if we bring in more labor, the price of labor declines. That is \nwhat the facts are. It is a matter of economics. It hasn't been \nrepealed. It is amazing to me that some of our CEOs and some of our \nfree market geniuses don't understand that simple fact.\n  What about depressing wages? The Congressional Budget Office \nconcluded, based on extensive academic evidence, that low- and high-\nskilled native-born workers would compete at a wage disadvantage with \nsimilarly skilled immigrant workers.\n  CBO wrote:\n\n       Based on CBO's reading of that research, a 1-percent \n     increase in the labor force attributable to immigration has \n     tended to lower the relative wages for all workers with less \n     than a high school diploma by roughly three-tenths of 1 \n     percent . . . and to lower the relative wages for workers \n     with at least a college degree by one-tenth of a percent.\n\n  CBO's analysis of S. 744, the bill that passed the Senate, shows that \naverage wages across the entire economy are lower for the first 12 \nyears of this policy change.\n  All right. So what CBO said: If we pass this bill that passed the \nSenate, it will lower wages across the entire economy for 12 years.\n  Is it not the deep, fundamental responsibility of the Members of this \nSenate to be attuned to and concerned about the wages of working \nAmericans? And should we not immediately reject, at a time of low \nwages, declining wages, any policy our CBO tells us--certainly \ncorrectly--will pull down further the wages of American workers, at a \ntime when we have record unemployment, record numbers of people outside \nthe workforce? How simple is this for us to understand? I cannot \ncomprehend what it is that this Congress is thinking.\n  Professor George Borjas, of Harvard, the leading expert in the world, \nI think, on immigration and wages, recently noted that immigration from \n1960 through 2012, which is the last year he had data, has cost native-\nborn workers an of $402 billion. Where did that money go, according to \nProfessor Borjas? It went to the corporate profits in almost the exact \nsame amount. He says that native-owned firms would gain $437 billion in \nincome. So they would have their income increase and almost the \nentirety of that increase in income is paid for by the reduction in \nwages of their workers.\n  Right now, we have healthy profits but not healthy wages. Look at \nthis chart which points that out. This growth in profits is directly \ncaused by the advantage that accrues to a business out doing what it is \nsupposed to do, which is try to produce widgets at the lowest possible \nprice and make the best profits it can make for their stockholders, and \npay people competitive wages. When there are a lot more\n\n[[Page S634]]\n\nworkers applying for jobs, they don't have to pay as high wages as they \nwould if there weren't that many people applying for jobs.\n  I am not criticizing business. What I am saying is that as a matter \nof national policy, shouldn't it be our policy to listen to people such \nas Professor Borjas who studied this issue and tells us there is a \ndirect relationship between declining wages and the number of \nimmigrants we have coming into our country? I am not demeaning a single \nperson who wants to come to America to work. I am just talking about \nfacts.\n  In other words, Professor Borjas finds the increase for business is \nalmost entirely paid for by the decline in wages for working Americans.\n  The problem today is declining wages for working Americans a lot more \nthan it is about profits. I don't have any problem with corporate \nprofits. I wish corporate profits were higher. But we should not be \nsetting up economic factors and creating economic conditions that \nexacerbate an income problem that we have in America. That is all I am \nsaying. I think American workers have a right to demand it, and they \nunderstand this. Maybe some of our geniuses don't understand it. Some \nhave political gains they look for out of this. Some have economic \ngains they look for out of this. But somebody better be dealing with \nthe concerns of the people in our country who are hurting.\n  Professor Borjas found that the impact of increased immigration from \n1980 to 2000 resulted in a 3-percent decrease in the wage of average \nnative workers and an 8-percent decrease in the wage of high school \ndropouts--those who don't have a high school degree. The poorest \nworkers in America suffered the greatest amount during that 20-year \nperiod based on census data, empirical data, that he can defend.\n  As a matter of fact, this chart is a recent chart. Professor Borjas \npresented a paper to a large group of economists in June of last year--\nlast summer--and to my knowledge, nobody challenged it then or since.\n  So a 10-percent increase in the size of a skill group--that is high \nschool dropouts, for example--reduces the wages of that group \nsignificantly.\n  Professor Borjas wrote:\n\n       Immigration has its largest negative impact on the wage of \n     native workers who lack a high school diploma, a group that \n     makes up a modest (and, in recent decades, shrinking) share \n     of the workforce. These workers are among the poorest \n     Americans. The children of these workers make up a \n     disproportionate number of the children in poverty: 24.8 \n     percent of all children of the native-born working poor live \n     in households headed by a high school dropout.\n\n  That is what he said, not me. I think the economics has not been \ndisputed and it is just common sense.\n  Professor Borjas is not alone in these findings. I would note \nProfessor Borjas, I believe, was born in Cuba and came to this country \nas a young man, as an immigrant. Similar results were found by \neconomists at the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta. They had a look at \nit. The prominent labor economist David Card of the University of \nCalifornia-Berkeley reached similar conclusions.\n  However, it is not only lower wages that working Americans have to \nbear, but it will be higher unemployment as well.\n  The rapid increase in the immigrant population, especially those in \nthe low-skilled segment of the income distribution, will overwhelm the \nability of the economy to produce jobs and increase wages. Thus, the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that S. 744, the bill that passed \nthe Senate, would raise the number of unemployed Americans during the \nfirst 5 years by an average annual number of 162,000, and that \nunemployment would ``remain elevated through 2020.''\n  This is a stunning conclusion, especially when compared with what CBO \nargued in its 2013 Outlook. In their Budget and Economic Outlook of \nFebruary 2013--just last February--CBO projected--get this--in their \nprojections last year about how many additional jobs would be created \nper month for the next 5 years, they projected we would only create \n75,000 jobs a month.\n  I don't know what the future holds, but we are not seeing the kind of \njob growth we expected. This past December, the job growth was 74,000--\nwell below the 200,000 or so we need to just have a modest increase in \nthe number of working Americans. So CBO projects a 162,000 reduction \nannually in the number of people who would be getting jobs in America \nas a result of the passage of this bill, and we are only going to \ncreate 75,000 a month. That is a serious hammer blow to working \nAmericans and their ability to get a job. In other words, CBO's \nestimated increase in unemployed Americans will equal about a full \nmonth of average employment gain for the first 5 years after enactment. \nAt today's job growth rate, that additional unemployment is like losing \nabout a month of job gains every year.\n  What about economic output? As one might expect, the lower wages and \nhigher unemployment reflect an economy that is not growing fast enough \nto absorb all of the new workers we have in the country now who become \nwork-age eligible. While the size of the economy expands under the \nSenate's bill, because of the larger population, the growth rate is not \nfast enough to raise wages or lower unemployment. CBO estimates that \nGNP per capita will fall below baseline; that is, without passage of \nthe immigration bill. So if we pass the immigration bill, the GNP--\ngross national product--of America per person, per capita, will be \nlower and stay lower until 2030, than it would be if the bill didn't \npass at all.\n  President Obama, talked to us the other night about his concern over \nwages, and I would suggest the first thing he needs to do is to revise \nhis commitment to the passage of the Senate immigration bill and quit \npushing for it, because it is guaranteed to have a negative impact on \njobs and GDP per capita in America. It just is. It is something I hope \nall of us will consider.\n  I know the House wants to do the right thing. I know they want to \nreach out and be a positive force in America. I know a lot of our \nSenators felt the same way. But they weren't focused on the realities \nand the impacts that the legislation, if passed, would have. It would \nlower wages, it would increase unemployment, and it would reduce the \ngrowth in the economy per person over the next almost 30 years.\n\n  This not what we can afford to do now, colleagues. So I urge all of \nus to be honest about this and do the right thing. I know there are big \nbusinesses that want this. I know there are political interest groups \nthat want this. I know some of the Democratic leaders want this real \nbadly, and we have special activist groups that have one reason or \nanother to favor virtually open boarders in America.\n  We cannot go in that direction. It is not good for our constituents, \nfor the people who sent us here to serve the national interests.\n  I will just propose that instead of taking steps that are guaranteed, \ndocumented to make things worse, let's do a few things to make things \nbetter, things that would make jobs better and more profitable in \nAmerica, without adding to the debt of the United States, which in \nitself is hurting the American economy.\n  We need more American energy that creates good-paying jobs right here \nin America. We need a more competitive tax and regulatory code that \nallows businesses and workers to compete in the global marketplace. We \nneed a good trade policy that increases our exports and expands \ndomestic manufacturing and demands that U.S. manufacturers and workers \nhave their products fairly competed with on a level playing field \naround the world--fair trade as well as free trade. We need an \nimmigration policy that serves the interests of the American people, as \nI have just noted. We need to convert the welfare office from a check-\ndelivering institution to a job-creating, job-training center to help \nmove people into jobs and help them become employed at better wages.\n  We need to make the government of this country leaner and more \naccountable to the taxpayers so that it produces more for every tax \ndollar that is extracted from the American public. We have an \nobligation to produce for the money they give us, and we are not being \nvery productive by any fair analysis. We need to restore economic \nconfidence by continuing our effort to produce a balanced budget.\n  Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to share these \nthoughts. I believe what I have said represents one of the most \nsignificant public policy issues facing our country today. We need to \nunderstand what we are doing.\n\n[[Page S635]]\n\nWe need to understand the impact of our legislation. If we take the \ntime to do so, we will recognize that when we reform immigration, and \nit must be quite different from that which would be done if the Senate \nbill were to become law.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Gun Violence\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, since the failure of the gun bill on the \nfloor of the Senate, I have tried to come to the floor every week or so \nto talk about the voices of the thousands of victims who have died from \ngun violence all across this country. About 30 people a day--not even \ncounting suicides--die from gun violence. It is a travesty, it is a \ntragedy, it is a scourge on our country, and it is inflicting pain in \nour cities, in our suburbs, and the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives--the most deliberative, the most representative bodies \nin the history of the world--are doing absolutely nothing about it.\n  If you want to know why it continues, we can give a long list of \nreasons. There is no one panacea to solve the problem of gun violence. \nIt is about tightening our gun laws. It is about better mental health \nprogramming, more funding. It is about addressing a culture of \nviolence. But it is also about a signal that we send here, a signal of \ncomplicity.\n  Our silence essentially sends a message to young men and women all \nacross this country that we must be OK, we must be all right with \nepidemic levels of gun violence if the numbers continue to spiral \nupwards and we do absolutely nothing about it.\n  The statistics alone tell you we should step to the plate and change \nour laws, address the problem, give new resources. But seeing that \nthose numbers and that data have not really moved the Senate to action, \nmaybe the voices of the victims will.\n  A lot of attention here in the greater Washington area was paid to a \nseemingly random shooting without apparent motive in a suburban \nMaryland mall on Saturday, January 25.\n  A gunman came in, a 19-year-old with a shotgun, and sprayed bullets \ninto a Zumiez store, which is a store that sells clothing and \nmerchandise for skateboarders and snowboarders.\n  He killed Brianna Benlolo and Tyler Johnson, two people he apparently \nhad no connection to.\n  Brianna was 21 years old, and she left behind a little 2-year-old boy \nElijah. Her friends who worked at the mall with her said Brianna was \n``really proud of her job.'' They spoke about how positive she was. One \nfriend said ``she never seemed like she had any negativity.'' She left \nbehind a little notebook that she had filled with fanciful drawings and \nphrases from pop culture. She was a really, really happy young woman \nwho was raising a really, really happy little boy. Little 2-year-old \nElijah is never going to get to see his mother again because of a \nseemingly random, unprovoked act of violence in another mass shooting.\n  Tyler Johnson had had a tough life. He had had a history of substance \nabuse. But he had been clean from drugs and alcohol for 2 years, and he \nhad pretty much completely turned his life around. He was working, \nearning a paycheck at this store at the mall. But then, after work, he \nhad become a board member at a local 12-step recovery house called the \nSerenity Center in Columbia, and he was now all about the business of \nmentoring other young people to make sure they would not fall into the \nsame cycle of abuse of drugs and alcohol that he had.\n  The president of Serenity Center said:\n\n       I thought he was a remarkable young man. I don't see a lot \n     of young people stepping up like that. I just thought he was \n     an up-and-coming leader.\n\n  We are desperate in this country to have these kinds of role models \nsuch as Tyler Johnson--somebody who had struggled with dependence and \nhad not only conquered it for himself but then had gone out and set \nhimself about being a role model.\n  The difference that Tyler Johnson could have made--Tyler was 25 years \nold. Tyler was not even halfway through his life, and he had decided he \nwas going to spend his life turning people's lives around. He had \ndecided he was going to go back and get a degree that would help him \nbecome a counselor for young people.\n\n  We lost maybe 50 years of life transformations because Tyler Johnson \nis gone. Tyler Johnson was going to help turn kids' lives around, to \nget them back on the straight and narrow path like he did, but we do \nnot get that benefit any longer because of another mass shooting at a \nMaryland mall.\n  When you read these obituaries and horrific newspaper articles about \nshooting after shooting, as I have since I became so personally \nconnected to this issue in the wake of the shooting in Sandy Hook that \ntook Dylan Hockley's life and Daniel Barden's life and Jesse Lewis's \nlife and Ben Wheeler's life, you see how casual the violence is. Chad \nOulson lost his life on January 13 of this year in Wesley Chapel, FL.\n  Chad was going to see a new movie. I have not seen it, but I have \nheard it is pretty good: ``Lone Survivor.'' He was texting his 3-year-\nold daughter, as the previews were playing. One of the movie patrons \ndid not like the fact that Chad was texting during the previews of the \nmovie. So he confronted Chad about it. They had an argument. They had \nan altercation. This guy left the theater to go get a security guard. \nWhen he returned, he came back alone. He took out a gun, and he shot \nChad.\n  Chad was struck in the chest and died. His wife was hit in the hand \nand suffered injuries. An off-duty police officer and two nurses who \nhappened to be in the theater ensured there were no more shots fired. \nThey tried to resuscitate Chad until the paramedics arrived.\n  His family members said he was just a good all-around guy. He was the \nfather of a beautiful little girl--a girl he was texting with at the \ntime of his murder. ``You'd be hard-pressed to find somebody who didn't \nlike him,'' somebody said. ``He was a friend to everybody, whoever he \nmet.''\n  Two days later, in Dallas, TX, Trinidad Salazar was killed over a \ndispute about roof shingles. There was a dispute as to whether he owned \nthese shingles or whether another guy owned the shingles, and this 38-\nyear-old guy decided the best way to resolve the dispute over who owned \nthese roof shingles was to shoot 33-year-old Trinidad Salazar. A .40 \ncaliber Glock pistol was pulled out. He fired one warning shot into the \nground, and then fired one shot directly into Trinidad, and Trinidad, \nat 30 years old, is no longer with us.\n  The casualness and the randomness of this gun violence makes it even \nharder to take. It is not that you can ever defend this kind of \ncarnage. But when no one can see it coming, when it becomes the result \nof simple arguments over housing materials or nuisances in movie \ntheaters or items of clothing, it just makes it even more absurd that \nwe do not step to the plate and do something about it.\n  In 2013--the year after Sandy Hook happened--we paid even more \nattention to school shootings. So when one came across our transom, \nwhen we saw evidence or reports of shootings on TV, we all paid \nattention. Over the course of 2013, there were 28 school shootings. \nMadam President, 28 school shootings happened in 2013--the year after \nSandy Hook. That is a lot.\n  We are 28 days into 2014, and in those 28 days we have had 11 school \nshootings. We had 28 in all of 2013. We have had 11 school shootings in \njust the first month of 2014 alone. We are on pace--we are on pace--to \nhave over 120 school shootings this year.\n  On January 9, in Jackson, TN; on January 13, in New Haven, CT; on \nJanuary 14, in Roswell, NM; on January 17, in Philadelphia, PA; on \nJanuary 17, in Albany, GA; on January 20, at Widener University; on \nJanuary 21, at Purdue University; again on January 21, at Wakefield \nElementary, in Turlock, CA; on January 24, at South Carolina State \nUniversity; on January 27, in Carbondale, IL; on January 28, in \nHonolulu, HI--luckily, each one of them--``luckily,'' that is a \nterrible word to use--in each one of these school shootings there have \nonly been one or two or three people shot or injured. But it is\n\n[[Page S636]]\n\njust a matter of time before there is another Sandy Hook. When you are \nhaving school shootings at the rate of one every two school days, it is \njust a matter of time before somebody continues to pull that trigger \nover and over or someone does not intervene as quickly as they \nintervened in these situations.\n  If we do not recognize the trend that is developing, if we do not at \nleast send a message that the Senate and the House do not condone with \nour silence these acts, then it will just continue to happen.\n  I am not suggesting that there is a magical act of Congress that we \ncan pass that is going to end gun violence in this country or, frankly, \nthat is going to stop people with deep psychological illnesses from \nwalking into malls and churches and schools occasionally and firing \nweapons.\n  But we can take steps to make sure it does not happen as often. We \ncan take steps to make sure the carnage is not as bad or as significant \nwhen someone decides to walk into a crowded place and do that kind of \ndamage. That is within our power. That is something on which \nRepublicans and Democrats should be able to agree.\n  I will continue to come down to the floor to tell the stories of the \nvoices of the victims until we can find the ability to reach across \nparty lines and do something to at least send a message that the Senate \nstands against the developing, awful, terrible trend of mass violence \nin this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to talk about the farm bill that \nwill be on the floor--is on the floor, that we will vote on sometime \nnext week. I would also predict that this is the last farm bill that \nwill not be driven by the new realities of people who want their food \nneeds met in new ways. These food needs are going to be greater, but we \nare going to be less concerned, I would expect, 5 years from now about \nfarm surpluses and what happens if we grow too much than we are about \nhow we meet the growing food needs of the world, partially because of \npopulation, partially because people, once they get better food, want \nthe better food. Once you have got the variety of food, once you have \nhad the experience of better food, nobody wants to go back to the food \nthey used to have. We are going to see that driving this debate more \nover the next few years than we have up until now.\n  Agriculture in many States, including my State of Missouri, is the \nNo. 1 industry. Sixteen percent of our workforce is directly involved \nin agriculture. It continues in State after State where the Presiding \nOfficer and I both hear that every Senator represents an agricultural \nState. I think every Senator represents a State where agriculture is a \nsignificant part of what we do, as it has always been part of what we \ndo. Fewer people participate directly on the production end of \nagriculture, but, of course, everybody participates on the consumption \nend of agriculture.\n  In America, agriculture directly supports 16 million jobs which are \njust involved in how we grow and process what we have. Farm families in \nMissouri, farm families nationwide, work each and every day to feed the \ncountry. More and more are focused on what it takes also to feed the \nworld.\n  For 2 years now we have been in a temporary farm bill. In some cases, \nthe assistance that government has given and will give again with the \npassage of this bill has not even been there for the last 2 years. When \nI talk in a few minutes about livestock disaster, that program went \naway in 2011 as we were facing some of the most difficult times in a \nlong time.\n  The drought has been worse in many States than anytime since the \n1950s. Programs that would deal with that have not dealt with that. But \nthe investment in this bill will reaffirm our commitment to being at \nthe forefront of productive agriculture. It will provide rural \ncommunities the ability to compete both here and abroad. Certainly, it \nis not perfect. I think while it may not be the best possible bill, I \nwould say as I said 2 years ago when I voted for that interim bill, it \nis the best bill possible right now.\n  As we all know, the leaders on the agriculture committees in the \nHouse and the Senate have spent a long time trying to bring this bill \ntogether. If it were easy, they would have done it quicker. They did \nnot come back earlier than everybody else did during the recent break \nbecause they wanted to be back early; they came back because that \ndiscussion had not brought itself to a final bill yet.\n  But this is the bill. It does some good things. It provides a \ncertainty and a safety net for farm families. Very few farm families at \nsome point in the productive cycle of a year do not have to go to the \nbanker and say: We need to borrow some money to make something possible \nin this planning year that we could not do without borrowed money. Here \nis how we are going to pay it back. Well, ``here is how we are going to \npay it back'' is a whole lot better if you say: Here is the safety net. \nHere is what happens if things that we do not expect to go wrong go \nwrong. Here is what happens if we have to actually use the crop \ninsurance. Here is how we will pledge to you that we will, of course, \nhave crop insurance when you make this loan. So this bill provides that \nand gives a 5-year place to look.\n  My mom and dad were dairy farmers. I have some sense of understanding \nhow farm families work and think. Knowing how you can look at the rules \nand regulations 5 years in advance is a whole lot better than looking 5 \nmonths in advance or 2 years in advance. We have gone through a period \nwhere farm families have not known for a long time now what the long-\nterm government commitment to agriculture is. When we pass this bill, \nwe are going to have that longer commitment for the first time in a \nwhile.\n  This supports our export opportunities. It finds ways that allow us \nto get more easily into markets that the people in those countries want \nus to be in, because what we produce is something they need, they want, \nthey know they would like to have. ``USA'' stamped on a truck, on a \nbin, on a container, is a seal of approval all over the world.\n  This expands bioenergy production, not for the bioenergy things that \nare out there already in a proven way, but expanding bioenergy in \nplaces we know it needs to be expanded. This is the bill that we invest \nin rural communities.\n  Eighty percent of this bill is now in nutrition programs that affect \npeople in the most urban parts of our country and in rural parts of our \ncountry. But the 20 percent that includes the crop insurance and other \nprograms--I think crop insurance is about 4 percent of the entire bill \nhere. We see people who are critical of how government is doing too \nmuch to help farm families, although they usually say--they usually \nassume that all farm families are big corporate farmers. But just 4 \npercent or so of the bill is that.\n  In the 20 percent that deals with rural America, it is things such as \neconomic development that allow people to continue to compete and be in \nrural America. This gives our colleges and universities and the land \ngrants principally, but the nonland grants who have an agricultural \nmission, the things they need, the tools they need, and research.\n  I think researchers were trying to figure out how to be sure that our \nproducts are as healthy and helpful to the people who consume them as \npossible. That is good. This bill does that by securing at the same \ntime some real cost savings. There is about $23 billion of deficit \nreduction because of the reforms in this bill, that which we have done \nin the past that we no longer believe we have to do for farm families \nto be competitive. I think 5 years from now we can look at this again \nand assume that the world marketplace allows us to look at farming in a \nnew way.\n  I would like to discuss a couple of important issues that are \naddressed in this bill. One is research; the other is livestock \ndisaster assistance. In 2012, about 80 percent of the agricultural land \nin America experienced a drought. It was the most extensive drought in \nour country since the 1950s.\n\n  In Missouri, all 114 counties were declared disaster areas because of \nthat drought. Many with those persistently dry conditions were ranked \namong the very worst in the country. We grow lots of livestock in our \nState--lots of livestock of all kinds, particularly cattle, beef and \ndairy cattle. We have livestock, we have other livestock that is a\n\n[[Page S637]]\n\nlittle easier to both categorize and contain and know everything you \nwould want to know about.\n  But these industries did not have the kind of risk management \nprograms they needed. For whatever reason, in the last farm bill, the \nlivestock assistance programs, the livestock disaster programs--that is \nall they are; they are not to help in good times, they are purely to \nhelp in bad times. Those programs expired in 2011, just at the time \nwhen we had some of the worst livestock conditions we have had in over \n50 years. So there was nothing there for those livestock producers. \nThey were forced to liquidate their herds, resulting in the lowest \ncattle numbers since 1952.\n  What does that mean, the lowest cattle numbers since 1952? It means \nwe have fewer cattle, obviously. But it also means that the replacement \nof the herd is going to be harder, not as many mother cows, not as many \ncalves. Beef shelves in grocery stores will reflect these cattle \nnumbers for a long time because people had to sell their herds.\n  In our State alone, there were 300,000 fewer cattle than there were a \ncouple of years ago. It is the lowest number of cattle, in fact, \nsingle-year decline since the mid-1980s. It takes a long time to come \nback from that decline and have the numbers of cattle available for \nfeedlots, for buyers, and eventually for the grocery store shelves than \nwe would have had otherwise.\n  I am pleased the farm bill makes these programs permanent, but, \nagain, they are permanent programs that only occur if you have \nextraordinary disaster circumstances that make them occur.\n  Thanks to smart investment in research, we have the safest, most \naffordable and abundant food supply in the world. We make smart \ninvestment in research. This is not a new commitment by the Federal \nGovernment. It goes back to 1862 when President Lincoln signed the bill \nthat created the Department of Agriculture. One of the principal \npurposes for the Department of Agriculture was research that could be \nshared so that every farmer or every State or every community did not \nhave to do their own research but research would be shared by the \nDepartment of Agriculture, encouraged by the Department of Agriculture, \ndone in a way that met the needs of the whole country.\n  Research continues to produce great results. In 1940, 1 farmer fed 19 \npeople. This year, 1 farmer feeds about 155 people. By 2050, global \nfood demand is expected to increase by about 70 percent, and to double \nshortly after that. The American farmer is the best farmer in the world \nat producing quality products that are desired to meet that growing \nfood need. If world food needs double between now and some date shortly \nafter 2050, that means we need to produce as much food in the second \nhalf of this century in any given year as we have produced--if 10,000 \nyears of agricultural research has brought us to what we produce today, \nwe need to double that in about the next 50 years.\n  It is incumbent upon us to make sure we have the tools available to \ndo that. As the ranking member of the agricultural appropriations \nCommittee, certainly research has been critical to our committee. I am \nglad the farm bill authorizes these research programs and allows us to \ncontinue to encourage research that will enable us to do what we need \nto do to meet our own food needs and world food needs.\n  Agricultural research lets us have more efficient production, ways to \neradicate pests and disease. It addresses the adverse weather \nconditions the crops grow in. Africa as a continent is not in the food \nproduction role it needs to be, if by 2050 the projection is half of \nthe people in the world will live in Africa. It is in our best interest \nto see them produce more food as well.\n  Of course, it is in our best interests to maintain a safe food \nsupply. Agricultural research can aid small farmers. We can see ag \nresearch that adds value to staple crops and adds nutrients to staple \ncrops in countries that grow a lot and have a lot of it, but, frankly, \nit may not have much food value, even though it may be most of what \npeople eat.\n  The Danforth Plant Science Center in St. Louis conducts critical \nresearch to do just that, to look at a staple crop in a developing \ncountry and figure how that crop can be changed in a way that is \nbeneficial to people who are used to it, who can grow it, but need to \nfigure out how to select the best of those plants to replant next year.\n  Research into nutrient fortification, drought resistance, disease, \nand other things is important. The farm bill takes that step.\n  The chairwoman of the committee and the ranking member of the \ncommittee, our friends the Senators from Michigan and Mississippi, have \nworked hard to bring this bill forward.\n  I close by saying again, I predict that as world food needs and 21st \ncentury opportunities for agriculture change, that is going to define \nthe debate 5 years from now, well below what we are likely to \nanticipate. It is no longer going to be a world that is driven about \nhow do we sell the crops we grow, it is going to be much more driven by \nhow do we grow the crops the world needs and Americans need, and how do \nwe connect that result to the market that needs it.\n  American farmers for a long time have struggled with how productive \nthey were in a world that maybe didn't need everything we could grow. \nThat is not going to be the case in the very near future. I believe by \nthe time we get to the end of this 5-year farm bill, we are going to \nhave a very different discussion about how we meet our own food needs, \nworld food needs, and the great opportunity in agriculture, agriculture \nbusiness, and competition--that nobody does better than the American \nfarmer.\n  I intend to support this bill next week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I attended, as did all of my colleagues, the President's \nState of the Union Message the night before last. Obviously, as always, \nthe President delivers an excellent speech.\n  I must say that in the years I have attended the President's State of \nthe Union Message, I have never seen a message on national security and \nforeign policy as disconnected from reality as the President's speech. \nObviously it had minor importance by the amount of time that was taken \nin the speech, but what was most interesting was the President \nportrayed a Middle East, in particular, that has little relation to the \nreality today and the ongoing tragedies, deaths, and sacrifice because \nof a failure of American leadership.\n  In interesting polling data today, a Pew Research poll indicates:\n\n       More Now See Failure than Success in Iraq, Afghanistan\n       Little Partisan Gap in Views of Whether U.S. Has Reached \n     Goals.\n\n  It continues:\n\n       After more than a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, \n     the public does not think the United States has achieved its \n     goals in either country. About half of Americans (52%) say \n     the U.S. has mostly failed to achieve its goals in \n     Afghanistan while 38% say it has mostly succeeded.\n\n  Opinions about the U.S. war in Iraq are virtually the same; 52 \npercent say the United States has mostly failed in reaching its goals \nthere while 38 percent say it has mostly succeeded.\n  Continuing:\n\n       In both cases, evaluations of the wars have turned more \n     negative in recent years. In November 2011, as the U.S. was \n     completing its military withdrawal from Iraq, a majority \n     (56%) thought the U.S. had achieved its goals there.\n\n  So the American people, despite the rhetoric from the \nadministration--some of it incredibly bizarre--have figured out that \nafter many years of sacrifice, expenditure of American blood and \ntreasure, we are looking at and staring failure in the face.\n  I will quote from the President's speech the night before last.\n  On Iraq, the President said:\n\n       When I took office, nearly 180,000 troops were serving in \n     Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, all our troops are out of Iraq.\n\n  Yes, that is a correct statement. But what the President didn't go on \nto say was that Iraq is now collapsing under the weight of sectarian \nviolence that now has exceeded that of 2008, one of the most dangerous \nyears of the war. What the President didn't say was that there is \nsectarian violence, Sunni and Shia, initiated largely by President\n\n[[Page S638]]\n\nMaliki, which is causing attacks throughout Iraq--bomb detonations, \nIEDs, attacks on various institutions. President Maliki has driven his \nown vice president out of the country. The list goes on and on.\n  I say to my colleagues, there is no greater example of our failure in \nIraq than Fallujah today. In the second battle of Fallujah, in 2007, \nthe United States of America lost 96 marines and soldiers killed, over \n600 wounded. Today, vehicles are driving through the streets of \nFallujah flying Al-Qaeda flags. Al-Qaeda is now in charge in Fallujah.\n  I wonder what we tell families of those brave soldiers and marines \nwho were killed and wounded in the first and second battle of Fallujah. \nBecause in the words of General Petraeus, who was the architect of the \nsurge--which most of my colleagues, including the President of the \nUnited States, said would fail, when actually there were many of us who \nknew that it would and did succeed: We won the war but lost the peace.\n  We lost the peace because the United States of America did not leave \na residual force behind, thereby allowing the situation to deteriorate \nto where it is today with Al-Qaeda now in charge of the city of \nFallujah, Ramadi--the Syria-Iraq border now being the headquarters and \nstaging areas of Al-Qaeda in both Syria and Iraq. Their black flags now \nfly over cities where brave Americans, marines and soldiers, sacrificed \ntheir lives and their well-being.\n  Gen. James Conway, who commanded the marines in the first battle of \nFallujah in April 2004, commenting on failures of the administration's \npolicies in Iraq stated: ``In some ways, the al-Qaeda grand strategy is \nvindicated.'' He deplored U.S. policies, appeared weak and confused in \nthe wake of how hard we fought to get those cities back in the first \nplace.\n  What did the President of the United States say? Did he mention \nFallujah? Of course not.\n  He said:\n\n       When I took office, nearly 180,000 troops were serving in \n     Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, all our troops are out of Iraq.\n\n  Yes, the troops are out of Iraq and the place is going to hell in a \nhand basket.\n  Don't think that these people, Al-Qaeda and Al Nusra, are not intent \non pursuing their goals of radical Islam right to the United States of \nAmerica. This should concern every one of my colleagues and every \nAmerican citizen.\n  Yesterday there was a hearing in the Senate Intelligence Committee:\n\n       Al Qaida faction in Syria contemplating U.S. attack, \n     intelligence officials warn.\n       Senate hears Nusra Front has ``aspirations for attacks on \n     the homeland'' amid concern over civil war's terrorism \n     implications.\n       Intelligence officials have claimed that a faction linked \n     to al-Qaida in Syria has a desire to launch a domestic attack \n     on the US, an assertion that underscored the growing \n     importance of the Syrian civil war to global terrorism.\n       The Nusra Front, one of the jihadist factions in Syria, \n     that aligns itself with al-Qaida, ``does have aspirations for \n     attack on the homeland,'' James Clapper, the US director of \n     national intelligence, told the Senate Intelligence Committee \n     on Wednesday, yesterday.\n\n  We know that with Al Nusra, Al-Qaeda, and other radical Islamist \norganizations, which, by the way, are attracting young men from all \nover the world, including Europe, is now one that is contemplating \nattacks on the United States of America.\n  I want to again mention General Conway, who commanded the marines \nduring the first battle of Fallujah in 2004.\n  At the Heritage Foundation he said:\n\n       ``We fought and died taking those cities,'' Conway said \n     Wednesday at the Heritage Foundation. Conway became the \n     Marine Corps commandant before retiring as a four-star \n     general.\n       A blunt-talking general who rarely seeks the spotlight, \n     Conway described his reaction to recent events in stark terms \n     during his brief remarks.\n       It causes Iraqi and U.S. policies to look a little weak and \n     confused in the wake of how hard we fought to get those \n     cities back in the first place.\n\n  Continuing:\n\n       ``In some ways, the al-Qaeda grand strategy is \n     vindicated,'' Conway said, referring to the organization's \n     desire to wait out American forces.\n\n  Why did they wait out American forces? They waited out American \nforces because as soon as President Obama took office he announced we \nwere leaving. He didn't announce a strategy for success. He didn't say \nwe have to reach certain goals before we leave. He told everybody we \nwere leaving.\n  It is very clear, when we look at electoral history, that his vote \nagainst the resolution concerning military action in Iraq was one of \nthe factors that led him to the Presidency. But for him to stand before \nthe American people and say:\n\n       When I took office, nearly 180,000 Americans were serving \n     in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, all our troops are out of \n     Iraq.\n\n  This is, at best, a very incomplete depiction of what has happened \nsince all of those troops are out of Iraq.\n  Finally, General Conway said:\n\n       Those who lost people, those wounded, I think, are now \n     stripped of a coping mechanism, Conway said. ``If you have a \n     young Marine or soldier sitting with his legs missing, he \n     could at least previously say, `Well what we did was the \n     right thing. Iraq is better for it, and we won.' '' I'm not \n     sure that same individual sitting in that chair is thinking \n     those things these days. That's truly sad.\n\n  I have talked to and heard from so many of these brave young \nAmericans who feel exactly as General Conway described. They don't know \nand they don't understand after the enormous sacrifices that they made \nthat somehow now black Al-Qaeda flags are flying over Fallujah.\n  On Afghanistan, the President said:\n\n       More than 60,000 of our troops have already come home from \n     Afghanistan. With Afghan forces now in the lead for their own \n     security, our troops have moved to a support role. . . .\n       After 2014, we will support a unified Afghanistan as it \n     takes responsibility for its own future. If the Afghan \n     government signs a security agreement that we have \n     negotiated, a small force of Americans could remain in \n     Afghanistan with NATO allies to carry out two narrow \n     missions: training and assisting Afghan forces, and \n     counterterrorism operations to pursue any remnants of Al \n     Qaeda. For while our relationship with Afghanistan will \n     change, one thing will not: our resolve that terrorists do \n     not launch attacks against our country.\n\n  On the one hand, the President said there would be two narrow \nmissions and yet our goal is still that terrorists don't launch attacks \nagainst our country. Again, he failed to put forward a true proposal \nfor our strategy in Afghanistan and once again avoided offering any \nspecifics on troop numbers. Why did we not leave a troop presence \nbehind in Iraq? Because they would never give a troop number. Anybody \nwho tells you the problem was not getting it through the Iraqi \nParliament is not telling you the truth.\n\n  Senator Graham, Senator Lieberman, and I were in Erbil when President \nBarzani said: I will go to Baghdad. When we met with Allawi, he said: I \nwill sit with Maliki. We went to Maliki and Maliki said: I will agree \nto have a force of troops in my country. How many? We could not give \nhim an answer nor would the administration give him an answer.\n  In the words and testimony of our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, the number cascaded down to 3,500, and that would have been a \nforce that spent its time defending itself. Therefore, we did not leave \na troop force behind in Iraq, and I have just described the \nconsequences.\n  The same thing is happening in Afghanistan. The President will not \nsay the force level he wants left behind in Afghanistan. Why is it he \nwill not?\n  I want to point out that President Karzai of Afghanistan is a \nparanoid individual, and he has been incredibly unhelpful. It has been \nterribly disappointing to me--and I have known him for 14 years--that \nhe is behaving as he is. But President Karzai's paranoia is somewhat \nunderstandable when he does not know whether the United States will \nremain, he doesn't know whether he can count on the United States, and \nhe knows he has to stay in the neighborhood and accommodate for the \nlikelihood now that the United States leaves completely. So his \nparanoia, to some degree, is much more understandable.\n  On our last trip to Afghanistan in early January, we saw firsthand \nthe progress that has been made by American and Afghan forces, and such \nprogress is a true testament to the positive impact our troops have had \nand the long-term benefits of our partnership with the Afghan people. \nThe Afghan people, though, and military will need our continued \nsupport. If we pull out, if we see the Iraq movie again,\n\n[[Page S639]]\n\nwe will see the same thing happen in Afghanistan that is now happening \nin Iraq, and it doesn't take a lot of smarts to know that.\n  So now we turn to Syria. In Syria ``we will support the opposition \nthat rejects the agenda of terrorist networks.'' What does that mean?\n  Despite promise after promise, the administration has refused to \nprovide aid to the moderate opposition forces in Syria who are \ncommitted. It was 2 years ago when the President of the United States \nsaid: It is not a matter of whether Bashar al-Assad will leave office, \nit is a matter of when. It was over 2 years ago, at the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, when Secretary of Defense Panetta and the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in answer to my question: Sir, it is \ninevitable, it is inevitable that Bashar al-Assad will leave office.\n  Does anybody believe that now?\n  Our failure to help the Free Syrian Army over time was negated and \noverwhelmed by the presence of 5,000 Hezbollah sent in by the Iranians, \nthe Iranian Revolutionary Guard, planeload after planeload of weapons \nthat now land at the Damascus Airport from Russia, while they are \nloaded onto Russian-built helicopters, and barrel bombs, which are \nexplosives packed with all kinds of nuts and bolts and other metals, \nare dropped out of those helicopters on men, women, and children.\n  But not to worry--not to worry--because the chemical weapons are \nleaving, apparently, according to the President, because he said: \nAmerican diplomacy, backed by the threat of force, is why Syria's \nchemical weapons are being eliminated, and we will continue to work \nwith the international community to usher in the future the Syrian \npeople deserve, a future free of a dictator, terror, and fear.\n  The chemical weapons he is hailing as a success--how much has been \naccomplished? The Syrian Government has delivered less than 5 percent \nof its deadliest chemical weapons agents to international authorities \nso far. This is a quote from an L.A. Times story:\n\n       Syria unlikely to meet deadline on its deadliest chemical \n     agents. President Bashar Assad's government has delivered \n     less than 5 percent of its deadliest chemical weapons agents. \n     The deadline is next week.\n\n  So even this claim about chemical weapons being removed does not bear \nscrutiny. But far, far, far more important--far more important, I say--\nis that if we got rid of the chemical weapons Bashar al-Assad had, that \nwould not change the equation on the ground. I am sure a Syrian mother \ncannot differentiate very well if her child is killed by a chemical \nweapon, a barrel bomb or is starved to death, as 120,000 men, women, \nand children have met that fate.\n  It is unbelievable. Now we are watching a charade take place in \nGeneva, and that of course has turned into a farce. Anybody who \nbelieves that Bashar al-Assad is going to willingly leave office, when \nhe is winning the battle on the ground, obviously has no idea of the \nnature of Bashar Assad.\n  Again, the slaughter goes on, and one of the huge aspects of this \nhappens to be the fact that it is no longer a civil war. I would remind \nmy colleagues this conflict began because in homes there were some \nchildren who wrote some anti-Assad graffiti on the wall. They were \nrounded up by Assad's police and were tortured and beaten, and that \nbegan an Arab spring in Syria. That spread throughout the country and \nnow has spread throughout the region.\n  As I just said, the Iraq-Syria border is now Al Qaeda. It is now \ncontrolled by them. The Iranians are all in, with 5,000 Hezbollah; \nLebanon is destabilized; Jordan is overwhelmed by refugees; Turkey is \neven under strain; 100,000-some refugees are even in Kurdistan. It has \nturned into a regional conflict and one which, sooner or later, will \nfinally erupt into a major conflict which is going to affect the United \nStates of America.\n\n  The President of the United States may want to leave the Middle East \nalone, but I can assure my colleagues the Middle East will not leave \nAmerica alone. Look at the statement made just today by our Director of \nNational Intelligence who said that al-Nusra, an affiliate of Al Qaeda, \nis planning attacks on the United States of America.\n  The President said: Finally, let's remember that our leadership is \ndefined not just by our defense against threats but by the enormous \nopportunities to do good and promote understandings around the globe, \nand no one is better positioned to take advantage of those \nopportunities than America.\n  I couldn't agree more. But when the United States is viewed by the \nworld, particularly the Middle East, as weak, withdrawing, no longer \ninvolved or trying to disengage, then I am not sure we can have the \neffects the President outlined in his State of the Union speech.\n  I think it is very clear that a seminal moment, as far as the entire \nMiddle East is concerned, was when the President of the United States \nsaid that because Bashar Assad had crossed the red line in the use of \nchemical weapons--there was indisputable evidence that 1,400 men, \nwomen, and children had been killed in chemical weapons attacks--we \nwere going to have to enact strikes against Bashar Assad in Syria. A \nfew days later, our Secretary of State, in one of the more incredible \nstatements I have ever heard--said: Yeah, but the strike will be \n``unbelievably small.'' I am not making that up. He said the strike \nwould be ``unbelievably small.''\n  That must have really frightened the Syrians when they heard that any \nmilitary strikes would be ``unbelievably small.''\n  The President of the United States then, without informing our \nallies--specifically the Saudis--according to published reports, took a \n45-minute walk with his Chief of Staff and then decided he would go to \nthe Congress of the United States for permission or for ratification of \nany attack he might make, and, obviously, that wasn't going to happen.\n  I say to my colleagues, I travel a lot in the Middle East. I can tell \nyou--and I would even name names but not on the record--that at that \nmoment our allies lost confidence, they lost belief in the United \nStates. We are now watching countries in the region openly stating--for \nexample, the Saudi Arabians refusing a seat on the National Security \nCouncil of the United Nations--and this is published everywhere--they \nno longer believe in the United States of America.\n  By the way, one of the other aspects of this, and there are many, is \na Washington Post story of this morning:\n\n       Europeans are flocking to the war in Syria. What happens \n     when they come home?\n\n  The story is about a couple of people who went from England.\n\n       The distress among security officials is pervasive in \n     European capitals and in Washington. U.S. Intelligence Chief \n     James R. Clapper, Jr. told a congressional panel Wednesday \n     that the Syrian war had attracted about 7,000 foreign \n     fighters from as many as 50 nations and that at least one of \n     the main jihadist groups in Syria aspires to carry out an \n     attack in the United States. But Europe is a far closer and \n     more accessible target. The International Center for the \n     Study of Radicalization estimated last month that nearly \n     2,000 Western Europeans had traveled to Syria to fight and \n     that the number was rising fast.\n\n  Continuing to quote from the article:\n\n       French officials say 700 came from France. French Interior \n     Minister Manuel Valls asserted this month that returning \n     fighters represent ``the biggest threat the country faces in \n     the coming years.'' The anxiety has been especially acute in \n     Britain, where memories are still fresh of the July 2005 \n     transit bombings. These attacks, which claimed 52 lives, were \n     carried out by homegrown radicals, at least two of whom had \n     received training in Pakistan. ``The penny hasn't dropped. \n     But Syria is a game-changer,'' Richard Walton, who leads \n     counterterrorism efforts at Scotland Yard, told the Evening \n     Standard newspaper. ``We are seeing it every day. You have \n     hundreds of people going to Syria, and if they don't get \n     killed they get radicalized.''\n\n  So we are in a situation of failed leadership over the last 5 years \nand the chickens, unfortunately, are beginning to come home to roost. \nWhen the President of the United States, in his address to the Nation, \ndescribes things in the Middle East as he did, I think it is very, \nvery, very unfortunate because that does not comport with the actual \nfacts on the ground.\n  I say to my colleagues, the American people no longer believe our \nmission in Iraq and Afghanistan was the right thing to do. I can tell \nmy constituents that in 2008 things were very different. The surge had \nworked. We were gradually withdrawing from Syria. We had the Taliban in \nAfghanistan largely under control. In Syria, Bashar Assad was losing. \nNow the terrain throughout the Middle East is dramatically different.\n\n[[Page S640]]\n\n  As much as I regret to say, it is my obligation to tell my \nconstituents my view; that is, we have very, very difficult times \nahead. I do not like to predict that bad things are going to happen, \nbut right now I don't see how they can be avoided.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, the number one priority for any Senator \nfrom North Dakota is the passage of a 5-year farm bill.\n  When I was campaigning across North Dakota, I reminded my \nconstituents that in spite of this wonderful energy renaissance we have \ngoing on in North Dakota, over 90 percent of all the land in my State \nis engaged in production agriculture.\n  It makes this farm bill so critically important to the economy not \nonly of my State but the economy of this country. Sixteen million jobs \ndepend in this country on the passage of a farm bill which provides \nproducers with risk management opportunities that make their farm work \nsustainable and make their continuation in production agriculture \neconomically possible.\n  So it is a good week for North Dakotans. Today we passed the flood \ninsurance bill which will prohibit draconian and very dramatic \nincreases in flood insurance prices from affecting my State. But also \nwe are on the cusp and terribly close to doing something we have waited \nso long to do, and that is to pass a 5-year farm bill.\n  I will talk in general about some of the things this farm bill does, \nbut I wish to focus my attention on two areas not a lot of people have \ncome to the floor to talk about, and those are the provisions for \nbeginning farmers and ranchers and the importance of the livestock \nprovisions in the farm bill.\n  The farm bill achieves the goals that put our agricultural system in \na strong position to continue this country's role as a world leader in \nproduction agriculture. This is achieved through an effective farm \nprogram for growers, livestock disaster coverage for ranchers and \nlivestock producers, enhanced crop insurance offerings, expanded \nagricultural research, and increased export promotion for agricultural \nproducts.\n  We have been void in our balance of trade by the inclusion of \nagricultural products and by what we do on the farm that has made a \ndifference to that trade deficit: critical investments in biofuels \nwhich help build a stronger, more vibrant, and more resilient energy \npolicy in our State; renewal of a sugar program to prevent excess \nimports of unfairly subsidized imported and foreign sugar; and targeted \nconservation assistance to tackle unique challenges, particularly in my \nState and the Red River Valley and in Devil's Lake. But I will tell a \nlittle story.\n  For years I have been going to farm producer meetings. During my time \nas a State official in North Dakota, I spent a lot of time at the Farm \nBureau, a lot of time at the Farmers Union, with corn growers and \nsoybean growers, and getting to know and understand agricultural work \non tax and regulatory issues. I always felt as if I was the youngest \nperson in the room that whole while, and I was in my 30s and 40s. I \nwould walk into a room and feel young. That has really been true.\n  I had a really wonderful experience when I was back home this last \ntrip. I went to something called Precision Agriculture, which is a \nspecial conference the Farmers Union hosts for North Dakota's NDSU \nExtension, where they look at using different kinds of new \ntechnologies, whether they are application technologies to be more \nefficient in how we use fertilizers and seeds or whether it is finding \nan ap that gives us more information for marketing. You name it. The \nPrecision Agriculture conference has gotten bigger and bigger.\n  But why I point that out and talk about it is that as I stood at the \npodium and took one look, I said: I want everybody under the age of 45 \nto stand up. Well over half of my audience stood up. That has never \nbefore happened in the 30 years I have been involved in public policy \nin North Dakota.\n  Young farmers are coming back to the farm. Young farmers are engaging \nat levels with technological developments and techniques that \nheretofore were not available and really weren't trusted maybe by an \nolder generation.\n  So now we have this new generation of producers who are going to do \none of the most important things that we do in this country, which is \nto feed our people and literally to feed the world. They are willing to \ndo that. They are willing to risk and make incredible investments on \nthe farm, whether it is land prices or equipment prices or whether it \nis betting the entire farm that you are not going to get hailed out. \nThis farm bill is critical, first and foremost, to making sure that \nrisk is mitigated by a crop insurance program which works for those \nyoung farmers.\n  I will outline just very briefly what those beginning farmer and \nbeginning rancher programs are in this farm bill.\n  While this is changing, according to the Department of Agriculture's \nmost recent census, the average age of American farmers is 57 years \nold; a quarter of American farmers are over the age of 65. Now, in \nNorth Dakota that dynamic is changing, as I have just outlined. But the \n2014 farm bill makes critical investments to ensure that this next \ngeneration of farmers has an opportunity to enter the field by \novercoming the high capital constraints and low production histories \nthat make those early years the most difficult.\n  The program continues and funds the beginning farmer and rancher \ndevelopment program which develops and offers education, training, \noutreach, and mentoring programs to ensure the success of the next \ngeneration of farmers. The bill expands eligibility to include military \nveterans who wish to begin a career in agriculture.\n  The 2008 farm bill had $75 million for this program with 5 years \nmandatory. The 2014 bill ups that amount to $100 million, recognizing \nthe need that we have to create that next generation of producers.\n  The 2014 farm bill prioritizes beginning farmers across USDA \nprograms. The Department of Agriculture is required to prioritize \nbeginning farmers to ensure they have access to USDA programs. The bill \ncontinues to set aside loan funds for both the beginning and socially \ndisadvantaged farmers who struggle to find credit someplace else.\n\n  There are also 5-percent set-asides in the environmental quality \nincentive program and the conservation stewardship program to make sure \nthat beginning farmers and ranchers have fair and equitable access to \nconservation programs.\n  This new farm bill increases access to capital for new farmers and \nranchers. The bill makes significant strides in increasing lending to \nbeginning farmers by expanding eligibility, removing term limits on \nguaranteed lending, and strengthening microloan programs that serve \nthose beginning farmers.\n  This farm bill encourages older farmers to help beginning farmers \nthrough conservation. The bill reauthorizes the Conservation Reserve \nProgram Transition Incentive Program, which gives 2 extra years of CRP \nto retiring farmers who transition their expiring CRP lands to \nbeginning farmers. This program has seen great success with retiring \nfarmers who want to help the next generation get started.\n  This new farm bill helps beginning farmers buy land. The bill \nreauthorized the contract land sales program, which guarantees loan \npayments to retiring farmers who sell their cropland to beginning \nfarmers. It also continues the down payment loan program which allows \nyoung farmers without much money to start investments and down payments \non a farm or a ranch. The borrower makes a cash down payment of at \nleast 5 percent of the total cost, and the government provides a low-\ninterest loan for 45 percent of the payment.\n  This new farm bill invests in value-added strategies that are \nespecially important to these new farmers, value-added grants \nencouraging independent producers to process raw products into \nmarketable goods, adding value and increasing farm income. Beginning \nfarmers will continue to be given a high priority in this program.\n  It helps beginning farmers plan in the early years. The bill \ncontinues the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Individual Development \nAccounts, which are designed to help new farmers finance their \nagricultural pursuits.\n  So this is for the next generation who looks and says: Is there \nopportunity in being a farmer? Can farmers not only work there, but can \nthey own\n\n[[Page S641]]\n\nthe land and continue our rich and strong tradition of family farming?\n  I think the answer is yes. This is a farm program that offers them \nthat opportunity that says: Yes, the United States and its people are \nwilling to invest in your future.\n  Finally, I wish to talk about the importance of the livestock \nprovisions. Livestock production is hugely important to North Dakota. \nAre we the largest livestock producer in the United States of America? \nThat would not be true. But for my ranchers out west, this is a \ncritically important program. This is a program which says to the \nranchers: We recognize that not everybody who is engaged in production \nagriculture is engaged in producing crops or specialty crops. Those who \nherd cattle and work cattle and work as hard as any group of people I \nknow deserve some attention in this farm bill.\n  If there ever was an example of where we needed to do something more \nfor our beginning ranchers, the early snow storm of 2013 is it, where \npeople literally lost their entire herd. For those who maybe don't have \na lot of expertise, understand this: One cow is not interchangeable. \nMany of these families over the years, through genetics and through \nselective breeding, have in fact built the herd--built a herd unique to \ntheir ranch--and they lost it all.\n  When they turned to us and said: What is there to help us? We had to \nsay: Nothing.\n  If you get hailed out and have crop insurance, there is help. If you \nhave a major disaster and can't plant, there is help.\n  But what is there for us? We had to say ``nothing,'' because we \nhadn't done a farm bill on a timely basis, and there was no help for \nthose farmers.\n  This farm bill is retroactive. It is going to help those farmers who \nnot only experience loss in the future but who have experienced loss \nsince October of 2011. We are on our way to fulfilling the commitment \nthat all of us made who came to the floor in October and talked about \nthat terrible storm.\n  The 2014 farm bill includes exactly the type of pro-rancher policies \nI wanted Washington to produce. Not only does the bill include \nimportant livestock disaster programs; the bill also continues the \nwidely popular and beneficial program called country of origin \nlabeling--or COOL--policy which for years has been fought for by \nranching families in North Dakota.\n  Additionally, the farm bill allows USDA in future years to move \nforward with livestock competition rules to provide transparent pricing \nfor cow-calf operators in my State and elsewhere.\n  Finally, the farm bill provides targeted conservation and research \nprograms for the support of cattle, pork, and poultry industries so \nthey can better assess the challenges facing livestock production.\n  I get a lot of questions even in my State. Why should anyone support \nthe farm program? Aren't things pretty good out there on the farm? I \nwill say, over 4 million acres in North Dakota alone could not be \nplanted this last crop season because of high water. That means the \ndifference between a family farmer staying in business and not staying \nin business. But importantly, for all of America, this means we have a \ncrop production system which feeds our country.\n  I tell people, let's think about things from the standpoint of value-\nadded. What does that mean? New wealth doesn't come when you go to the \nretail store and buy a shirt or a new coat. That is not new wealth. We \nare just taking money which has been generated someplace else and \ncirculating it in the economy. New wealth is created particularly in \nextractive industries such as oil and gas, coal mining, and it is \ncreated in agriculture. It is the quintessential new wealth creator. \nFrom the hard work of those producers in America grows an entire \neconomy that fuels the opportunity for 16 million jobs.\n  In my State of North Dakota, I was recently talking to a plant worker \nwho works at the KSHI plant who explained to someone that his top \npriority for his workers was the passage of a farm bill. They said: Why \nwould you care about the passage of a farm bill?\n  He said: Don't you get it? If the farmers aren't doing well, we \naren't producing tractors. We are not producing what we need to \nproduce.\n  I want everyone to understand that this is not a farm bill just for \nStates such as North Dakota and Minnesota. This is a farm bill for the \nentire world--to feed the entire world. It is also a farm bill that \nprovides new wealth creation that encourages the growth of 16 million \njobs.\n  I will close with one final thought. We talk about food, fiber, and \nfuel--the three things we talk about when we talk about agricultural \nproducts. But we know that in the applied research we see in those \ngreat land-grant colleges--and our State has one of the best. It is \ncalled NDSU. They have the best football team in the history of \nforever. But let me tell you, it is also a great extension program and \ngreat agricultural research center.\n  They are doing amazing work at NDSU in polymer research. They are \nlooking at biodegradable coatings and paints. We know that advanced \nmanufacturing is the next step we are going to make in agriculture, and \nwe are going to do everything we can to make sure that those products \nare sustainable and that those products are safe to use for our people \nand for our animals.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to support this farm program so we \ncan make sure we keep 16 million people working and that we have that \nnext generation of beginning farmers and beginning ranchers who are \nproducing food for our country and food for the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank the Chair and thank Senator \nKlobuchar for allowing me to go ahead of her. I ask to be notified \nafter 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Yucca Mountain\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wish to talk about recent rulings in \nthe Yucca Mountain repository litigation. I am ranking member of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Subcommittee on the Clean Air and Nuclear \nSafety. This is a matter I have followed closely. Our committee had a \nhearing this morning with the entire Nuclear Regulatory Commission and \nits new Chairman. These decisions are not simply political decisions, \nof course, they are legal decisions that adjudicated certain legal \ndisputes that have been simmering for a number of years. The court's \njudgments were founded on law, not politics or nuclear policy. It \nadjudicated certain contested legal matters. From my perspective, it \nwas an affirmation of plain law against plain defiance of law, and the \ncourt made that clear.\n  Last August the DC Circuit--in the case of in re: Aiken County--\nrendered a decision that provided a clear legal victory to proponents \nof nuclear energy in America. More important, it was a victory for the \nrule of law and the U.S. taxpayer and a victory for the rightful power \nof Congress to adjudicate and legislate on energy policy. The judgment \nalso rendered a resounding defeat for the policies advocated by the \ncurrent administration, the majority leader of the Senate, and other \npoliticians who have worked for years to thwart the law by refusing or \nblocking actions to implement the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which is \nthe law of the land.\n  More recently, in November of 2013, the DC Circuit issued another \nruling in the case of the National Association of Regulatory Utility \nCommissioners v. United States Department of Energy. These \nCommissioners around the United States sued the Department of Energy. \nThese Commissioners represent our States. That court found that the \ncurrent administration--the Obama administration--has been ignoring the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act.\n  The DC Circuit ordered the Energy Department to stop charging U.S. \nratepayers $750 million a year in nuclear waste fees until the Federal \nGovernment complies with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.\n  As a result, on January 3, just a few weeks ago, the Secretary of \nEnergy was forced to formally submit a proposal to Congress to reduce \nthe nuclear waste fee to zero--to end the fee--while at the same time \nasking the DC Circuit to reconsider the ruling it has rendered, which I \ndon't think it will.\n  Taken together, these two rulings vindicate the concerns that many of \nus have raised since 2009 about the lawless\n\n[[Page S642]]\n\nactions of this administration in failing to deal with our Nation's \nnuclear waste in the manner required by law.\n  I hear from people all the time who wonder how in the world the \nPresident doesn't comply with the law. He amends the health care act \nand does other things that most Americans are just taken aback by. They \ncan't imagine how he is not bound by law like everyone else, and, of \ncourse, he is. Indeed, he takes an oath to ensure that the laws of the \nUnited States are faithfully carried out.\n  I am currently serving as the Ranking member of the Senate \nSubcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety, which has oversight \njurisdiction with respect to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and I \nhave been looking closely at this matter. The Administration's lawless \nactions regarding nuclear energy, supported by the Senate Majority \nLeader, are deeply disturbing and contrary to a sound national energy \npolicy. No one Senator, no matter how prominent, can overrule \nestablished law.\n  The background: Over 30 years ago Congress passed the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act to require the Federal Government to accept nuclear waste \nfrom commercial nuclear reactors around the country with the objective \nof safely storing it in a single, permanent, geologic repository that \nis safe and secure.\n  A recent report entitled ``Yucca Mountain: A Post-Mortem'' in The New \nAtlantis provides some important statistics. It is estimated that, \ntoday, the U.S. has accumulated over 65,000 metric tons of spent \nnuclear fuel, which is enough waste to ``cover one football field to a \ndepth of approximately 20 feet.'' That number is expected to more than \ndouble by 2055. This nuclear waste is currently stored at 75 sites \nspread across 33 states. The 8 states with the most spent nuclear fuel \nare Illinois, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, New York, Alabama, \nCalifornia, Florida and South Carolina.\n  This report also recognizes that ``there is broad consensus among \nscientists from around the world'' that geologic disposal is ``the best \navailable option for permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-\nlevel radioactive waste . . . '' This is not a surprising conclusion, \nas Congress determined decades ago that it is in the national interest \nto safely and securely dispose of nuclear waste deep underground far \nfrom populated areas. It is difficult to imagine a better location for \nsuch a repository than Yucca Mountain, NV, the remote site that has \nbeen selected by Congress.\n  Congress also created the Nuclear Waste Fund to collect the fees that \nwere extracted from the nuclear power electric-generating companies. \nMoney is taken from them, which they take from the ratepayers, and that \nmoney was to be used to cover the cost of this program. So far the \nFederal Government has collected $25 billion for this fund at a rate of \nabout $750 million a year.\n  In 1987, the Congress passed--and President Reagan signed--a law that \namended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act by officially designating Yucca \nMountain, NV, as the Nation's geologic repository for spent nuclear \nfuel.\n  In July of 2002, Congress overrode Nevada's objections. Their \nrepresentatives didn't like it, although I would note the area of \nNevada where this facility is to be in place strongly supports it and \nthey opposed Nevada leaders who opposed building it.\n  Congress overrode the objections and passed a joint resolution that \nsaid:\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, that there \n     hereby is approved the site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, for a \n     repository. . . .\n\n  An extensive scientific evaluation process ensued, culminating in the \nEnergy Department determination, in an Environmental Impact Statement, \nthat Yucca Mountain is an appropriate site for the safe, long-term \ngeological storage of nuclear waste. Yucca Mountain is perhaps, \naccording to a 2006 report by the Senate Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works, ``the most studied real estate on the planet.''\n  In 2008, the U.S. Energy Department submitted to the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission an 8,600-page application for authorization to \nconstruct the repository. It discussed every possible complaint and \nconcern that could be raised, analyzing all the issues.\n  Section 114 of the act states that once the application is received \nby the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, it ``shall issue a final decision \napproving or disapproving the issuance of a construction authorization \nnot later than the expiration of 3 years after the date of the \nsubmission of such application. . . . '' That was in 2008, and they \nhave not rendered a decision since.\n  This means the NRC is under a clear legal duty--as set out in \nstatute, passed by Congress, signed by the President--to promptly \ncomplete the licensing process for Yucca.\n  Regrettably, in 2009, the Obama administration and its allies \norchestrated a complex scheme to ignore the law, to control the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission, and shut down the Yucca mountain process.\n  How was this done? Here is how the Federal circuit court judge--Judge \nRaymond Randolph--described the administration's scheme. This is \ndramatic and crystal clear language. It blows the whistle on one of the \nmost significant obstructions of law that I have seen during my time in \nWashington.\n  This is what the judge ruled:\n\n       Former (NRC) Chairman Gregory Jaczko orchestrated a \n     systematic campaign of noncompliance. Jaczko unilaterally \n     ordered commission staff to terminate the [Yucca] review \n     process in October 2010; instructed staff to remove key \n     findings from reports evaluating the Yucca Mountain site; and \n     ignored the will of his fellow commissioners.\n\n  That is a dramatic indictment of Mr. Jaczko's leadership. I would \nnote parenthetically that Mr. Jaczko was the choice of Majority Leader \nReid. He worked on Senator Reid's staff, and he insisted that Mr. \nJaczko be made the Chairman of the Commission.\n  Here is how the Board of County Commissioners of Nye County, Nevada--\nwhere Yucca Mountain is located and which strongly supports completion \nof the repository--explained it. They wrote in a recent letter that the \nYucca repository has been ``hijacked by the politics of a single \npowerful senator and what some view as complicity by the NRC Chairman \n[Mr. Jaczko].''\n  Beginning in 2009, now former Chairman Jaczko was able to effectively \nblock any further progress on Yucca Mountain; that is, until the DC \nCircuit finally ruled in August of last year that those actions were in \nclear violation of the law, which was an important victory for the rule \nof law and for the power of Congress.\n  In its ruling, the DC Circuit determined that ``the [NRC] has \ncontinued to violate the law governing the Yucca Mountain licensing \nprocess.''\n  The court then highlighted that the NRC had gone well beyond missing \nthe statutory deadline for completing its review of the licensing \napplication. Recognizing that ``Congress has not altered the legal \nlandscape''; that is, Congress has not amended the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct; the court explained that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is \n``simply flouting the law.''\n  The court also observed that, under Article II of the Constitution, \n``the President must follow statutory mandates so long as there is \nappropriated money available and the President has no constitutional \nobjection to the statute . . . '' The court stated that ``the President \nmay not decline to follow a statutory mandate or prohibition because of \npolicy objections . . . '' That is, ``absent a lack of funds or a claim \nof unconstitutionality that has not been rejected by final Court order, \nthe Executive [and its agencies] must abide by statutory mandates and \nprohibitions.''\n  The court further explained: ``It is no overstatement to say that our \nconstitutional system of separation of powers would be significantly \naltered if we were to allow executive and independent agencies to \ndisregard federal law in the manner asserted in this case by the NRC.'' \nOn this basis, the court granted the request of the plaintiffs in the \ncase for a ``writ of mandamus against the NRC.'' This is a writ that is \nrarely issued that orders a governmental body to comply with the law. \nIt held that the NRC ``must promptly continue with the legally mandated \nlicensing process.'' This was an important victory for the American \nconstitutional order.\n  Completing Yucca has big implications for the Federal budget. As the \nranking member of the Budget Committee, I believe we need to watch \nevery dime we raise and spend. We have already spent, amazingly, $15 \nbillion--\n\n[[Page S643]]\n\naccording to the Government Accountability Office--evaluating Yucca and \nother sites and doing work at the site.\n  We have already paid $2 billion as of January 2012 for claims \nresulting from the Government's failure to deal with the waste issue; \nin other words, people have sued and made claims against the government \nfor not fulfilling its obligation to build this site, and we have \nalready paid out $2 billion. It is a shame people can't be held \nindividually responsible for obstructing the law and causing the \nFederal taxpayers to pay out $2 billion.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the Federal \nGovernment's total liability for breach of contract claims from the \nfailure to resolve the waste issue could reach $50 billion. The \ngovernment agreed and set up a method to receive this waste. The \nelectric utility companies that generate nuclear power are now being \nforced--for decades--to keep the waste onsite at great expense, even \nthough they paid billions of dollars into the fund to make sure it is \ntaken care of at a single site.\n  With this important court victory, we may hope and expect that the \nNation's nuclear waste program can be put back on track, and it is \nhurting right now. The costs are real, and they fall on virtually all \nAmericans.\n  On October 28, the DC Circuit denied the NRC's petition for rehearing \nen banc. So the writ of mandamus stands. And, on November 19, 2013, the \nDC Circuit rendered another important decision in this arena. The court \nfound the Energy Department in non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act and ordered the Secretary of Energy to ``submit to Congress \na proposal to change the [nuclear waste] fee to zero until such a time \nas either the secretary chooses to comply with the [Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act] as it is currently written, or until Congress enacts an \nalternative waste management fee.''\n  In response, on January 3, 2014, the Energy Secretary submitted a \nproposal to Congress to zero-out the nuclear waste fee. Pursuant to the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 10222(a)(4), this proposal \n``shall be effective after a period of 90 days of continuous session \nhave elapsed following the receipt of such transmittal . . .''\n  Now an important question is, how will the NRC respond? Our nation \nderives almost 20 percent of the electricity needed to drive the \neconomy through nuclear power, which is a clean, safe, and affordable \nsource of energy. The failure of this Administration to deal with the \nissue of nuclear waste disposal over the last 5 years has posed a \nserious threat to the future viability of nuclear power. As a recent \nreport by the Heritage Foundation, entitled ``Obama Administration: No \nConfidence in Nuclear Energy,'' explains:\n\n       President Obama's decision to abandon plans for removing \n     the waste to the Yucca Mountain repository in Nevada creates \n     an uncertainty that could be a barrier to the expansion of \n     nuclear power.\n\n  So, this issue is critical to the future of nuclear power in America. \nWe need to get this waste repository issue settled, and I believe the \nNRC should expeditiously proceed with the Yucca license proceeding in \nan independent manner worthy of the important task they have been \nassigned. I am hopeful that if we do so, we may have turned a final \ncorner.\n\n  I received a letter dated October 23rd from the current NRC Chairman, \nDr. Allison Macfarlane, providing a copy of the NRC's first monthly \nstatus report concerning compliance with the DC Circuit ruling and \nexplaining that the NRC ``will deliberate and determine the various \nactivities that might compose the agency's response to the court's \ndecision.'' A day later, on October 24th, I was joined by Senate EPW \nranking member David Vitter and all Republican subcommittee members in \nsending a letter to Dr. Macfarlane, urging the NRC to ``comply \nexpeditiously'' with the DC Circuit's decision and explaining that \n``the next step in this legally mandated licensing process is for the \nNRC to complete the [Safety Evaluation Reports]'' for the Yucca site.\n  On November 18, 2013, the NRC approved an order directing the NRC \nstaff to implement the DC Circuit ruling by completing the Safety \nEvaluation Reports for Yucca Mountain. This is an important and crucial \nstep in the process. I have, since, received other NRC reports dated \nDecember 18, 2013, and January 24, 2014, describing activities related \nto Yucca Mountain. The NRC has asked the Energy Department to prepare \nthe supplemental environmental documents that are needed to move \nforward with the licensing process. It is my expectation that the \nSecretary of Energy will act promptly to provide the necessary \ninformation and support and to avoid the kinds of political schemes and \nunlawful acts that have previously derailed the Yucca process.\n  According to the NRC, the Energy Department has more than $15 million \nin funds that could be used to support Yucca-related efforts, and an \nadditional $18 million that could potentially become available for \nthese purposes. The most recent report from the NRC explains that \n``completion of the [Yucca Mountain safety report] is scheduled to take \napproximately 12 months, ending in January 2015,'' and that available \nfunds are sufficient to complete this task.\n  The NRC Chairman and other Commissioners must follow the law in this \nmatter. During her confirmation process earlier this year, Dr. \nMacfarlane affirmed a strong commitment to the ``independence'' and \n``impartiality'' of the NRC and pledged to defend those principles. For \ninstance, in her responses to my questions during her confirmation \nprocess, she unequivocally agreed with me that the NRC ``should not \nallow political meddling from Congress or other parts of the executive \nbranch to interfere with the NRC's independent decision-making \nprocesses.'' She committed to ``zealously guard the independence of the \nNRC and oppose any efforts to undermine it.''\n  During her confirmation, she also correctly recognized that the \n``responsibility for establishing a nuclear waste policy resides with \nCongress,'' and she acknowledged that the ``NRC currently has \napproximately $11.1 million in unobligated carryover funds (and $2.5 \nmillion in obligated, unexpended carryover funds) appropriated from the \nNuclear Waste Fund'' and that these funds ``could be used for a variety \nof activities related to the Yucca Mountain project, including the \ncompletion of the technical licensing review.''\n  We will be watching this process closely. I know that the leadership \nin the House of Representatives will be watching as well. In a letter \ndated August 23, 2013, the House Energy & Commerce Committee Chairman, \nFred Upton, and Environment & Energy Subcommittee Chairman, John \nShimkus, wrote to the NRC, stating:\n\n       [I]t is our expectation that the NRC's first action to \n     implement the Court's decision will be to diligently resume \n     its review of the license application, complete the [Safety \n     Report], and issue it publicly. Our country has invested 30 \n     years and $15 billion in determining whether Yucca Mountain \n     would be a safe repository. The NRC is this nation's nuclear \n     safety regulator and its reputation for independence and \n     objectivity rests on its transparency in this matter. As \n     such, NRC's objective, scientific findings regarding the \n     safety of Yucca Mountain would provide the public an \n     independent, authoritative assessment of this important \n     project.\n\n  I agree with Chairman Upton and Subcommittee Chairman Shimkus. In \nparticular, the NRC should know that Congress will watch closely to \nmake sure that costs associated with completing the safety report for \nYucca Mountain are appropriate and in line with earlier estimates.\n  Importantly, the NRC should already have all documentation necessary \nfor this process ready and available. In December 2011, I joined \nSenator Mark Kirk and eight other Senate colleagues in a letter to the \nNRC and Energy Department about Yucca Mountain. That letter--sent over \n2 years ago--was out of a deep concern that we had that the \nAdministration was purposefully jeopardizing the ability for future \nconsideration of the Yucca Mountain application by failing to \nadequately preserve scientific information and other records. We \nexplained that ``preserving the historical records and all scientific \ndocuments relating to Yucca Mountain is important to the nation's long-\nterm goal of achieving a permanent solution to our nation's \naccumulating nuclear waste.''\n  In that letter, we also explained:\n\n       Yucca Mountain is one of the most extensive research and \n     development investments this country has ever undertaken. \n     More than\n\n[[Page S644]]\n\n     $14 billion of taxpayer money and nearly 25 years of \n     scientific research, data collection, geological \n     characterization and evidence was collected to study the \n     Yucca Mountain facility.\n\n  In March 2012, former NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko responded to our \nletter, stating: ``The NRC documents relating to the Yucca Mountain \nProgram . . . will continue to be retained as permanent records . . .''\n  I will note that the members of the board are good people, and I \nthink the new chairman, Dr. Macfarlane, is going to try to do a much \nbetter job. But it was unbelievable how the former Chairman was able to \nobstruct Federal law.\n  The NRC should be able to proceed promptly with completing the \nlicensing process. But if they fail to do so, the NRC Chairman, or the \nentire Commission, could be held in contempt of court and appropriate \nsanctions could be issued by the court, and should be, if they fail, \nand that was discussed this morning at the hearing. The Commission says \nthey are going to move forward. They say they don't have as much money \nas they would like to have. They haven't asked for more money. They \nhave a duty to fix this problem and deal with it, and if they need more \nmoney, they should ask Congress for it.\n  After all of these years and the money spent, a contempt citation \nwould be a colossal failure and a tremendous embarrassment, and it \nwould be the result of a willful failure to follow the clear \nresponsibility of law.\n  In conclusion, I believe the DC Circuit's recent rulings concerning \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act have made an important contribution to the \nRule of Law in the United States and to the future of nuclear power. In \nCongress, there is strong bipartisan support for completing the Yucca \nlicense review process. In 2012, the House voted overwhelmingly, 326-\n81, in favor of appropriating the funds necessary for the NRC to \ncontinue the Yucca licensing process. Then, in July of 2013, the House \nsoundly defeated an amendment offered by a member from Nevada that \nwould cut funding for the Yucca licensing process. That amendment \nfailed by a vote of 335-81.\n  Last July, Representatives Fred Upton (R-MI) and John Dingell (D-MI), \nchairman and chairman emeritus, respectively, of the House Energy and \nCommerce Committee, authored an editorial entitled ``Decision on Yucca \nMountain Overdue.'' They wrote:\n\n       Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to \n     establish a deliberate, collaborative and mandatory process \n     to site, license, build and operate a national permanent \n     nuclear waste repository. The act obliges the federal \n     government to safely dispose of high-level nuclear defense \n     waste and commercial spent fuel from power plants. \n     Electricity consumers and taxpayers have paid approximately \n     $15 billion to determine if the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada \n     would be a safe repository. The [NRC] owes them an answer.\n\n  I couldn't agree more. With the benefit of the DC Circuit rulings in \nAugust and November of last year, which so clearly stated the \nAdministration's duties under law, Congress must not accept any further \ndelay in the Yucca Mountain license process.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                            Luger Nomination\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Alabama for \nmaking his remarks a bit briefer, and I thank him as well for \naccompanying me to the State of the Union Address 2 nights ago.\n  I rise today to urge a vote in the U.S. Senate to confirm the nominee \nto be Minnesota's next U.S. attorney. I see my colleague and friend \nfrom Iowa here, Senator Grassley, who has been working hard on his good \nnominee as well for Iowa, and we have been working on this together.\n  When we look at the extraordinary circumstances under which the U.S. \nAttorney's Office for the District of Minnesota has been operating, it \nwill be clear why a vote on this nomination and getting this done is so \nimportant.\n  For 2\\1/2\\ years--883 days--Minnesota has not had a full-time U.S. \nattorney. During those years, from August 2011 to August 2013, Todd \nJones was responsible for doing two jobs as the Minnesota U.S. attorney \nand as the Acting Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms \nand Explosives. I would note, as Senator Grassley has pointed out, it \nhas been a difficult time in the office. While they continue to do good \nwork, in part because the U.S. attorney's office in Minnesota has great \nprosecutors, they did not have a full-time manager during this time, \npending the approval of the ATF job and during the appointment time.\n  Over the summer, the Senate, as the Presiding Officer knows, \nconfirmed Todd Jones as the Director of the ATF--the first permanent \nDirector in 7 years--leaving the Minnesota U.S. attorney's position \nopen. Senator Franken and I, in consultation with getting a \nrecommendation from a bipartisan U.S. Attorney Advisory Committee, \nwhich included the former Republican-appointed U.S. attorney under both \nthe first George Bush and the second George Bush, who served on our \nadvisory board, we recommended Andy Luger, a respected litigator and \nformer assistant U.S. attorney, to fill the position. We recommended \nhim 191 days ago.\n  It has now been about 6 months--183 days--since Director Jones left \nand we still do not have a permanent, full-time U.S. attorney. \nMinnesota needs a full-time U.S. attorney. It is a major jurisdiction. \nAndy Luger has the experience and know-how necessary to do this job \nwell.\n  From his days fighting white-collar crime as an assistant U.S. \nattorney to his work with Minnesota law enforcement to help improve \ntheir gang-fighting strategy, Andy has earned the respect of the legal \nand law enforcement communities. Throughout his career, he has proven \nto be a tireless advocate for the people of Minnesota.\n  As an assistant U.S. attorney, he successfully prosecuted organized \ncrime, drug and white-collar cases. This included the prosecution of a \n$150 million national real estate and investment fraud case, leading to \nthe longest white-collar sentence in the United States at that time. In \n2009, he was appointed by the Minnesota Commissioner of Public Safety \nto lead an investigation into the Metro Gang Strike Force and uncovered \na series of problems with the unit. He recommended that the unit be \ndisbanded and replaced by other law enforcement efforts and it was, in \nfact, abolished.\n  In fact, a Star Tribune editorial said that Andy's review of the \nstrike force made ``smart recommendations about The Twin Cities' next \ngeneration gang-fighting strategy'' and that his report included \n``welcome measures to begin the long process of rebuilding the public's \ntrust.''\n  Andy is well respected in the law enforcement community. I can tell \nmy colleagues that after we made the recommendation to the President, I \ngot nothing but positive words from police chiefs and others who are \nexcited about him in this job. He is committed to building and \nmaintaining strong working relationships and partnerships between \nFederal and local law enforcement.\n  In addition to his many years as a Federal prosecutor, Andy has had a \ndistinguished career in private practice. He is currently a partner at \nthe Greene Espel law firm where he is well regarded as a highly skilled \ntrial lawyer focused on business litigation, representing businesses \nand white-collar defense. He has been selected as one of Minnesota's \nTop 100 ``Super Lawyers'' for the past 10 years and as one of the \n``Best Lawyers in America'' for the past 4 years. He clearly has the \nexperience, character, and drive to lead such a premier law enforcement \nagency as the Minnesota U.S. attorney's office.\n  The Minnesota U.S. attorney's office represents the United States \nwith professionalism, high ethical standards, and an unwavering \ncommitment to the safety of our community. These prosecutors work to \nprotect public safety by focusing on the offenders who do the most harm \nto the community--terrorists, the ``worst of the worst'' violent \ncriminals, drug traffickers, and major financial fraudsters. They also \nwork closely with local law enforcement to ensure local and Federal \nresources are used efficiently and effectively.\n  I personally know this after having served as the chief prosecutor \nfor Minnesota's largest county, Hennepin County, for 8 years, and I \nworked daily with our U.S. attorney. We would discuss which office \nwould handle cases. During the Moussaoui investigation, as people \nrecall, we got in Minnesota the hijacker who survived, the guy who\n\n[[Page S645]]\n\nthreatened to learn how to down a plane and was caught and imprisoned, \nand that came out of Minnesota immediately after 9/11. The office was \nvery focused on the terrorism investigation and my office stepped in \nand took some major white-collar cases to help out. We have a tradition \nof working together throughout the years, and that is why this office \nis so important to me.\n  Example: The office won a conviction in a $3.65 billion Ponzi scheme, \nthe second biggest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history. It has an ongoing \nterrorism investigation that has led to charges against 18 people for \naiding the terrorist organization Shabaad, 8 of whom have been \nconvicted, some receiving sentences of up to 20 years in prison. If one \ncan imagine this, they are conducting major terrorism investigations \nand prosecutions, and we need a full-time U.S. attorney to make \ndecisions and to be in charge.\n  Other major accomplishments include Operation Highlife, which was a \nmajor drug trafficking investigation involving more than 100 local, \nState, and Federal law enforcement officers and resulted in 26 \nindictments, 25 guilty pleas, and sentences up to 200 months in prison.\n  Operation Brother's Keeper was a successful investigation and \nprosecution of a RICO case involving a regional 200-member gang, which \ntook 22 dangerous criminals off the street.\n  Operation Malverde received national attention with the prosecution \nof 27 defendants associated with a Mexican drug cartel, including the \napprehension of the cartel regional leader, and sentences as high as 20 \nyears in prison.\n  The office also recently played a key role in shutting down a major \nsynthetic drug seller in Duluth. This head shop was a huge problem. The \nperpetrator has been convicted and is awaiting sentencing. They \nliterally found over $700,000 in his bathroom hidden in small plastic \nbags. They went after this head shop. They prosecuted that guy. They \nwon that case. They deserve a leader.\n\n  Andy Luger is the right person for this job. The Judiciary Committee \nagreed and reported out his nomination without objection on January 9. \nI appreciate the service of the Presiding Officer as well as Senator \nGrassley, who is here, on our Judiciary Committee, and I appreciate the \nsupport for his nomination.\n  I also supported the nomination of the U.S. attorney from Iowa, and \nwe know how important that job is as well.\n  This position of U.S. attorney was regarded by the Founders as so \nvital that they created it during the very first Congress; a position \nso crucial that it was born in the same law as the structure of the \nU.S. court; a position so necessary that President Zachary Taylor \nfilled it within 2 days of Minnesota becoming a State.\n  In our case, for a variety of reasons--a variety of reasons--we have \nnow gone 883 days without a full-time U.S. attorney. This is our \nmoment. We need to move ahead on this nomination.\n  Again, I appreciate Senator Grassley's help in moving these \nnominations forward. We have two U.S. attorneys, two Federal marshals. \nI can say that Andy is a dedicated public servant whose breadth of \nexperience, strength of character, and commitment to justice make him a \nwell-qualified candidate to serve as Minnesota's next U.S. attorney.\n  I don't think there are any objections to his nomination, but I urge \nmy colleagues to support his confirmation and give this office the \nleader it deserves, as well as the district of Iowa.\n  Thank you very much, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I had a chance to listen to the \nSenator from Minnesota, and I come to speak on another subject, but I \nwish to assure her that we will get these two nominees and others \nacross the finish line so the U.S. attorney for Minnesota can go to \nwork, hopefully before we get many more days added to the 800 she has \nalready talked about.\n  The farm bill process has been very long, very hard, and no doubt \nfrustrating for all who have been involved. Some of us on the Senate \nagriculture committee have participated in two committee markups and \ntwo floor debates for this bill, and that is over a period of two \nCongresses. I voted for and supported the bill at every one of those \njunctures.\n  I believe our country needs a good farm policy, which means, of \ncourse, an adequate and yet limited safety net for farmers, because so \nmuch about farming is beyond the control of the farmers, and I am not \ntalking just about natural disasters. Without a doubt, our farmers then \nface real, uncontrollable risks every year. The farm bill provides \nfarmers, then, with a number of programs to mitigate risks.\n  Agriculture remains a changing industry. Unbelievable technological \nadvancements are taking place right before our eyes. Farmers can now \ncontrol irrigation equipment and monitor grain bins on the phone from \nthe other side of the world. Agricultural technology is progressing so \nquickly. Five years from now, when we debate the next farm bill, \nautonomous tractors may well be doing a considerable amount of the \nfield work in America.\n  Farm policy has also changed over time. Unfortunately, the majority \nof farm program benefits have started going to a concentrated number of \nfarmers. The fact is 10 percent of the farmers--and those obviously \nwould be the wealthy farmers--get 70 percent of the benefits from a \nfarm bill. One reason for this is that the current farm policy offers \nfarmers essentially unlimited subsidies if they hire the right lawyers. \nAs a farmer, a citizen, and a legislator, I believe it is wrong to \nexpect or even to allow the government to give unlimited support to my \nfarm or any farm, especially since our country has a record $17 \ntrillion national debt.\n  During the first full Senate farm debate in the summer of 2012--so \nthe last Congress--my payment limit reforms were adopted by a vote of \n75 to 24 here on the floor of this very body. During the first round of \nfloor debate in the House in this Congress, Mr. Fortenberry from \nNebraska offered the same reforms and they were adopted there in the \nHouse by a vote of 230 to 194. Congress has spoken, then, and \noverwhelmingly agrees in both bodies with my commonsense approach of \nlimitations on the amount that one farming operation can get.\n  Wouldn't anyone think that policy, which is widely supported in both \nbodies of Congress and which saves taxpayers nearly $400 million, would \nbe untouchable when it comes to a conference committee? The rules of \nthis institution, the Senate, outline that. Senate rule XXVIII, if \nanyone would like to look it up. However, once again, behind closed \ndoors, Washington decided to intentionally screw up common sense.\n  This conference bill increases the payments available through the \ncountercyclical program--now called price loss coverage or PLC for \nshort--by 150 percent compared to what this Congress had already agreed \nupon. I have yet to hear anyone tell me a single legitimate reason why \nthat change could be made.\n  Additionally, the powers that be in this town have proven they \nlearned nothing from the World Trade Organization Brazil cotton case. \nThat dispute has resulted in the United States paying a $143 million \nfine per year to Brazilian cotton farmers because our farm program for \ncotton does not meet the rules of international trade. This farm bill \ndoubles down on the same market distorting principles that brought us \nthat very same trade dispute.\n  The original payment limit reforms that this Congress approved also \neliminated abuses through what is commonly know as the ``actively \nengaged loophole.'' To sum up this loophole, it makes it very easy for \nnonfarmers to get farm subsidies--probably those who go to the extent \nto hire a lawyer. This results in the largest 10 percent of the farms \nthen, as I said before, getting 70 percent of the farm program's \nbenefits, as I have already mentioned.\n  Yet the conference committee, in another brazen act of manipulation, \neliminates my simple enforceable reform. I happen to think that one \nnonfarming manager per entity is more than generous and over the years \nit has been much violated. So we just simply say it ought to be one \nnonfarm manager per farm and no more. But it has been a lot worse, and \nmy language--the language accepted by this body--reformed that. But as \nI have indicated a\n\n[[Page S646]]\n\ncouple times, the conference committee took it out.\n  The language in the bill now says--instead of the way it passed the \nSenate and passed the House on the floor of the House--USDA will have \nthe opportunity to review and fix the actively engaged loophole but \nonly if they should choose so; in other words, the Secretary of \nAgriculture does not have to.\n  I happen to know that Secretary Vilsack is sympathetic to what I have \nbeen trying to accomplish, so maybe he will be able to make something \ngood out of what I think is a very bad provision in this bill that \nmight actually make it very difficult for him to do that.\n  Under this provision, USDA could have fixed this problem--or even \nunder existing law, I should say--USDA could have fixed this problem at \nany point, since it is the result of their rulemaking. So giving, as \nthe compromise does, the USDA power they already have and claiming \nreform happens to be a true--and true too often--example of a \nWashington hat trick.\n  The conferees did not stop at just kicking the decision over to the \nDepartment, they also tied the USDA's hands with unnecessary \nrequirements that must be met before action can even be taken. That is \nwhy I say it is going to be difficult for Secretary Vilsack. I hope he \ncan find ways to accomplish what I want to accomplish. As I said, I \nthink that is where his heart is.\n  So I hope Secretary Vilsack, and I can even say the Obama \nadministration, finally uses this authority to produce a strong, \nenforceable rule regarding the number of people who can be eligible for \nfarm subsidies from taxpayers; in other words, people who are actually \nfarming. I am certainly going to offer them my thoughts on this issue.\n  Maybe I should explain why I said even the Obama administration, \nbeyond Secretary Vilsack. Because in this President's budget more than \nonce and in the Bush budget more than once, Presidents--including this \nPresident--have suggested these reforms to save money. This year I said \nabout $400 million. Actually, according to CBO, it is $387 million.\n  The Government Accountability Office released a report in October of \n2013 that clearly outlines the problems with the actively engaged \nloophole. One farming partnership they highlighted was composed of 22 \nLLCs, with 20 different owners and 16 managers who got their \neligibility through the actively engaged loophole.\n  So you understand why the bill that passed the Senate and the House \nsaid one manager. At least four of the managers I have referred to from \nthat operation even live out of the State, while several others live in \ncities around the State well outside of commuting distance.\n  Additionally, just yesterday, it was reported that a large farming \noperation in the State of Illinois is being fined $5.3 million because \nthey were exploiting taxpayers for farm subsidies. In this case, the \ngovernment determined their business structure was intentionally \ndesigned to evade those payment limitations that are even in existing \nlaw with the exact fake entity structures my provisions would have \nnearly eliminated.\n  I wish to quote U.S. attorney Jim Lewis, who handled that case:\n\n       We are pleased with this favorable resolution of the \n     government's claims of misuse of farm subsidy programs. These \n     programs are designed to help farmers withstand market price \n     volatility and the intrinsic risks associated with farming \n     from year to year. Any attempt to exploit the system to take \n     more than one's fair share is an improper use of government \n     funds that erodes the public confidence in such programs \n     and threatens their continued viability.\n\n  End of comment of U.S. Attorney Jim Lewis, who won that case against \nthese farmers, and they will be fined that $5.3 million.\n  I wish that U.S. attorney could have been part of the farm bill \nconference committee. His logic and expertise would have helped.\n  If a farm's business model depends on lawyers setting up complicated \nMickey Mouse legal structures just to get more government subsidies, \nperhaps the owners of that entity are in the wrong business.\n  So my provisions would have limited subsidies going to a few thousand \npeople who are very well off and, quite frankly, do not need unlimited \nfarm payments from the government--and probably are not even involved \nwith dirt under their fingernails--especially since, by definition, \nthey would be people then who do not actually work on farms.\n  If we cannot cut subsidies that go to nonfarming millionaires, how \nwill we ever find the courage then to fix other great entitlement \nproblems we have in this country?\n  With all that said, there are a few things this bill does that are \ngood.\n  The dairy provisions have ended up more market oriented than where we \nstarted, which I believe is very good. I am glad the Crop Insurance \nProgram will remain strong for farmers across the country, and the \nnutrition program reforms are welcomed.\n  In the end, I have to make a judgment of the bill as a whole. Every \nMember of this Senate has to. I believe this bill, sadly, is a missed \nopportunity. The Congressional Budget Office says the final savings in \nthis bill are only $16.6 billion. That is a pretty small amount \ncompared to the fact that it will spend nearly $1 trillion.\n  I think my colleagues know I am a person who plays by the rules. So I \nplayed by the rules with these reforms that were adopted 2 years ago 75 \nto 24--not debated or voted on this year because they were part of the \nbill that passed the Senate and then went to the House of \nRepresentatives and were voted on there 230 to 194.\n  So we played by the rules. A majority of both bodies support these \nreforms. Yet, in the end, just a small group of people, with a single-\nminded intent to keep unlimited farm subsidies flowing out the door, \nproved that Congress deserves its 12-percent approval rating.\n  I want to be clear. I strongly support the business of agriculture. I \nhave been involved in farming my whole life. My son Robin operates our \nfamily farm. I understand the industry. Growing wholesome foods to feed \nthe world has always been one of the noblest occupations, in my \nopinion.\n  But if I were to vote yes on the bill, it would be an endorsement of \nthe egregious manipulation of my payment limitation reforms behind \nclosed doors. I cannot in good conscience do that. Therefore, I will \noppose the Agricultural Act of 2014.\n  Just to kind of clarify, do you understand. I hope everybody \nunderstands we had the moral authority of a majority of the Senate, the \nmoral authority of a majority of the House of Representatives, the \nmoral authority of a majority of the people of this country--who I \nbelieve would say it is a good thing to save $387 million--and yet that \nmoral authority was avoided by conferees who thought: To heck with the \nmajority of the Senate or a voting majority of the House of \nRepresentatives of 230 to 194. It does not mean anything. We can do \nwhatever we want to do. We can waste that $387 million. We can continue \nto give farm payments to people who are not farming. We can continue to \nlet 10 percent of the biggest farmers get 70 percent of the benefits of \nthe farm program, which, in the end, then helps subsidize big farmers \ngetting bigger. There is nothing wrong with big farmers getting bigger, \nbut you should not subsidize it. It drives up the price of farmland, it \ndrives up the price of cash rent, so our young farmers cannot get \nstarted farming. If you want to preserve the family farm, that is one \nof the things that is very important.\n  So I have said my part. I hope I am around 5 years from now so I can \ntry this once again because I do not intend to give up on this process. \nFive years from now is the next farm bill probably. Maybe there will be \nopportunities between now and then. I intend to take advantage of those \nopportunities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Military Retiree Cuts\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I am here today as a voice for our \nveterans and career military servicemembers.\n  Since I came to Congress in 2001, I have served on the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, both in the House and the\n\n[[Page S647]]\n\nSenate, and have continuously fought to uphold the promises we have \nmade with the men and women who served on behalf of our Nation. I am \ncontinually looking for opportunities to improve the lives of our \nveterans who have served honorably and have sacrificed, sometimes with \ntheir lives, in support of our country.\n  They deserve every benefit they earned and what we have promised \nthem, but they have suffered a grave injustice in this body. Late last \nyear the Senate, without my support, agreed to a budget that cut \nretirement benefits of our veterans, reducing the cost-of-living \nadjustment. I certainly could not support this provision.\n  Veterans and the American people are rightly upset. I want to share \nsome of the letters I have received from our veterans and other \nArkansans. David Mullins from Jonesboro wrote:\n\n       I am a 20 year veteran of the United States Army. I retired \n     as a Sergeant First Class and I am currently drawing military \n     retirement. I joined the Army when I was 18 years old and I \n     wouldn't do anything different. Even though it was very hard \n     at times, I know that was what I was supposed to be doing. \n     Less than 1% of the American population serves in the \n     military and of those only about 13% actually retire with 20 \n     years or more of service. So we are talking about less than \n     .02 percent of the population. It is really appalling that, \n     after sacrificing my freedoms to protect those of my fellow \n     citizens, this is how we are treated. America is out of \n     touch.\n\n  I agree with David. In a letter I sent to the Armed Services \nCommittee leadership in the House and Senate, I equated retirement \ncompensation cuts to reaching into these individuals' retirement \naccounts and taking that money from them. This is unconscionable.\n  Diane from Hot Springs, AR, said in a letter:\n\n       I am truly disgusted by the new deal that cuts military \n     pensions but doesn't touch benefits for any of the \n     politicians. I would have no problems if it was an across the \n     board cut. This is the best example of what is wrong with our \n     government. Cut benefits for those that make real sacrifices \n     for their country. They take lower pay and separation from \n     family.\n\n  I agree with Diane. It is not fair. Our veterans should not be the \nones bearing the burden for irresponsible spending. We need to cut \nspending and put our country on the path of fiscal responsibility, but \nit should not come at the expense of our Nation's military retirees. \nThese are the only Americans who are being asked to sacrifice under the \nbudget agreement. It is wrong to single out our servicemembers for what \namounts to $6 billion over 10 years, representing a .02-percent \nreduction. We need to right this wrong so our military retirees and \ntheir families have one less thing to worry about.\n  Terry Williamson from Jacksonville, AR, wrote:\n\n       I just retired from 26 years of active duty serving my \n     country in the Air Force. I must say I was shocked and \n     disappointed to learn that the pay of retirees are being \n     offered up to be reduced by 1% cost of living as part of the \n     budget deal. I feel that I have lived up to and beyond my \n     part in serving my country. I have not even received my first \n     retirement check and yet already my government is short \n     changing my and all veterans who have served and fulfilled \n     their end of the deal, defending this great nation. I ask you \n     to do what you can to not allow this to happen to a small \n     portion of society that gave more to their country than most.\n\n  Terry, we are working to make sure you get the full retirement you \nearned. We are seeking ways to undo this cut and fully restore military \npay.\n  In January Congress took the first step toward restoring veterans' \nCOLAs with the passage of the Omnibus appropriations bill. This \nexempted medically retired disabled veterans and survivors from the \nCOLA reductions. But there is more work to do. The good news is we are \non your side.\n  Senator Ayotte introduced the Keeping Our Promises to Our Military \nHeroes Act that repeals the COLA reduction for all military retirees. I \nam certainly proud to support that legislation.\n  Arkansans want Congress to fully restore military retiree benefits as \nsoon as possible. I am committed to raising this priority at every \npossible opportunity until justice is realized for these military \nfamilies. While there has been much discussion about restoring these \nbenefits in future legislation, this should be done at the earliest \nopportunity in order to provide certainty for our military retirees' \nfinancial future.\n  To our Nation's military retirees, I am committed to this fight. You \nhave earned these benefits. Congress must correct the wrong and restore \nyour full retirement pay. As always, thank you for your service to our \ncountry.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Vermont is home to hundreds of world-class \nsmall businesses, each of which dots our economic landscape with their \nunique and often award-winning offerings. Our reputation for quality \nhas made the ``Vermont brand'' one that is valued and sought after by \nconsumers across the Nation--and increasingly also across the globe. \nOne burgeoning industry in Vermont is that of craft beer. In fact, the \nState is becoming almost as well known for its craft beers as it is for \nits maple syrup.\n  One such successful small brewery, the Hill Farmstead Brewery, was \nfeatured in the January 18, 2014, edition of the New York Times. After \na planned expansion next year, the brewery's owner, Shaun Hill, plans \nto cap production at 150,000 gallons per year. His successful business \nmodel, and highly sought after brew, as the article states, ``offers \nlessons in how limiting production can bring success.''\n  Vermont's small-State appeal attracts business owners large and \nsmall. The Hill Farmstead Brewery is just one example of the successes \nVermont's economy boast. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of ``Craft \nBeer, the (Very) Limited Edition,'' from the January 18 New York Times \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to appear in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 18, 2014]\n\n                 Craft Beer, the (Very) Limited Edition\n\n                           (By Claire Martin)\n\n       Two weeks ago, a beer drinker in Fresno, Calif., called \n     Hill Farmstead Brewery in Vermont to ask where he could buy \n     its craft beers. ``You have to drive to the airport, get a \n     ticket, fly to Burlington, rent a car and drive an hour and a \n     half to the brewery,'' the owner, Shaun Hill, replied with a \n     laugh. But he wasn't joking.\n       Hill Farmstead, in the hamlet of Greensboro, produces just \n     60,000 gallons of beer annually. The beer is available for \n     purchase only at the brewery and in roughly 20 Vermont bars. \n     In addition, Mr. Hill sends 12 kegs to distributors in New \n     York City and Philadelphia a few times a year.\n       Next year, after several buildings are expanded and new \n     equipment is installed, Mr. Hill plans to cap production at \n     150,000 gallons a year--forever. (For context, the Russian \n     River Brewing Company, a craft brewery in California, made \n     437,100 gallons last year, and Dogfish Head Craft Brewery in \n     Delaware produced 6.3 million gallons.)\n       Hill Farmstead is one of at least three Vermont craft \n     breweries that are churning out small batches of highly \n     sought-after beers and have owners with firm plans to keep \n     the operations small. Mr. Hill's story offers lessons in how \n     limiting production can bring success.\n       Mr. Hill, 34, has been honing his brewing technique for \n     nearly 20 years. He first learned to make beer for a high \n     school science-fair project, then started a home-brew club in \n     college and later worked as the head brewer at two other \n     Vermont breweries, the Shed and the Trout River Brewing \n     Company, as well as one in Copenhagen, Norrebro Bryghus.\n       Two beers created during Mr. Hill's tenure at Norrebro \n     Bryghus won gold medals in 2010 at the World Beer Cup, an \n     international beer competition, and a third earned a silver \n     medal.\n       Several months before these accolades, Mr. Hill returned to \n     Vermont to begin construction on Hill Farmstead Brewery on a \n     former dairy farm that he and his brother, Darren, a \n     woodworker, inherited from their grandfather. ``I wanted to \n     make beer, I wanted to live in this place and I wanted to \n     help my family and make sure I had the finances available to \n     take care of this land in perpetuity,'' Mr. Hill says.\n\n[[Page S648]]\n\n       This wasn't his first attempt at starting a brewery, but it \n     was the first time he was able to obtain financial backing. \n     ``Ten years ago or even still five years ago,'' he says, ``it \n     was very difficult to find private investment or to convince \n     banks to loan money to a start-up.''\n       In the past decade, craft beer production has thrived, \n     attracting investors with deep pockets. In 2012, national \n     retail sales for craft beer were $11.9 billion, according to \n     the most recent figures from the Brewers Association.\n       While Mr. Hill was in Denmark, where American craft beer \n     was starting to become popular, he was able to borrow $80,000 \n     from a small group of European and American lenders who he \n     felt respected his vision and abilities.\n       From the start, his philosophy has been to make the best \n     beer possible without pursuing what he calls ``infinite, \n     boundless growth.'' He operates under the belief that beer is \n     a perishable item, ``just like lettuce or broccoli,'' he \n     says, and should be consumed locally, not shipped long \n     distances.\n       Mr. Hill has a staff of six, including two assistant \n     brewers who harvest yeast and transfer beer into kegs, but he \n     personally makes all of the brewery's offerings--pale ales, \n     stouts and porters--using modern stainless steel tanks and \n     traditional wooden barrels, like those used in winemaking.\n       The beers are known for having ``a sense of balance that \n     isn't common in a lot of new breweries,'' says Jeff Baker, \n     the bar manager of the Farmhouse Tap and Grill in Burlington, \n     which serves the beers. ``They're hoppy, but they're not \n     super-bitter and they don't exhaust your palate.''\n       For entrepreneurs who measure success in more than just \n     financial terms, it's still crucial to have a viable \n     business, says Bo Burlingham, author of ``Small Giants: \n     Companies That Choose to Be Great Instead of Big.'' ``The \n     challenge for a lot of small companies who have nonfinancial \n     goals is that you can't let that get in the way of having a \n     very financially solid business,'' Mr. Burlingham says. \n     ``You'd better have a sound business model, steady gross \n     margins, a healthy balance sheet and margins you protect.''\n       For Mr. Hill, financial stability came quickly. He says the \n     brewery began turning a profit after just one year.\n       Demand surged last February when users of the beer-review \n     site Ratebeer.com deemed Hill Farmstead the best brewery in \n     the world--after having anointed Mr. Hill as the best new \n     brewer in 2010.\n       Now Mr. Hill says he fields questions like the one from the \n     Fresno caller every day. He estimates that thousands of \n     people have made long-distance beer runs to Hill Farmstead \n     Brewery, some traveling from as far as New Zealand, Norway \n     and Japan.\n       Customers wait in line for one to four hours to buy bottles \n     and two-liter growlers of the beers, many of which are named \n     for Mr. Hill's ancestors (Edward, Abner, Florence). The \n     brewery once sold an entire batch of beer--500 gallons--in \n     one day.\n       As his beer's popularity has risen, he has sometimes worked \n     18-hour days. Some small-business owners who have achieved \n     financial stability choose to delegate a significant portion \n     of their work to employees, but Mr. Hill says he won't be \n     doing that.\n       And the notion of moving production to an industrial park, \n     where craft breweries are commonly found, holds no appeal for \n     him. He has decided to invest in infrastructure and better \n     equipment that will make his current operation more \n     efficient.\n       ``I didn't start this brewery so I could keep growing and \n     move it away from here; that wasn't the point,'' he says. \n     ``It wouldn't be fun anymore. It wouldn't have purpose or \n     meaning.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/30/senate-section/article/S648-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S648-S649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FAIRNESS IN DISASTER DECLARATIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this week, Senator Kirk and I introduced \nthe Fairness in Federal Disaster Declarations Act. It is designed to \nensure fairness in FEMA's consideration of whether a community will be \ngranted Federal assistance after a disaster.\n  This legislation is necessary because the way FEMA evaluates whether \nto declare an area a Federal disaster is not working. It works against \nStates with large populations.\n  From 2002 to 2012, Illinois was denied Federal disaster assistance \nsix times. Texas was denied 11 times--for damage caused by everything \nfrom wildfires to tropical storms. Florida was denied Federal disaster \nassistance six times during that 10 year period, and California, New \nJersey, and New York were each denied four times. FEMA's formula does \nnot work for large, populous States, particularly those with a \nconcentrated urban area, like Illinois.\n  It is not enough just to talk about the numbers, though. Each one of \nthese disasters devastated communities. In each one of these disasters, \npeople saw their homes and their towns destroyed.\n  This past November, tornadoes swept through Illinois, killing six \npeople and destroying whole towns in my State. The cities of \nWashington, Gifford, and New Minden, IL, experienced some of the worst \ntornado damage I have ever seen. Power lines were down and public \ninfrastructure was decimated, but because Illinois did not meet one of \nFEMA's criteria, we were denied Federal public assistance.\n  Governor Pat Quinn is going to appeal that denial, and he has Senator \nKirk's and my full support for that appeal.\n  Illinois also was denied Federal disaster assistance after tornadoes \ndestroyed the towns of Harrisburg and Ridgway in 2012. Eight people \ndied after tornadoes with winds up to 200 miles per hour splintered \nhomes, businesses, churches, and public infrastructure in those two \ntowns. Nevertheless, the State was denied public assistance. FEMA said \nbecause Illinois has a large population, we should be able to absorb \nthose recovery costs. When similar tornado damage happened in \nneighboring Joplin, MO--which has a smaller population--Federal \nassistance was granted.\n  It is not just tornado damage in Illinois that has resulted in \ndenials from FEMA for Federal assistance, and it is not just the \nState's per capita that has been used as FEMA's justification for the \ndenials. Counties with a high population also have been denied. Last \nApril, Illinois experienced major flooding both along the Mississippi \nRiver and resulting from flash flooding due to major storms.\n  Many communities in Cook County, including Chicago and its suburbs, \nexperienced unprecedented flooding. But because the damage in Cook \nCounty did not meet FEMA's per capita requirement, Cook County was \ndenied individual assistance. All of the neighboring counties were \napproved. Cook County was denied.\n  When questioned about these decisions, FEMA pointed to the factors it \nconsiders when determining if a Federal declaration is warranted. One \nof these factors has to do with the population of the State. If a State \nhas a large population--more than 10 million people--it is analyzed \ndifferently than if it were smaller. The thinking is that large States \nhave the resources necessary to absorb the recovery costs. Well, I can \ntell you--Illinois does not have the resources to absorb the costs of \nthese tornadoes and flooding. Whole towns were devastated in these \ndisasters.\n  The bill Senator Kirk and I introduced assigns a value to each of the \nsix factors considered in the disaster declaration analysis. When FEMA \nconsiders individual assistance--help for people to rebuild their homes \nand pay for temporary housing--it will use the same, consistent \nfactors, no matter where the disaster strikes.\n  The population of the State will constitute 5 percent of the \nanalysis. Consideration of the concentration of damages will be 20 \npercent. The amount of trauma to the disaster area will be 20 percent. \nThe number of special populations--such as elderly or unemployed \npeople--will be 20 percent of the analysis. The amount of voluntary \nassistance in the area will be 10 percent. And the amount of insurance \ncoverage for the type of damage incurred will be 20 percent of the \nanalysis.\n  Our bill also adds a seventh consideration to FEMA's metrics--the \neconomics of the area, which will receive 5 percent consideration. This \nincludes factors such as the local assessable tax base, the median \nincome as it compares to that of the State, and the poverty rate as it \ncompares to that of the State. It is reasonable that FEMA should take \ninto consideration the size of the State, but as the regulations stand, \nlarge States are being penalized. Assigning values to the factors will \nensure that the damage to the specific community weighs more than the \nState's population.\n  After the tornadoes hit Harrisburg and Ridgway, the head of the \nIllinois Emergency Management Agency, Jonathon Monken, worked with \nlocals and people from the FEMA regional office to determine if the \nState could apply for public assistance--money to help Mayor Gregg and \nothers pay for the overtime accrued by all the people working around \nthe clock to help the community dig out of the destruction. What \nDirector Monken and the others discovered was that it would have been a \nwaste of the State's time and resources to even apply for Federal \npublic assistance. We did not meet FEMA's threshold.\n\n[[Page S649]]\n\n  Currently, FEMA multiplies the number of people in the State by $1.35 \nto determine a threshold of the amount of damage a state would have to \nhave incurred to be considered for public assistance. In Illinois, that \nfigure is about $17 million. Well, Harrisburg, Ridgway, and the \nsurrounding communities had about $5.5 million in public assistance \ndamages, and $5.5 million is a lot of loss, particularly in a rural \narea, but not enough to qualify for Federal assistance under FEMA's \nrules.\n  In the same way this bill assigns values to the factors FEMA \nconsiders for individual assistance, it assigns values to the six \nfactors the agency considers for public assistance. The per capita \nconsideration will be 10 percent of the analysis. Localized impacts of \nthe disaster will make up 40 percent of the analysis. The estimated \ncost of the assistance needed will constitute 10 percent of the \nanalysis. The insurance coverage in force will be 10 percent. The \nnumber of recent multiple disasters will be 10 percent. And an analysis \nof the other Federal assistance for the area will make up 10 percent of \nthe evaluation.\n  The bill also would add a seventh consideration for public \nassistance--the economic circumstances of the affected area--which \nwould be considered at 10 percent of the analysis. This would include \nthe same information as it would for individual assistance--the local \nassessable tax base, the median income of the area as it compares to \nthat of the State, and the poverty rate as it compares to that of the \nState.\n  Illinois is a relatively large State, geographically, and has a \nconcentrated urban area. The State--particularly downstate--is being \npunished for this fact. If the cities of Washington and Gifford--and \nHarrisburg and Ridgway--do not qualify under FEMA's current criteria \nfor federal assistance, something is wrong.\n  These towns were struck by category 4 and category 3 tornadoes, \nrespectively, and the damage is devastating. The people of these \ncommunities are being punished for living within a populous State. \nLet's fix the metrics FEMA uses to make this analysis so that they are \nfair to every state.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/30/senate-section/article/S649-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGETARY REVISIONS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, section 114(d) of H.J. Res. 59, the \nBipartisan Budget Act of 2013, allows the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee to revise the allocations, aggregates, and levels filed on \nJanuary 14, 2014, pursuant to section 111 of H.J. Res. 59, for a number \nof deficit-neutral reserve funds. These reserve funds were incorporated \ninto the Bipartisan Budget Act by reference to sections of S. Con. Res. \n8, the Senate-passed budget resolution for 2014. Among these sections \nis a reference to section 313 of S. Con. Res. 8, which establishes a \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund for a farm bill. The authority to adjust \nenforceable levels in the Senate for a farm bill is contingent on that \nlegislation not increasing the deficit over either the period of the \ntotal of fiscal years 2013 through 2018 or the period of the total of \nfiscal years 2013 through 2023.\n  I find that the conference agreement on H.R. 2642, the Agricultural \nAct of 2014, as reported on January 27, 2014, fulfills the conditions \nof the deficit-neutral reserve fund for a farm bill.

Madam President, every January brings hope that the New \nYear will be a happy and safe one. But, sadly, 2014 has already been \nmarred by gun violence.\n  To cite just a few examples, on January 9, a 16-year-old student at \nLiberty Technology Magnet High School shot a classmate in the thigh \nwith a pistol. On January 14, a 12-year-old in New Mexico walked into \nhis middle school's gym and opened fire with a shotgun, injuring two of \nhis classmates as they waited to go to class. And on the evening of \nJanuary 15, a man used a semi-automatic handgun to murder two people at \nan Indiana grocery store. He was about to kill another person just \nbefore police officers shot and killed him.\n  Sadly, our Nation's epidemic of gun violence continues. The National \nCenter for Injury Prevention and Control has estimated that around \n30,000 people in the United States die from gunshot wounds every year, \nand more than 60,000 people are injured by guns every year. A study \nalso has shown that the firearm homicide rate in our Nation is 20 times \nhigher than the combined rate of 22 other countries comparable in \npopulation.\n  We live in a country where almost every week a community is wracked \nby a mass shooting, defined as an incident that claims at least four \nlives. In 2013, our Nation witnessed at least 25 such shootings. These \noccur all over our Nation, in places like Oklahoma City, where last \nAugust a man who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia stopped taking \nhis medication and shot his mother, sister, niece, and nephew; in \nOttawa, KS, where last April a man who had served prison time for \nattempted second-degree murder shot and killed 4 people; in Washington, \nDC, where a mentally deranged individual killed 12 and injured 8 at \nWashington's Navy Yard.\n  Last December, just one day before the anniversary of the tragic \nNewtown school shooting which stole the lives of 27 people, 20 of them \nchildren, another school shooting occurred in Arapahoe, CO. This time, \nthe perpetrator was an 18-year-old high school senior who entered his \nhigh school near Denver armed with 125 rounds of ammunition, a pump-\naction shotgun, a machete, and three incendiary devices. He critically \ninjured a classmate, who has since tragically passed away, before \ntaking his own life. While this may not qualify as a mass shooting, it \nis no less troubling. It is a testament to how disturbingly numb to gun \nviolence our society has become that the sentiment ``it could have been \nworse'' is some form of relief.\n  Today, America is a nation where parents are nervous to send their \nchildren to schools, shopping malls, and movie theaters because they \nare genuinely afraid that their kids might not come back. We live in a \nnation where toddlers find unsecured handguns in their family's homes \nand accidentally take lives. We live in a society where arguments and \ndisputes turn into tragedies, all with one ill-considered pull of a \ntrigger. Is this the kind of environment we want to live in? Is this \nwhat we want to leave for the next generation?\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that this year, the procession of gun \ntragedies will begin to end. It is my hope that we will not be \nsubmerged this year in the horror of a mass shooting. But this hope \nwill only be realized if Congress takes action to stop the gun violence \nplaguing our country.\n  I urge my colleagues not to accept the status quo, where convicted \nfelons, domestic abusers, and the mentally ill can get their hands on a \ndeadly weapon at any time. I urge my colleagues to take steps toward \nending this violence by passing commonsense legislation, supported by \n90 percent of the American people, that would enact background checks \non all gun sales. I urge my colleagues to work to ensure that our \nhomes, our families, and our neighborhoods become safer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/30/senate-section/article/S650-2", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ASHLAND UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN.

The \nuniversity offers undergraduate, masters, and doctorate degrees and has \nbeen nationally recognized and ranked in the ``Top 200 National \nUniversities'' by U.S. News & World Report for the last 2 years.\n  Madam President, I would like to congratulate Ashland University for \naddressing the affordability and accessibility of higher education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/30/senate-section/article/S650-3", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S650-S651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MYRON BELKIND\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I rise today to recognize Cleveland \nnative Myron Belkind, who was named president of the National Press \nClub on January 25, 2014. Mr. Belkind grew up in Lyndhurst, OH, where \nhe began his career in journalism writing as a student and then for the \nCleveland Plain Dealer and the Cleveland Press.\n  During Mr. Belkind's 42-year career with the Associated Press, he \ncovered many world leaders and headed up Associated Press bureaus in \nKuala Lumpur, New Delhi, London, and Tokyo. He served as president of \nseveral foreign press associations and as a journalism instructor at \nthe George Washington University in Washington, DC. He has received the \nDistinguished Alumni Awards from the Ohio State University School of \nCommunications and Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.\n  As a foreign correspondent in the 1970s, Belkind covered major \ninternational news stories and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for \nhis coverage of the breaking news that Prime Minister Gandhi's \ngovernment had declared a state of emergency on June 26, 1975, \nsuspending civil liberties, arresting thousands of political opponents, \nand imposing restrictions on the national and international press.\n  He is the first National Press Club president with an extensive \ninternational background in foreign correspondence. In his new role, he \nhas vowed to continue his work promoting worldwide freedom of the press \nand will\n\n[[Page S651]]\n\ncontinue to strive for professional development and excellence in \njournalism.\n  Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Myron Belkind, a fellow \nBuckeye, as he begins this new chapter in his distinguished career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/30/senate-section/article/S651-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING MARSHA OGILVIE\n\n  Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to Marsha H. \nOgilvie, a loyal and steadfast mayor of Sandpoint, ID. On January, 8, \n2014, Mayor Ogilvie lost a valiant battle with cancer and my State lost \na good friend, a champion for women and children and a tireless public \nservant.\n  Mayor Ogilvie, who was born at March Air Force Base in Southern \nCalifornia, moved to the great State of Idaho in 1994. In the 20 years \nshe made Idaho her home, she distinguished herself in service to \nothers. As she once said, and many in Sandpoint now say, she won the \nhearts and minds of the people in Sandpoint.\n  Elected mayor just 2 years ago and having served the two previous \nyears on the city council, Mayor Ogilvie, leaves a giant hole in those \nhearts and the broader community. The business and professional \nexperience Mayor Ogilvie brought was wide and varied and earned her the \nrespect of many. Early in her career, she served in restaurant and \nretail management. When she and her husband Francis arrived in \nSandpoint, they opened a couple of small businesses--The Candy Cottage \nand the All Smiles gift shop. But Marsha Ogilvie was not just about \nbusiness. She cared deeply about the health, welfare and success of \nwomen and children.\n  Soon after moving to Idaho and well before entering public service, \nshe established Kinderhaven, a nonprofit community organization which \nis dedicated to supporting children in crisis. Founded in 1996 and \nunder the vision and compassionate care of Marsha Ogilvie, more than \n1,300 children have found the all-important help they needed in times \nof their greatest distress. So important to the Sandpoint community, \nKinderhaven was named the grand prize winner in the 2002 Governor's \nBrightest Stars Awards. In addition, Mrs. Ogilvie, who crossed paths \nwith many women serving as volunteers in the Sandpoint community, \nstarted Women Honoring Women. It was designed to be a one-time event \nbut has evolved since 1999 into an annual event to recognize and honor \nwomen in Bonner County who are 65 or older and working to make a \ndifference in the lives of others, who love learning and exhibit \nqualities of leadership. Marsha Ogilvie recognized these qualities in \nothers because she, too, possessed them. . .well, all but one--she was \nonly 64 when she passed away.\n  If these achievements were not enough, Marsha Ogilvie joined with \nthree friends to co-author a children's book, which was just recently \npublished. Gigi's Enchanted Forest was a way to honor the life of a \nmutual friend of theirs who shared their hope for and love of children \nand a dedication to community service.\n  Mayor Marsha H. Ogilvie personified a life of giving and caring. Her \nunparalleled legacy of hard work, reaching out to her community and \nrecognizing those who help others in volunteer service is indelibly \netched on the many hearts and minds of those she served in Sandpoint, \nID, and far beyond the city limits. May God bless her husband, her \nfamily and the hundreds of Idahoans who will miss her passion, \nexuberance and spirit of joy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/30/senate-section/article/S651-2", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FISHER'S TECHNOLOGY\n\n  Mr. RISCH. Madam President, a small business faces a constant threat \nto its bottom line when the products they sell grow obsolete. Years of \nexpertise and business relationships can be rendered meaningless \nwithout the ability to adjust in an ever changing and technologically \nadvancing marketplace. There is no better example of adaptation than \nFisher's Technology in my home State of Idaho.\n  Fisher's Technology was founded in Boise, ID in 1936, during the \nworst years of the Great Depression, as a specialty typewriter sales \nand repair shop. In 1985, Gary Mahn purchased the company and, since \nthen, Fisher's Technology has expanded its inventory to become Idaho's \nlargest office supply firm. This would not have been possible had \nFisher's remained narrowly focused on typewriters. In a continuing \nbusiness evolution, Mr. Mahn sold the office supply portion of the \ncompany to another local Boise company. This allowed Fisher's \nTechnology to maintain and grow the remaining office equipment \ndivision.\n  Today, Fisher's Technology has four locations across Idaho, offering \na variety of office hardware and software products along with IT \nservices. After a 78 percent increase in sales revenue, topping $13 \nmillion, Fisher's was named to Inc. Magazine's 5,000 fastest-growing \ncompanies in the Nation. Fisher's has made this list four of the last 5 \nyears, a testament to the Fisher's Technology team's hard work and \ncommitment to customer satisfaction. At a time when America's economy \nhas struggled to add jobs, Fisher's Technology has boosted its payroll \nfrom 46 employees in 2009 to 66 today representing a 43 percent \nincrease in hiring.\n  Not only has Fisher's Technology helped businesses across Idaho meet \ntheir equipment needs, but its employees are also active members of \ntheir communities and strive to give back in any way that they can. For \nexample, the company sponsors the Blue Cross ``Blue Cruise'' bicycle \nrace, which benefits local charities in Idaho's Treasure Valley.\n  I commend everyone at Fisher's Technology on their continued growth, \nresilience, and determination, and wish them another 78 years of \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/30/senate-section/article/S651-3", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DAVID MELINCOFF\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I rise today to recognize a \nremarkable Vermonter, David Melincoff, who is carrying on the tradition \nof providing a good meal and fostering a sense of community each \nThanksgiving.\n  As many Vermonters continue to struggle to make ends meet in the wake \nof the most severe recession to hit the United States in generations, \nMr. Melincoff marked the 24th year his Burlington, VT restaurant has \noffered a traditional Thanksgiving dinner at no cost. Nearly 1,000 \ndinners were given away this past Thanksgiving. Since the Thanksgiving \nCommunity Dinner started 24 years ago at Sweetwaters American Bistro, \nMr. Melincoff estimates that more than 20,000 meals have been served \nfree of charge.\n  The dinner, a traditional Thanksgiving meal of turkey, stuffing, and \nmashed potatoes, offers the same experience a diner would have eating \nat the restaurant on any other night, including wait service provided \nby volunteers. The fundamental difference is that the meal is free of \ncharge--and the sense of community this generosity inspires is \nundeniable.\n  It is not only those who are having financial difficulties who attend \nthe Thanksgiving Community Dinner. As Mr. Melincoff noted, ``Sometimes \nit's an emotional need.'' Often, people who have lost a loved one \nattend in order to share in the company and fellowship of others. The \ndinner provides an opportunity where people, regardless of their \neconomic status, can sit and break bread together. ``Here, they just \nfeel equal. That's the part that always gets me,'' Mr. Melincoff said. \n``It's about self-respect.''\n  The meal itself is just one part of the day-long event. A coat \ndonation drive was added as another effort to serve 4 years ago. \nHundreds of coats are collected in advance by the Windjammer Restaurant \nin South Burlington, and this year roughly 700 coats were provided to \nindividuals in need.\n  Local residents and members of the business community also pitch in \nto make the Thanksgiving Community Dinner a success. Everyone benefits \nfrom this event, whether it is from the food provided or the \nsatisfaction of giving back to the community. For the volunteers, Mr. \nMelincoff noted, ``it puts things into perspective about what you \nshould be grateful for.''\n  Mr. President, I wanted to take this opportunity to commend Mr. \nMelincoff for his commitment and service to others and applaud his \nefforts to reach to out those in need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/30/senate-section/article/S651-4", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S651-S652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to\n\n[[Page S652]]\n\nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/30/senate-section/article/S652-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and two withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/30/senate-section/article/S652-2", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagree to the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses on the amendment of the House to the amendment \nof the Senate to the bill (H.R. 2642) to provide for the reform and \ncontinuation of agricultural and other programs of the Department of \nAgriculture through fiscal year 2018, and for other purposes.\n  The message further announced that pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 2761, and \nthe order of the House of January 3, 2013, the Speaker appoints the \nfollowing Members on the part of the House of Representatives to the \nBritish-American Interparliamentary Group: Mr. McIntyre of North \nCarolina and Mr. Delaney of Maryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/30/senate-section/article/S652-3", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n       S. 1977.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the Northern \n     Mariana Commonwealth Legislature petitioning the United \n     States Congress to amend the Radiation Exposure Act of 1990; \n     to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                 Senate Joint Resolution No. 18-04, S1\n\n       Whereas, the United States Government and the Atomic Energy \n     Commission together with the United States Armed Forces \n     conducted testing of atomic nuclear weapons on Eniwetok and \n     Bikini Atolls in the Marshall Islands, South Pacific, from \n     1946 to 1962; and\n       Whereas, a total of 67 atomic and thermonuclear bombs/\n     devices were detonated with a total yield of 108,492.2 \n     kilotons which resulted in fallout across a wide area around \n     the Marshall Islands in the Pacific; and\n       Whereas, no less than ten of those detonations yielded \n     between five to ten megatons of radioactive material from the \n     center of the explosion to the height of between 12 to 55 \n     miles into the jet-stream; and\n       Whereas, on October 31, 1952, Operation Ivy was conducted \n     on Elugelab Island (``Flora'') in the Enewetak Atoll, in \n     which the first true thermonuclear hydrogen bomb (a 10.4 \n     megaton device) code name Mike was detonated, destroying the \n     entire island leaving behind a 6,240 feet across and 164 feet \n     deep crater in its aftermath; and\n       Whereas, in 90 seconds the mushroom cloud climbed to 57,000 \n     feet into the atmosphere and within 30 minutes had stretched \n     60 miles in diameter with the base of the mushroom head \n     joining the stem of 45,000 feet; and\n       Whereas, radioactive fallout is the after effect of the \n     detonation of a nuclear bomb where radioactive particles and \n     earth debris, which comprise the mushroom cloud, are released \n     into the atmosphere and remain in the atmosphere for about 24 \n     hours before descending back to earth; and\n       Whereas, before the decend back to earth, these radioactive \n     particles can be carried through jet-steams in the atmosphere \n     to locations over a thousand miles away from the actual test \n     site and settle into the environment causing multiple health \n     and environmental problems; and\n       Whereas, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands \n     are located approximately 1,230 miles directly west of the \n     test sites; and\n       Whereas, the radioactive dust particles travelled through \n     the westward flowing jet-streams from the Marshall Islands to \n     Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; \n     and\n       Whereas, due to the deleterious effects of the nuclear \n     radiation, on October 5, , 1990, the United States Congress \n     passed the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (``RECA'') \n     which established new programs for persons physically present \n     in areas near the Nevada nuclear test site during atomic \n     testing at the site. Atmospheric testing of atomic devices--\n     important to national security during the darkest days of the \n     ``cold war''--ended in 1963 when, under President Kennedy, \n     the United States signed and ratified the limited Test Ban \n     ``Treaty''. Prior to the Treaty, the United Stated detonated \n     over 200 atomic devises in the open air in both the South \n     Pacific and in Nevada. The RECA provides compassionate \n     payments to persons with specified diseases who fear that \n     their health were harmed because of fallout from atmospheric \n     atomic testing at the Nevada test site, regardless of whether \n     causation can be scientically established; and\n       Whereas, on July 10, 2000, Public Law 106-245, the \n     Radiation Exposure Compensation Act Amendments of 2000 was \n     passed, adding two new claimant categories, providing for, \n     among other things, additional compensable illnesses, \n     removing certain lifestyle restrictions, and adding \n     additional geographic areas to the ``downwinder'' claimant \n     category; and\n       Whereas, although RECA coverage has been expanded, it still \n     does not provide relief to all Americans affected by fallout, \n     particularly residents of the Commonwealth of the Northern \n     Mariana Islands and the Territory of Guam; and\n       Whereas, there is no doubt that the Territory of Guam has \n     received radioactive debris from fallout during the nuclear \n     weapons testing in the Pacific Ocean to such an extent that \n     in March 2004, Congresswoman Madeleine Z. Bordallo spoke \n     before the Committee to Assess the Scientific Information for \n     the Radiation Exposure Screening and Education Program to \n     request that they include an assessment of Guam for \n     ``downwinders'' and ship decontamination as part of their \n     congressionally mandated study; and\n       Whereas, because the islands in the CNMI are in close \n     proximity to the Territory of Guam, separated by a scant 30 \n     miles, and both are affected by the same win, weather and \n     ocean current patterns, it logically follows that radiation \n     which affects the Territory of Guam necessarily affects the \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; and\n       Whereas, as a result, the Nuclear and Radiation Studies \n     Board (``NSRB'') published in 2005 its report entitled \n     ``Assessment of the Scientific information for the Radiation \n     Exposure Screening and Education Program''; and\n       Whereas, because fallout may have been higher for the \n     people outside RECA-designated areas, the NRSB recommended \n     that all residents of the continental US, Alaska, Hawaii, and \n     overseas US territories who have been diagnosed with specific \n     RECA-compensable diseases and who may have been exposed to \n     radiation from U.S. nuclear-weapons testing fallout be \n     compensated; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress has the authority to \n     amend RECA to include residents of the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands affected by radiation as eligible \n     ``downwinder'' claimants; and\n       Whereas, the failure of the United States Congress to amend \n     RECA in such a way as to compensate affected residents of the \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Islands will cause the people of \n     the Commonwealth to bear a disproportionate burden in \n     defending the United States of America; and\n       Whereas, we, the people of the Commonwealth of the Northern \n     Mariana Islands, United States of America, humbly request \n     that the Commonwealth be included in RECA with the same \n     criteria that was made for Nevada test site in 1990 for \n     compassionate payments: Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved, on behalf of the people of the Commonwealth of \n     the Northern Mariana Islands by the Eighteen Northern \n     Marianas Commonwealth Legislature, That the United States \n     Congress is hereby respectfully petitioned to declare that \n     all Americans shall be given the same consideration when it \n     comes to compensation for exposure to radiation from U.S. \n     nuclear testing; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the United States Congress is hereby \n     respectfully petitioned to amend the Radiation Exposure \n     Compensation Act of 1990, Public Law 101-426, as amended by \n     Public Law 101-510, 3139 (43 U.S.C. 2210) and Public Law 106-\n     245, to include the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands in the jurisdiction ``downwinders'' covered by the \n     Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the United States Congress is hereby \n     respectfully requested to include the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands similarly as the Territory of Guam \n     and be granted RECA ``on site'' status; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the affected population previously and \n     currently in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands \n     (those residing who have been exposed to radiation from the \n     Atomic Energy Commission tests in the Marshall Islands) be \n     recognized as being ``downwinders'' of such test; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the President of the Senate and the Speaker \n     of the House of Representatives shall certify, and the Senate \n     Legislative Secretary and the House Clerk shall attest to the \n     adoption of this joint resolution, and thereafter the Senate \n     Clerk shall transmit a certified copy to the Honorable Barack \n     Obama, President of the United States of America; to the \n     Honorable John Boehner, Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives; to the Honorable Patrick J.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Northern Mariana Commonwealth \n     Legislature requesting the United States Congress to \n     eliminate Section 2109 of S. 744 and similar legislation \n     which will allow thousands of alien workers, their families, \n     and persons of other ethnic origin who are in the \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to become \n     permanent residents and subsequently become U.S. citizens; to \n     the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                       House Resolution No. 18-34\n\n       Whereas, the Chamorro and Carolinian people of the Northern \n     Mariana Islands, in the exercise of their inalienable right \n     of self-determination, negotiated the Covenant Agreement \n     which established the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands in a Political Union with the United States of \n     America. And, in a plebiscite called by the United States on \n     June 17, 1975, they approved the Covenant Agreement by 78.8 \n     per centum. And, with the approval of the Covenant (U.S. \n     Public Law 94-241; 90 Stat. 263) by the 94th United States \n     Congress in a Joint Resolution (H. J. Res. 549) on March 24, \n     1976 and approved by the President of the United States on \n     October 24, 1977, the Chamorro and Carolinian people of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands finally realized their aspiration to \n     be freed from foreign dominations, and to be recognized as a \n     people of the Northern Mariana Islands, with the ``the right \n     of local self-government and to govern themselves in \n     accordance with a Constitution of their own adoption'' as \n     agreed upon and guaranteed pursuant to Article 1, Section 103 \n     of the Covenant; and\n       Whereas, this desire of the Chamorros and Carolinians of \n     the Northern Mariana Islands is not unique, and serves as a \n     basic tenet that guides indigenous peoples around the world \n     who wish to be protected and secure in their homeland, and to \n     exercise their right to self-government. These include the \n     Filipinos, led by national hero and icon Jose Rizal; the \n     Native Americans of North America; the indigenous Fijians, \n     outnumbered at one point by ethnic Indians; the Aborigines of \n     Australia; the Maori of New Zealand; and the Native \n     Hawaiians; and\n       Whereas, the debate on immigration reform issues is now \n     before the 113th United States Congress, and in particular, \n     the passage of Section 2109 (Long-Term Legal Residents in the \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands) of S.744 by the \n     Senate, that is now before the House of Representatives, if \n     approved and becomes a law, will make thousands of alien \n     workers, their families and people of other ethnic origin in \n     the Commonwealth eligible to become U. S. permanent residents \n     five years from its enactment, and five years thereafter, \n     they will be eligible to become U. S. Citizen; and\n       Whereas, the CNMI's 2010 census data shows that there were \n     53,883 people in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands. Of that figure, 2,461 were Carolinians and 12,902 \n     were Chamorros, representing a combined total of 15,363 \n     persons of Northern Marianas descent. The 2010 census \n     reported other ethnic groups as follows: 19,017 Filipino; \n     2,253 Korean; 3,659 Chinese; 1,979 other Asian persons; 1,343 \n     persons of other ethnic origin; 6,832 persons of two or more \n     ethnic origins; and 3,437 persons of native Hawaiian or \n     Pacific Islanders. These groups of people represent a total \n     of 38,520 or 71 percent of the total population of the \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, compared to \n     only 15,363 or 29 percent of Chamorro and Carolinian people \n     of Northern Marianas descent. Undoubtedly, the alien workers, \n     their families and people of other ethnic origin have already \n     outnumbered the population of the Chamorro and Carolinian \n     people of Northern Marianas descent; and\n       Whereas, the U. S. Senate, in introducing S. 744 with the \n     added Section 2109 (Long-term Legal Residents of the \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands), failed to \n     recognize and respect the spirit and sanctity of the Covenant \n     Agreement; the fundamental provisions delineated in Article \n     I, Section 105 of the Covenant, namely, Articles I, II, and \n     III and Sections 501 and 805; and in particular, Article I, \n     Section 103, which guarantees the indigenous Chamorros and \n     Carolinians of the Northern Mariana Islands their right of \n     local self-government and to govern themselves with respect \n     to internal affairs in accordance with a Constitution of \n     their own adoption; and\n       Whereas, S. 744, Sections 2109 B(i), (ii), (iii), (v)(I), \n     (V), and (C) will allow the alien workers, their families and \n     people of other ethnicity to become permanent residents and \n     eventually become U. S. citizens upon it becoming law. \n     According to the 2010 census these foreign people represent a \n     combined total of 38,520 or 71 percent of the Commonwealth's \n     population. Such data clearly depicts a great disparity in \n     the population profile of the Commonwealth, where the people \n     of Northern Mariana descent represent only 15,363 or 29 \n     percent of the total population of 53,883. As a consequence, \n     the Chamorros and Carolinians of the Northern Marianas \n     Islands will ultimately become powerless and minority voice \n     in their homeland. Their social, economic, and political \n     rights and all that they have aspired, bargained and worked \n     hard to achieve, pursuant to the Covenant Agreement; \n     including their rights under the Northern Mariana Islands \n     Constitution, which they wrote, adopted, and approved by the \n     President of the United State of America on October 24, 1977, \n     will undeniably be taken away from them; and\n       Whereas, Article V, Section 506 of the Covenant, which the \n     Chamorro and Carolinian people of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands agreed to, and approved, hold the same provisions as \n     those found in Section 2109 of S. 744. Sub-section (II) of \n     Section 2109 permits such alien who was, on May 8, 2008, and \n     continues to be as of the date of the enactment of this \n     paragraph, a permanent resident (as defined in section 4303 \n     of this title 3 of the Northern Mariana Islands Commonwealth \n     Code, in effect on May 8, 2008); and (III), is the spouse or \n     child (as defined in section 101(b)(1) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(b)(1))), of an alien described \n     in sub-clauses (I) or (II); and (IV), was, on May 8, 2008, an \n     immediate relative (as defined in section 4303 of title 3 of \n     the Northern Mariana Islands Commonwealth Code, in effect on \n     May 8, 2008, of a United States citizen, notwithstanding the \n     age of the United States citizen, and continues to be such an \n     immediate relative on the date of the application described \n     in subparagraph (A); and (V), is the spouse or child (as \n     defined in section 101(b)(1) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(b)(1))), of the alien guest \n     worker described in sub-clause (V) and is presently resident \n     under CW-2 status. The intent of these provisions are already \n     permitted under Section 506 of Article 5 of the Covenant \n     Agreement, notwithstanding Sections 2109B(i), (ii), (iii), \n     (v)(I), (V), and (C) (Long-term Legal Residents of the \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands) of S.744; and\n       Whereas, Section 2109 ((Long-Term Legal Residents of the \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands) of S. 744 is \n     amending Article V, Section 506 of the Covenant by including \n     Section 2109 B(i), (ii), (iii), (v)(I), (V), and (C) to allow \n     alien workers, their families, and people of other ethnic \n     origin, who were counted and described in the CNMI's 2010 \n     Census, to become permanent residents and eventually become \n     U. S. citizens. Clearly, this Act violates the fundamental \n     provisions delineated in Article I, Sections 105 and other \n     provisions of the Covenant; and\n       Whereas, the House of Representatives of the 18th Northern \n     Marianas Commonwealth Legislature recognizes the importance \n     of granting improved status to the few stateless persons who \n     were born in the Northern Mariana Islands between January 1, \n     1974 and January 9, 1978 (Section 2109 B(v)(I)); however, the \n     granting of permanent resident status to foreign persons \n     delineated in Section 2109 B(i), (ii), (iii), (V), and (C) of \n     S.744,\n\n[[Page S654]]\n\n     should and must go through the established process, pursuant \n     to the Immigration and Nationality Act. Therefore, the \n     Northern Marianas Commonwealth Legislature disagrees with and \n     is strongly opposed to the inclusion of the Commonwealth of \n     the Northern Mariana Islands in S.744, under Section 2109 \n     (Long-Term Legal Residents of the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands); and\n       Whereas, Article V, Section 503(a) of the Covenant \n     authorizes the United States Congress to make applicable to \n     the Northern Mariana Islands the immigration and \n     naturalization law of the United States after the termination \n     of the Trusteeship Agreement. This was accomplished when the \n     U.S. Congress enacted the Consolidated Natural Resource Act \n     of 2008 (Public Law 110-229). However, such authority given \n     to the United States Congress under the said Article V, \n     Section 503(a) does not necessarily mean that the U.S. \n     Congress can unilaterally and arbitrarily enact immigration \n     laws and/or other bills or legislations for the Commonwealth \n     of the Northern Mariana Islands that contradicts and \n     infringes on the fundamental provisions delineated in Article \n     1, Section 105 and other provisions of the Covenant; \n     particularly, outlined in Article 1, Section 103, which \n     guarantees the indigenous people of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands the right of local self-government and to govern \n     themselves with respect to internal affairs in accordance \n     with a Constitution of their own adoption; and\n       Whereas, Article 1, Section 105 of the Covenant states: \n     ``The United States may enact legislation in accordance with \n     its constitutional processes which will be applicable to the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, but if such legislation cannot also \n     be made applicable to the several States the Northern Mariana \n     Islands must be specifically named therein for it to become \n     effective in the Northern Mariana Islands. In order to \n     respect the right of self-government guaranteed by this \n     Covenant the United States agrees to limit the exercise of \n     that authority so that the fundamental provisions of this \n     Covenant, namely Articles I, II and III and Sections 501 and \n     805, may be modified only with the consent of the Government \n     of the United States and the Government of the Northern \n     Mariana Islands''; and\n       Whereas, Section 2109 (Long-term Legal Residents of the \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands) of S. 744 \n     contradicts U.S. Public Law 110-229 (Consolidated Natural \n     Resources Act of 2008) which mandates the alien worker \n     population of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands to be zeroed out when the transition period ends on \n     Dec. 31, 2014. U.S. Public Law 110-229 (Consolidated Natural \n     Resources Act of 2008) seeks to help create jobs for the many \n     unemployed indigenous Chamorro and Carolinian people and U.S. \n     citizens who are residents in the Northern Mariana Islands, \n     who have been actively searching for work in the job market. \n     Section 2109 of S. 744, on the other hand, will deprive the \n     Chamorro and Carolinian people of Northern Marianas descent \n     and U.S. citizens who are residents of the Commonwealth of \n     employment opportunities, as alien workers and people of \n     other ethnic origin will continue to occupy and fill the \n     positions in the job market; and\n       Whereas, alien workers who are recruited for employment \n     purposes, should not, irrespective of the length of their \n     employment in the Commonwealth, be automatically entitled to \n     full social, economic, and political rights, because such \n     benefits and privileges of United States citizens were never \n     promised, bargained, entered, and/or agreed upon in their \n     employment contracts, which were approved by them and the \n     Government of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands; nor were discussions made or suggested for alien \n     workers, their families, and persons of other ethnic origin \n     to become permanent resident during the negotiation of \n     Covenant Agreement between the indigenous people of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands and the United States of America, \n     notwithstanding Section 506 of Article V of the Covenant; and\n       Whereas, the enactment of Section 2109 (Long-term Legal \n     Residents of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands) of S. 744, and/or any similar Act by Congress, will \n     dramatically change the social, economic, and political \n     landscape in the Commonwealth to the advantage of the \n     thousands of alien workers, their families and people of \n     other ethnic origin or race upon them becoming U.S. Citizens. \n     This will have a devastating effect on the social, political \n     and economic livelihood of the Chamorro and Carolinian people \n     of the Northern Mariana Islands. It will give birth to a new \n     form of foreign domination on the indigenous people once \n     again, but this time, sadly, it evolves from within the \n     Commonwealth by way of Section 2109 (Long-term Legal \n     Residents of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands); and\n       Whereas, the enactment of Section 2109 of S. 744, and/or \n     any similar legislations by Congress will place the \n     Carolinian and Chamorro people of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands back in time, trapped under a new form of foreign \n     domination once again, and a direct violation of the Covenant \n     Agreement, and the mandates of the Trusteeship Agreement \n     which was agreed upon by the United States and the United \n     Nation Security Council, including the Charter of the United \n     Nation which obligates the United States ``to promote the \n     development of the people of the trust territory toward self-\n     government or independence as may be appropriate to the \n     particular circumstances of the trust territory and its \n     peoples and the freely expressed wishes of the peoples \n     concerned''. The enactment of Section 2109 and/or other \n     similar act or legislations by Congress is a direct \n     contradiction to the freely expressed wishes of the Chamorro \n     and Carolinian people of the Northern Marianas Islands when \n     they exercised their inalienable right of self-determination \n     and negotiated the Covenant Agreement with the United States \n     of America--to be free from foreign domination, and to be \n     recognized as a people of the Northern Mariana Islands, with \n     ``the right of local self-government and to govern themselves \n     in accordance with a Constitution of their own adoption; and\n       Whereas, Section 2109 of S. 744, and/or any similar Act \n     currently before both houses of the U.S. Congress for \n     consideration, or are being proposed will create alarming \n     concerns to the Chamorro and Carolinian people of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, thus affecting the relationship \n     between them and the United States; therefore, the 18th \n     Northern Marianas Commonwealth Legislature urged the U.S. \n     Congress that any and all propose legislations that infringes \n     upon the social, economic and political rights of the \n     indigenous Chamorro and Carolinian people who are of Northern \n     Marianas descent, who called for, negotiated, and voted \n     favorably in support of the Covenant, must be addressed \n     pursuant to Article 1, Section 105 and Section 902 of the \n     Covenant; and\n       Whereas, Section 902 of Article IX states in part: ``The \n     Government of the United States and the Government of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands will consult regularly on all \n     matters affecting the relationship between them''. . . ``to \n     consider in good faith such issues affecting the relationship \n     between the Northern Mariana Islands and the United States as \n     may be designated by either Government and to make \n     recommendations with respect thereto'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the 18th \n     Northern Marianas Commonwealth Legislature respectfully \n     request and urge the House of Representatives of the 113th \n     United States Congress to eliminate Section 2109 (Long-Term \n     Legal Residents of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands) of S. 744, and any similar legislation that is \n     currently before both houses of the U.S. Congress undergoing \n     review for consideration until such legislative intent for \n     the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is discussed \n     pursuant to Article 1, Section 105 and Article IX, Section \n     902 of the Covenant to Establish the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Marianas in Political Union with the United States \n     of America; and to recognize, respect and take into serious \n     consideration the mandates of the Trusteeship Agreement which \n     was agreed upon by the United States; and the United Nation \n     Security Council, including the United States obligation \n     under the Charter of the United Nation as stipulated in the \n     House Joint Resolution No. 549--to approve the ``Covenant To \n     Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in \n     Political Union with the United States of America''; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the Speaker of the House shall certify, and \n     the Clerk of the House shall attest to the adoption of this \n     resolution. The Clerk of the House shall transmit a certified \n     copy of this Resolution to the Honorable Joseph R. Biden, \n     Jr., President of the Senate, 113th United States Congress; \n     the Honorable John Boehner, Speaker of the House, 113th \n     United States Congress; the Honorable Gregorio ``Kilili'' \n     Sablan, CNM1 Delegate to the 113th United States Congress; \n     the U.

A bill to protect consumers by requiring reasonable security \npolicies and procedures to protect data containing personal \ninformation, and to provide for nationwide notice in the event of a \nbreach of security; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Data \nSecurity and Breach Notification Act of 2014. I introduce this bill \nwith my good friend, Senator Feinstein, Chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, as well as Senators Pryor and Nelson, valued Subcommittee \nChairmen on the Senate Commerce Committee. I want to express my \nparticular gratitude to Senator Pryor for his work on this issue. He \nhas long been the champion of data security legislation on the Commerce \nCommittee, and his well-known commitment and expertise on this issue, \nas well as his support of our current bill, have proven to be \nindispensable.\n  While the recent breaches at Target and Neiman Marcus have made \nheadlines, these breaches are nothing new. Data breaches have happened \nbefore, and they will inevitably occur in the future. Understanding \nthis, there is much more that can be done to prevent breaches and, when \nthey occur, respond to them.\n  Similarly, the concepts in today's bill are not new and have been \nconsidered by Congress before. The bill that Senators Feinstein, Pryor, \nNelson, and I introduce today is not a significant departure from the \nbill that Senator Pryor and I introduced in the past two Congresses. \nLike the earlier bills, it is predicated on basic principles: companies \nshould adopt strong security protocols to protect consumers' personal \ninformation; they should quickly notify affected consumers in the event \nof a breach; and the Federal Trade Commission, FTC, and State attorneys \ngeneral should be empowered to fully enforce the law. With those \nprinciples as a framework, the bill we introduce today has four key \nelements.\n  First, it directs the FTC to promulgate rules establishing robust \ndata security protocols that companies and nonprofits must adopt when \ncollecting and storing consumers' personal information. These rules \nwill be strong, but they will also be flexible. We recognize that \nsecurity measures for a large multi-billion-dollar corporation may not \nbe appropriate for a small business. As such, the Commission is \nrequired to consider the impact on small businesses and other \nmitigating factors in developing its rules.\n  Second, the bill requires breached companies to notify affected \nconsumers unless there is no reasonable risk of identity theft, fraud, \nor other unlawful conduct. In so doing, the breached company must also \nprovide those consumers with free credit reports. If companies adopt \nadvanced technologies that render their personal data unreadable, \nindecipherable, or otherwise unusable, there is a rebuttable \npresumption that no risk to consumers exists. The FTC, in consultation \nwith the National Institute of Standards and Technology, shall \nestablish guidelines identifying the technologies that would qualify \nfor this rebuttable presumption.\n  Third, the bill will establish a two-pronged enforcement system, \nwhereby the FTC and state Attorneys General are afforded not only \ntraditional equitable remedies but civil penalty authority as well. \nMoreover, the bill makes it a criminal offense for anyone to knowingly \nconceal a data breach.\n  Lastly, our bill will require companies to report data breaches to a \ndesignated Federal government entity as established by the Department \nof Homeland Security. This entity will serve as a central repository \nfor information on all data breaches of a certain magnitude and will, \nin turn, notify other relevant Federal and law enforcement agencies, \nsuch as the Department of Justice, Secret Service, FTC, and affected \nState Attorneys General.\n  I would like to note that, while the impetus behind introducing this \nbill is to provide consumers with the strongest protections possible, \nthe bill will also provide businesses with regulatory certainty--\nsomething they currently lack. Our bill will finally codify into \nregulation what the FTC is already doing; that is, the Commission has a \nlong history of bringing enforcement\n\n[[Page S657]]\n\nactions against companies for negligent data security practices as \nviolations of the FTC Act's broad prohibition against ``unfair or \ndeceptive acts or practices.'' Indeed, the Commission is currently \nembroiled in numerous data breach cases. The FTC's new data security \nrules mandated by our bill will finally provide more explicit detail to \nindustry regarding the rules of the road. Importantly, the bill will \ncreate one set of Federal rules; it will preempt State laws with regard \nto data security and breach notification so that companies no longer \nhave to operate under a patchwork of differing state laws.\n  Notwithstanding my frustration over Congress's decade-long failure to \npass meaningful data security legislation, I remain hopeful that this \nyear will be different. The American public is demanding that we do \nsomething about a problem that is only getting worse. As I noted \nearlier in my remarks, there will be more data breaches in the future--\nit is inevitable. And the consequences are not trivial. Not only do \nthese data breaches impose potentially devastating financial \nconsequences on consumers who are victimized by identity theft and \nother financial fraud, these breaches also threaten basic consumer \nprivacy. Companies continue to collect, aggregate, and house an \nunfathomable amount of personal information about all of us. These same \ncompanies must guard that information with the highest of security \nstandards. While I am not naive to think our bill will prevent all data \nbreaches of the future, I am confident that it will go a long way \ntowards pushing companies to do more--much more. And it will finally \nprovide consumers with peace of mind that--when a breach does occur--\nthey will be notified as soon as possible so they may take the \nnecessary steps to protect themselves.\n  I thank Senators Feinstein, Pryor, and Nelson for helping me on this \nimportant bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/30/senate-section/article/S657-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 342--DESIGNATING FEBRUARY 3 THROUGH 7, 2014, AS \n                  ``NATIONAL SCHOOL COUNSELING WEEK''\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Levin, Mr. Cornyn, Ms. \nKlobuchar, Mr. Cardin, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Durbin) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed \nto.:\n\n                              S.
