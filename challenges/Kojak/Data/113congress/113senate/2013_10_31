Mr. President, October 31 has always been a special day for \nme, since it marks the admission of the great State of Nevada to the \nUnion. There are always parades and celebrations at home, many of which \nI have sadly missed in recent years because of my responsibilities \nhere.\n  But October 31 is special for another reason, and not just that it is \nHalloween. It is my brother's birthday--my youngest brother, 22 months \nyounger than I. My brother Larry, who lives in Searchlight, celebrates \nanother birthday today. It is my pleasure to wish both my brother and \nthe Silver State of Nevada a very happy birthday.\n  Nevada Day is particularly special as it marks the beginning of a \nyear-long celebration of our 150th anniversary of the Battle Born \nState's entrance into the Union.\n  For thousands of years Nevada was the home to Nevada American \npeoples. I have in my office across the hall a wonderful painting by a \nNevadan which shows the first non-Indian to see the Las Vegas Valley. \nYou can see there the Sunrise Mountain and glimpses of the oases that \nwere there. There were a number of them in that valley. He was the \nfirst non-Indian to see the valley a long time ago. He is in the \npicture mounted on his beautiful horse with all his fancy regalia. But \nthe fact is the picture doesn't begin to show what Rafael Rivera looked \non that day, because he had been lost. He was with the Spanish \nExpedition and he was lost. He was there by accident. It is a wonderful \npicture, and we honor Rafael Rivera in Nevada. So it is a special day \nfor us in Nevada.\n  On October 31, 1864, right in the middle of the Civil War, Nevada \nbecame\n\n[[Page S7690]]\n\nthe 36th State of the Union. Nevada is only one of two States to join \nthe Union during the war. The first was West Virginia, which seceded \nfrom Virginia to form a new State and remain part of the Union. It \ngained its statehood before Nevada, on June 30, 1863.\n  Union sympathizers had rushed to finalize Nevada's statehood in order \nto ensure Lincoln's reelection--because, remember, this is right before \nhis reelection. In fact, they were so eager to mint a State they \ntelegraphed the new Nevada constitution to Congress. At that time, it \nwas the longest telegram ever sent--coming in at 16,543 words and \ncosting $59,294.92. Eight days later, President Lincoln was reelected \nPresident of the United States.\n  Nevada is only one of two States to significantly expand its borders \nafter its admission to the Union. Eastern and southern Nevada joined \nthe State in the late 1860s after gold was discovered in the regions. \nMany Nevadans believe the State was only allowed to join the Union so \nits mineral riches could help fund the northern war effort, but in \ntruth that is a myth. It is not true. The tale probably stems from the \nfact that the Nevada Territory was created in 1861 so its gold and \nsilver could be used to help the Union rather than the Confederacy. So \nthe State's slogan, Battle Born--a reference to the war--and an \nerroneous episode of ``Bonanza,'' which depicted a constitutional \nconvention in Carson City I guess helped cement the legend.\n  The 150th anniversary of our admission to the Union is a wonderful \ntime to study and reflect in this shared history we have as States and \nas a nation. It is also time to build a foundation for another 150 \nyears of innovation and accomplishment for our State.\n  Nevada--from the mountains and high deserts of the east, to the \ngeothermal wells of the north, including Lake Tahoe to the west, of \ncourse, to southern Nevada with the Las Vegas strip, from Indian \nCountry to the mining towns and ranching communities--is a unique State \nin today's modern Union.\n  I like to say that people don't understand Nevada is more than the \nbright lights of Las Vegas. From the glittering waters of Lake Tahoe, \nNevada is the most mountainous State in the Union, except for Alaska. \nWe have more than 300 mountain ranges. Other than Alaska, it is the \nmost dangerous place to fly a private plane because of the weather \npatterns which develop so quickly. I have been involved as I have flown \nin some of the smaller airplanes around the State.\n  We have magnificent wildlife. We have the famous bighorn sheep, we \nhave mountain goats, the largest antelope range in the world. We have 1 \nmountain almost 14,000 feet high, and we have 32 mountains over 11,000 \nfeet high. It is a magnificent State, and I am so fortunate to be able \nto represent that State--the State where I was born.\n  So today and throughout this special year we should celebrate \neverything that makes Nevada extraordinary and successful.\n  Happy Nevada Day, Nevadans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/31/senate-section/article/S7690-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING CARL FRITTER\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to take a minute to congratulate a \nman who has been part of the Senate for a long time. With more than \nfour decades of service to the Federal Government and some 32 years \nhere in the Senate, a man by the name of Carl Fritter will retire \ntoday. He began his career at the Government Printing Office and gave \n44 years of service to the Federal Government. He is respected by his \ncolleagues in the Secretary's Office and admired throughout the Senate \ncommunity for his craftsmanship. Carl learned the art of bookbinding as \nan apprentice in the Government Printing Office. He received special \ntraining in bookbinding from experts across the globe.\n  In 1977, Carl was detailed to the Senate Library, where he eventually \nbecame Director of the Office of Conservation and Preservation. My son, \nduring one of the summers, worked in that office, and that was a great \nexperience. There he got to know Carl.\n  In addition to binding and repairing books, he has built many \nbeautiful boxes and other things. He is a modern-day artisan. It is \namazing the things he has built and can build. He has built, for \nexample, boxes to contain gavels, books, and other works of art. Later \ntoday when we swear in the new junior Senator from New Jersey, the oath \nbook Vice President Biden will use to swear in Senator-elect Booker was \nmade by Carl Fritter.\n  I wish him the very best in his retirement. He is going to go to Key \nWest, FL, where he wants to spend more time there with his wife Bunny \nand his children and grandchildren. I thank Carl for his decades of \ndedicated service to this institution and the Federal Government, and \ncongratulate him on a career of success building and preserving \nartifacts here in the U.S. Capitol.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/31/senate-section/article/S7690-2", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to say a few words of thanks \nthis morning to a member of the Senate family who is leaving us today. \nAfter 44 years of government service, including 32 here in the Senate, \nCarl Fritter has decided it is time to go.\n  Carl has been a real friend to my office over the years, through his \nwork in the Office of Conservation and Preservation, and we are sorry \nto see him leave us. But before he does, I want to say how grateful we \nare for his outstanding work over the years.\n  Carl learned the art of bookbinding in an apprentice program at the \nGovernment Printing Office many years ago. He says he never saw himself \nas a bookbinder, but after working outside one January during the \nconstruction of the Kennedy Center, he started thinking about getting a \njob indoors, and his supervisors over at the GPO gave him the \nopportunity. Carl would learn his trade from bookbinders from all over \nthe world, each of whom taught him different techniques, which he put \nto good use in the Senate Library for many years.\n  In 1990, the Office of Conservation and Preservation was created. \nCarl was named Director 4 years later.\n  In addition to binding and repairing books, Carl taught himself a lot \nof other crafts. I am told he makes some pretty amazing decorative \nboxes, bowls, gavels, and books. One of Carl's most memorable projects \nwas a fall-down box that he built as a gift for Margaret Thatcher. It \nwas a box that opened to reveal a plate in the middle, with two \ncongressional resolutions on either side. I am sure Prime Minister \nThatcher loved it.\n  Carl, thank you for lending us your talents for so long and for \ngiving so much of your life to this institution. We wish you and Bunny \nall the best in your retirement. I am sure you will enjoy passing down \nyour skills to your grandkids. They will have a great teacher. But the \nentire Senate community will miss your craftsmanship and your \ncommitment to excellence, and we will miss your friendship.\n  Carl, thank you very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/31/senate-section/article/S7690-4", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7690-S7692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             FAMILY FRIENDLY AND WORKPLACE FLEXIBILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, given that October is National Work and \nFamily Month, I wish to take the opportunity to discuss an issue that \nhas become increasingly important to working families, and that is the \nneed for workplace flexibility.\n  Yesterday my colleague Senator Ayotte and I introduced the Family \nFriendly and Workplace Flexibility Act of 2013, which we hope will \nprovide America's workers with the flexible work arrangements they \nneed. Countless Americans have become increasingly familiar over the \npast several years with the same reality: more and more to do, with \nless and less time to do it. And while Congress can't legislate another \nhour in the day, we can help working Americans better balance the \ndemands of work and family.\n  The Family Friendly and Workplace Flexibility Act is a commonsense \nmeasure Congress can pass to help alleviate that burden for millions of \nfamilies by providing greater flexibility in managing their time. We \nall know working moms who are stretched between a job and supporting \ntheir kids,\n\n[[Page S7691]]\n\nand baby boomers with elderly parents who require care and attention. A \n2010 study conducted by the White House Council of Economic Advisers \nfound that work flexibility programs can ``reduce turnover and improve \nrecruitment, [increase] the productivity of an employer's workforce, \nand are associated with improved employee health and decreased \nabsenteeism.''\n  Another study conducted by the Society for Human Resource Managers \nfound that women's responsibilities have increased at work and men's \nresponsibilities have increased at home, resulting in 60 percent of \nwage and salaried employees believing they do not have enough time to \nspend with their loved ones. The American workplace has evolved \ndramatically since the industrial workplace of the post-Depression era. \nYet the labor laws written during this time period are still in place \ntoday and the makeup of our workforce has also changed dramatically.\n  Today, 60 percent of working households have two working parents. \nSixty-six percent of single moms and 79 percent of single dads work as \nwell. American workers have had to adapt to keep pace with this \nchanging environment. So should our laws. Instead of sticking with an \nantiquated labor law, I believe we need to update the Fair Labor \nStandards Act to actually meet the changing needs of workers.\n  That is why I am introducing the Family Friendly and Workplace \nFlexibility Act.\n  This bill will allow flexible workplace arrangements such as \ncompensatory time and flexible credit hour agreements, which are \ncurrently available to employees working for the Federal Government--\nFederal employees already have this--to be extended to businesses \nregulated by the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n  Currently, the FLSA prohibits employers from offering compensatory \ntime or comptime to their hourly employees. This bill would amend the \nFLSA to allow private employers to offer comptime to employees at a \nrate of 1\\1/2\\ hours for every hour of overtime work. I should add that \nthis would be a completely voluntary process. An employee could still \nchoose to receive monetary payments as their overtime compensation. \nThis bill simply allows the option for employees to choose paid time \noff over work instead. There is no need for Washington to stand in the \nway of families earning the time that they need.\n  This bill also institutes a flexible credit-hour program under which \nthe employer and employee can enter into agreements that allow the \nemployee to work excess hours, beyond the typical number of hours he or \nshe is typically required to work, in order to accrue hours to be taken \noff at a later time. This option is for employees who do not get the \nopportunity to work overtime, but still want a way to build up hours to \nuse as paid leave. Like comptime, this program is voluntary and may not \naffect collective bargaining agreements that are in place.\n  Under this legislation, employers would not be mandated to offer \nflexible workplace arrangements, just as employees are not mandated to \nchoose their benefits, rather than direct compensation for overtime \nwork. Both parties are free to choose what works best for them.\n  I would like to take a moment to focus on some of the protections in \nthe bill. Under this bill, an employee may accrue up to 160 hours of \ncomptime per year. At any point in the year, a participating employee \nmay request to revert back to receiving traditional overtime \ncompensation in exchange for their accrued comptime, essentially \ncashing out their banked time. Further, the bill also requires \nemployers to provide monetary payment at the end of the year for any \nunused comptime or flextime.\n  I have also included a provision that safeguards unpaid comptime and \nflextime in the case of bankruptcy. Thus, the bill takes steps to \nprotect against any potential for lost wages in these kinds of \ncircumstances.\n  If anyone understands the benefits of comptime, it is our public \nemployees. That is because flexible work arrangements have been \navailable to Federal employees since 1978. If the Federal law already \nprovides these beneficial workplace arrangements to Federal and State \nworkers, why should we not make them available to all employees? Public \nemployees enjoy these arrangements so much that the unions representing \nthem frequently fight for comptime arrangements when negotiating \ncollective bargaining agreements.\n  It is very important to note this legislation does not do anything to \nalter the 40-hour work week. Let me repeat that: This bill in no way \nalters a 40-hour work week or how overtime is calculated.\n  Another way in which the Family Friendly and Workplace Flexibility \nAct protects employees is by prohibiting employers from coercing \nemployees into accepting or rejecting comptime or flextime \narrangements.\n  When we look at today's modern workplace, we see some companies such \nas Dell, Bank of America, and GE that already provide flexible \nworkplace arrangements to their salaried employees who are not subject \nto the rules under FLSA. Perhaps it is no coincidence that workplaces \nsuch as these are also among the highest-ranked companies at which to \nwork.\n  Now is the time to allow private companies to provide the benefits of \nflexible arrangements like comptime to their nonexempt workers as well. \nAfter all, it is not just workers at some places of employment who are \nparents or family members who need to be able to take time off to \nattend a function for their child's school, to see a son or daughter's \nsupporting event, or to care for an aging parent. It is workers at all \nplaces of employment.\n  A report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers shows that \nnearly one-third of all American workers consider work-life balance and \nflexibility to be the most important factor in considering job offers.\n  Let me say that again. Nearly one-third of all American workers \nconsider work-life balance and flexibility to be the most important \nfactor in considering job offers.\n  It also shows that 66 percent of human resource managers cite family-\nsupportive policies and flexible hours as the single most important \nfactor in attracting and retaining employees. These numbers are pretty \ntelling.\n  I am pleased that the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce has endorsed this \nlegislation. I also thank my friend Congresswoman Martha Roby for her \nleadership and dedication in advancing this cause over in the House. \nShe introduced a bill to accomplish similar ends as the Family Friendly \nand Workforce Flexibility Act and actually saw her bill to passage. Now \nit is time for the Senate to act.\n  The effort to provide greater flexibility and support for families in \nthe workplace is one I have long supported. I have previously supported \nlegislation allowing flexible workplace arrangements. This is the fifth \ntime I have sponsored legislation to establish comptime, and I am proud \nto continue that fight today.\n  I consider myself very fortunate to be joined by Senator Ayotte in \nthis effort. I suspect her predecessor, former Senator Judd Gregg, \nwould be proud to see her leadership on this issue as well. Senator \nGregg was a champion for flexible work arrangements throughout his \nentire Senate career, I was thankful to work with him on the issue in \nthe past, and I am gratified to work with Senator Ayotte on this issue \nmoving forward.\n  Yesterday Senator Lee introduced a similar measure that seeks to \nprovide for comptime for American workers. Senator Lee is helping with \nthe effort, working with conservatives to find out-of-the-box solutions \nto the challenges Americans face today. I applaud Senator Lee for his \ncommitment to this effort and look forward to working with him in the \nfuture on this issue.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport this commonsense bill because it is the right thing to do for \nworking families.\n\n\n                           Millett Nomination\n\n  Finally, I will be voting against cloture on the Millett nomination, \nand I would like to discuss why. Ms. Millett is no doubt a fine person. \nThis is nothing personal.\n  Peter Keisler, of course, is a fine person too. But our Democratic \ncolleagues pocket-filibustered his nomination to the DC Circuit for 2 \nyears on the grounds that the court's workload did not warrant his \nconfirmation. They did so despite his considerable skill as a\n\n[[Page S7692]]\n\nlawyer and his personal qualities. His nomination languished until the \nend of the Bush administration. He waited almost 1,000 days for a vote \nthat never came.\n  The criteria our Democratic friends cited to block Mr. Keisler's \nnomination then clearly show the court is even less busy now. For \nexample, the seat to which Ms. Millett is nominated is not a judicial \nemergency--far from it. The number of appeals at the court is down \nalmost 20 percent, and the written decisions per active judge are down \nalmost 30 percent.\n  In addition to these metrics, the DC Circuit has provided another. \nThe chief judge of the court, who was appointed to the bench by \nPresident Clinton, provided an analysis showing that oral arguments for \neach active judge are also down almost 10 percent since Mr. Keisler's \nnomination was blocked.\n  These analyses show that not only is the court less busy in absolute \nterms now than it was then, it is less busy in relative terms as well, \nwhen one takes into account the number of active judges serving on the \ncourt. The court's caseload is so low, in fact, that it has canceled \noral argument days in recent years because of lack of cases. After we \nconfirmed the President's last nominee to the DC Circuit just a few \nmonths ago--and by the way we confirmed him unanimously--one of the \njudges on the court said that if more judges were confirmed there would \nnot be enough work to go around. So if the court's caseload clearly \ndoes not meet their own standards for more judges, why are Senate \nDemocrats pushing to fill more seats on a court that doesn't need them? \nWhat is behind this push to fill seats on the court that is canceling \noral argument days for lack of cases, and according to the judges who \nserve on it will not have enough work to go around if we do?\n  We don't have to guess. Our Democratic colleagues and the \nadministration's supporters have been actually pretty candid about it. \nThey have admitted they want to control the court so it will advance \nthe President's agenda. As one administration ally put it, ``The \nPresident's best hope for advancing his agenda is through executive \naction, and that runs through the DC Circuit.''\n  Let me repeat, the reason they want to put more judges on the DC \nCircuit is not because it needs them, but because ``The President's \nbest hope for advancing his agenda is through executive action, and \nthat runs through the DC Circuit.''\n  Another administration ally complained that the court ``has made \ndecisions that have frustrated the President's agenda.'' Really? The \ncourt is evenly divided between Republican and Democratic appointees. \nAccording to data compiled by the Federal courts, the DC Circuit has \nruled against the Obama administration in administrative matters less \noften than it ruled against the Bush administration.\n  Let me say that again. According to data compiled by the Federal \ncourts, the DC Circuit has ruled against the Obama administration in \nadministrative matters less often than it ruled against the Bush \nadministration. So it is not that the court has been more unfavorable \nto President Obama than it was to President Bush. Rather, the \nadministration and its allies seem to be complaining that the court has \nnot been favorable enough. Evidently they do not want any meaningful \ncheck on the President. You see, there is one in the House of \nRepresentatives, but the administration can circumvent that with \naggressive agency rulemaking. That is if the DC Circuit allows it to do \nso.\n  A court should not be a rubberstamp for any administration, and our \nDemocratic colleagues told us again and again during the Bush \nadministration that the Senate confirmation process should not be a \nrubberstamp for any administration. For example, they said President \nBush's nomination of Miguel Estrada to the DC Circuit was ``an effort \nto pack the Federal courts.'' And they filibustered his nomination--\nseven times, in fact.\n  We have confirmed nearly all of President Obama's judicial nominees. \nAs I said, we confirmed a judge to the DC Circuit unanimously just a \nfew months ago. This year we have confirmed 34 circuit and district \ncourt judges. At this time in President Bush's second term the Senate \nhad confirmed only 14.\n  Let me say that again. This year we have confirmed 34 circuit and \ndistrict court judges. At this time in President Bush's second term the \nSenate had confirmed only 14 of those nominees. In fact, we confirmed \nPresident Obama's nominees even during the Government shutdown.\n  In writing to then-Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter to \noppose the nomination of Peter Keisler, Senate Democrats said:\n\n       Mr. Keisler should under no circumstances be considered--\n     much less confirmed . . . before we first address the very \n     need for the judgeship . . . and deal with the genuine \n     judicial emergencies identified by the judicial conference.\n  That course of action ought to be followed here too. Senator Grassley \nhas legislation that will allow the President to fill seats on courts \nthat actually need judges. The Senate should support that legislation, \nnot transparent efforts to politicize a court that doesn't need judges \nin an effort to create a rubberstamp for the administration's agenda.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/31/senate-section/article/S7692-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that an \nofficial letter of resignation as mayor of Newark, NJ, from Senator-\nelect Cory Booker of New Jersey be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   Newark, NJ,\n\n                                                 October 30, 2013.\n     Robert P. Marasco,\n     City Clerk, City of Newark, Broad Street, Newark, NJ.\n       Dear Mr. Marasco: Serving as the mayor of Newark, New \n     Jersey has been one of the greatest honors of my life. Since \n     taking office more than seven years ago, I've had the \n     privilege to work closely with countless residents, municipal \n     employees, elected officials, community leaders and others to \n     move Newark forward. It was not easy, but together, we have \n     brought incredible positive change to our city and set the \n     stage for this momentum to continue in the coming years.\n       On Thursday, October 31, 2013 at noon, I will be sworn in \n     as one of New Jersey's United States Senators. Therefore, \n     effective Thursday, October 31, 2013 at 12:00 a.m., I am \n     officially resigning as mayor of Newark.\n       While I am leaving one position, I am not leaving Newark. I \n     am proud to be able to now represent Newark and our entire \n     state as a United States Senator. My level of dedication, \n     passion and service will not falter as I serve New Jersey. \n     Our best days lie ahead, and together, we will continue to \n     achieve great things.\n       The work goes on.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Cory A. Booker,\n                                                            Mayor.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the statement that \nwas just made by the Republican leader. It is a shame what is about to \noccur on the Senate floor if he has his way. The President has \nsubmitted the name of a nominee to serve on the DC Circuit Court. This \nis not just another court. Some view it as the second most important \ncourt in the land. Some of the most technical and challenging legal \ncases come before this court. The judges who serve there are called on \nnot just to do routine things but to do extraordinary things on a \nregular basis. That is why the appointments to this court are so \ncritically needed when\n\n[[Page S7693]]\n\nit comes to maintaining the integrity of our Federal judiciary.\n  What I heard from the Senate Republican leader was a statement that \nhe would vote against the nomination of Patricia Ann Millett, President \nObama's nominee for the vacancy on the court.\n  There are 11 judges authorized for this court. Currently, only eight \nare serving. There are three vacancies. Ms. Millett is being suggested \nfor the ninth seat out of the 11 that are authorized. I am not going to \ngo back into the history of our exchanges when it comes to the \nappointment of judges. I can make as compelling a case, if not more \ncompelling, than that just made by the Senator from Kentucky.\n  At the end of the day those who are witnessing this will say it is \nanother he said versus he said. What are these politicians up to? Who \nis right? Who is wrong? What I would suggest is, don't take my word for \nit and don't take the word of the Senator from Kentucky. Take the word \nof the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  On April 5 the Judicial Conference of the United States, led by Chief \nJustice John Roberts, made its Federal judgeship recommendations for \nthis Congress. The Judicial Conference is not Republican or Democratic; \nit is nonpartisan. According to its letter, its recommendations reflect \nthe judgeship needs of the Federal judiciary. The Judicial Conference, \nwhich judges the caseload and workload in the Federal courts, did not \nreach the same conclusion as the Senator from Kentucky. They didn't \ntell us we need fewer judges on the DC Circuit Court--not at all. It is \nincumbent upon us to fill those vacancies, and that is where we should \nbe today.\n  Let me add one additional note. What is especially troubling about \nwhat they are going to do to this fine woman is the fact that she is so \nextraordinarily well qualified. She may hold a record of having been an \nadvocate and argued before the U.S. Supreme Court some 32 times. She \nhas received the endorsement of both Democratic and Republican \nSolicitors General. Those are the lawyers who represent the United \nStates of America before that Court across the street, and her \nnomination is strongly supported by prominent former Republican \nSolicitors General.\n  So the notion that the Senator from Kentucky suggests--that this is \nsome partisan gambit--is completely destroyed by her letters of \nrecommendation from Republicans as well as Democrats who have served as \nSolicitor General and have witnessed her fine work. This is about \nputting the right person in the job on one of the most important courts \nin the land, and sadly, unless the position of the minority leader of \nthe Senate is not the position of all Republican Senators, she may \nsuffer from this partisan approach to the appointment of this vacancy. \nWhat a sad outcome for a fine woman who has done so well as a \nprofessional advocate before appellate courts, has been recommended on \na bipartisan basis--the highest recommendations--and now, after \nlanguishing on the calendar, is going to be dismissed. She didn't fit \ninto the political game plan. That is awful.\n  The men and women who step forward and submit their applications to \nbecome part of our Federal judiciary know they are going to be \ncarefully scrutinized and criticized for some things in their past, but \nthey do it anyway in the name of public service. What I hear from the \nSenator from Kentucky is that she doesn't fit into the political game \nplan on the other side of the aisle. I hope there are enough Republican \nSenators who will disagree with the Senator from Kentucky. We should \ngive Patricia Ann Millett an opportunity to serve on the DC Circuit \nCourt as quickly as possible.\n  I know there are others on the floor, and I want to make sure \neveryone has time to say what is on their mind today because there are \nimportant issues before us, but I do want to make one brief comment \nabout another issue.\n\n\n                 Expiration of Stimulus Funds for SNAP\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 2 days ago Kate Maehr of the Greater \nChicago Food Depository came to visit me in my office. Kate is one of \nmy favorite people. Kate runs this huge network of food distribution in \nthe Chicagoland area. Her warehouses are huge, and they are filled with \nfoodstuffs, much of which is donated by companies that produce food so \nthat it can be distributed in food pantries and other sources all \naround the Chicagoland area. Kate is one of the best, and I look \nforward to her visits each year because I know the fine work she does \nto feed the hungry.\n  Two days ago she came into my office very sad.\n  She said: I don't know what we are going to do.\n  I said: What is the matter?\n  She said: This Friday the increase in food stamps, or SNAP benefits, \nfor the poor people who live in the greater Chicagoland area is going \nto be cut. It may be only $10 or $15, but I know these people, I know \nmany of them personally, and they live so close to the edge. It will \ncall for some sacrifice on their part, and many of them will be hard-\npressed to make that sacrifice, and I can't make up the difference. \nWith all of the donations and all of the charitable contributions, I \njust can't make up the difference.\n  I thought about it for a minute. I thought, how would you approach a \nMember of the Senate or the House of Representatives and say: You know, \nthis cutback of $15 a month will really hurt. It is hard for us, in our \npositions in life, to really understand or identify with the plight and \nthe struggle of those who are not certain where their next meal is \ncoming from.\n  Most of those people have the benefit of the SNAP program, the food \nstamp program. Well, who are these people? Who are these 48 million \nAmericans who receive benefits from this program? Almost 1 million of \nthem are veterans. Veterans who are not sure where their next meal is \ncoming from get food stamps--SNAP benefits. Almost half of the 48 \nmillion are children. There are 22 million children and another 9 \nmillion who are elderly and disabled. When we talk about cuts in the \nSNAP program, we are talking about these people--the veterans, \nchildren, the elderly, and the disabled.\n  Right now there are two proposals before us. One proposal is from the \nSenate, and that cuts back spending on this program to the tune of $4 \nbillion over 10 years. I supported it because I think it closes the \npotential for abuse. I don't want to waste a penny of Federal \ntaxpayers' money on any program in any way, shape, or form. Senator \nStabenow, chairman of the Senate agriculture committee, made this \nchange in the food stamp program that will save us $4 billion and will \nnot create hardship. In fact, it closes what may be a loophole.\n  Now comes the House of Representatives, and their view is much \ndifferent. They want to cut some $40 billion--10 times as much--over \nthe next 10 years. When we take a look at the approach they are using \nfor these cuts--10 times the amount cut by the Senate--we understand \nhow they get their so-called savings. They take almost 4 million--3.8 \nmillion--people out of the program: children, single mothers, \nunemployed veterans, and Americans who get temporary help from the food \nstamp program. The House would cut $19 billion and 1.7 million people \nfrom SNAP by eliminating the authority of Governors of both political \nparties to ask for waivers so that low-income childless adults under 50 \ncan still receive benefits beyond the 3 months they do ordinarily. This \nsays that Governors looking at their States with high unemployment \nunderstand that there are people in need.\n  It is hard for Members of Congress in the House or the Senate--it is \nhard for me too--to really appreciate the lifestyle of someone living \nfrom paycheck to paycheck, but that is a reality for millions of \nAmericans. Many of the people who are receiving food stamps are \nworking. That may come as a shock to people, but they are not making \nenough money to feed their families.\n  I went on a tour of a food warehouse in Champaign, IL, and had a \nnumber of people explain the importance of not only their work with \nfood pantries but the importance of the food stamp program. I noticed \none young woman who was part of the tour. I didn't quite understand why \nshe was there. She was an attractive young mother who was dressed well. \nShe explained that she had two children. I later learned why she was \nthere. She is a food stamp recipient. She has a part-time job with the \nlocal school district--not a full-\n\n[[Page S7694]]\n\ntime job--and her income is so low, she still qualifies for food \nstamps, SNAP benefits. She was there to thank me. She wanted to thank \nme not just for the food stamp program but because we changed the law a \ncouple of years ago and allow mothers like her to take their kids to \nfarmers markets and use their food stamps to buy fresh produce.\n  She said: It is almost like a trip to Disneyland for my kids. They \nhave come to know the farmers, and they look forward to meeting them \neach week. The farmers give them an extra apple or tomato or this or \nthat, and I just want to thank you. My kids are getting good food from \nfarmers markets, and it helps us make ends meet.\n  This is a single working mom with two kids. Those are the types of \npeople who are receiving food stamps and benefits. The notion that they \nare somehow lazy welfare queens--go out and meet them. Meet the woman \nat the Irving Park United Methodist Church food pantry I met who is \ntrying to live in the city of Chicago on a Social Security check that \npays her $800 a month. I challenge any Member in the Senate or House to \ntry to get by on $800 a month in the city of Chicago. She makes it \nbecause she has two food pantries that give her 3 or 4 days of food \neach and she has food stamps.\n  I will conclude by saying that what we are talking about as far as \nfood stamps is really a matter of basic hunger of children, veterans, \nelderly, and disabled who get this helping hand that makes a difference \nin their lives.\n  We are a great and caring nation. I am so proud to represent a great \nState in that Nation. We are a caring people, and caring people do not \nturn their backs on hungry kids or hungry elderly people. We better \ntake care, when it comes to this food stamp program, that we don't make \ncuts that are going to make their lives more difficult.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all speakers on \nthe Democratic side prior to noon be limited to 5 minutes each.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I don't know whether Senator Boxer was \nto be recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will take 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I understand that Senator Boxer wants 5 \nminutes, and I will yield to the fine chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee for 5 minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators on the Republican side be \nallocated 10 minutes each.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member on the Budget \nCommittee. I know he has a lot on his plate. He and I work well \ntogether, and I thank him.\n  Mr. President, I want to put on the Record my strong support for \nCongressman Mel Watt to be Director of the Federal Housing Finance \nAgency. May I do that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I hope we have a resounding vote for Mel Watt. He is a \nterrific person. He has the heart, intelligence, and the experience.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as critical decisions are being made about \nthe future of the housing finance system, it is time that we place \npermanent leadership at the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, \nFHFA. Congressman Mel Watt has both the experience and the expertise to \nhelp create a system that ensures access to safe and affordable credit \nand other housing options for all Americans.\n  Congressman Watt brings with him over 40 years of experience in \nhousing, real estate, and other financial services issues. From 1970 to \n1992, he ran a law practice focusing on business, real estate, \nmunicipal bonds, and community development, learning the details of \nhousing finance from the ground level. He was first elected to \nrepresent the 12th district of North Carolina in 1992 and has served \nover 20 years on the House Financial Services Committee. In addition, \nhis work on the House Subcommittees on Capital Markets and Government \nSponsored Enterprises, and on Financial Institutions and Consumer \nCredit has given him the necessary policy expertise to run the agency \nthat oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n  Congressman Watt's experience and expertise made him one of the first \npolicymakers to recognize how predatory underwriting practices were \nthreatening the larger housing market and economy as a whole. Years \nbefore the foreclosure crisis began, Congressman Watt, along with \nCongressman Brad Miller, introduced the Prohibit Predatory Lending Act \nin 2004. They reintroduced it every Congress after that until it was \nadopted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \nProtection Act. In March 2007, only 2 months after the Democrats became \nthe majority party in Congress, Congressman Watt joined Chairman Barney \nFrank in introducing a bill to reform regulation of Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac. The bill passed both the House and the Senate with \nbipartisan support and now called the Housing and Economic Recovery \nAct, HERA, was signed into law by President Bush in July 2008.\n  Congressman Watt also brings with him the experience and balance in \nvision to represent all stakeholders fairly, and has broad support from \nboth industry and consumer groups.\n  ``The National Association of Realtors has long appreciated \nRepresentative Watt's proven ability and willingness to engage the \nindustry, stakeholders, and consumers throughout his service in the \nHouse of Representatives. Watt has always aimed to craft policy that is \nfair, garners wide consensus, and allows all parties to move forward, \nall of which are vital qualities for the Director of the FHFA.''\n  The Mortgage Bankers of America said, ``Congressman Watt would bring \nconsiderable experience to the post of Director [and] a strong base of \nunderstanding on a wide variety of public policy issues related to \nhousing finance. . . . [W]e would urge the Senate to approve his \nnomination.''\n  The Center for Responsible Lending said, ``Watt brings to FHFA an \nability to work with a variety of stakeholders, with many competing \ninterests and perspectives. He has a track record of crafting practical \nsolutions and alliances for a complex, dynamic marketplace. He is \nconsistently thoughtful, fair, and respectful of all opinions, and his \npolicies have been guided by a concern for all Americans.''\n  The National Association of Home Builders said, ``We applaud the \nnomination of Representative Watt to this important position. After \nfour years in conservatorship, the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \nstands at a crossroad. Rep. Watt brings years of experience to this \nposition at a pivotal moment as our nation's housing market recovers. \nNAHB looks forward to working closely with Rep. Watt to help address \nthe many complex challenges facing the U.S. housing finance system upon \nhis confirmation by the U.S. Senate.''\n  The Center for American Progress said, ``We believe that Mr. Watt has \nthe vision, expertise, and experience necessary to provide strong \nleadership for FHFA. His personal background and professional \nexperience have provided him with a deep commitment to affordable \nhousing and sustainable credit, which not only support a robust housing \nmarket, but also provide shelter and opportunity for America's families \nand spur economic growth for the nation as a whole.''\n  The United States Conference of Mayors said, ``It is not surprising \nthat Representative Watt has bipartisan support in the Senate. His \nrecord shows that he can work across the political aisle finding \nsolutions to complex problems. Time and time again, mayors have been \nimpressed with his thoughtful approach in developing solutions that are \nmindful of all stakeholders. As the nation's housing market climbs back \nas a major part of our economy, we need such a leader as Mel Watt at \nthe head of FHFA.''\n  Mr. President, I ask to speak as in morning business for the rest of \nmy time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Affordable Care Act\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am so pleased to be on the floor with \nsome very good news out of California and how ObamaCare, the Affordable \nCare Act, is working in our great State. People are phoning. People are \ngoing\n\n[[Page S7695]]\n\nonline. People are talking with insurance agencies, with health \ninsurance companies. They are getting health care coverage, some for \nthe very first time, and for many for the first time it is affordable; \nall good policies--good policies that will be there when they are \nneeded.\n  We know a small percentage of people, as the President addressed \nyesterday, are being told their old policies are not going to be \noffered to them anymore, but all of those folks know they can get \nbetter policies. They can't be turned away. There will be competition \nfor their business. Many of them will get subsidies. So at the end of \nthe day, this health care story, although quite bumpy, as we know the \nprescription drug launch was years ago--we know it is bumpy, and we are \nangry on both sides of the aisle that it is bumpy--but at the end of \nthe day, I think it is going to be good.\n  I wish to read some of the comments made by people who have logged in \nto ``Covered California,'' which is coveredCA.com. Here is one who just \ngot an affordable health care policy:\n\n       Thank you so much, President Obama! And everyone who works \n     there.\n       This was soooo much easier than I thought it would be! I am \n     soooo grateful to get medical insurance! Thank you!\n\n  Another:\n\n       Great phone support, thank you. No wait time, the assistant \n     answered all my questions clearly.\n\n  Another:\n\n       GREAT JOB! EASY! WHAT'S All THE FUSS ABOUT?\n\n  Another:\n\n       Wow. This was easy and my monthly premiums are \n     significantly less than my previous employer's health care \n     coverage before the Affordable Care Act.\n\n  One who I thought truly summed it up:\n\n       Thank God Almighty I'm free at last!\n\n  These are the real people. These are not people who have a political \nagenda. They are real people. They are Democrats. They are Republicans. \nThey are Independent voters. They have had a hard time getting health \ninsurance and, because of the Affordable Care Act, with all of its \nglitches on the national Web site--and we acknowledge them--it is \nworking. It is working in our State, and eventually, once that national \nWeb site is fixed, it will work for everybody.\n  I wish to put some real numbers on this: 180,000 Californians have \nbegun the process of signing up for coverage--180,000 families. Imagine \nthe relief they have. Over 2 million unique visitors have been to \ncoveredCA.com. There have been 200,000 calls to coveredCA.com's call \ncenters. The average wait time is under 4 minutes and the average total \ncall time is less than 16 minutes for Californians enrolling in \ncoverage and asking questions. We have 4,000 insurance agents and \nclinic workers trained so far and certified. They have their badges so \nthey can offer, in person, help to those who are looking to enroll.\n  Very recently I went to a clinic in my home county and I can tell my \ncolleagues the excitement there is palpable. The doctors, the nurses, \nthe assistants, the people in the waiting room, everybody knowing they \ncan get either insurance on the exchange or insurance through an \nexpanded Medi-Cal Program. We have millions of people who will be able \nto sign up on the exchanges. We have about 1.4 million people who could \nsign up for the expanded Medi-Cal Program.\n  Do I have any time remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 5 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Five seconds. I hope we get these two wonderful nominees \non the way to confirmation today.\n  I hope we will be patient and that we will all work together to fix \nthe problems with health care. I think, at the end of the day, it is \ngoing to be great.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to share some thoughts about the \nfilling of the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals \njudgeships. I have been involved in that issue for well over a decade. \nWe started looking at the case numbers when President Clinton was in \noffice. I, along with Senator Chuck Grassley, both Republicans, blocked \nPresident Bush from filling a vacancy, because that court did not need \nanother judge and they wanted to fill it. Let's be frank. Presidents \nwant to fill the DC Circuit Court of Appeals because they think they \ncan shift the balance there and be able to advance their agenda \nthroughout the judicial process because a lot of key cases are filed \nthere, and lobbyists and outside forces that care about judges want the \nPresidents to put their kind of people in those positions--maybe even \ntheir law partner or their friend or their political buddy on that \ncourt. But there are some great judges on the court. But I am Ranking \nRepublican on the Budget Committee also. I serve on the Judiciary \nCommittee and on the Budget Committee. We have no money in this country \nto fund a judgeship that is not needed.\n  The last time we were able to move one of those judges to the Ninth \nCircuit where the position was needed. Today, it is clear that the \ncaseload for the DC Circuit continues to fall. The number of cases per \njudge in the DC Circuit continues to decline. Senator Grassley has been \na champion of this issue for years. He chaired the court subcommittee \nof the Judiciary Committee. I chaired it after he did. We have seen \nthese numbers.\n  Senator Durbin says, Oh, it is a shame. It is a shame these nominees \ndon't get confirmed. As Senator McConnell noted, it was a shame that \nPeter Keisler, a fabulous nominee, didn't get confirmed. But, in all \nhonesty, the court didn't need that slot filled and they don't need any \nof the three slots today that are vacant. They do not need to be \nfilled. Congress has no responsibility to fill a vacancy that is not \nneeded, and we shouldn't do it. Each one costs about $1 million a year. \nThat is what it costs to fill a judgeship.\n  We have needs around the country. We have certain needs around the \ncountry, and we are going to have to add judges. Why would we fill \nslots with judges we don't need and not fill slots with judges we do \nneed? That is my fundamental view about it. I will just say this: It is \nnot going to happen. We are not going to fill these slots. This country \nis in deep financial trouble.\n  The majority basically is saying: Oh, the Budget Control Act and, oh, \nwe have cut to the bone. We can't find another dime in savings. Do you \nknow what the problem is, America? You haven't sent us enough money. If \nyou would just send more money to Washington, we could spread it around \nand everything would be fine.\n  This is basically what we are hearing from the leadership: No more \ncuts. In fact, the Budget Control Act reduced spending too much. Oh, \nthis is critically important. Every dollar we spend is critically \nimportant and we can't reduce a dime of it or even the growth of it. \nThat is what we have been hearing: Send more money to Washington. We \nwant to raise taxes. We are open about demanding increases in taxes to \nfund whatever it is we want to spend.\n  Is there any waste and abuse in this government? There absolutely is. \nLook at this chart. Senator Durbin is on the Judiciary Committee. He \nhas been involved in this. He knows these numbers. There is nothing \nphony about what I am showing my colleagues today. This is absolute \nfact: Total appeals filed per active judge. These are the judges on the \ncourt today. The DC Circuit has eight judges. They have eight judges. \nThe number of appeals filed per judge in their court is 149, and the \naverage per circuit judge in America is 383. The average is 2\\1/2\\ \ntimes that number. We do not need to fill these slots.\n  Look at the Eleventh Circuit. They have vacancies, but at this point \nthey are doing almost 800 cases per judge per year. Think about that. \nIn the Second Circuit, which is Manhattan--a very important circuit \nwith very complex cases--there are more than 2\\1/2\\ times the number of \ncases than the DC Circuit. Remember, this is the current number of \njudges, I say to my colleagues. This isn't if we were to add three more \njudges. If we added three more judges, it would be a little over 100 \ncases per judge, not 149. This is absolute fact. They take the entire \nsummer off. No other circuit does this. They have canceled oral \narguments they had scheduled because there were no cases to argue. They \ntake the summer off.\n  I talked to one circuit judge in another circuit who said: At least \none of\n\n[[Page S7696]]\n\nthe judges in the DC Circuit goes around the country sometimes and \nhelps out, but none of our judges can because we are so busy we don't \nhave time to do it.\n  Most of our judges are working very hard. I am a total believer in \nthe integrity and the value of the Federal judiciary. I respect them \ngreatly. They do important work. But it has just so happened in the \ncourse of our American system that the DC Circuit is at a point where \nit has the lowest caseload per judge in decades, of any circuit and it \nneeds to be fixed and the number of cases continues to decline.\n  So what I would say to my colleagues is I believe we should give \ndeference to the President in the nomination of judges. I voted for, I \nam sure, close to 90 percent of the nominations the President has \nsubmitted. I voted for almost 90 percent, I would suggest. But I am not \ngoing to support three judges we don't need. The last thing we need to \nbe doing is burning on the Mall of the United States of America $3 \nmillion a year to fund judgeships we don't need. There are other places \nin this government we can cut wasteful spending as well, but this one \nhighlights the situation.\n  I suggest to my colleagues this is a test to this Senate. This is a \ntest for all of the Members of the Senate. If we say there is no place \nto save money in Washington; if we say we have found every bit of \nwaste, fraud, and abuse there is--well, look at this court.\n  I am not condemning any of the nominees. I am not complaining about \ntheir quality or their ability. I am saying the taxpayers of America \nshould not have extracted from them another $3 million a year to fund \nthree judges that absolutely are not needed, particularly when we have \nlegitimate needs in other courts around the country that need more \njudges.\n  Look at the Eleventh Circuit, my circuit: Almost 800 cases per judge \nfiled. This circuit, the DC Circuit, 149, and they want three more \njudges--not so.\n  I believe we have a 10-minute limit. How much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So, in conclusion, I appreciate the opportunity to be \nhere. It looks as though we will vote on the Millett nomination maybe \nlater today. With no personal criticism of that nominee in any way, I \nthink it is important for us to say we just don't need these slots. We \nare not going to fill them. Not one of the three needs to be filled. We \nare not going to fill any of them. We are going to honor the finances \nof the American people.\n  Once again, I express my appreciation to Senator Chuck Grassley, the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee, who has led the fight on \nthis issue for a number of years. I have worked with him on it. We have \nlegislation to transfer these judgeships to other places. That is what \nwe should be doing, moving them to where they are needed. It has been \ngreat to work with Senator Grassley.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about Congressman \nMel Watt.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for an \ninquiry, under the UC were we going to divide 30 minutes per side? Was \nthat the intent of the unanimous consent request I made earlier?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time until noon is equally \ndivided in the usual form.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. In the usual form. All right.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about Congressman \nMel Watt, who is a champion for middle class families in my home State \nof North Carolina. Mel Watt is the President's nominee to be the next \nDirector of our Federal Housing Finance Agency.\n  Congressman Watt is a true North Carolinian. He was born in North \nCarolina. He attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, \nand he has spent much of his distinguished career working for the \npeople of North Carolina.\n  Congressman Watt is an outstanding choice to lead the Federal Housing \nFinance Agency.\n  Over his 20 years on the House Financial Services and Judiciary \nCommittees, Congressman Watt has been a steadfast advocate for \naffordable housing in North Carolina and across the country. He has \nworked tirelessly to protect families from predatory and deceptive \nlending practices.\n  He has been willing to work across the aisle to find common ground on \nissues that promote economic opportunity for the middle class.\n  Well before the housing crisis, Congressman Watt raised concerns that \npredatory lending practices were harming consumers and putting our \nhousing market at risk. He was instrumental in enacting Dodd-Frank and \nin supporting its antipredatory lending provisions. He will be a \ntremendous asset to our housing market and economy moving forward.\n  In a letter to the Senate this week, 54 community and advocacy \norganizations called for Congressman Watt's confirmation, saying:\n\n       Representative Watt has the depth to grasp the problems \n     that plague Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and has the skills to \n     work with everyone involved to get the housing market back on \n     track.\n\n  I agree. I was proud to join my North Carolina colleague Senator \nRichard Burr in introducing Congressman Watt at his confirmation \nhearing earlier this year, and I am pleased that the Banking Committee \napproved his nomination.\n  The bipartisan support for Congressman Watt from our delegation in \nNorth Carolina is representative of his longtime ability to work across \nthe aisle.\n  During his distinguished tenure in Congress, Congressman Watt worked \nwith Republican Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte and \nRepresentative Lamar Smith to pass legislation that addressed Patent \nand Trademark Office backlogs. And he worked with Representative Blaine \nLuetkemeyer on legislation that ensured adequate transparency for ATM \nfees while eliminating excessive regulatory burdens.\n  Congressman Watt's long congressional career builds on more than two \ndecades in the private sector as a small business owner and a legal \nexpert.\n  With experience in the private sector and more than two decades of \nservice on the House Financial Services Committee, Congressman Watt has \nthe background, the skills, and the history of bipartisan cooperation \nnecessary to confront the challenges facing our recovering housing \nmarket.\n  His nomination is supported by industry leaders such as the National \nAssociation of Realtors president Gary Thomas and the National \nAssociation of Home Builders chairman Rick Judson. He is supported by \nthe Mortgage Bankers Association and the United States Conference of \nMayors. And he is supported by Erskine Bowles, cochair of the National \nCommission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, and the former Bank of \nAmerica chairman and CEO Hugh McColl.\n  In fact, I ask unanimous consent that these letters from the National \nAssociation of Realtors, the National Association of Home Builders, and \nMr. McColl be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                      of Realtors',\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 29, 2013.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the one million members of the \n     National Association of Realtors' (NAR), their \n     affiliates, homebuyers, and homeowners, I strongly urge the \n     United States Senate to expeditiously confirm Representative \n     Mel Watt as the next Director of the Federal Housing Finance \n     Agency (FHFA).\n       The National Association of Realtors' has long \n     appreciated Representative Watt's proven ability and \n     willingness to engage the industry, stakeholders, and \n     consumers throughout his service in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives. Watt has always aimed to craft policy that \n     is fair, garners wide consensus, and allows all parties to \n     move forward, all of which are vital qualities for the \n     Director of the FHFA.\n       The extended conservatorship of the government-sponsored \n     enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is one of the most \n     pressing issues facing the housing sector. This requires that \n     the FHFA be led by a permanent Director, who looks for \n     measured and comprehensive solutions that will protect both \n     the housing market and taxpayers. Representative Watt has \n     clearly demonstrated through his extended service and \n     involvement with key housing issues before the\n\n[[Page S7697]]\n\n     House Financial Services Committee that he has a keen \n     understanding of the importance of housing finance to the \n     nation's economy.\n       The FHFA Director plays a critical role in the future of \n     our nation's housing finance system and must weigh the costs \n     of action and inaction with the benefits of protecting the \n     taxpayer and ensuring the continued recovery of housing. \n     Representative Watt has the experience and skill necessary to \n     work with Congress and the Administration to ensure that both \n     costs and benefits are handled in a manner that benefits our \n     nation. As our economy continues its slow recovery from the \n     Great Recession, we must focus on sensible and commonsense \n     policies that foster strong growth and stability. \n     Representative Watt has the experience, knowledge, and \n     ability to bring that much needed focus to the FHFA.\n       In short, we know that Representative Watt will not only be \n     an asset to FHFA but also to the Congress and the \n     Administration as we work together to restore strength to the \n     housing and mortgage markets. The National Association of \n     Realtors urges confirmation of Representative Watt, \n     and stands ready to work with FHFA and Congress to facilitate \n     a strong housing and economic recovery.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Gary Thomas,\n     2013 President, National Association of Realtors'.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                             of Home Builders,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 29, 2013.\n     Hon. Harry Reid, Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC,\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: On \n     behalf of the 140,000 members of the National Association of \n     Home Builders (NAHB), I am pleased to offer NAHB's strong \n     support for the nomination of Representative Mel Watt as the \n     next Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). I \n     urge you to support his nomination when it is considered by \n     the full Senate later this week.\n       Today's mortgage finance system is in a state of \n     uncertainty. The ongoing conservatorship of the government \n     sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, \n     continues to be one of the most challenging issues facing the \n     housing industry today. With the path forward for \n     comprehensive housing finance reform taking shape, and with \n     that outcome still very uncertain, having a permanent FHFA \n     Director will be critical to ensure the safety and soundness \n     of the housing GSEs, as well as promote a stable and liquid \n     residential mortgage financing system for our nation's \n     housing market. NAHB believes that the confirmation of \n     Representative Mel Watt will bring much-needed certainty to \n     the U.S. housing finance system as we transition from the \n     current state of conservatorship to a new and stronger system \n     of housing finance.\n       Representative Watt will bring years of experience to this \n     position at a pivotal moment in the recovery of our nation's \n     housing market. During Representative Watt's tenure on the \n     House Financial Services Committee, he has proven to be a \n     thoughtful leader on housing policy. The FHFA needs a \n     permanent director with his leadership capabilities.\n       NAHB looks forward to working closely with Representative \n     Watt to help address the many complex challenges still facing \n     the housing finance system and the recovery of the housing \n     market. We hope that the Senate will move quickly to approve \n     his nomination.\n           Best regards,\n                                                      Rick Judson,\n     2013 NAHB Chairman of the Board.\n                                  ____\n\n                                  Charlotte, NC, October 25, 2013.\n     To: The Editor\n\n                 Time To Act on the Mel Watt Nomination\n\n       Given the need to have more economic activity, it appears \n     to me that the Senate should move now to confirm Congressman \n     Mel Watt as Director of FHFA. There seems to be no reason not \n     to approve Mr. Watt's nomination other than he has been \n     nominated by the President.\n       I have known Mel Watt for 40-some odd years, both as a \n     lawyer and as a US Congressman. I know him to be highly \n     intelligent, a man of impeccable character, and a straight \n     shooter. While Chairman of the Board of the Bank of America, \n     I consulted with him on many occasions about banking \n     legislation. We did not always agree with each other, but I \n     always knew that I was getting an honest opinion and one that \n     was well thought out.\n       Mr. Watt has been a real estate lawyer in one of the \n     fastest growing cities in America--Charlotte, NC, and he is \n     very much aware of the need for housing loans for people from \n     all economic segments. Most of his more than 20 years in \n     Congress were spent on the House Financial Services \n     Committee.\n       It is worth reminding people that Congressman Watt has a \n     business degree from the University of North Carolina at \n     Chapel Hill, and a law degree from Yale University. Without \n     question, he is well educated. No doubt he is smart, and \n     there is no doubt that we need somebody like him in charge.\n       I hope Senator Burr and Senator Hagan from North Carolina \n     will push for his confirmation. The Country needs him.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Hugh L. McColl, Jr.\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Congressman Watt's strong record of working with industry \nleaders, consumer advocates, Democrats and Republicans proves that he \ncan deliver results for middle class families across the country and in \nNorth Carolina.\n  We need Congressman Watt at the Federal Housing Finance Agency. I \nknow he will work successfully with Congress to strengthen the backbone \nof our current housing finance system, and I urge my colleagues to join \nme in supporting his nomination later today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, just a parliamentary inquiry: I have 10 \nminutes allocated to me?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I rise to address the candidacy of Congressman Mel Watt to be \nDirector of the Federal Housing Finance Agency as well.\n  Let me preface my comments by making it very clear. I know \nCongressman Mel Watt. He is a good man. I served with him in the House. \nWe served on the Banking Committee together. I know for many years he \nhas been and continues to be a passionate advocate for increasing \ntaxpayer subsidies for housing finance, and I have never once doubted \nhis sincerity, his commitment, or his passion for working for his \nconstituents and also for disadvantaged people generally. Having said \nthat, while Mel Watt is certainly a good man, I think this is the wrong \njob for this good man, and I want to explain why.\n  I think it is useful to first consider the massive size of the \ninstitutions that the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the FHFA, \nregulates. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Federal Home Loan Banks \ncombined are enormous.\n  Fannie and Freddie together hold 48 percent of all the outstanding \nmortgages in the United States of America. Last year, they guaranteed \nalmost 80 percent of all the new mortgages that were issued. Combined, \nFannie and Freddie have assets that are nearly $5.2 trillion--this is \nmuch larger than the Federal Reserve--which have just made themselves \ninto an enormous institution. Combined, Fannie and Freddie are more \nthan twice as big as JPMorgan Chase, the biggest bank in America. In \naddition to being very large, they are enormously complex, and they are \nat the center--in fact, they are the housing finance market of the \nUnited States of America.\n  So they are enormously large, they are enormously complex. And the \npost we are talking about here--the directorship of the regulator--has \nvirtually unchecked powers. The legislation that creates this post, \nthat creates this agency and the head of this agency, empowers the \nDirector enormously. Let me quote from the statute. The Director's \npowers include ``all rights, titles, powers, and privileges of the \nregulated entity, and of any stockholder, officer, or director'' of the \nentity. In plain English that means this person has the power of the \nentire board of directors, the CEO and all the management, and the \nregulatory agency that controls it all. There is no parallel in our \ncountry for an institution where so much power is concentrated in one \nperson.\n  In addition, there is no congressional oversight. The FHFA does not \ndepend on Congress for appropriations. It gets its money from fees from \nthe entities it regulates. So Congress has no control, no authority, \nonce a person is confirmed in this post, and they are confirmed for a \n5-year term and can only be removed for cause. So it is unchecked power \non an enormous scale.\n  Now, precisely because of the unchecked power over these enormously \nlarge, important, powerful, and complex institutions--precisely for \nthat reason--the statute stipulates very clearly that the person \nholding this post has to be someone who is technically competent \nbecause of their own history, because they have been a practitioner in \nthis field. The legislation demands that, and for good reason. \nSpecifically, the law insists that the Director shall have a \n``demonstrated\n\n[[Page S7698]]\n\nunderstanding of financial management or oversight, and have a \ndemonstrated understanding of capital markets, including the mortgage \nsecurities markets and housing finance.''\n  So we are not talking about being automatically qualified by virtue \nof being a Member of Congress. One needs to be a practitioner. I will \ngive you one quick example of many why central to the management of the \nenormous complexity of these institutions is the use of complex \nderivatives, which manage the interest rate risk inherent in these \nportfolios. Fannie and Freddie are the world's biggest users of \nderivatives for this risk management purpose. Understanding how these \nwork, the risks that are inherent in them, and how it affects the \nbroader capital markets is absolutely essential. Yet in December 2011, \nMel Watt said this. I quote Congressman Watt:\n\n       For all of the last term of Congress, I sat in the \n     Financial Services Committee, and a lot of these arguments \n     that I am hearing today are the same arguments that I heard \n     about derivatives. Well, I didn't know a damn thing about \n     derivatives. I am still not sure I do.\n\n  Derivatives are central to the management of these institutions.\n  There is another reason why this statute insists on an experienced \npractitioner and a technocrat rather than a politician, and that is \nbecause pursuing a political agenda at these institutions is enormously \ndangerous. Look at the damage that it did the last time. Congressman \nWatt was an advocate for all of the policies that helped to drive \nFannie and Freddie into the conservatorship that cost taxpayers so much \nmoney. He supported lower capital standards, lower downpayments, lower \nunderwriting standards, loan forgiveness. He was opposed to tougher \nregulations, even when it was becoming clear that these institutions \nwere on a downward spiral and soon would need a massive bailout.\n  Unfortunately, Congressman Watt still supports these policies. And if \nhe were confirmed as the Director, with all of these powers, he could \nunilaterally reinstitute these policies.\n  Now, fortunately, at the moment, we have a Director who understands \nthat his obligation to the taxpayer precludes these misguided policies. \nI am deeply concerned that if confirmed, Congressman Watt would reverse \nthat practice and reinstitute some of these very damaging and dangerous \npolicies.\n  So for these reasons and, I would say, in respect and in honoring the \nclear language of the statute, we have an obligation to not confirm \nCongressman Mel Watt. While I know he is a very good man, I think he is \nthe wrong person for this job. So I would urge my colleagues to vote no \non cloture later today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      The Nomination of Mel Watts\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, while not many people know about \nthe Federal Housing Finance Agency, it has become one of the most \npowerful and important government agencies. Following the financial \ncrisis and massive bailouts of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and all the big \nbanks, the Federal Government took a primary position in the mortgage \nmarket. Right now, 48 percent of all outstanding U.S. mortgages and 77 \npercent of those issued last year were guaranteed by the Federal \nGovernment. This is a problem in and of itself, but the FHFA is the \nagency that oversees all of them.\n  Mel Watts is the guy President Obama has nominated to lead the \nagency. I know Mel from my time both in the House and the Senate, and I \nam deeply concerned that he will push the Federal Government further \ninto the mortgage business, instead of moving us away from it. He has \nshown his colors during his time here in Washington, and he is not the \nright guy to lead the agency. I am opposed to his nomination and urge \nmy colleagues to oppose him.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to any motion to \ninvoke cloture on nominees to the DC Circuit. I am somewhat \ndisappointed that the Senate majority wants to turn to a very \ncontroversial nomination next rather than to continue on a path of \ncooperative confirmations or other important Senate business. It seems \nto me that scheduling such a controversial vote in the closing weeks of \nthis session of Congress is designed simply to heat up the partisanship \nof judicial nominations.\n  My opposition is based on a number of factors.\n  First, an objective review of the court's workload makes clear that \nthe workload simply does not justify adding additional judges, \nparticularly when additional judgeships cost approximately $1 million--\n$1 million--every year per judge.\n  Second, given that the caseload does not justify additional judges, \nyou have to ask why the President would push so hard to fill these \nseats. It appears clear that the President wishes to add additional \njudges to this court in order to change judicial outcomes.\n  Third, the court is currently comprised of four active judges \nappointed by a Republican President and four active judges appointed by \na Democratic President. There is no reason to upset the current makeup \nof the court, particularly when the reason for doing so appears to be \nideologically driven.\n  I will start by providing my colleagues with a little bit of history \nregarding this particular seat on the DC Circuit.\n  It may come as a surprise to some, but this seat has been vacant for \nover 8 years. It became vacant in September 2005, when John Roberts was \nelevated to Chief Justice.\n  In June of 2006, President Bush nominated an eminently qualified \nindividual for this seat, Peter Keisler. Mr. Keisler was widely lauded \nas a consensus bipartisan nominee. His distinguished record of public \nservice included service as Acting Attorney General. Despite his broad \nbipartisan support and qualifications, Mr. Keisler waited 918 days for \na committee vote. The vote never happened.\n  When he was nominated, Democrats objected to even holding a hearing \nfor the nominee based upon concerns about the workload of the DC \nCircuit.\n  First, I would like to remind my colleagues that in 2006 Democrats \nargued that the DC Circuit caseload was too light to justify confirming \nany additional judges to the bench. Since that time, do you know what \nhappened. The caseload has continued to decrease.\n  In terms of raw numbers, the DC Circuit has the lowest number of \ntotal appeals filed annually among all the circuit courts of appeals. \nIn 2005 that number was 1,379. Last year it was 1,193--a decrease of \n13.5 percent.\n  There are a lot of different ways to look at these numbers, but \nperhaps the best numbers to examine are the workload per active judge. \nThe caseload has decreased so much since 2005 that even with two fewer \nactive judges, the filing levels per active judge are practically the \nsame. In 2005, with 10 active judges, the court had 138 appeals filed \nper active judge. Today, with only 8 active judges, it has 149. This \nmakes the DC Circuit caseload levels the lowest in the Nation and less \nthan half the national average.\n  It has been suggested that there are other circuits, namely the \nEighth and the Tenth, that have lighter caseloads than the DC Circuit. \nThat is inaccurate. The DC Circuit has fewer cases filed and fewer \ncases terminated than either the Eighth or the Tenth Circuit.\n  Cases filed and cases terminated measure the amount of appeals coming \ninto the court and being resolved. Some of my colleagues have been \narguing that the Eighth and the Tenth Circuits are similar to the DC \nCircuit based upon the comparison of pending cases. But cases pending \ndoes not measure how many cases are being added and removed from the \ndocket.\n  When looking at how many cases are added or filed per active judge, \nthe DC Circuit is the lowest with 149. It is lower than the Eighth \nCircuit's 280 and the Tenth Circuit's 217. When looking at the number \nof cases being terminated by each court, the DC Circuit is once again \nthe lowest at 149. Again, the Eighth Circuit and the Tenth Circuit \ncourts are much higher at 269 and 218.\n  Let me mention one other important point about pending appeals and \nthe statistics my colleagues use. Several of my colleagues said on the \nfloor yesterday that in 2005 there were only 121 pending appeals per \nactive judge. That number seemed a little odd to me, so we looked into \nit a bit further, what the situation was in 2005. In order to arrive at \nthat number, my colleagues appear to be taking the total appeals for 12 \nmonths ending June 30, 2005, and dividing them by 11 active judges.\n\n[[Page S7699]]\n\n  As it turns out, there were only 9 active judges for almost that \nentire 12-month period. Janice Rogers Brown was sworn in on June 10, \n2005, and Judge Griffith was sworn in June 29, 2005. As a result, \nduring that 12-month period there were 10 active judges for a total of \nonly 19 days. There were 11 active judges on the DC Circuit for a grand \ntotal of 1 day.\n  A few months later in 2005, the court was back down to nine after \nJudge Roberts was elevated to the Supreme Court and Judge Edwards took \nsenior status.\n  This is how hard pressed the other side is to refute what everyone \nknows to be true: The caseload of the DC Circuit is lower now than it \nwas back in 2005. In order to have a statistic that supports their \njudgment, the other side is claiming there were 11 active judges for \nthat 12-month period, while that claim was true for only a total of 1 \nday.\n  The bottom line is this: The objective data clearly indicates the DC \nCircuit caseload is very low and that the court does not need \nadditional active judges. That is especially true if you use the \nstandard Senate Democrats established when they blocked Mr. Keisler.\n  In addition to the raw numbers, in order to get a firsthand account, \nseveral months ago I invited the current judges of that court to \nprovide a candid assessment of their caseload. What they said should \nnot surprise anyone who has looked at this closely. The judges \nthemselves confirmed that the workload on the DC Circuit is \nexceptionally low, stating, ``The court does not need additional \njudges.'' And, ``If any more judges were added now, there wouldn't be \nenough work to go around.''\n  Those are powerful statements from the sitting judges in that \ncircuit. Given these concerns, it is difficult to see why we would be \nmoving forward with additional nominations, especially in a time when \nwe are operating under budget constraints. Unfortunately, the \njustification for moving forward with additional DC Circuit nominees \nappears to be a desire and an intent to stack the court in order to \ndetermine the outcome of cases this court hears.\n  It is clear the President wants to fill this court with ideological \nallies for the purposes of reversing certain policy outcomes. This is \nnot just my view. It has been overtly stated as an objective of this \nadministration.\n  I would quote along this line a Washington Post article, ``Giving \nliberals a greater say on the D.C. Circuit is important for Obama as he \nlooks for ways to circumvent the Republican-led House and a polarized \nSenate on a number of policy fronts through executive order and other \nadministrative procedures.''\n  We have a President who says: If Congress will not, I will. How do \nyou stop that? The courts are the check on that. Even a member of the \nDemocratic leadership admitted on the Senate floor that the reason they \nneed to fill these seats was because, as he saw it, the DC Circuit was \n``wreaking havoc with the country.''\n  This is perplexing, given the current makeup of the court. Currently, \nthere are four Republican-appointed judges, and, with the most recent \nconfirmation, there are now four Democratic-appointed judges. \nApparently some on the other side want to make sure they get a \nfavorable outcome of this court.\n  I have concerns regarding filling seats on this court which clearly \nhas a very low caseload. I have greater concerns about this President's \nagenda to stack the court and to upset the current makeup simply in \norder to obtain favorable judicial outcomes because: If Congress will \nnot, I will.\n  Given the overwhelming lack of a need to fill these seats based upon \ncaseload and especially considering the cost to the taxpayers of over \n$1 million per judge per year, I cannot support this nomination and \nurge my colleagues to reject it as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, since I was first elected, the Senate has \nconsidered more than 1700 nominations to Article III federal courts. In \nnearly every case, the focus was on the individual nominee and whether \nhe or she was qualified for judicial service. The nominee before us \ntoday is one of the rare exceptions. The focus here is on the court to \nwhich she and two others have been nominated, the US Court of Appeals \nfor the DC Circuit. I cannot support any of these nominees because no \none, no matter who they are and no matter what their qualifications, \nshould be appointed to this court at this time.\n  It would be difficult to make a more compelling case that the DC \nCircuit needs no more judges. The Administrative Office of the U.S. \nCourts is the keeper of the caseload facts and ranks the DC Circuit \nlast among all circuits in appeals filed and appeals terminated per \njudicial panel. In fact, the AO ranks the DC Circuit last even in the \ncatch-all category of ``other caseload per judgeship.'' And Chief DC \nCircuit Judge Merrick Garland recently confirmed that the number of DC \nCircuit cases scheduled for oral argument has declined by almost 20 \npercent in the last decade.\n  Here is another way to look at this issue. In July 2006, Democrats on \nthe Judiciary Committee signed a letter to then-Chairman Arlen Specter \nopposing more DC Circuit appointments for two reasons. First, they used \nspecific caseload benchmarks to conclude that the court's caseload had \ndeclined. Second, they said that filling vacancies labeled judicial \nemergencies by the Judicial Conference was more important.\n  I am not aware that my Democratic colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee have said either that they used the wrong standard in 2006 or \nthat their 2006 standard should not be used today. I do not want to \naccuse anyone of using different standards for nominees of different \npolitical parties, so it is fair to apply the same standard that \nDemocrats used to oppose Republican DC Circuit nominees.\n  Democrats opposed more DC Circuit nominees because total appeals \nfiled had declined. According to the AO's most recent data, total \nappeals filed have declined 18 percent further since 2006. Democrats \nopposed more DC Circuit nominees because written decisions per active \njudge had declined. The AO's data show that written decisions per \nactive judge have declined 27 percent further since 2006. Democrats \nopposed more DC Circuit nominees because there were nominees to only 60 \npercent of the 20 existing judicial emergency vacancies. Today, the \nSenate has pending nominees to only 49 percent of the 37 current \njudicial emergency vacancies. These are the facts. New appeals filed \nand written decisions per active judge in the DC Circuit are both 76 \npercent below the national average and 50 to 60 percent below the next \nbusiest circuit.\n  I hope that my colleagues get the point. No matter how you slice it \nor dice it, the DC Circuit has the lowest caseload of any circuit in \nthe country and its caseload continues to decline. The very same \nstandards that Democrats used to oppose Republican nominees to the DC \nCircuit in 2006 show conclusively that the court needs no more judges \ntoday. As I said, none of my Democratic colleagues--and 4 who signed \nthat 2006 letter are on the Judiciary Committee today--have said they \nwere wrong in 2006 or attempted to explain why their 2006 standard is \ninappropriate today.\n  The Senate evaluates the vast majority of judicial nominees on their \nown merits. These current DC Circuit nominees are the rare exception \nbecause they have been chosen for a court that needs no more judges at \nall. The better course would be to enact S. 699, the Court Efficiency \nAct, which would move two of these unnecessary DC Circuit seats to \ncircuits that need them.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Congratulating the Boston Red Sox\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, before I start, I want to recognize the \nBoston Red Sox team for an outstanding historic season and to \ncongratulate Red Sox Nation on their third World Series Championship in \n10 years. Go Sox.\n  The Red Sox mean so much to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and to \nour communities throughout New England, particularly this year. They \nhave been a symbol of Boston's strength and resilience. From their \nhistoric one-season turnaround to their\n\n[[Page S7700]]\n\nwin in front of the Fenway faithful for the first time since 1918, to \ntheir scruffy beards, this team will be remembered forever for its \nheart and for its success. Like all of us in Massachusetts, they have \nshown what it means to be Boston strong.\n  I also want to congratulate the St. Louis Cardinals on their 97-win \nseason and their extraordinary achievement for winning 4 pennants in 10 \nyears. Really amazing.\n  I am honored every day to represent the people of Massachusetts and \nthe values we stand for. I am especially proud to congratulate the Red \nSox today.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of Congressman Mel \nWatt's nomination to serve as the Director of the Federal Housing \nFinance Agency.\n  In many areas of Massachusetts and around the country, housing \nmarkets have recovered, but in too many other areas the housing market \nis plagued by underwater mortgages and foreclosures. A wounded housing \nmarket continues to drag down our economy and it leaves millions of \nfamilies struggling to rebuild economic security.\n  One of the people who can make an important difference in helping the \nhousing market back to full health is the Director of FHFA. The FHFA \noversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Between them, Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac back the vast majority of mortgages in the country, which \nmeans right now the FHFA has enormous influence over the American \nhousing market.\n  The FHFA has the tools to help homeowners who continue to struggle \nfollowing the 2008 financial crisis. It has the tools to help \naccelerate our economic recovery. For 4 years now, the FHFA has been \nled by an acting director. The time has come for some permanence and \nfor some certainty. It is time for the FHFA to have a director, and \nCongressman Mel Watt is the right man for the job.\n  He has decades of relevant experience. He spent 22 years as a \npracticing lawyer, working with middle-income and lower income families \non real estate closings and other housing issues. He then spent the \nnext 21 years in Congress as a member of the House Financial Services \nCommittee where he dealt firsthand with housing finance as a \npolicymaker.\n  When it comes to housing, Congressman Watt has seen it all. \nCongressman Watt has shown good judgment throughout it all. Several \nyears before the housing market collapse in 2008, Congressman Watt \nintroduced the Prohibit Predatory Lending Act in an effort to stop \nmortgage lenders from taking advantage of homebuyers. The act would \nhave helped Congress address the underlying cause of the financial \ncrisis by making it harder for lenders to push families toward \nmortgages they could not repay and too often did not understand.\n  After that crisis hit, Mel built on his earlier legislation to craft \nlaws that reduced risky mortgage lending and gave homeowners additional \nprotection. Congressman Watt has worked hard to level the playing field \nfor consumers. But he is no ideologue. I have worked with him for many \nyears now. I have seen firsthand that he is a thoughtful policymaker. \nHe can see problems coming, and when he does he seeks common ground and \nworks hard to develop real solutions.\n  As Congress looks at ways to fix Freddie and Fannie to steady the \nhousing market, Congressman Watt's practical approach is exactly what \nFHFA needs. The people who know him best, the Senators from his home \nState of North Carolina, the business leaders in his congressional \ndistrict in Charlotte, support his nomination without reservation.\n  So what I want to know is this: Why would anyone in Congress try to \nblock Mel from receiving a simple up-or-down vote? Why would they not \nwant strong leadership in an agency that has been thrust into such a \ncritical role in the economy? It does not make sense, not to the people \nwho know Mel and not to the people who want to put this economy back on \ntrack.\n  Mel's work will help restore the housing market, help lift the \neconomy, and most of all, help strengthen America's families.\n  It is time for obstruction for obstruction's sake to end, and it is \ntime for the Senate to move forward with an up-or-down vote to confirm \nCongressman Watt so that he can get to work at the FHFA serving the \nAmerican people.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n Nomination of Patricia Ann Millett to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to say a few words about the \nappointment of Patricia Millett to the DC Circuit. The DC Circuit is an \n11-member appellate court that hears some of the greatest and most \nserious administrative appeals in this country. Most of them are \ncomplicated, somewhat convoluted, and they do take serious expertise.\n  The court is an 11-member court. It currently has eight members. \nThree of the eight are women, and there are three vacancies on the \ncourt. Patricia Millett has been nominated by the President to fill one \nof those vacancies. What is interesting about this debate is that no \none questions her qualifications or her temperament. She graduated \nsumma cum laude from the University of Illinois in 1985 and magna cum \nlaude from Harvard Law School in 1988. Even Senator Cruz from Texas has \npointed out how superbly qualified she is. Yet there is a good chance \nthat there will not be the votes to allow us to proceed to a vote on \nher qualifications and therefore confirm the nomination.\n  I wish to state some of her qualifications. She clerked for Judge \nThomas Tang on the Ninth Circuit in Phoenix, AZ, for 2 years. She \nworked in the Solicitor General's office for 11 years, in the Justice \nDepartment's civil Appellate Section for 4 years. She leads the Supreme \nCourt and appellate practice at the law firm Akin Gump. She has argued \n32 cases in the Supreme Court, placing her in the top 10 of all \nattorneys from 2000 to 2012. She has also argued dozens of cases in \nother appellate courts.\n  She is known as a superb appellate lawyer. She is known as someone \nwith sterling qualifications, and she has received the unanimous rating \nof ``well qualified'' from the ABA--the highest rating the ABA gives. \nShe has received numerous awards from the Department of Justice and \nstrong support across the aisle, including from all three Solicitors \nGeneral who served in the Bush administration. She is not only an \noutstanding lawyer, she is also an exceptional person with a work \nethic, a morality, and a history of faithful service that is truly \nadmirable.\n  She is the mother of two children, David and Elizabeth. She earned a \nblack belt in Tae Kwon Do after taking classes with her husband and \ntheir children. I am not sure how important that is, but I assume she \nis physically very fit.\n  She is a military spouse. Her husband Bob served in the Navy and the \nNavy Reserve until his retirement in 2012, and he was deployed to \nKuwait in 2004.\n  Anyone who has read the Bars and Stripes article on her cannot but \nlook at this woman and say she is the model American woman. Yet we may \nnot even be able to vote on her today.\n  During that time, Patricia was also one of so many military spouses \nwho shouldered the burden of parenting while her husband was overseas. \nShe understands the sacrifices military families make to keep our \ncountry safe. ``Pattie did the job of two parents while Bob was away. . \n. . During Bob's nine-month deployment [to Kuwait], Pattie was still \nworking at the Solicitor General's office and handling a heavy Supreme \nCourt caseload,'' which is very special if one thinks about what it \nmeans. ``She argued one Supreme Court case and briefed five more while \njuggling her solo-parenting duties.'' According to this article, Tom \nGoldstein, a distinguished appellate practitioner and the founder of \nthe popular scotus Web site, said ``Through it all, he never saw Pattie \ncomplain about these sacrifices for her country.''\n  She has also made a long-time commitment to work on behalf of the \nhomeless. The Bars and Stripes article says:\n\n\n[[Page S7701]]\n\n\n       The project most near and dear to Pattie's heart is \n     Mondloch House, a group of homeless shelters and individuals \n     that Pattie has been involved with for many years. Each week, \n     Pattie coordinates fruit and vegetable deliveries . . . to \n     make sure the shelters have fresh produce.\n\n  Judge Thomas Ambro of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals said it \nbest:\n\n       Pattie is a really good human being. And, as everyone \n     knows, she's in the first rank of appellate practitioners in \n     this country. She combines talent, hard work, judgment, and \n     focus; she's the complete package.\n\n  The question is, Why is there opposition to this nomination? Some on \nthe Republican side have said the DC Circuit, which today has eight \njudges and three vacancies, doesn't need any new judges. They said \nPresident Obama is trying to pack the court. I disagree. Only 7 or 8 \nyears ago my Republican colleagues were arguing to confirm President \nBush's nominees to fill vacancies on the 9th seat, the 10th seat, and \nthe 11th seat on the DC Circuit. They even threatened to invoke the \nnuclear option to fill these seats. The caseload isn't much different \nthan it was then. In fact, it is greater in some measures today. The \nnumber of pending appeals per active judge on the DC Circuit is greater \nthan the number when all four of President Bush's DC Circuit nominees \nwere confirmed. In addition, while the raw filings per active judge are \nlower on the DC Circuit than some other circuits, there is good reason \nfor that. The DC Circuit's caseload is different because of the \nsubstantial docket of complex administrative agency appeals.\n  In fact, statistics published by the Judicial Conference of the \nUnited States show that--without counting immigration appeals--43 \npercent of DC Circuit cases were administrative appeals. The average in \nall other circuits combined is only 1.7 percent. That is a huge \ndifference.\n  If you look at the published opinions from the first six months of \nthis year, the DC Circuit's published cases took just as long--and in \nmany cases longer--than did the published decisions of many other \ncircuits. The median time from filing to disposition is 11.8 months--28 \npercent above average among the circuits.\n  And, many of those DC Circuit cases involved highly complex \nadministrative appeals with important questions of Federal law and \nregulation.\n  Chief Justice Roberts wrote about this in a 2006 law review article \ncalled What Makes the DC Circuit Different? He cited the Court's \njurisdiction to review decisions of numerous important agencies, such \nas the FCC, the EPA, the NLRB, the FTC, and the FAA. And he wrote: \n``Whatever combination of letters you can put together, it is likely \nthat jurisdiction to review that agency's decision is vested in the \nCircuit.''\n  And, as former DC Circuit Judge Patricia Wald wrote in the Washington \nPost, ``These cases can require thousands of hours of preparation by \nthe judges, often consuming days of argument, involving hundreds of \nparties and interveners, and necessitating dozens of briefs and \nthousands of pages of record--all of which culminates in lengthy, \ntechnically intricate legal opinions.''\n  So, the caseload does support the confirmation of new judges to the \nDC Circuit.\n  I would also like to take a moment to address this notion of ``court \npacking,'' a term that originated with a plan by President Franklin \nRoosevelt to authorize new seats on the Supreme Court when he was not \ngetting decisions he favored.\n  This is not about creating new seats. This is about filling seats \nthat exist, seats that have been authorized by Congress for many years, \nseats that the Judicial Conference continues to recommend be filled, \nand seats that my Republican colleagues pushed to fill not so many \nyears ago. This is not ``court packing.''\n  Now, I remember how the DC Circuit looked after President Bush's last \nappointee was confirmed in 2006. The Court had seven Republican \nappointees and three Democratic appointees. Other circuits were \nsimilarly lopsided as well. Some might see that as packing the courts.\n  But I do not see it that way. A President must do his or her job \nmaking nominations to ensure that the judicial business of the American \npeople gets done over time, long after that President leaves office. \nThat is how our system works.\n  I supported two of President Bush's DC Circuit nominees, John Roberts \nand Thomas Griffith, and I supported cloture on a third, Brett \nKavanaugh. I supported other controversial Bush circuit court nominees, \nsometimes to the chagrin of many on my own side. I did so because I \nbelieved those nominees were qualified and could be fair. I believe \nvery deeply that the judiciary is too important to play partisan games \nwith. That is exactly what is going on. Why should I continue, as a \nmember of the Judiciary Committee with the second most seniority, when \nthe administration changes, to step out and support any new \nRepublican's nominees? I have done it in the past. I hoped to break \nthis deadlock of partisanship. I had hoped we could vote when a nominee \nis qualified regardless of party. This nominee, if a motion to close \noff debate is not granted, shows me that the atmosphere is such that \nthis can never be the case and that I, as someone on the Judiciary \nCommittee who has been willing to cross party lines to vote for a \nqualified nominee, should cease and desist in this regard. That is the \nmessage of this nominee to me.\n  Think of this woman and her history: Army wife, mother of two, \nappellate lawyer, Solicitor General's office, and the tenth greatest \nnumber of Supreme Court appearances in the last 12 years. She is going \nto be denied, and no one has cast any blemish on her academic ability \nor her moral ethic. So the only thing I am left with is intense \npartisanship.\n  Please, let there be some Republicans who want to change the nature \nof this place and begin that change with the recognition that we have a \nsuperior woman. In a country where the majority of people are women, \nthe number of women on this court is in the minority, and there is a \nneed for bright, informed, legal talent. This woman is one of them. I \nhope she will survive cloture.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article from Bars and Stripes be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From Bars and Stripes, Oct. 21, 2013]\n\n   Faith & Family: The Center of a Military Spouse DC Circuit Nominee\n\n                            (By Reda Hicks)\n\n       Patricia Millett (Pattie to her friends) is the complete \n     package. From the beginning of her career, Pattie had all the \n     markings of a legal rock star. Top of her classes at \n     University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Harvard Law \n     School. Prestigious clerkship for the Ninth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals. Appellate staff of the Department of Justice Civil \n     Division. Assistant to the Solicitor General, serving equal \n     time under Presidents Bush and Clinton. Head of Akin Gump's \n     Supreme Court practice. More than 30 cases argued before the \n     Supreme Court. Sky-high stack of professional accolades. \n     ``Unanimously Well Qualified'' ABA Rating. Seven Solicitors \n     General support her nomination to the D.C. Circuit.\n       But somewhere in that rocket-propelled career, Pattie fell \n     in love with a Sailor. And became a mom. And earned a black \n     belt. All while living a genuine, intentional, faith-based \n     life of success. And these qualities and experiences, even \n     more than her legal fame, are what make her the complete \n     package.\n       Her long-time friend and fellow appellate attorney Tom \n     Goldstein knows that all too well: ``Pattie is an outstanding \n     talent, an incredibly hard worker, and the best legal writer \n     I have ever had the good fortune to work with. But her \n     success comes from a complete commitment to a core set of \n     values, to family, God, and country that really drive all of \n     her decisions.''\n       Pattie met Bob King in 1995, in Washington, D.C., while he \n     was serving at the Pentagon in the U.S. Navy. They met at a \n     Washington Street United Methodist Church singles event Bob \n     reluctantly attended at the urging of his roommate. Bob knew \n     right away that Pattie was the one; he felt like they had \n     been together forever because their core values were so in \n     step from the very beginning. Bob and Pattie were married a \n     year later in June 1996, in the same church where they had \n     first met.\n       Three years later, when it looked like Bob's next \n     assignment would send him far from Pattie, they made the \n     decision that Bob would transition to the Navy Reserves, \n     where he served until his retirement in 2012. Commitment to \n     family is a top priority for Bob and Pattie, who work \n     together to make their children David and Elizabeth the \n     center of their lives.\n       Like so many other military spouses, Pattie did the job of \n     two parents while Bob was away on reserve duty, and \n     eventually in 2004 he was called on to deploy. ``It was \n     really hard for her, working sixty hour weeks and keeping our \n     family together in my absence\n\n[[Page S7702]]\n\n     with a three-year-old and six-year-old to handle at home,'' \n     he says. ``But she did an amazing job!''\n       During Bob's nine-month deployment, Pattie was still \n     working at the Solicitor General's office and handled a heavy \n     Supreme Court caseload. She argued one Supreme Court case and \n     briefed five more while juggling her solo-parenting duties. \n     Tom Goldstein says through it all, he never saw Pattie \n     complain about these sacrifices for her country.\n       ``She was proud of Bob's service, and was completely \n     committed to her family as her first priority.'' Pattie might \n     have made it look easy, but her associate Hyland Hunt knows \n     differently. Hyland, also a military spouse, has been working \n     with Pattie at Akin Gump for two years.\n       ``Pattie has been a tremendous encouragement to me,'' says \n     Hyland. ``Other things pulling at us can sometimes make it \n     very hard to focus on work, but watching Pattie helps me know \n     that it can be done.'' But it doesn't just happen. ``If \n     Pattie has taught me anything, it's that you have to live \n     intentionally in each part of your life.''\n       Pattie served as a mentor for Hyland on the law, but has \n     also been a sounding board as she navigates the difficult \n     choices military spouses have to make when balancing career \n     and a spouse's military service. Helping others is a practice \n     familiar to those who know her, as Pattie is held in high \n     esteem as much for being a good person as for being a good \n     lawyer.\n       ``Pattie is a really good human being,'' says Judge Thomas \n     Ambro of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. ``And, as \n     everyone knows, she's in the first rank of appellate \n     practitioners in this country.'' Judge Ambro met Pattie in \n     2000, when a friend suggested she would make a good addition \n     to an appellate panel he was working on. The success of the \n     first panel led to many more, and Pattie now speaks to Judge \n     Ambro's Georgetown undergraduates each year about how to \n     manage all of the things tugging at their time and balance. \n     It's a message that really resonates with them.\n       ``[She] combines talent, hard work, judgment, and focus; \n     she's the complete package,'' Judge Ambro notes. ``And she \n     does it all without being nasty.''\n       ``The thing that amazes me, knowing how much stress she is \n     under, is that she is incredibly kind and unfailingly humble \n     and gracious,'' says associate Hyland Hunt. ``You never hear \n     her snap at opposing counsel. She keeps an equanimity that is \n     remarkable.''\n       For Pattie, this kindness goes hand in hand with her and \n     Bob's core principles. From that first fateful day when Bob \n     and Pattie met at Washington Street United Methodist, they \n     have been committed to putting service and faith at the \n     center of their family.\n       ``We firmly believe that we are here to serve,'' Bob says, \n     ``and we are very intentional about teaching that to our \n     children.'' Today, the whole family is involved in various \n     ministries. David worked on the Highland Support Project in \n     Guatemala, bringing running water to remote areas. \n     Elizabeth's service started when she raised $1,800 selling \n     lemonade to raise money for children living in a garbage dump \n     in Cambodia. And both kids have been on mission trips to West \n     Virginia, where they worked with the Jeremiah Project to help \n     repair and rebuild low-income housing. Next summer, says Bob, \n     they are very excited to be going on a mission trip together \n     for the first time, working with the White Mountain Apache \n     Tribe in Ft. Apache, Arizona.\n       The project most near and dear to Pattie's heart is \n     Mondloch House, a group of homeless shelters for families and \n     individuals that Pattie has been involved with for many \n     years. Each week, Pattie coordinates fruit and vegetable \n     deliveries, organizing volunteers for pick-ups and drop-offs \n     to make sure the shelters have fresh produce to serve. Hyland \n     Hunt says Pattie's family has a well-known tradition of \n     serving dinners together at one of the homes, called \n     Hypothermia Shelter.\n       Pattie, Bob, and the kids love to do things together. In \n     fact, Bob says spending time, all four of them together, is \n     Pattie's favorite thing to do. That's why, many years ago \n     when their daughter joined her older brother in taekwondo \n     lessons, Bob and Pattie decided to start taking lessons, too.\n       ``We wanted something to do together that was active,'' \n     says Bob. ``It is a fun family activity, but it also teaches \n     each of us basic self-defense skills, which are very \n     important.'' Now, all four of them are black belts; in fact, \n     Pattie is a second degree black belt, surpassing her husband \n     and nearly catching up to her son David's third degree belt.\n       Pattie's colleagues say unequivocally that her passion for \n     the law takes a backseat to her husband and their two \n     children. Maintaining balance between family and a demanding \n     legal field is probably also one of her greatest career \n     challenges. But she has a champion in her biggest fan, her \n     husband.\n       ``Seventeen years is no short amount of time, but I have \n     loved every minute with her,'' he says. ``She still amazes me \n     with how she can juggle everything and keep her sanity.''\n       From her very first Supreme Court argument, Bob wanted to \n     be in the gallery cheering Pattie on. But Pattie refused. ``I \n     don't want you to see me crash and burn!'' she would say, \n     although Bob knew that she certainly would not.\n       It took Bob five years to convince Pattie to let him come \n     watch her argue, and when she finally agreed, Bob was blown \n     away. Now, Bob goes to watch her every chance he gets. ``I've \n     seen four or five arguments now, and I'm just amazed every \n     time because you have to be so fast on your feet! I could \n     never do that. She's one of the best! I know I'm not \n     objective on that, but it's true!''\n       Watching Pattie before the Supreme Court, Bob says it is \n     clear she has earned the respect of the Justices. ``They know \n     what they will get when Pattie comes before them, because she \n     is always prepared.'' That might be an understatement.\n       Before an argument, Pattie spends weeks studying the \n     record, going through moot court arguments until she knows \n     her case inside and out. Tom Goldstein calls Pattie a \n     ``ferocious preparer, committed to leaving no stone unturned, \n     and thinking of every possible nuance and counter argument to \n     the counter argument.'' Says Hyland Hunt, ``It always amazes \n     me how she can digest and know the record,'' but Pattie's is \n     the kind of knowledge that comes from plain and simple \n     diligence.\n       Pattie's hard work, focus, and tenacity have made her a \n     great advocate. Her kindness, wisdom and graciousness have \n     made her a highly respected professional. But her strong \n     center, built on family, faith, and service make her the \n     complete package.\n       Military spouses forging their own careers can learn a lot \n     from Pattie's example. Whatever our professional pursuits, \n     true success starts at the core; build a strong one, then \n     hold on to it tightly.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be opposing cloture on the nominations of Melvin \nWatt to be the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and \nPatricia Millett to be a U.S. circuit court judge for the District of \nColumbia Circuit. I do so because I believe that neither candidate \nshould be affirmed by the Senate at this time.\n  I have been privileged many times to be a part of groups of Senators \nwho were able to come together and negotiate agreements to end the \ngridlock surrounding nominees, avert the nuclear option, and allow the \nSenate to move forward with our work on behalf of the American people. \nMy work in these groups--often referred to as ``gangs''--has won me \nboth praise and condemnation and has often put me at odds with my \nparty.\n  In 2005 when the Republicans were in the majority and we were about \nto exercise a nuclear option on President Bush's judicial nominees who \nwere being filibustered by the other side that was in the minority, \npart of the agreement addressed future nominees, an agreement which has \nheld all these years. I quote from the agreement:\n\n       Signatories will exercise their responsibilities under the \n     Advice and Consent Clause of the United States Constitution \n     in good faith. Nominees should only be filibustered under \n     extraordinary circumstances, and each signatory must use his \n     or her own discretion and judgment in determining whether \n     such circumstances exist.\n\n  As to both of the nominees we are considering today, I find and it is \nmy judgment as a Senator that extraordinary conditions exist. The \nagreements I have entered into, including to begin on the motion to \nproceed, including last July on the NLRB nominations, have all included \npreserving the right of individual Senators to exercise their rights.\n  If we go to the nuclear option--which I understand some of my \ncolleagues are now frustrated to the point where they would like to--\nmeaning that 51 votes will now determine either nominees or other rules \nof the Senate, we will destroy the very fabric of the Senate; that is, \nthat it requires a larger than numerical majority in order to govern.\n  I understand the frustration of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle. It is interesting that well over half of my colleagues in \nthe Senate have been here less than 6 or 7 years. The majority of my \nfriends on the other side have not been in the minority. The majority \nof my colleagues on this side have not been in the majority. I have \nbeen in both. When this side was in the majority, I watched how out of \nfrustration we wanted to curtail the 60-vote criteria and go to 51 \nbecause we were frustrated over the appointment of judges. That was \nback in 2005. I watched my colleagues on the other side want to go to \n51 votes because of their frustration over the motion to proceed. I \nhave watched and understand the frustration the majority feels because \nthey feel it is their obligation to make this body function \nefficiently.\n\n  The truth is, this body does not function efficiently nor was it \nparticularly designed to. Is there more gridlock\n\n[[Page S7703]]\n\nthan there used to be? In many respects, yes. And I believe with all my \nheart that what we just did to the American people in the shutdown of \nthe government may motivate colleagues of mine on this side as well as \nthe other side not to do this kind of thing again. Our approval rating \nwith the American people has sunk to all-time lows and they are going \nto see another expression of gridlock when we take these votes today. \nBut the cure is going to have repercussions for generations to come in \nthis body.\n  There is no reason to have a House and Senate if we go to a simple \n51-vote rule in this body. My colleagues should understand that \nsomeday--someday--this side of the aisle will be in the majority and \nthis side of the aisle will feel frustration, as we did once before \nwhen we were in the majority because of blockage from the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  I urge patience on the part of the majority leader. I urge patience \non the part of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Most of \nall I urge the kind of comity between leadership on both sides and \nindividuals on both sides.\n  I see the Senator from Virginia is here, and he has been one who has \nworked very hard to engender that in this body. Can't we work some of \nthese things out without having a showdown on this floor every single \ntime?\n  This dispute won't affect the American people. What we just did in \nthe shutdown certainly injured the lives and well-being of millions of \ninnocent Americans. Maybe we have learned from that, but I urge my \ncolleagues to understand the votes being taken on these two issues are \nin keeping with the agreement I joined in with 13 of my colleagues, \nRepublican and Democrat, back in 2005. That agreement stated that \n``signatories''--those who made the agreement--``will exercise their \nresponsibilities under the advice and consent clause of the United \nStates Constitution in good faith.''\n  In good faith. I am acting, with my vote, in good faith.\n  I see my friend the majority leader on the floor of the Senate, and I \nhope he understands this action is being taken in good faith. But I \nalso understand the frustration my friend the majority leader feels. So \nI urge my colleagues, when we get through this, to sit down, have some \nmore conversations and negotiations so we can avoid this kind of cliff \nexperience which has earned us the strong, profound, and well-justified \ndisapproval of the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, very briefly, I want to respond to my friend \nfrom Arizona.\n  I have worked with the senior Senator from Arizona on many things \nover these many years we have been in Congress together, and I heard \nwhat he said. I appreciate his suggesting we have a conversation about \nwhat is going to happen in the next couple of days and I am always \nwilling to do that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I also to want speak to the judicial \nnomination, but I want to first respond as well to the Senator from \nArizona. Let me first of all say there are few people in this body I \nhave more respect for, and there are few people in this body who have \ntime and again shown the political courage he has to put country ahead \nof party. I share a lot of his views. It is odd, but I feel sometimes \nthat I work in the only place in America where being a gang member is \nconsidered a good thing.\n  I have not served here during these times when my party was in the \nminority, and intellectually I understand Senator McCain's point, but I \nguess what I can't understand and what I can't explain to the folks all \nacross Virginia when they ask me: Why can't you guys get anything done, \nis that on any historical basis, looking at the number of times these \nprocedures have been used in the past--and clearly they have been used \nby both parties--it seems at some point, while the rights of the \nminority need to be protected, there has to be some level of common \nagreement for not exercising these tools to the extent they have been \nso that this institution becomes so dysfunctional we allow ourselves to \ndo something that in my tenure both in public and private life was \nnever as stupid as what we did during the first 3 weeks of October.\n  So I do appreciate the Senator's comments. And although I now want to \nspeak to the extraordinary qualifications of Patricia Millett, someone \nfrom Virginia, I wanted to state that I believe in the Senator's good \nfaith and I also hope we can avoid the kind of further breakdown that \nwould further disappoint the American people. I thank him for his \ncomments.\n  I do want to take a couple of moments to talk about something other \nSenators have come out to speak on, and that is the nomination the \nPresident has made of a fellow Virginian, Patricia Millett, to be part \nof the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit.\n  I have had the opportunity as Governor to appoint people to the \nbench, and I took that responsibility very seriously in terms of \nreviewing the qualifications of the candidates. I had the opportunity \nas a Senator to recommend individuals to the courts for the President's \nconsideration, and I can't think of a candidate who brings more \nqualifications, more evidence of bipartisan support, more deserving of \nappointment, than Patricia Millett.\n  We all know the DC Circuit plays an incredibly important role in our \njudicial system. We also know the court currently has 3 of its 11 seats \nvacant. I recognize that in the past this court has been the focus of \nsome debate and discussion, but the idea that we are going to somehow \nchange the rules midstream seems inappropriate. If there is a \nlegislative reason why we should change the DC Circuit Court from 11 to \nsome fewer number of judges, that ought to be fully debated, but we \nshould not hold up the confirmation of an individual whose credentials \nI believe are impeccable.\n  Ms. Millett currently chairs the Supreme Court practice at Akin Gump. \nShe went to the University of Illinois and Harvard Law School. She \nclerked on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and she \nworked on the appellate staff of the civil division of the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice.\n  She has spent over a decade in the U.S. Solicitor General's office, \nserving both Democratic and Republican administrations. During her time \nthere she was awarded the Attorney General's Distinguished Service \nAward, and as has been mentioned by my other colleagues, during her \ncareer she has argued 32 times before the Supreme Court, which until \nrecently was the highest number of cases argued by any woman in our \nhistory.\n  What is also remarkable--and the Senator from Arizona mentioned we \nneed to move past some of these partisan divisions--is that this is an \nindividual who is supported by both Democrats and Republicans.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter \nindicating that support.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     July 3, 2013.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: We are \n     former Solicitors General of the United States, and we write \n     in support of the nomination of Patricia Millett for a seat \n     on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit. Each of us has substantial first-hand \n     knowledge of Ms. Millett's professional skills and personal \n     integrity. It is our uniform view that she is supremely \n     qualified for this important position.\n       Ms Millett served for 15 years in the United States \n     Department of Justice--first as an appellate attorney in the \n     Civil Division during the George H. W. Bush Administration \n     and then for 11 years in the Solicitor General's office, \n     during the Clinton and George W. Bush Administrations. Since \n     leaving the Department, she has co-led and then led the \n     Supreme Court practice at Akin Gump. Over the course of her \n     distinguished career, Ms. Millett has argued 32 cases in the \n     Supreme Court and many more in the courts of appeals--in \n     matters that span a broad range of federal-law issues, from \n     constitutional challenges to administrative review, \n     statutory-interpretation disputes, and commercial and \n     criminal law questions. With deep experience in both private \n     and government practice, she will bring an appreciation of \n     both sides of the many important disputes before the District \n     of Columbia Circuit.\n\n[[Page S7704]]\n\n       Within the Bar, Ms. Millett has been a leader among her \n     peers, and a mentor to many other lawyers, through her \n     teaching visits to law schools and her work with a number of \n     professional associations, including the Coke Appellate Inn \n     of Court, the Supreme Court Institute, and the Opperman \n     Institute for Judicial Administration.\n       Ms. Millett has a brilliant mind, a gift for clear, \n     persuasive writing, and a genuine zeal for the rule of law. \n     Equally important, she is unfailingly fair-minded.\n       We understand there is an ongoing debate about the optimal \n     number of active judges for the District of Columbia Circuit, \n     and this letter takes no position on that issue. But if \n     additional judges are to be confirmed, we think Ms. Millett's \n     qualifications and character make her ideally suited for a \n     position on that distinguished Court. Please do not hesitate \n     to contact any of us if you have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n     Kenneth W. Starr,\n       (Solicitor General, 1989-1993).\n     Drew S. Days III,\n       (Solicitor General, 1993-1996).\n     Walter E. Dellinger,\n       (Acting Solicitor General, 1996-1997).\n     Seth P. Waxman,\n       (Solicitor General, 1997-2001).\n     Theodore B. Olson,\n       (Solicitor General, 2001-2004).\n     Paul D. Clement,\n       (Solicitor General, 2005-2008).\n     Gregory G. Garre,\n       (Solicitor General, 2008-2009).\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Ms. Millett served seven former Solicitors General from \nall ends of the political spectrum. In the letter I just referred to, \nher nomination is supported by Democrats such as Walter Dellinger as \nwell as Republicans such as Ted Olson and Ken Starr.\n  She has also been recognized by the National Law Journal as one of \nthe hundred most influential lawyers in America, and has received the \nendorsement of the American Bar Association.\n  As mentioned by the Senator from California already, she has a \nremarkable personal story as well. She is active in our community in \nVirginia, she is a resident, and actually attends church in my home \ncity of Alexandria. We saw earlier the picture of her and her husband, \nand as was mentioned before a picture is worth a thousand words. Her \nhusband was deployed a number of times as a naval reservist in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom, and earlier this month the Military Spouse \nJ.D. Network recognized Ms. Millett for her professional service and \nfor her service as a spouse of an Active-Duty participant.\n  So this incredible lawyer, this incredible community servant, this \nindividual who has the support of both Republicans and Democrats, \nshould not be denied her appointment to the DC Circuit.\n  Again, I have not been here when we were in the minority, but as has \nbeen mentioned time and again, when John Roberts--who is now, \nobviously, our Supreme Court Chief Justice--was nominated for the DC \nCircuit, he was confirmed unanimously. Even though many Democrats did \nnot share his judicial views, they viewed his qualifications as \nimpeccable.\n  I heard constantly the same from my colleagues on the other side, \nthat this is not a question of Ms. Millett's qualifications. Why should \nthis individual be denied her appropriate representation on the DC \nCourt of Appeals? So I hope, my colleagues, that we can avoid further \nthreats and counterthreats. Let's vote this individual based upon her \nqualifications. On any indication of qualifications, Patricia Millett \nis ably qualified, uniquely qualified to serve on the DC Circuit Court \nof Appeals, and I urge my colleagues to vote for her confirmation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination of Pattie \nMillett, of Alexandria, VA, to the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe DC Circuit. Ms. Millett is extremely well qualified for this \nposition, in terms of her legal expertise, experience, character, and \nintegrity. The Senate should invoke cloture on and confirm her \nnomination.\n  As one of the Nation's leading appellate lawyers, Ms. Millett \npossesses remarkable legal expertise in this area. She has litigated \nappellate cases extensively, including 32 arguments and many briefs \nbefore the U.S. Supreme Court, and 35 arguments spanning 12 of the \nFederal Circuit Courts of Appeal (including the DC Circuit). Her cases \nhave spanned the spectrum of legal issues that the DC Circuit \nconfronts, including constitutional law, administrative law, civil and \ncriminal procedure, commercial disputes, national security, and civil \nrights. Ms. Millett also has many years of experience in the public \nsector, having worked in the Office of the Solicitor General for over \n11 years, and in the Appellate Section, Civil Division of the \nDepartment of Justice for 4 years. It's important to note that her \nservice to the United States was bipartisan, spanning both Democratic \nand Republican administrations.\n  Ms. Millett graduated from Harvard Law School, magna cum laude, in \n1988 and she clerked for the Honorable Thomas Tang of the U.S. Circuit \nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for 2 years.\n  I believe Ms. Millett possesses the character and integrity necessary \nfor a nomination of this caliber. She is an active member of Aldersgate \nUnited Methodist Church, where she teaches Sunday school and visits the \nhospitalized and home-bound. For many years she has also participated \nin the Hypothermia Homeless Shelter, which operates during the winter \nmonths on the Route 1 corridor in Alexandria, preparing meals.\n  As a military spouse, Ms. Millett and her family have also sacrificed \nfor our Nation. Ms. Millett's husband was deployed during Operation \nIraqi Freedom, so she brings a unique understanding of veterans' issues \nand the stress of deployment on soldiers and their families.\n  I know there have been issues raised regarding the caseload for the \nDC Circuit. These issues do not concern me. With respect to the size of \nthe DC Circuit, Congress removed a seat under the Court Security \nImprovement Act of 2007. Today, three of the DC Circuit's eleven \nexisting seats are vacant. And three other circuits currently have \nlower caseloads per active judge than the DC Circuit. Yet, just this \nyear, the Senate confirmed nominees to two of these other circuit \ncourts--the Eighth and Tenth Circuit.\n  As Governor of Virginia, I chose two members of the Supreme Court of \nVirginia and have thought deeply about qualities that make for a strong \nappellate judge. I believe Ms. Millett is superbly qualified for a \nposition on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. I hope the Senate invokes \ncloture on her nomination today, and that she is confirmed for a \nposition on the DC Circuit.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr President, I wish to speak briefly about an \noutstanding candidate nominated to serve on the United States Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On June 4, 2013, \nPresident Obama nominated Patricia Millett to be a United States \nCircuit Judge.\n  Patricia's qualifications to be a United States Circuit Judge are \nimpeccable. She is a graduate of Harvard Law School and the University \nof Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Patricia practiced at Miller & \nChevalier and worked as a law clerk for Judge Thomas Tang, on the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. Following 4 years in the appellate section of \nthe Department of Justice's Civil Division, Patricia served as \nassistant to the Solicitor General for more than a decade.\n  After her public service, Patricia joined Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & \nFeld LLP, where she heads the firm's Supreme Court practice and is co-\nleader of its national appellate practice. She has extensive experience \narguing cases before the Supreme Court--32 in all and is without \nquestion one of the Nation's leading appellate lawyers. Patricia's \nexperience, education, and character have earned her praise from \ncolleagues and clients alike. Following her nomination, the American \nBar Association rated her unanimously well qualified to serve as a \nUnited States Circuit Judge.\n  Patricia is also a military spouse, having steadfastly stood by her \nhusband's side as he served his country in uniform for 22 years. As she \nawaits Senate confirmation, I am proud to say Patricia's nomination is \nsupported by Blue Star Families, by veterans, and active-duty members \nof the Armed Forces, who today stand with her as she prepares to serve \nher country once more. Their support is a testament to\n\n[[Page S7705]]\n\nPatricia's character and to the integrity with which she will serve as \na federal judge.\n  I rise today to not only speak in strong support of Patricia's \nnomination, but also to decry the decision by Senate Republicans to \nonce again play politics with President Obama's nominees and to place \npartisanship above all else.\n  I rise today because my colleagues in the minority have declared it \nunnecessary to fill the three vacancies on the DC Circuit, including \nthe seat to which Patricia has been nominated. The Senate Republicans \non the Judiciary Committee propose eliminating the 9th, 10th, and 11th \nseats on the DC Circuit, rather than confirming nominees put forward by \nthis President. Now, of course, my Republican colleagues dispute any \npartisan motivation. Instead, they claim a diminished caseload on the \nDC Circuit simply does not warrant confirmation of President Obama's \nnominees. This might be a persuasive argument were it not belied by \nSenate Republicans' confirmation of President Bush's nominees to these \nsame seats and by the fact that the DC Circuit caseload has been \nconsistent over the past decade and has even increased in recent years.\n  In fact, when John Roberts, now Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, \nlast held the seat Patricia would occupy, his caseload was lower than \nthe pending caseload Patricia will encounter on her first day as a \njudge. Let me be clear, the fight over this confirmation has nothing to \ndo with Patricia--instead it has everything to do with the fact that a \nDemocrat, rather than a Republican, now controls the White House. My \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle are doing everything they can \nto prevent confirmation of this President's nominees.\n  Truly, the stakes are too high for this type of political \ngamesmanship, The DC Circuit is often called the second most important \ncourt in the United States, and for good reason. The DC Circuit handles \nsome of the most complicated cases that enter the Federal court system, \nand its decisions touch the lives of Americans each and every day. From \ndecisions affecting our clean air and water, to decisions having broad \nimplications for labor relations, elections, and how we interpret and \napply the Americans with Disabilities Act--decisions by the DC Circuit \nimpact not only the quality of our lives today, but also our children's \nlives tomorrow.\n  Most importantly for our men and women in uniform, for our veterans, \nand for their families, the DC Circuit has jurisdiction over the \nDepartment of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Its \ndecisions matter to our servicemembers, to our veterans, and to their \nfamilies--which is why it is shameful that Senate Republicans would \nrather play politics than allow a clean up or down vote on Patricia's \nnomination. The American people expect more from us. They deserve more \nfrom us.\n  I urge my colleagues to set aside partisanship and politics and allow \nan up or down vote on Patricia's nomination. Through her distinguished \ncareer and public service, Patricia Millett has earned not only our \nadmiration and respect, but our support. Join me in supporting this \nnominee who is eminently qualified to serve as a United States Circuit \nJudge.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nnomination of Patricia Millett to be a Circuit Judge for the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n  As my colleagues have noted, Patricia Millett will bring a wealth of \nexperience and skill to the bench. She is a nationally recognized \nappellate attorney. She has argued 35 cases in nearly all of the \nFederal appellate courts and 32 cases at the Supreme Court. Patricia \nMillett is unquestionably qualified to serve as a judge on the DC \nCircuit Court.\n  I am proud to serve on the Senate Armed Services and Veterans' \nAffairs Committees, and I have been moved by Patricia Millett's \nexperience as part of a military family.\n  Her husband, Robert King, served in the Navy and as a Navy reservist \nuntil his retirement last year. In 2004, he was deployed to Kuwait as \npart of Operation Iraqi Freedom, and was called up again in the fall of \n2009 for Afghanistan, while Patricia cared for their 2 children, \nmaintained the household, and continued her career, arguing before the \nSupreme Court.\n  Patricia and her husband have faced what so many military families \nhave, the difficulties of deployment, the challenges of separation and \nsingle parenting at home, and the process of reintegration when a \nservicemember returns. They have shown the deepest commitment to \nserving our Nation.\n  Patricia Millett will bring these important experiences and the \ndevotion to this country unique to military families with her to the \nbench, a vital contribution to the DC Circuit given the distinct role \nit plays in adjudicating military and defense issues.\n  Much of Patricia's life has been devoted to public service, and her \ndesire to serve as an appellate judge for the important DC Circuit is a \nreflection of that commitment to serve in the public interest. I am \ndisappointed that our colleagues have blocked a vote to confirm Ms. \nMillett. I urge Senators to reconsider and support her nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The majority leader.\n\n\n                       Senator-elect Cory Booker\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, in a few minutes we are going to have the \ngood fortune of welcoming a fine young man to be the next Senator from \nthe State of New Jersey. I trust that serving in the Senate will be \namong the most rewarding experiences of his life, and he has had many \nof them.\n  I urge my fellow Senators, Democrats and Republicans, to get to know \nthis good man. I feel so elated that he is going to be here. Of course, \nI loved Frank Lautenberg. We served together for all those many years. \nBut we are going to find that Cory Booker is going to be a great asset \nto this Nation and to the Senate.\n  He has had a tough time the last few months. His parents moved to Las \nVegas in early August. And as things happen in life, his dad was \nstricken with a very violent stroke. His aunt lives there, his mom's \nsister. She is a retired dentist from California. I was there because \nof the August recess and I had the good fortune of meeting all three of \nthem. His dad, of course, was not able to communicate and, sadly, he \ndied not too long after that. But this was right before his election \nwas completed, and it was very difficult for Senator-elect Booker going \nto Nevada, campaigning with all the national publicity he had in that \nelection, but he, during this time of fire, did extremely well. I am \nvery proud of him.\n  He had a demanding year, no doubt, with all the things he was doing \nand his deciding to run for the Senate. But he traveled to Nevada on \nvarious occasions, as I indicated, to be with his family and to support \nthem. This quality he has was apparent early in life--his love of \nfamily and dedication to his parents, now especially his mom, who is \ngoing to be here today. He is not only a devoted son but a brilliant \nscholar and a dedicated public servant.\n  Think about this man's academic record: Stanford undergraduate, \nsenior class president at Stanford. That fine institution also allowed \nhim to study even more there and he earned a master's degree in \nsociology, which has served him well in the work he has done. His \nhaving this advanced degree in sociology helped him in his work with \nthe people of the State of New Jersey and the city of Newark. But with \nhim, one Stanford degree wasn't enough; he got two. And then, if that \nweren't enough--and it wasn't--he was chosen to be a Rhodes scholar and \nthen got another advanced degree at Oxford.\n  If that wasn't enough, he went to Yale Law School. This is quite a \nrecord. He has been a city councilman and mayor for more than a decade. \nHe has lived with his constituents and kept in touch with them like no \nmayor with whom I have ever come in contact. We are so fortunate to \nhave him here. He has been with his constituents in the inner city of \nNewark. I commend him for his dedicated service to the people of New \nJersey and the people of Newark.\n  Part of his job was to highlight the difficulties of working poor \nfamilies, and he did that and he did it very well. He has done \neverything he can to highlight to everyone who would listen to him and \nwatch him to indicate that many Newark residents are struggling to know \nwhere their next meal will come from. At a time in the history of this \ncountry when we have so many people needing so much, where the rich\n\n[[Page S7706]]\n\nare getting richer and the poor are getting poorer and the middle class \nis being squeezed, we are very fortunate to have this good man in the \nSenate. I am confident he will treasure his memories in this historic \nlegislative body and serve his Nation and State with distinction.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Before we have this ceremony, I wish to say one thing about \nCory Booker. I have talked about his great academic record. But for me, \na frustrated wannabe athlete, his most impressive qualification, as far \nas I am concerned, is that he was a tight end for one of the great \nStanford football teams.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/31/senate-section/article/S7706-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CERTIFICATE OF ELECTION\n\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual format.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Patricia Millett is unquestionably qualified to be the \nnext judge on the DC Circuit. The Senate will soon vote to end debate \non her nomination and I hope that the rank partisanship that shut down \nour Government earlier this month will not be on display again with \nthis upcoming vote. I hope the moderates who prided themselves in \nfinding a solution to the shutdown will agree that Ms. Millett is an \nextraordinary nominee who should not be filibustered.\n  Over the last few weeks, I have heard those who want to filibuster \nMs. Millett make some unfounded claims to justify their partisan \nagenda. First they asserted that the President is\n\n[[Page S7707]]\n\nsomehow packing the court by nominating judges to vacant seats. No \nstudent of history can honestly say that nominating candidates to \nexisting vacancies is court-packing.\n  Next, they claimed that because the last of President Bush's nominees \nto this court was not confirmed, Ms. Millett should be filibustered as \npayback. These partisans fail to note that by the time Peter Keisler \nwas nominated, four of President Bush's nominees to the DC Circuit had \nbeen confirmed. Only one of President Obama's nominees to this court \nhas been confirmed and another has been filibustered.\n  Mr. Keisler was nominated to the 11th seat on the DC Circuit--and \nwould have marked the fifth time a President Bush nominee was confirmed \nthe court and the second time a Bush nominee was confirmed to be the \n11th judge on the court. At that time, Democrats noted the hypocrisy of \nRepublicans pushing to confirm a second judge to the 11th seat on the \nDC Circuit after they had blocked Merrick Garland's nomination in 1996 \nto be the 11th judge. Judge Garland's nomination was held up until \nanother judge retired and he was confirmed to be the 10th judge on the \ncourt. Patricia Millett, however, is nominated to be the 9th judge. \nThose who are determined to filibuster this highly qualified nominee \nshould at least get their facts straight.\n  For all the discussion about the DC Circuit's caseload, you would \nthink that it had the lowest caseload of any circuit court in the \ncountry. But you would be wrong. The circuit court with the lowest \ncaseload is actually the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, which as of \nJune 30, 2013, has 1,341 total pending appeals and 134 pending appeals \nper active judge. In contrast, the DC Circuit has 1,479 total pending \nappeals and 185 pending appeals per active judge.\n  Despite the lower caseload on the Tenth Circuit, the Senate has \ncontinued to confirm nominees to that court without any complaints from \nRepublicans about the workload. Just this past year, we confirmed \nRobert Bacharach of Oklahoma to be the ninth judge on the Tenth Circuit \nand Gregory Phillips of Wyoming to be the tenth judge on the Tenth \nCircuit. We also recently held a hearing for Carolyn McHugh of Utah to \nbe the eleventh judge on the Circuit. And in the next few weeks, we \nwill hold a hearing for Nancy Moritz of Kansas to be the twelfth judge \non the Tenth Circuit. If Ms. McHugh and Ms. Moritz are both confirmed, \nthe Tenth Circuit will be at full strength with 12 active judges. \nAgain, in all the hearings and votes we have had for these Tenth \nCircuit nominees, I cannot recall a single instance where Republican \nsenators questioned the need for judges on that court.\n  Some have also cited the DC Circuit's six senior judges as a reason \nto filibuster Patricia Millett's nomination. Of course, the Tenth \nCircuit has 10 senior judges, and yet, we never hear this cited as a \nreason for not confirming nominees to existing vacancies in the Tenth \nCircuit. I hope the Senators from Oklahoma, Wyoming, Utah, and Kansas \nwill hold Patricia Millett to the same standard that the circuit \nnominees from their home state were held to or which they expect to be \nheld to.\n  Today's Washington Post editorial calls for Patricia Millett to be \nconfirmed and concludes that Republicans ``shouldn't insist on altering \nthe size of a court only when it's a Democratic president's turn to \npick judges or filibuster highly qualified nominees on that pretext.'' \nI ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record.\n  Patricia Millett is an outstanding nominee who deserves to be treated \non her merits. No argument has been lodged against her that would rise \nto the level of an extraordinary circumstance. If the Republican caucus \nfinds that despite her stellar legal reputation and commitment to her \ncountry that somehow a filibuster is warranted, I believe this body \nwill need to consider anew whether a rules change should be in order. \nThat is not a change that I want to see happen but if Republican \nSenators are going to hold nominations hostage without consideration of \ntheir individual merit, drastic measures may be warranted. I hope it \ndoes not come to that. I hope that the same Senators who stepped \nforward to broker compromise when Republicans shut down the Government, \nwill decide here to put politics aside and vote on the merits of this \nexceptional nominee. I also hope the same Senators who have said \njudicial nominees should not be filibustered barring extraordinary \ncircumstances will stay true to their word.\n  Ten years ago John Roberts, President Bush's nominee received a voice \nvote by the Senate. Today President Obama's nominee to that same seat, \nPatricia Millett, is being filibustered. What has changed in 10 years? \nThe caseload of that court under any measure has remained constant or \ngone up slightly in the past 10 years so that is just a partisan \npretext.\n  Let us treat this extraordinary nominee based on her qualifications. \nPatricia Millett has honorably served this Nation for so many years and \nwe are better off for it. I urge my fellow Senators to vote for \ncloture. Do not filibuster this brilliant lawyer, this military spouse, \nthis exceptional nominee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 30, 2013]\n\n                 Stripping a Court as a Political Ploy\n\n       It would have been hard for President Obama to nominate a \n     less controversial person to join the U. S. Court of Appeals \n     for the District of Columbia Circuit, the second-most-\n     important court in the land. So why are a lot of Republicans \n     probably going to vote against moving forward with Patricia \n     Millett's nomination on Thursday?\n       Ms. Millett is one of three people the president picked to \n     fill three open slots on the court, a high-profile perch in \n     the judiciary that reviews weighty matters such as regulation \n     of Wall Street and the environment. A lawyer who has \n     extensive experience arguing cases before the Supreme Court, \n     she has gold-plated bipartisan credentials, having served in \n     the Justice Department under the presidencies of Bill Clinton \n     and George W. Bush. A raft of legal luminaries has endorsed \n     her, including conservative former solicitors general Ted \n     Olson, Paul Clement and Kenneth Starr. Even conservative GOP \n     senators admit she is well-qualified.\n       But instead of being judged on her merits, Ms. Millett may \n     well end up a victim of a GOP campaign against allowing any \n     more of Mr. Obama's nominees onto the D.C. Circuit. Though \n     Republicans pushed to fill its 11 seats when George W. Bush \n     was president, they now argue that it doesn't need more than \n     its current eight judges, and that Mr. Obama is trying to \n     ``pack'' the court. Some have backed a bill from Sen. Charles \n     E. Grassley (R-Iowa) that would strip the court of its \n     vacancies rather than consider the president's duly appointed \n     picks to fill them. A war of dueling numbers on the D.C. \n     Circuit's workload has ensued. Republicans insist that it \n     doesn't take as many cases as other appeals courts do. \n     Democrats respond that the D.C. Circuit must consider more \n     complex cases than others.\n       But the answer doesn't matter. Even if Republicans are \n     right, they shouldn't insist on altering the size of a court \n     only when it's a Democratic president's turn to pick judges \n     or filibuster highly qualified nominees on that pretext. \n     These moves are transparently self-serving, and would \n     encourage similar behavior by Democrats against Republican \n     presidents.\n       The recent history of the confirmation process is a steady \n     descent into unreasonable partisanship; if acted upon, the \n     Republicans' position would be another step down. It might \n     also provoke another unnecessary battle over Senate rules, \n     which could reshape the chamber in ways both parties would \n     regret.\n       If Republicans are genuinely concerned that the D.C. \n     Circuit has too many slots allotted to it, the fair way to \n     trim it down would be to limit future presidents from filling \n     seats that come open in the next presidential term and \n     thereafter. In the meantime, President Obama's picks deserve \n     the same fair treatment and respect as any others. Under that \n     standard, Ms. Millett should fly through confirmation on \n     Thursday.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I want to illustrate why this seat \ndoesn't need to be filled. These are the other circuits. The average of \nthose other circuits is 383 caseloads. The DC Circuit has 149, so \nworkload doesn't demand it.\n  Secondly, we are in a situation where this administration has said: \n``If Congress won't, I will.'' He is going to do it by executive order. \nThis is a court that can rule for or against the executive orders of \nthis administration. We need to maintain checks and balances of the \ngovernment.\n  Also, each one of these seats costs $1 million, and not just for 1 \nyear, but every year for the rest of the life of those judges who are \nserving full time. I ask that my colleagues vote against this cloture \nmotion.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 \nmore minutes equally divided.\n\n[[Page S7708]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am sure the Senator is concerned about \ncosts. Yet, the same Senators blocking Patricia Millett's confirmation \nwere not concerned when an unnecessary shutdown of the government cost \nthe taxpayers billions of dollars.\n  I also note that under President Bush, there were 11 judges on the DC \nCircuit Court of Appeals with a lower caseload. Now there are 8 judges \nwith a higher caseload. The numbers are the numbers.\n  President Obama is being treated differently than President Bush was. \nPatricia Millett is being treated differently than John Roberts was. It \nis not fair, it is not an extraordinary circumstance, and there is no \njustification for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. What that doesn't take into consideration is that there \nare six senior status judges on this court. Chief Judge Garland told us \nthat their workload is the equivalent of 3\\1/4\\ judges. So presently \nthere are enough judges to go around and that would equal 11\\1/4\\ \njudges. There are 8 judges there now plus the 3\\1/4\\ that have senior \nstatus. There are plenty of reasons not to fill any more seats on this \ncourt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nnomination of Patricia Ann Millett, of Virginia, to be United States \nCircuit Judge for the District of Columbia Circuit, shall be brought to \na close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS (when his name was called). ``Present.''\n  Mr. HATCH (when his name was called). ``Present.''\n  Mr. ISAKSON (when his name was called). ``Present.''\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I come to the floor to discuss the first \npolicy-focused legislation I am introducing as a Senator. I believe it \nwill be a win for Massachusetts and a win for the Nation. But before I \ndo so, I would like to comment briefly about another win last night for \nMassachusetts and for Red Sox Nation everywhere.\n  Behind the mighty bat of Big Papi, the tireless and tough arms of Jon \nLester, John Lackey, and Koji Uehara, and the incredible power of the \nbeard, this unlikely Red Sox team took us from last in the division to \nfirst in the world.\n  For many of us in Massachusetts, this was not just about baseball. \nBecause on Patriots' Day, when the Sox play in the morning and New \nEngland comes together for a celebration, evil visited our city at the \nBoston Marathon this year.\n  While this team cannot bring back the lives we lost or heal the \nwounds inflicted, it did what no other team besides the Red Sox can do: \nIt reaffirmed our common bond in Massachusetts, in New England, and \nwith Red Sox Nation fans everywhere.\n  It is often said that baseball is a game of inches. But it is also a \ngame that can span miles, bringing people together across entire \ncommunities and cultures, bridging differences and building \nfriendships. That is what Red Sox baseball did for Boston, for \nMassachusetts, and for New England this year, when we needed it the \nmost. The Red Sox gave us the chance to all raise our hands in triumph \nonce again together as one.\n  The Red Sox came back to win in dozens of games. They never gave up. \nThey fought to the last pitch in every game, showing the resilience \nthat reflected the response of an entire city and region after the \nmarathon tragedy, and in doing so they gave us so much more than \nentertainment. They gave us hope, something to cheer for, and something \nelse to talk about at a time of deep sadness in our region.\n  As the song says: ``Don't worry about a thing, `cause every little \nthing gonna be all right.'' Watching the celebrations last night in and \naround Fenway and especially on Boylston Street, just a brief distance \nfrom the marathon finish, reminds me of how proud I am to represent \nthis great city and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the Senate.\n  The Sox team that won the World Series in 2004 allowed us to release \n86 years of disappointment. This year's team allowed us to cheer again \nafter months of mourning. For that, we congratulate and thank the 2013 \nWorld Series champions, the Boston Red Sox.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Markey pertaining to the introduction of S. 1627 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. MARKEY. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I offer my congratulations to the \nSenator from Massachusetts for the World\n\n[[Page S7709]]\n\nSeries victory by the Boston Red Sox, and I know it is a happy day in \nhis State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/31/senate-section/article/S7709-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7709-S7710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DC CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I wish to return to the issue of the DC \nCircuit Court of Appeals, because even though we had an earlier cloture \nvote where the Senate decided to continue debate and not close off \ndebate on this issue, I anticipate the majority leader will bring to \nthe Senate floor the other two nominees which have now cleared the \nSenate Judiciary Committee for the three seats President Obama has said \nhe wants to fill and is asking for the advice and consent of the \nSenate.\n  I wanted to make sure we all understand exactly what this debate is \nabout. At this very moment, there are plenty of U.S. appellate courts \nthat urgently need judges to handle their existing caseload. As my \nfriend, the distinguished Presiding Officer, knows as a former attorney \ngeneral, there are a lot of district courts around the country, Federal \ndistrict courts, that could use additional personnel because they are \nwhat are called judicial emergencies because they have such heavy \ncaseloads. They need more help. So why in the world would we want to \nadd more judges to a court that does not have enough work for them to \ndo? That is exactly what this debate is all about. It is not about the \nspecific nominees. It is not an ideological battle that we are all \nfamiliar with so much as it is one of practical economics.\n  Between 2005 and 2013, the total number of written decisions per \nactive judge on the DC Circuit declined by 27 percent. From 2005 to \n2013, the number of written decisions per active judge went down by \nalmost one-third, 27 percent. The number of appeals filed with the \ncourt went down by 18 percent.\n  As of September 2012, both the total number of appeals filed with the \nDC Circuit and the total number of appeals decided by the DC Circuit \nper active judge were 61 percent below the national average. You can \nsee from this chart that has been prepared by the office of the ranking \nmember, Senator Grassley, how the 13 circuit courts of appeals compare \nwhen it comes to the number of cases or appeals filed per active judge.\n  In red is the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, the lowest caseload, the \nfewest number of cases of any circuit court in the Nation. Conversely, \nthe 11th Circuit out of Atlanta has 778 cases or appeals filed per \nactive judge. So I do not know why you would want to take three new \njudges and assign them to the court with the lowest caseload per active \njudge. It makes absolutely no sense.\n  By the way, the average for the circuit courts, all 13 circuit \ncourts, is 383 cases or appeals filed per active judge; again, the \naverage for the entire Nation being 383 appeals per active judge. The \nDC Circuit, to which President Obama wants to add 3 additional new \njudges, is 149, almost one-third.\n  One other sort of unique thing about the DC Circuit Court of Appeals \nis while many of these courts are very busy and, indeed, are overworked \nrelative to the other circuit courts, the DC Circuit Court is perhaps \nthe only court in the Nation that literally took a 4-month break \nbetween May and September of this year because they could. They did not \nhave enough work to do, so they took a break. They took 4 months off \nbetween May and September.\n  The bottom line is that this court is not one that needs more judges. \nIn fact, one of the current members of the DC Circuit told Senator \nGrassley, our colleague from Iowa, ``If anymore judges are added now, \nthere won't be enough work to go around.''\n  So what is this all about? Why are my friends across the aisle \nignoring the needs of other appellate courts and other jurisdictions \naround the country that have, as the judicial administration office \nterms it, judicial emergencies because they have so much work to do \nthat they need help? Why are my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle ignoring those courts where there are needs in favor of a court \nwhere there is no demonstrated need?\n  Here is perhaps one reason why: The DC Circuit Court of Appeals, \nbeing located in Washington, DC, does have a unique caseload. I would \nsay the types of cases they consider are not particularly more \ncomplicated. I do not buy that argument. Many of them are \nadministrative appeals, which, as the Presiding Officer knows, are \nhighly deferential to the administration. It is usually an abuse-of-\ndiscretion standard, which is, as I say, very deferential.\n  But the reason why the DC Circuit Court of Appeals is the subject of \nso much focus, whether it is a Republican President or a Democratic \nPresident, is because it is often called the second most important \ncourt in the Nation by virtue of its docket, the kinds of cases it \ndecides.\n  Indeed, this was a court that, before the Supreme Court held portions \nof the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional, actually affirmed the \nconstitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, primarily because they \ndid not feel it was their prerogative to hold it unconstitutional, \nrather than--and defer to the Supreme Court which ultimately had the \nability to overrule old cases and reach that result.\n  But this court wields tremendous influence over regulatory and \nconstitutional matters. The truth is, I will show you a few quotes here \nin a moment that Senator Reid and the President hope that by adding \nthree more judges to the court, they can transform it into a \nrubberstamp for the Obama administration agenda.\n  Right now there is a balance on the court. There are four judges who \nwere nominated by a Republican President, there are four judges on the \ncourt nominated by a Democratic President. Yet my friends across the \naisle have been condemning the DC Circuit Court without justification, \nin my view. They have been condemning it as a bastion of partisanship, \nextreme ideology.\n  The facts do not bear that out. As I said, remember, this is the same \ncourt that actually upheld the President's health care law as \nconstitutional. It is the same court that twice upheld the President's \nexecutive order on embryonic stem cell research. It is the same court \nthat has ruled in favor of the Obama administration in the majority of \nenvironmental cases that have come before it, including ones related to \nthe regulation of greenhouse gasses, ethanol-blended gasoline, and \nmountaintop removal coal mining. That does not sound like a radical, \nideological court to me. It sounds like it is a court doing its job \nwithout fear or favor, in an impartial way, administering justice, not \nengaging in crass partisanship or tilting at ideological windmills.\n  Of course, the critics of the court do not mention those decisions I \nmentioned when they are criticizing the court. Instead, they point to \nthree separate rulings where the Obama administration did not fare so \nwell.\n  The first one of those was a ruling that struck down the Securities \nand Exchange Commission proxy access rule which has to do with \ncorporate governance. I know that sounds like a lot of mumbo jumbo, but \nbasically the court found that the agency had failed to conduct a \nproper cost-benefit analysis. We all understand what that means. The \nstatute actually requires the agency to conduct a cost-benefit \nanalysis, but the agency did not do it. It ignored the letter of the \nlaw, and the DC Circuit ordered the administrative agency to follow the \nlaw and engage in that kind of cost-benefit analysis.\n  The second ruling that the critics of the recent court point out came \nin August of 2012 when the court invalidated the EPA's cross-State air \npollution rule, saying it would impose massive emissions reduction \nrequirements on certain States without regard to the limits imposed by \nthe statutory text. In other words, when an administrative agency such \nas the EPA issues rules and regulations, they do not do so in a vacuum \nor in a void. They are necessarily guided by the authority given to \nthem and the limitations imposed upon them by the laws that Congress \nwrites. They are free, within that statutory mandate, to write rules \nand regulations, but they are not free to ignore them or to engage in \nrulemaking that basically goes counter to the direction of Congress.\n  So in this case, one that is cited by some of the critics, the court \nheld the Clean Air Act does got give the EPA boundless authority or \nunlimited authority to regulate emissions. A court requiring an \nadministrative agency to work within its legal authority I think is \ncommon sense. Otherwise, you would have administrative agencies free to\n\n[[Page S7710]]\n\nchart their own path without regard to any kind of guidance or \nlegitimacy conferred by Congress in terms of regulation.\n  Remember, these administrative agencies are very powerful entities. \nSome say they are the fourth branch of government. There is a lot of \nconcern that I have, that many people have, about overregulation and \nits damage to our economy. The very least the courts ought to do is \nmake sure that they are operating within their mandate and the \nlimitations imposed upon them by Congress. That is what the court did \nin this cross-State air pollution rule.\n  By the way, Texas was caught up in this rulemaking process without \neven having an opportunity to be heard and to challenge the modeling of \nthe EPA. Due process is a pretty fundamental notion in our laws, in our \njurisprudence. Texas, in that instance, was denied any opportunity for \nbasic due process of law, another reason why the court made the right \nruling.\n  The third case that has drawn the ire of some critics across the \naisle on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals has to do with two \nPresidential recess appointments. Every President basically has made \nrecess appointments, but no President has done what this President has \ndone. It violated the Constitution when doing so. In other words, \nbasically President Obama said: Notwithstanding the fact that the \nConstitution gives advice and consent responsibility to the Senate--\nthat is in the Constitution--the President basically in this instance \ndecided when Congress was going to be in recess, for the purposes of \ninvoking this extraordinary power, basically said the President was \ngoing to decide when we were in recess.\n  Essentially, as some pundits said, basically the President was \nclaiming an authority to be able to appoint judges using the recess \nappointment power when we are ``taking a lunch break.'' That cannot be \nthe law. It is not the law. That is what the DC Circuit Court said. So \nthe DC Circuit Court said President Obama's legal rationale for \nappointments and the role of the Senate in advice and consent and the \nconfirmation proceedings would ``eviscerate the Constitution's \nseparation of powers.''\n  That is what the DC Circuit said about President Obama's claim to \nhave the extraordinary power to make recess appointments and bypass the \nconfirmation of the Senate in the Constitution.\n  You might wonder if the court has actually been pretty evenhanded in \nterms of its decisionmaking process, you might wonder if it has the \nlightest caseload per judge in the Nation and there are other courts \nthat need help a lot more, you might wonder what is going on here. Why \ndoes President Obama feel so strongly, why does Senator Reid feel so \nstrongly, why does the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee that I serve on feel so strongly that they want to move these \nthree judges through, even though there is no need for these judges on \nthe DC Circuit Court?\n  Well, I am sorry to reach the conclusion, but I think the evidence is \noverwhelming that what the President is trying to do by nominating \nthese unneeded judges to this critical court, the second most powerful \ncourt in the Nation, is he is trying to pack the court in order to \naffect the outcomes.\n  I know my friends across the aisle do not like that term, court \npacking. Students of history remember when Franklin Delano Roosevelt \nclaimed the power to appoint additional Supreme Court Justices. That \nwas held to be an unconstitutional court packing. But I do not know \nwhat else you would call this, if you are going to try to jam three \nadditional judges on this court that are not needed, the second most \nimportant court in the Nation, in order to change the outcome of those \ndecisions and to rubberstamp the administration's expansive policies. I \ndo not know what else you would call it other than court packing. I \nthink a fair interpretation or fair definition of court packing is when \nyou add judges to a court for the explicit purpose of securing \nfavorable rulings.\n  That is exactly what Democrats are trying to do with these \nnominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I wish to quote our friend Senator Reid, the majority \nleader of the Senate. His candor is, again, remarkable and very clear. \nHe said:\n\n       We are focusing very intently on the DC Circuit. We need at \n     least one more.\n\n  By that he means one more judge. Continuing:\n\n       There are three vacancies. We need at least one more and \n     that will switch the majority.\n\n  When the court sits en banc, when all judges decide to sit on the \nmost important cases, then President Obama will have a majority of \nnominees on that court. They will be able to outvote the Republican \nnominees on the court.\n  Senator Schumer is complaining about some of the cases I mentioned a \nmoment ago, and he concludes: ``We will fill up the DC Circuit one way \nor another.''\n  I believe that the evidence is overwhelming that the motivation at \nplay here is one to make sure that this court becomes a rubberstamp for \nthe big government policies of this administration. That is why they \nare ignoring appellate courts that actually need the help, and they are \ntrying to stack the court in the second highest court in the land. That \nis why they are also threatening--we heard a little bit of that today, \nrattling that saber once again--the nuclear option to try to confirm \njudges with a simple majority rather than the 60-vote cloture \nrequirement under the Senate rules.\n  We have a good-faith solution. This is Senator Grassley's bill, which \nwould allocate these three unneeded judges to places where they are \nactually needed. This is the kind of idea that our colleagues across \nthe aisle embraced repeatedly when one of the judges from the DC \nCircuit was reallocated to the Ninth Circuit in 2007.\n  If our friends across the aisle continue to move ahead with their \ncourt-packing gambit, it will make this Chamber even more polarized \nthan it already is. I only hope they choose a different course. This is \nwhy we are committed on this side of the aisle to stopping these \nnominations to these unneeded judges in this court and making sure that \njudges are placed where they are needed so they can engage in a fair \nand efficient administration of justice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I wish to enter into a colloquy with \nmy great friend from Missouri, Senator Blunt.\n  I wish to make a comment, if my colleague will excuse me. I have to \nsay I am amazed to hear that we are court packing when what we are \ntalking about is trying to fill three vacancies on a court. I hadn't \nheard that before with other Presidents. Hopefully, we can fill \nvacancies and try to do it in a bipartisan way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/31/senate-section/article/S7710-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7710-S7712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I very much wish to thank a great \nfriend and colleague, Senator Blunt, for joining me today on the floor \nand in leadership on some very important community mental health \nlegislation.\n  We have an opportunity to get something done with this issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent to proceed with the colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. We wish to do this today because today marks the 50th \nanniversary to the day that President John F. Kennedy signed into law \nthe Community Mental Health Act. The good news is he signed this act. \nThe unfortunate news is it was the last act he signed in his life.\n  Today we want to recognize what that has meant to so many people \nacross the country. This put in place the ability to serve people in \nthe community who have mental health issues, rather than only being in \ninstitutions, being able to serve people closer to home, at home or to \nbe able to give them the opportunity to get the help they need and \nstill be active and successful in the community.\n  I think so many of us have been touched by mental health issues, \nwhich is part of physical--it is not mental and physical health. I \nthink it is about time. I know my friend would agree that we start \ntreating illnesses above\n\n[[Page S7711]]\n\nthe neck differently than illnesses below the neck. It is all about \ncomprehensive health care. We have all been touched in some way.\n  My father went undiagnosed with a bipolar disorder for 10 years when \nI was growing up. When he finally received the help he needed, the \nmedication he needed, he was able to work and be successful for the \nrest of his life. I wish to make sure every family has that \nopportunity.\n  I know for President Kennedy it was his younger sister Rosemary who \nwas institutionalized in the early 1940s and that brought him to this \nissue as well as to other passionate concerns that he had. President \nKennedy saw a way to improve the lives of people such as his sister \nliving with a mental illness by providing service in the community and, \nfrankly, lowering the stigma on mental health. We still have a long way \nto go on reducing the stigma and understanding that it is, in most \noccasions, a physiological change in the brain, a chemical imbalance, \nsomething that needs to be treated appropriately, and that is certainly \nnot a choice by an individual.\n  President Kennedy thought we needed to make sure we were providing \nthe very best for the people in this community. In his statement to \nCongress he wrote:\n\n       We need a new type of health facility, one which will \n     return mental health care to the mainstream of American \n     medicine, and at the same time, upgrade mental health \n     services.\n\n  We have worked together in a bipartisan way since then. The Mental \nHealth Parity and Addiction Equity Act was championed by our friends \nand colleagues, Senators Pete Domenici, Paul Wellstone, Ted Kennedy, \nand Congressman Patrick Kennedy in the House, and it became law. It \nsaid we have to have parity in how insurance companies treat mental \nhealth and physical health.\n  I was pleased to get those provisions into health reform, but there \nis more to do and that is why we are here.\n  I wish to turn to my friend from Missouri, who has been a great \npartner and ask, as we go forward, what his thoughts are on this day \nand what we should continue to do to continue with this legacy.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I wish to say it is a very important topic, and it is a \nmoment when there are many reasons, as the Senator said, that we should \nkeep returning to it.\n  It was this day 50 years ago when President Kennedy signed the \nCommunity Mental Health Act. He called it a ``bold new approach.'' \nFrankly, while some things happened in the 50 years since then and now, \nthere haven't been that many bold new approaches in the last 50 years.\n  This is a topic that for whatever reason our society hasn't dealt \nwith in ways that have been satisfactory in making great changes. In \nfact, some of what we have done in other areas has made it harder for \ncommunities and families to work with people who have behavioral \nchallenges, to find out the information that person does not want to \nshare with them.\n  All of us can probably think of some family where this has happened, \nwhere someone still has an ongoing commitment to an adult son or \ndaughter, mom or dad, and are part of what they are doing. They are \npaying some bills or whatever. The information that people would \nbenefit from knowing is hard to get to or the requirement that somebody \nfollow up on a court-ordered procedure is difficult to enforce and make \nthat happen.\n  This is one of the times when we really need to be thinking what do \nwe need to do to make this challenging work better.\n  First, it is a widespread problem, but it is not a problem that is \nuntreatable. There is one statistic I have seen from the National \nInstitutes of Mental Health: ``One in four adults suffers from a \ndiagnosable mental disorder'' that is diagnosable and, in virtually \nevery case, treatable--one in four.\n  This is not a stigma. This is not something where you are the only \nperson this has ever happened to or to your loved ones, that this is \nthe only person this has ever happened to. This is something that many \nfamilies understand. Many people have a challenge that never gets \ndiagnosed, frankly.\n  Creating a way for that to happen, where we make it easier, we make \nit more comfortable, and we make it affordable--whatever we are doing \nto allow that, in almost every case, the treatable problem to be \ndiagnosed and treatable is important.\n  One of the topics the Senator and I started talking about almost at \nthe very first of this year--we have been talking about this for almost \n10 months. Of course, it was after the tragedy at Newtown. One thing we \nknow is that somebody who has a mental health problem is much more \nlikely to be the victim of a crime than they are to be the perpetrator \nof a crime.\n  The other thing we know is that as we look at these tragedies we have \nseen happen in the last few years, the one common denominator--whether \nit was in Newtown, Aurora, Tucson, the Navy Yard or Virginia Tech, \nwhether it was at a supermarket, at a theater or on a college campus--\nwhat we saw in every case was this was somebody who had a behavioral \nproblem, a mental health problem that hadn't been dealt with in the \nright way. In many ways this has turned the attention of the country \nback to a problem that, for whatever reason, we would just as soon \napparently not talk about.\n  In fact, when the Senate committee that deals with mental health had \na hearing in January of this year on mental health, it was the first \ntime since 2007 that there had been such a hearing devoted to this \ntopic--a topic that the National Institutes of Health said one of four \nadults is challenged by and the Senate, in 6 years, hadn't talked about \nit in any kind of official, focused way. This is why Senator Stabenow \nand I have been working to try to take advantage of the moment.\n  In the principal piece of legislation we have been working on, the \nExcellence in Mental Health Act, we also have a model that works. A \ncouple of different things were done. One, of course, was to expand the \nfederally qualified health center concept, if they wanted, to add \nbehavioral health, and they could under the same rules and regulations. \nFrankly, people would be walking through the same door as their \nneighbors.\n  We also created ways for community health centers--the very health \ncenters that President Kennedy's legislation created--to add some of \nthe advantages to be in a federally qualified center, to be in a \ncommunity mental health center.\n  Certainly the Senator's efforts--and I know we both have other \nstories to tell about other things we are working on as well, but we \nhave had great response from the community mental health centers and \ngreat response from veterans.\n  The Senator may wish to talk about that a little bit because I know \nshe has been engaged in many discussions with veterans' groups who say \nif only our veterans had a place to go that was close and where their \nneighbors were going perhaps for some other kind of behavioral health. \nWe have a wide swath of support from our veterans' groups as well as \nour health care groups.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I wish to go back to what the Senator from Missouri has \nindicated. Our veterans are coming home. We know that at least 200,000 \nof our veterans coming home will go into the community.\n  I see our distinguished chair of the Senate veterans' committee on \nthe floor. I thank the Senator for all of his good work.\n  In addition to the VA system, where we are strengthening mental \nhealth services, we know that many will come home to the communities \nand be looking to an outpatient clinic or somewhere in the community \nfor help. The reason we have strong support from the Iraq and \nAfghanistan veterans' organizations is because our Excellence in Mental \nHealth Act legislation, which creates a behavioral health clinic model \nbased on what has been done in community health that has worked so \nwell, will create an opportunity for those veterans coming home to get \nsupport and help in the community.\n  One of the most difficult statistics to talk about is that 22 of our \nveterans are committing suicide every day--22 every day. That is \nunacceptable.\n\n[[Page S7712]]\n\n  We need to make sure families and veterans have the support that they \nneed so that when they come home they can receive the help they need. I \nam very proud of the fact we have about 50 organizations supporting the \nExcellence in Mental Health Act, such as sheriffs and police officers. \nMost likely, if somebody needs help, they are placed in a jail or in \nthe emergency room. They don't go to a mental health facility.\n  What we are proposing is something that would provide 24-hour \nemergency psychiatric delivery, coupled with high quality community \nmental health services. The time is now to do this.\n  We have seen the need increase as states over the years have cut \nfunding for in-patient mental health services and have not replaced \nthem with services in the community.\n  Too often, people who need mental health treatment end up not getting \nthe treatment they need, and end up in the emergency room or, worse, in \njail. The ER and jail are not the place to treat mental illness.\n  It is fair to say that our need now is greater than ever.\n  Too many people who need treatment don't get it, including one-third \nof all people living with mood disorders and more than half of those \nwith severe mental disorders.\n  Tragically, 22 American veterans commit suicide every day. At least \n25 percent of returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan are in need \nof some form of mental health treatment.\n  We know that people suffering from mental illness are more likely to \nbe the victims of violence than the perpetrators.\n  However, we have seen too many examples of what happens when people \ndon't get the treatment they need around the country and right here in \nWashington, DC, where we've seen two tragic examples in the past 2 \nmonths, including the shootings at the Navy Yard and the woman who \ntried to drive her car into the White House and the Capitol.\n  What can we do to improve the way we treat mental health issues in \nthis country? How can we improve people's lives?\n  We need to take the final step in mental health parity by \nstrengthening access to quality mental health services in communities \nacross America. That is why we need to pass the Excellence in Mental \nHealth Act that the Senator from Missouri and I have sponsored \ntogether.\n  This bill would expand access to community mental health care by \nmaking sure more providers are available to treat mental health issues \nand can offer a broad range of mental health services, such as the 24-\nhour crisis psychiatric services, integrated preventive screenings, \nintegrated treatment for mental illness and substance abuse, and \nexpanded peer support and counseling services for patients and \nfamilies.\n  This bill can help fulfill the legacy of President Kennedy's \nCommunity Mental Health Act and the Mental Health Parity and Addiction \nEquity Act.\n  There will be health care legislation coming to the floor before the \nend of this year to address physician payments, and that would be a \nnatural place to address the Excellence in Mental Health Act.\n  I hope our colleagues will join us in supporting critical efforts to \naddress mental health care in this country, and I hope they will join \nus in moving this proposal forward so we can get closer to this goal.\n  I wish to turn to my colleague, the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri for closing remarks. He has been a true champion for mental \nhealth and a wonderful partner to me and for his views on how we can \nwork together to improve mental health treatment in America.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I would just say that both our States have led in this \narea. Missouri has clearly been a pioneer in mental health efforts. Our \ncommunity health centers--many of them--have added behavioral health in \nthe last few years. There are other pieces of legislation out there \nthat add to this mental health first aid, where people, particularly \ndealing with young people, can take a course. And they do not become \npeople who can deal with your problem, but they may help you recognize \nif you have a problem and that somebody needs to deal with this.\n  In 2011, Missouri pioneered a program for Medicaid beneficiaries with \nsevere mental illness that is based in community mental health centers \nand provides care coordination and disease management to address the \n``whole person,'' including both mental illness and chronic medical \nconditions. This combination saves money.\n  I have worked closely with the Missouri Coalition of Community Health \nCenters, which just celebrated their 35th anniversary and they are very \nexcited about how this legislation could benefit the population they \nare serving.\n  I also co-sponsored the Mental Health First Aid Act of 2013 to help \npeople identify, understand and respond to the signs of mental \nillnesses and addiction disorders through a pilot program for mental \nhealth first aid training. In my State, we are already benefitting from \nthis program and in August over 100 new mental health first aiders were \ncertified during Missouri's first large-scale mental health first aid \ntraining.\n  In addition, I co-sponsored the Justice and Mental Health \nCollaboration Act to improve access to mental health services for \npeople in the criminal justice system. This bill would give law \nenforcement officers the tools they need to identify and respond to \nmental health issues, while continuing to support mental health courts \nand crisis intervention teams.\n  These bills--all of which have garnered bipartisan support--are steps \nin the right direction.\n  I hope Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid will allow stand-alone votes \non mental health legislation, and I hope President Obama will work with \nmembers from both parties to improve our Nation's policies before \nanother mental health crisis results in senseless loss.\n  I agree with Senator Stabenow that the time is now. We are actually \nprobably beyond the time we should have done this. But we would be ill-\nadvised to go further down this road without looking at this system and \nfiguring out how we can improve it. There are many bipartisan ideas in \nthe Senate, and I believe the Excellence in Community Health Act is \nright at the top of that list. But we need to look at this, do it, and \ndo it now. I look forward to seeing something happen on this between \nnow and the end of the year.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I again thank my friend from Missouri \nfor his commitment and for working with so many colleagues across the \naisle on a bipartisan basis. I believe we will get this done and we \nwill now, on this 50th anniversary of President Kennedy's signing the \nCommunity Mental Health Act, complete the circle in terms of mental \nhealth parity in our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/31/senate-section/article/S7712-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7712-S7714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. First of all, I congratulate the Senator from Michigan \nand the Senator from Missouri for touching on what is obviously a very \nserious national issue; that is, how we deal with the crisis of mental \nhealth in this country. I thank both of them for the work they are \ndoing.\n  I would like to say a few words as a member of the conference \ncommittee on the budget, which is hoping to avert another government \nshutdown and come up with a sensible long-term budget for our country.\n  The first point I would make is that when I return from Vermont and \ncome here to Capitol Hill, I am always amazed at how different the \nworld view is here as opposed to the real world--whether it is Vermont \nor when I travel to other States around the country. It almost seems as \nif we are living on two separate planets.\n  As a member of the Budget Committee, I understand, as do the American \npeople, that a $17 trillion national debt and a $700 billion deficit is \na serious issue that must be addressed. The American people know that, \nbut what they also understand is that there is an even more important \nissue out there; that is, real unemployment today is close to 14 \npercent. Youth unemployment--an issue Pope Francis is beginning to talk \nabout a great deal--in this country is approximately 20 percent. \nAfrican-American youth unemployment is over 40 percent.\n\n[[Page S7713]]\n\n  The American people are saying: Yes, deal with the deficit, but do \nnot forget that we continue to have a major economic crisis with \nmillions of Americans unemployed. And for many other Americans who are \nworking, their wages are deplorably low. We have millions of folks \nworking for $8 or $9 an hour who cannot take care of their families \nunder those wages.\n  While the middle class is disappearing and the number of people \nliving in poverty is at an alltime high, we also have another dynamic \nwe don't talk about too much here for obvious reasons; that is, the \nwealthiest people are doing phenomenally well, corporate profits are at \nrecordbreaking levels, and the gap between the very wealthy and \neverybody else is growing wider and wider. We are surrounded by \nlobbyists representing the wealthy and large corporations, and they \ndon't really like that discussion, so we don't talk about that too \nmuch, but it remains absolutely true.\n  When I go home and talk to Vermonters or when I go around the \ncountry, people tell me--and the polls tell me--that the American \npeople--regardless of political persuasion, by the way--are in \nsignificant agreement about a lot of issues. We don't see that \nreflected here, but the American people are in significant agreement. \nIf we ask the American people, I suspect, in North Dakota, Vermont, \nMaryland, or anywhere else whether they think we should cut Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid, they would overwhelmingly say no.\n  These are tough economic times. Poverty is going up among seniors. \nPeople are worried about health care costs, and these programs are \nvital to the survival of so many people. So do not cut Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid. That is not what Bernie Sanders is saying; that \nis what the American people are saying. That is what Democrats are \nsaying, that is what Republicans are saying, that is what Independents \nare saying, and that is what people who agree with the tea party are \nsaying. There is not a whole lot of dispute outside of Washington, but \ninside Washington the picture becomes a little different. We have \nvirtually all Republicans talking about cutting Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid. We have the President talking about cutting \nSocial Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. We have some Democrats talking \nabout it. But that is not what the American people believe.\n  According to the latest poll I have seen on this issue--the National \nJournal/United Technologies poll--81 percent of the American people do \nnot want to cut Medicare, 76 percent of the American people do not want \nto cut Social Security, and 60 percent of the American people do not \nwant to cut Medicaid. So I have a very radical idea for my colleagues. \nWhat about occasionally--we don't have to overdo it--listening to the \npeople who sent us here? What they are saying is they do not want to \ncut these terribly important programs.\n  Second of all, what do the American people want? What they want is \nfor us to invest in our infrastructure and create the millions of jobs \nwe desperately need. According to a Gallup poll of March 3, 2013, 75 \npercent of the American people--that includes 56 percent of \nRepublicans, 74 percent of Independents, and 93 percent of Democrats--\nsupport ``a federal jobs creation law [that would spend government \nmoney for a program] designed to create more than 1 million new jobs.''\n  The American people are saying: Yes, the deficit is important, but \nwhat is more important is creating jobs, and rebuilding our crumbling \ninfrastructure is one way to do it, but don't cut Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid.\n  What else are the American people saying? Well, not too surprisingly, \nwhen we see so much income and wealth inequality in America, the \nAmerican people believe that when 95 percent of all new income in the \nlast few years has gone to the top 1 percent, given the fact that the \nwealthy are doing phenomenally well, maybe they should be asked to pay \na little more in taxes, and maybe we should end all of the corporate \nloopholes that currently exist.\n  Again, that is not Bernie Sanders. According to a January 29, 2013, \npoll by Hart Research Associates, 66 percent of the American people \nbelieve the wealthiest 2 percent should pay more in taxes and 64 \npercent of the American people believe large corporations should pay \nmore in taxes than they do today.\n  The American people are giving us a solution to the major crises \nfacing the American people. They want to invest in our economy, they \nwant to create jobs, they want to ask the wealthy and large \ncorporations to pay more in taxes, and they do not want to cut Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid. That is the real world, but then when \nwe come back to Washington, what are people saying? Let's cut Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid; let's not invest in our \ninfrastructure and create jobs; and, in fact, let's give more tax \nbreaks to the wealthy and large corporations. This is an ``Alice in \nWonderland'' world. The American people are saying one thing and the \nlobbyists around here and many Members of Congress are saying something \nvery different.\n\n  The deficit is an important issue, and we should be proud, by the \nway, that we have cut the deficit in half in the last few years. We \nhave more to go, but we should take some credit for that. But when we \ntalk about the deficit, it is very important for us to remember how we \ngot to where we are today--a $17 trillion national debt and a $650 \nbillion-or-so deficit.\n  I find it interesting that some of those people who were most active \nin causing the deficit are now standing up saying: Oh, I am really \nworried about this deficit that I helped cause; therefore, we have to \ncut all these programs that working people and children and the elderly \nneed. So let's take a brief look back into the recent past and find out \nhow we got to where we are today and who voted for those programs.\n  As I hope most Americans know, in January 2001 when President Clinton \nleft office and President Bush took over, this country had a $236 \nbillion surplus--a $236 billion surplus. That is quite a large surplus. \nThe Congressional Budget Office projected that the 10-year budget \nsurplus would be $5.6 trillion; that there would be a huge increase in \nour budget surplus. The projections were very strong. In fact, they \nprojected that we could erase the national debt by 2011. Imagine that. \nThat was where we were heading.\n  Well, President Bush took office and a number of things happened. We \nwent to war in Afghanistan and Iraq. I voted for the war in \nAfghanistan; I strongly opposed the war in Iraq. But be that as it may, \nmany of my friends, who are great deficit hawks, forgot to pay for \nthose wars. Those wars are estimated to cost somewhere around $6 \ntrillion. So folks who are standing up today saying: Gee, we just can't \nafford nutrition programs for children, they didn't have a problem \nvoting for two wars and not paying for them. They also did not have a \nproblem voting for huge tax breaks that went to the wealthiest people \nin this country, and they also did not have a problem voting for a \nMedicare Part D prescription drug program--written by the insurance \ncompanies, by the way, by the pharmaceutical industry--which also added \nto the deficit.\n  The point I am making is that many of the folks who are standing here \ndemanding cuts in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid voted for two \nwars, tax breaks for the rich, and an unfunded Medicare Part D program. \nThen on top of all that, we had the Wall Street crash, which resulted \nin less revenue coming in to the Federal Government. Add all that stuff \nup and you have a large deficit.\n  Let me conclude by simply saying at a time when we have massive \nwealth and income inequality in America, which is something we should \nfocus on from both a moral perspective as well as an economic \nperspective; at a time when the middle class is disappearing and \nmillions of people are working longer hours for lower wages, at a time \nwhen we have the highest rate of childhood poverty in the \nindustrialized world, at a time when senior poverty is increasing, at a \ntime when we have 20 percent youth unemployment in this country, in my \nhumble opinion, we do not balance the budget on the backs of the most \nvulnerable people in this country--working people, the elderly, the \nchildren, the sick, and low-income people. That is not what we do.\n  What we should do is go to those people who are doing very well and \nsay to\n\n[[Page S7714]]\n\nthem: You know what. Welcome to the United States of America. You are \npart of our country, and you are part of our economy. This country has \nproblems now. You, if you are a large corporation--one out of four \nlarge corporations paying nothing in Federal income taxes--you are \ngoing to have to start paying your taxes. You can't just stash your \nmoney in the Cayman Islands and in other tax havens. And if you are an \nextremely wealthy person doing well, you are going to have to \ncontribute more in tax revenue.\n  The bottom line is that we need to create jobs in this country, we \nneed to protect the most vulnerable people in this country, and we need \nto do it in a way which is morally right and which makes good economic \nsense.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/31/senate-section/article/S7714-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7714-S7715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COST OF GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, this afternoon I joined with Senator \nWarner and Senator Klobuchar and Senator Casey to point out just how \nmuch harm is caused to this country because we are governing from one \nmanufactured crisis to another. The cost of the government shutdown, \nthe cost of coming so close to defaulting on our obligations, the fact \nthat we are governing through automatic across-the-board cuts known as \nsequestration, is hurting our economy.\n  This has been particularly difficult for the people in the State of \nMaryland, the State I represent. In our region we have so many Federal \nworkers, so many Federal facilities--10 percent of our workforce works \nfor the Federal Government--that we saw many small businesses in our \ncommunities that depend upon the Federal workforce literally having \nnobody in their restaurants and in their shops. Consumer confidence was \nat an alltime low.\n  There have been estimates as to the amount of harm caused by the \ngovernment shutdown. Standard & Poor's said $24 billion was taken out \nof our economy as a result of the government shutdown. Add that to the \nextra cost because we came so close to defaulting on the debt. Add that \nto the fact that since 2011 we have been living under sequestration. \nThe estimate is we have lost about 900,000 jobs from this self-\ninflicted crisis management.\n  I could give many examples, but I will give a few.\n  I am very proud that the National Institutes of Health is based in \nthe State of Maryland. Their impact is all over this country, including \nin the State of Massachusetts. As a result of sequestration and then \nthe government shutdown, hundreds of grants could not be awarded. I \nthink it was 700 by sequestration alone.\n  What does that mean? That means young researchers don't get a grant. \nThey may stay with research, they may go to a different field, they may \ngo to a different country. It means that maybe the cure for Alzheimer's \nwill be put back a little bit or the influenza vaccine will be put back \na little bit. Literally, lives are at risk. But also, our economy is at \nrisk because the research supports so many private sector jobs. I could \ngive the same example at FDA, NIST, Beltsville Agricultural Research \nCenter, or Fort Meade. We have many examples of how our country has \nbeen harmed. We cannot govern from one manufactured crisis to another.\n  My message is I hope we will get a budget agreement--I know the \nbudget conferees met this week--which will give some predictability to \nour economy, eliminate sequestration, a progrowth budget so we can \ninvest in education, research, and modern roads, bridges, and transit \nsystems.\n  I am very optimistic about America's ability to globally compete if \nwe stop these self-inflicted crises. I have been doing a ``made in \nMaryland'' tour throughout the State where I have visited many \nbusinesses. I give credit to my colleague in the House, Congressman \nHoyer, whose saying, ``Make it in America'' has really caught on. So I \ntook my friend Congressman Hoyer's suggestion, and I went around \nMaryland to meet with different companies. Maryland businesses are the \nbest in the world. I know I am a little biased about Maryland, but they \nare the best in the world on innovation and creativity. I will give a \nfew examples which may not be self-evident.\n  The Paul Reed Smith Guitar Factory is located on the eastern shore of \nMaryland in a small community called Stevensville. Over 200 people work \nthere, and they produce the best guitars in the world and are sold all \nover the world. Santana's guitar was produced there. It is now in the \nMetropolitan Museum of Art, it is such an incredible instrument--not \nonly in beauty, but in sound--and was made right here in Maryland, USA.\n  Another company I visited during my ``Made in Maryland'' tour was the \nVolvo Mack truck plant located in Hagerstown, MD, one of the largest \nemployers in western Maryland, with good-paying jobs. They make the \nmost efficient truck engine in the world and it is produced right in \nMaryland, in the United States of America, the most innovative and \ncreative ways to deal with the problem of efficiency in trucks.\n  I visited Ernest Maier, which makes brick pavers with concrete. It is \nvery close to the Nation's capital. We can do manufacturing in America \nand we can compete in manufacturing. They are developing the technology \nfor pervious concrete. It is critically important to our environment.\n  I take great pride in the Chesapeake Bay and the work we are doing to \nclean up the Chesapeake Bay. One of the major sources of pollution \ncomes every time we have a storm and all of the runoff goes into the \ntributaries that lead into the Chesapeake Bay, causing a lot of \npollutants to come into the bay, creating dead zones. If we have \npervious concrete, allowing the water to seep rather than to flow, it \ncuts down dramatically the amount of pollution. The Ernest Maier \nCompany is doing something about cleaning up our environment as well as \nselling a product that is well received around the country.\n  We have Marlin Steel located in Baltimore. It is a small specialty \nsteel company. Their jobs are growing. One hundred percent of the \ningredients come from the United States, and their product--steel, \nmanufactured in Maryland--is exported around the world because it is a \nquality product.\n  Atlas Container is another Maryland manufacturer with a national \nmarket. I visited them. They are doing great. Their sales are up, their \nemployment is up.\n  An area which I think is particularly important to the Presiding \nOfficer is the craft beer industry. I have been up to Massachusetts and \nenjoyed some of their craft beers. There are over 100,000 jobs in the \ncraft beer industry in this country, and it is growing. Times have been \ntough--but not in the craft beer industry. It is growing.\n  I visited Flying Dog in Frederick and Heavy Seas in Baltimore. They \nare coming out with new and seasonal beers, which is keeping a market \ngrowing, using creativity, besides having a very fine product.\n  It is not just in the craft beer industry, it is also in the wine \nindustry. We have about 64 wineries in our State. I visited one in \nMontgomery County, MD. I don't know if most people know that Montgomery \nCounty, MD, produces one of the best wines in this country and can \ncompete internationally. We are very proud of what is done at Sugarloaf \nMountain Winery in Montgomery County, MD.\n  I wish to talk about some of the high-tech jobs done here. Brain \nScope has developed a portable device available in the battlefield \nwhich can tell the severity of a head wound, as to whether the warrior \nneeds immediate attention in order to save his life because of a brain \ninjury or whether they can take a little more time before treatment. It \nis inexpensive in its operations and gives the data necessary to \ndetermine brain waves and the severity of the head injury. I think the \ntotal cost was about $10 million to develop. The military is very \nappreciative of this discovery. Think about the lives it will save, and \nthink about the application of this technology to our community life. I \nthink we are always nervous when we see our children and grandchildren \non the playing field at sporting events, knowing how common head \ninjuries are. This technology can be used on the playing field to \ndetermine the severity--whether a person who suffers a head injury \nneeds to seek immediate medical attention because it is life \nthreatening or whether they just need to sit out for a while.\n\n[[Page S7715]]\n\n  This is the type of innovation and creativity taking place in \nMaryland. I can name dozens more small innovative companies working in \nbiosciences, life sciences, and cyber security areas.\n  At Brain Scope they started with two employees. They now have over \n20. This is a common story. These are good-paying jobs created here in \nMaryland, in the United States of America.\n  Lions Brothers in Owings Mills, MD. If you have ever seen a uniform \nwith emblems on it, it was most likely done at Lions Brothers. They \nhave figured out a way in which they can produce this product--which is \nused not only for sports gear, but the U.S. Government for uniforms, \nBoy Scouts, Girl Scouts.\n  What is common in each of these companies? They are innovators. They \nfind creative ways to create and expand markets. They are creating more \njobs, and they are creating good-paying jobs.\n  We could name every State in this country where we have seen this \ncreativity. We have duplicated this throughout our country. But the \nmessage is clear: Our country can take off, but we have to give \npredictability to our businesses. That is why the work being done in \nthe conference committee on the budget is so important. We can't go \nthrough another manufactured crisis, another shutdown, another \nthreatened default on our debt, the continuation of sequestration. It \nneeds to end. We need to have a budget which allows for the type of \ngovernment partnership for that type of economic growth--the basic \nresearch, the educated workforce, the modern roads and infrastructure \nand energy systems. That is what we need to have so the companies I \nmentioned can continue to lead the world in innovation, creativity, and \ncreating the jobs we need--the good-paying jobs in America.\n  If we act, I am confident America will compete and win the global \ncompetition. ``Made in Maryland'' has been a huge success and has been \nduplicated all over our country. Let us act and get our work done so we \ntruly can make it in America.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren).

Madam President, I rise today to address the public \nrevelations regarding classified government surveillance programs. But \nbefore I do so, I would like to take a moment to honor Mike Landsberry, \nwho died a hero's death in Sparks, NV, last week.\n  After spotting a student with a gun at Sparks Middle School, Mr. \nLandsberry moved directly in harm's way to protect his students and \nothers from danger. He was fatally shot.\n  Mr. Landsberry was an Alabama native, a graduate of McQueen High \nSchool in Sparks, a University of Nevada-Reno graduate, and a decorated \nmaster sergeant Nevada Guard airman.\n  To his students, he was a coach, a teacher, and also a mentor. To his \ncommunity, Mr. Landsberry was a patriot, a father, and a friend. Master \nSergeant Landsberry leaves behind a legacy of self-sacrifice and \nservice to his country and community. He will continue to be remembered \nas a great and honorable man and a father.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/31/senate-section/article/S7715-2", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7715-S7716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            USA FREEDOM ACT\n\n  Mr. HELLER. I would also like to briefly discuss current National \nSecurity Agency practices, including its bulk data collection programs \nand the implication these programs have for the privacy of Nevadans and \nmillions of other law-abiding citizens.\n  Due to published reports in newspapers around the world, Nevadans are \nwell aware that the Federal Government has been collecting phone data \nof law-abiding citizens without their knowledge through a process known \nas bulk collection. These practices are mostly authorized by section \n215 of the PATRIOT Act.\n  Specifically, section 215 permits the FBI to seek a court order \ndirecting a business to turn over certain records when there are \nreasonable grounds to believe the information sought is relevant to an \nauthorized investigation of international terrorism.\n  ``Relevance'' has been found by the courts to be a broad standard \nthat, in effect, allows large volumes of data to be collected. These \nsame records can be combed through in order to identify smaller amounts \nof information that are relevant to an ongoing investigation. In other \nwords, it has been established that section 215 allows for massive \namounts of data to be collected in order to find the tiny amount of \ndata that would solve an investigation regarding international \nterrorism. The court's reasoning that this is permitted is because, \nwhen submitted, it is likely that the data will produce information \nthat will then help the FBI.\n  Millions of Americans' call records are collected and stored by the \nNSA because a few numbers may solve an authorized investigation. \nSupporters of bulk collection practices have defended this program as \nan important tool in the fight against terror. They have said this is a \nmechanism to access the logs quickly, and they are not actually \nlistening to the content.\n  President Obama even said:\n\n       When it comes to telephone calls, nobody is listening to \n     your telephone call. Instead, the government was just sifting \n     through this so-called metadata.\n\n  The President is correct. They are not listening to the actual calls \nlike the FBI conducting a wiretap, but let me outline that the \ngovernment can figure out what is going on from those call logs.\n  For example, they will know that an American citizen in Ely, NV, \nreceived a call from the local NRA office and then called their \nRepresentative and Senators. But they claim that the content of that \ncall remains safe from government intrusion or they will also know that \na Nevadan from Las Vegas called a suicide prevention hotline and spoke \nto an individual for 12 minutes, but they will not know what that \nperson discussed.\n  The question I have is this: Why does the Federal Government have to \nhouse this data? I believe it is because Congress has authorized a \nmassive surrender of our constituents' privacy.\n  I want to be clear: I share the concerns of all Americans that we \nmust protect ourselves against threats to the homeland. I also believe \nwe must continue to understand that terrorism is very real and that the \nUnited States is the target of those looking to undermine the freedoms \nwe hold as a core of our national identity. Are we sacrificing our own \nfreedoms in the process? Are we sacrificing our constitutional rights \nthat are afforded under the Fourth Amendment? If so, this is a steep \nprice to pay to protect Americans from terrorism.\n  So the next question must be: If the price to protect Americans from \nterrorism is an incredible loss of individual privacy, what are the \nresults of this program?\n  What has the bulk collection program provided in tangible results \nthat justifies a privacy intrusion of this level?\n  The answer is that two cases have been solved in the collection of \nmillions of records through the use of the program authorized by \nsection 215. We know that because on October 2, 2013, the chairman of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, asked the NSA Director \nKeith Alexander the following question:\n\n       At our last hearing, the deputy director, Mr. Ingliss, \n     stated that there's only really one example of a case where, \n     but for the use of Section 215, both phone records \n     collection, terrorist activity was stopped. Was Mr. Ingliss \n     right?\n\n  To which Director Alexander responded, ``He's right. I believe he \nsaid two, Chairman.''\n  Congress has authorized the collection of millions of law-abiding \ncitizens' telephone metadata for years, and it has only solved two \nongoing FBI investigations. Of those two investigations, the NSA has \npublicly identified one. In fact, that case would have easily been \nhandled by obtaining a warrant and going to that telephone company. The \ncase involved an individual in San Diego who was convicted of sending \n$8,500 to Somalia in support of al-Shabaab, the terrorist organization \nclaiming responsibility for the Kenyan mall attack. The American phone \nrecords allowed the NSA to determine\n\n[[Page S7716]]\n\nthat a U.S. phone was used to contact an individual associated with \nthis terrorist organization.\n  I am appreciative that the NSA was able to apprehend this individual, \nbut it does not provide overwhelming evidence that this program is \nnecessary. As Senator Ron Wyden from Oregon noted, the NSA could have \ngotten a court order to get the phone records in question.\n  In essence, Congress has authorized a program that invades the \nprivacy of millions of Americans with little to show for it. The \nresults simply do not justify this massive invasion of our privacy, and \nthat is why I want to end bulk collection practices authorized under \nsection 215 of the PATRIOT Act.\n  I joined Senator Leahy to introduce the bipartisan, bicameral USA \nFreedom Act. This legislation, among other things, will rein in the \ndragnet collection of data by the National Security Agency. It will \nstop the bulk collection of Americans' communication records by ending \nthe authorization provided by section 215 of the PATRIOT Act.\n\n  Some in this Chamber will argue this removes a massive tool for the \nNSA to assist the FBI. I disagree with that. All this legislation does \nis shut down the collection of millions of Americans' metadata by the \nNSA. If the FBI needs a telephone number, they can go to a FISA judge \nand get a warrant. The phone company can still provide that data. \nChances are a major phone provider will have that data as they keep all \ndetailed records for at least 1 year.\n  When talking broadly about how certain technological developments \nshould be incorporated in our justice system, Associate Justice of the \nSupreme Court William Douglas once said:\n\n       The privacy and dignity of our citizens are being whittled \n     away by sometimes imperceptible steps. Taken individually, \n     each step may be of little consequence. But when viewed as a \n     whole, there begins to emerge a society quite unlike any we \n     have seen--a society in which government may intrude into the \n     secret regions of a person's life.\n\n  Here in the Congress it is our responsibility to take great care to \nacknowledge each possible step that could whittle away our privacy. We \nmust examine its necessity carefully and reasonably. In this case, I do \nnot believe such practices are warranted.\n  We can continue to protect Americans from threats of terrorism \nwithout infringing on individual privacy that the Constitution protects \nunder the Fourth Amendment. We should shut down bulk collection \npractices.\n  With that, I thank the Chair, yield the floor, and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I recently received a disturbing note \nfrom a constituent in Burlington, KY. Unfortunately, I suspect a lot of \nmy colleagues have been receiving notes just like it.\n  This gentleman said that after receiving several letters from his \ninsurer, it became clear to him that the President was being misleading \nwhen he said if you like the plan you have--if you like the plan you \nhave--you can keep it. That is because he found out his policy, which \ncame into effect just 2 months after the law's arbitrary cutoff date \nfor grandfather plans, will be discontinued next year. He is not happy \nabout this at all, especially given the fact that a plan on the \nObamaCare exchanges will dramatically drive up his insurance costs, \nfrom $400 a month to more than $700 a month, with zero subsidies \navailable.\n\n  Here is what he had to say:\n\n       My wife and I are 54. We don't need maternity care and we \n     don't need ObamaCare.\n\n  He is right to be upset. This is simply not in keeping with the \nspirit of the President's oft repeated promise.\n  Perhaps the administration would like to tell him he should have just \ndone a better job of keeping up with its regulatory dictates. But what \nabout the millions who purchased their plans relying on the President's \npromise that they could keep them? What about the husbands and wives \nacross Kentucky who suffered when two of our largest employers had to \ndrop spousal coverage? What about the folks who lost coverage at work? \nWhat about all the smaller paychecks and lost jobs? What about the \npart-timeization of our economy?\n  This law is a mess. It is a mess. As Secretary Sebelius said herself \nyesterday: ``The system is not functioning.''\n  Maybe she was referring to no more than the narrow problems with \nhealthcare.gov. But as the President keeps reminding us over and over, \nObamaCare is about more than just a Web site. He is right about that. \nThat is why, if the system is not functioning, it is just another sign \nthat ObamaCare itself is simply not working. The President and his \nWashington Democratic allies understand this. That is why the White \nHouse is so eager to enroll everybody--other than themselves--into the \nexchanges. It is why they handed out a yearlong delay to businesses, \nand that is why the Washington Democrats' Big Labor allies are looking \nfor their own special carve-outs.\n  What about everybody else? What about the middle class? Where is \ntheir carve-out? So far, Washington Democrats have resisted every \nattempt to exempt the struggling constituents whom we all represent.\n  The folks who rammed this partisan bill through know it is not ready \nfor prime time, and they seem to want no part of it themselves. But for \nyou out there, the middle class, it seems to be tough luck--tough luck.\n  We have even seen some of the same folks try to stamp out innovations \nthat would help folks get out from under some of ObamaCare's more \ncrushing burdens. That is why they have launched a crusade against \nsmall businesses that dare to experiment with self-insurance and other \npioneering ideas. Maybe the administration does not like self-insurance \nbecause it represents a free market alternative to ObamaCare. But the \nfact is nearly 100 million Americans are already availing themselves of \nit. I am sure most of them like the greater flexibility and \naffordability it provides.\n  So it is time these folks spent their energy working with us to look \nafter the middle class and to bring about the kind of reforms that will \nactually lower costs and that our constituents want, because they \nshould not have to wake up to news such as this: ``Florida Blue is \ndropping 300,000 customers.''\n  ``Hundreds of thousands of New Jerseyans opened the mail last week to \nfind their health insurance plan would no longer exist in 2014''--out \nof existence.\n  ``Half of the roughly 600,000 people in [my State of] Kentucky's \nprivate insurance market will have their current insurance plans \ndiscontinued.''\n  Mr. President, 300,000 Kentuckians will have their current insurance \nplans discontinued.\n  This is not fair. It is not what Americans were promised, and \nRepublicans intend to keep fighting for middle-class families suffering \nunder this law. I hope more of our Democratic colleagues will join us \nin this battle in the future.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is an unfortunate reality--perhaps \nbordering on negligence--that Congress has been unable to do something \nabout climate change.\n  How will our grandchildren look back at our inaction when they \ninherit a changed planet--one that we found too politically \ninconvenient to help avoid?\n  Thankfully, this President has shown leadership on this issue, but we \nmust do more.\n  Recently, I offered a simple piece of legislation--one that has \ntraditionally been very bipartisan--that can help take another common \nsense step and at the same time improve the lives of millions overseas.\n  The bill helps two friends of the United States overcome the \ndevastating impacts of deforestation: Haiti and Armenia.\n  Our forests provide resources for almost two-thirds of all species on \nthe planet, offering shelter, food, fresh water, and medicines. Forests \nhelp with biodiversity, water conservation, soil enrichment, and \nclimate regulation.\n  Forests cover 30 percent of the world's land area, but we still lose \nswaths the size of entire countries--about 12-15 million hectares--each \nyear.\n  In fact, approximately 76 percent of our world's original primary \nforests have been destroyed or degraded. And deforestation alone \naccounts for up to 20 percent of the global greenhouse gas emissions \nthat contribute to global warming.\n  That is because forests take carbon out of the air, and in turn, \nreplenish the atmosphere with oxygen. Forests help settle out or trap \ndust, ash, smoke, and other harmful pollutants. They offer water \nthrough an evaporation process and shade to hundreds of thousands of \nspecies.\n  If deforestation continues at this staggering level, we lose one of \nthe planet's most important weapons in stabilizing the global climate.\n  And deforestation in Haiti and Armenia hurts far more than the global \nclimate--deforestation is a factor in economic, agricultural, health, \nand environmental problems.\n  An already struggling country, Haiti was hit hard by the massive, \nJanuary 2010 earthquake.\n  More than 200,000 people were killed, and an estimated 1.5 million \nwere displaced. A staggering number of houses and buildings simply \ncollapsed.\n  The subsequent cholera outbreak claimed over 8,000 lives and infected \nhundreds of thousands more.\n  While Americans and people from all over the world donated money, \norganized shipments of medicines and supplies, and even traveled to \nHaiti as emergency relief workers helped rescue and treat victims, \nthere is an important piece of the puzzle that has been receiving \nlittle attention--the role of deforestation.\n  When you look at the lush green of the Dominican Republic and compare \nit to the stark desolation on Haiti's side of the border, it is easy to \nsee why Haiti is so much more vulnerable to soil erosion, landslides, \nand flooding than its neighbor.\n  In 1923, Haiti's tropical forest covered 60 percent of the country. \nToday, less than 2 percent of those forests remain.\n  Deforestation induces soil erosion and landslides, making land more \nvulnerable to floods and mudslides. In a place such as Haiti, already \nscarce agricultural land is rendered all the less productive.\n  These issues are exacerbated by natural disasters such as the 2010 \nearthquake or the many tropical storms Haiti has faced in recent years.\n  I remember on a previous visit to Haiti that there was a strong rain \nduring the evening in the capitol of Port au Prince. I mentioned the \nrain casually to our Haitian hotel host and she said that in the \nmorning several people would be dead from the rain.\n  I was puzzled--from the rain?\n  Yes, the mountains around Port au Prince have been so deforested that \na simple downpour leads to deadly mudslides.\n  Former Haitian Prime Minister, Michele Pierre-Louis, said it so \naptly:\n\n       ``The whole country is facing an ecological disaster. We \n     cannot keep going on like this. We are going to disappear one \n     day. There will not be 400, 500 or 1,000 deaths [from \n     hurricanes]. There are going to be a million deaths.''\n\n  Mr. President, when I visited Armenia last year, I found a similar \nproblem. I had the opportunity to drive through the Armenian \ncountryside for several hours en route from Georgia. What I saw in this \notherwise proud country was devastating.\n  While archaeological data suggests that approximately 35 percent of \nArmenia was originally forested, less than 8 percent of its forests \nremain today.\n  In recent years, increasing bouts of heavy rainfall, landslides, and \nfloods have endangered hundreds of communities in Armenia and cost \nmillions in damages. On the other hand, record droughts have threatened \nmore than two-thirds of the nation by desertification as natural tree \ncover continues to diminish.\n  Groups such as the Armenia Tree Project have focused on reforestation \nefforts in northern Armenia because it suffered a significant loss of \nforest cover in the early 1990s.\n  Mr. President, deforestation is brought on by a number of reasons-- \nmaking land available for urbanization, plantation use, logging, \nmining--and illegal logging and mining--and others.\n  Poverty and economic pressures also play significant roles; 80 \npercent of the population of Haiti and 36 percent of the population of \nArmenia live below the poverty line, and wood and charcoal produced \nfrom cutting down trees accounts for a major--and relatively cheap--\nsupply toward the energy sectors of both nations.\n  But the implications of deforestation are disastrous. These forests, \nif protected and regrown, would fight the destructive effects of soil \nerosion.\n  They would help protect freshwater sources from contaminants, would \nsafeguard irrigable land, and would save lives during natural \ndisasters. Helping these nations deal with their deforestation \nproblem--one that impacts the entire planet given the rise in \ngreenhouse gas emissions--is not only the right thing to do, it is the \nsmart thing to go with our limited assistance dollars.\n  Every dollar we put into reforestation in these hard-hit countries \npays itself back in economic, health, and environmental returns.\n  That is why Senators Brown, Cardin, Feinstein, and Whitehouse have \njoined me in introducing the Haiti and Armenia Reforestation Act to \nhelp address the deforestation challenge.\n  The bill aims to restore within 20 years the forest cover of Haiti to \nat least seven percent and the forest cover of Armenia to at least 12 \npercent, about each country's respective levels in 1990.\n  Within 7 years of enactment, the bill also aims to restore the social \nand economic conditions for the recovery of 35 percent of both \ncountries' land surfaces and to help improve sustainable management of \nkey watersheds.\n  A number of groups and organizations are already on the ground \nworking toward these goals in Haiti, and a few in Armenia such as the \nArmenia Tree Project I mentioned earlier, but more needs to be done to \nhelp support\n\n[[Page S7718]]\n\nthese efforts in a coordinated manner and with backing from both the \nGovernments of Haiti and Armenia and of the United States.\n  While it is important to start putting trees in the ground, this bill \nis about more than just planting trees. Our government has tried that \napproach in the past and it has proven to be ineffective.\n  This bill empowers the U.S. Government to work with Haiti and Armenia \nto develop forest-management programs based on proven, market-based \nmodels.\n  These models will be tailored to help both countries manage their \nconservation and reforestation efforts in ways that can be measured.\n  The bill encourages cooperation and engagement with local communities \nand organizations, provides incentives to protect trees through income-\ngenerating growth, and authorizes debt-for-nature swaps, focusing on \nsustainable restoration of forests, watersheds, and other key land \nsurface areas.\n  Most importantly, the bill does not authorize any new funds. It will \nhelp make sure such existing funds are spent wisely and productively.\n  It will help the people of Haiti and Armenia rebuild their critical \necosystems, which in turn will have tremendous long-term impacts on \ntheir qualities of life.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/31/senate-section/article/S7718-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO CARMEN VELASQUEZ\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank \nCarmen Velasquez of Chicago, who is retiring as executive director of \nAlivio Medical Center, for her many years of service to the Latino \nCommunity and the city of Chicago.\n  As a community leader, civil rights activist, health and education \nadvocate, and one of my personal ``she-ros,'' Carmen Velasquez has \ndedicated her life to justice and equitable health access for all. As \none of the original founders of the Alivio Medical Center, she has \nserved the community for 25 years, helping grow one community health \ncenter to a network of 6 clinics, with plans to open two new sites this \nyear.\n  Carmen is the daughter of Mexican immigrants--her father harvested \nbeets in South Dakota before coming to Illinois to start a successful \njukebox business. Carmen went on to earn degrees from Loyola University \nChicago and the University of the Americas in Puebla, Mexico.\n  In her professional career, Carmen dedicated her talents and energy \nto universal health care and immigration reform as a community \norganizer. She was a social worker and bilingual education specialist, \nwho quickly became a pillar of Chicago's Latino community.\n  As a member of Chicago's Board of Education, she realized that more \nneeded to be done not only to address the needs of the Latino community \nin schools, but also in health clinics.\n  In 1988, Carmen's mission was clear; she needed to find a place to \naddress the too often neglected medical needs of her community. While \nwalking through Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood in search of clinic \nspace, Carmen came upon a muffler shop parking lot littered with \nrusting old trucks. She went inside the shop and asked its owner if the \nlot was for sale.\n  His response? ``Offer me something.''\n  Carmen Velasquez made an offer, and with that, she began her active \ncampaign to raise $2.1 million for construction of the first of \nAlivio's community health centers.\n  Carmen's passion and tenacity turned her dream into a reality. Alivio \nMedical Center opened its doors 1 year later in 1989, as a bilingual, \nbicultural nonprofit community health center. Alivio has since grown to \nbecome a respected advocacy organization that is also an essential \nsafety net provider for many low-income and vulnerable residents of \nChicago.\n  Because of Carmen Velasquez's hard work and dedication, Alivio \ncontinues to meet the primary health care needs of over 20,000 Spanish-\nspeaking, predominantly Mexican immigrants who fall through the cracks \nof the health care system every year. The residents of the Pilsen, \nLittle Village and Back of the Yards neighborhoods who come to the \nclinic every year know that, regardless of their income level or \ninsurance coverage, they can expect the very best quality care.\n  Carmen's commitment to her community has not gone unnoticed. She has \nbeen recognized for excellence in her work throughout the years. She \nwas recently recognized at halftime by the Chicago Bears with the \nNational Football League's, NFL, Hispanic Heritage Leadership Award, \nand she has been honored with the MALDEF Lifetime Achievement Award, \nthe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Community Health Leadership Award, \nand Premio Ohtli, the highest honor bestowed by the Government of \nMexico on an individual for service to Mexicans living abroad. Illinois \nGovernor Pat Quinn has also honored Carmen as the Latino Heritage Month \n``Trailblazer of the Day.''\n  I was fortunate to meet Carmen and her family early in my Senate \ncareer. On so many occasions I have counted on Carmen's wise counsel \nand caring heart to help me through the challenges we face. If I could \nmake one phone call before facing a tough decision on an issue of \nsocial justice, particularly in the Hispanic community, I would call \nCarmen Velasquez and know that her life experience, caring heart, and \nstreet-level wisdom would never disappoint me.\n  Carmen's perseverance and her indomitable spirit are tremendous.

Mr. President. In October of 2013, Veterans in the Last \nFrontier and Alaska-Golden Heart hubs of Honor Flight will be traveling \nto Washington, DC, to visit their memorials. I would like to welcome \nthese heroes to our Nation's capital and take this time to recognize \ntheir service to our Nation.\n  I would like to record the individual names of the World War II \nveterans selected for this trip: Mr. Jacob Knapp, Army; Mr. Stanley \nColeman, Navy; Mr. John Collins, Army; Mr. William Field, Navy; Mr. \nAlvin Hershberger, Army; Mr. Norman Hogg, Army; Mr. Howard Hunt, Army; \nMr. Alfred Kehl, Army; Mr. George Miller, Air Force; Mr. Manuel Norat, \nArmy; Mr. Leonard Nugent, Navy; Mr. Dale Parker, Navy; Mr. Fredrick \nSamsun, Marines and Air Force; Mr. Marshall Solberg, Navy; Mr. Lafton \nWells, Navy; Ms. Ellen White, Air Force; Ms. Juliana Wilson, Navy; Mr. \nAllen Woodward, Navy; Mr. Edward Young Jr., Air Force; Mr. James \nBrewster, Navy; Mr. Elvin Brush, Air Force; Mr. Arnold Booth, Army; Mr. \nConrad Ryan, Army; Mr. William Miller, Army; Mr. Louis Palmer, Navy; \nMr. James Dodge, Marines; Mr. Roy Helms, Army; Mr. Nelson McBirney, \nNavy and Mr. Wenzel Raith, Navy.\n  These veterans from Alaska join over 90,000 other veterans from \nacross the country, who, since 2005, have traveled to our Nation's \ncapital to visit and reflect at memorials built here in their honor. \nThis Honor Flight trip was made possible by generous public donations \nand contributions from those who wish to honor these heroes.\n  We owe a great deal to our servicemen and veterans who put themselves \nin harm's way for our Nation and for our security. The sacrifices made \nby these heroes are truly incredible and without their honor, courage, \ncommitment, and sacrifice, we would not enjoy the freedoms we cherish \ntoday.\n  Each of these veterans have my thanks for their service, and I very \nappreciate the staff, volunteers and supporters of the Honor Flight \nprogram who make these trips happen.

Mr. President, yesterday, I voted to confirm Alan Estevez \nto\n\n[[Page S7719]]\n\nbe a Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense. In this important \nposition, the second highest ranking acquisition official at DOD, Mr. \nEstevez will help oversee hundreds of billions of dollars in \nprocurement during his tenure.\n  I am eager to work with Mr. Estevez on an issue important to my State \nand our overall security strategy. Like my colleagues Senators \nBlumenthal and Cornyn have discussed, it is unacceptable to me that the \nDepartment of Defense is continuing the procurement of Mi-17 \nhelicopters from Rosoboron export, Russia's official arms export firm.\n  The reasons to stop this procurement are numerous, and, by contrast, \nthe logic behind the continuation of this procurement is flawed.\n  Not only is Rosoboronexport at the heart of an industry that Russia's \nown chief military prosecutor publicly stated is corrupt, but this \ncompany is also supplying the Assad regime in Syria. We are handing \nmoney--tax dollars from my constituents in Connecticut--to a company \nthat is propping up a regime that is committing atrocities against its \nown people.\n  I was outraged to learn that earlier this year that DOD awarded \nRosoboronexport a $572 million contract for the procurement of 30 Mi-17 \nhelicopters for the Afghan Special Mission Wing, completely ignoring \nthe recommendation of the Special Inspector General for Afghan \nReconstruction, SIGAR, to halt this procurement.\n  Even if DOD thinks that this procurement should go forward in light \nof the SIGAR recommendation, there is no credible reason that these \nhelicopters should not be made in America. My constituents are tired of \nour procurement dollars going to overseas firms, and this particular \nexample is one of the most egregious.\n  We have spent over $100 billion on equipment from overseas \nmanufacturers in the last several years. When I talk to manufacturers \nin Connecticut who are churning out the most reliable and rugged \nmilitary equipment in the world, including helicopters, they just can \nnot understand why we are paying a corrupt Russian arms dealer for \nequipment we already make at home.\n  I look forward to making my feelings known to Mr. Estevez and, as we \ndid last year during the consideration of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act, making it clear that this body does not approve of \nthis Mi-17 procurement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/31/senate-section/article/S7719-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO JUDGE S. ARTHUR SPIEGEL\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor a friend and fellow \nCincinnatian, Judge S. Arthur Spiegel, on the occasion of his 94th \nbirthday and would also like to recognize him for his service to our \ncommunity and our Nation.\n  On April 5, 1980, Judge Spiegel was appointed as a United States \nDistrict Judge for the Southern District of Ohio by President Jimmy \nCarter. He was confirmed on May 20, 1980 and began his duty on June 5, \n1980.\n  With 33 years of Federal judicial service, including as Chief United \nStates District Court Judge for the Southern District of Ohio and by \ndesignation on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth \nCircuit, he took Senior Status on June 5, 1995. He continues to serve \non the Court as Cincinnati's oldest sitting judge and continues to \nhandle a full docket and hundreds of cases a year.\n  Judge Spiegel served his country valiantly in World War II in the \nPacific campaigns while serving as a flying artillery spotter in an \nunarmed light aircraft. He was a United States Marine Corps Captain \nfrom 1942 to 1946 in the First Marine Division.\n  Judge Spiegel received a BA from the University of Cincinnati in 1942 \nand obtained his LL.B. from Harvard University in 1948--postgraduate \nUniversity of Cincinnati, 1949. In addition, he was awarded an Honorary \nDegree, Doctor of Humane Letters by Hebrew Union College, Jewish \nInstitute of Religion in 1996 and a Distinguished Alumni Award, College \nof Arts & Sciences from the University of Cincinnati in 1997.\n  Judge Spiegel has served as a role model to many lawyers in private \npractice and on the bench. His intelligence and strength of character \nhave been revered by many and he has set the highest standards of \nprofessionalism for those appearing in his courtroom. He was a co-\nfounder of the Potter Stewart American Inn of Court in Cincinnati, \nwhich was one of the first establishments of this kind, and serves to \nmentor and teach professionalism and trial techniques to law students \nand young lawyers.\n  Judge Spiegel is a member of the American Bar Association, the Ohio \nBar Association, the Cincinnati Bar Association and the Federal Bar \nAssociation. He was a lecturer on labor law, debtor/creditor rights, \nand appellate advocacy at the University of Cincinnati College of Law \nfrom 1970 through 1975. He was also a Delegate, Sixth Circuit Judicial \nConference from 1967 through 1970; a Life Member, Sixth Circuit \nJudicial Conference beginning in 1971; and was a District Judge \nRepresentative for the Sixth Circuit, United States Judicial Conference \nin 1996 and 1997.\n  He has served on numerous boards of trustees in his community. He \nserved on the Mayor's Friendly Relations Committee from 1961 to 1965 \nand the Cincinnati Human Relations Commission from 1967 to 1973, \nincluding serving as its first Chairman from 1965 to 1967. He was also \na Board Trustee for Bowling Green State University from 1973 to 1981 \nand has been a Trustee and Trustee Emeritus for The National Conference \nfor Community and Justice since 1973.\n  In recent years, Judge Spiegel has served on the Roundtable of the \nBlack Lawyers Association of Cincinnati, which aims to broaden the \nopportunities in the legal profession for minorities. He regularly \nmeets with students of local high schools regarding the role of the \ncourts in our society and also conducts naturalization ceremonies in \nthe local schools. He received the Award of Recognition from the Black \nLawyers Association of Cincinnati in 1995.\n  A civil rights advocate both on and off the bench, Judge Spiegel \nserved as the first Chairman of the Cincinnati Human Relations \nCommission, an organization with the mission of helping the community \novercome prejudice and discrimination. As an active participant in the \ncivil rights movement, Spiegel worked to calm tensions after race riots \nin the late 1960s.\n  A true renaissance man, Judge Spiegel is a pilot, painter, tennis \nplayer, writer, horseback rider and self-taught mechanic.\n  He is married to Louise Wachman Spiegel, and they have four sons, \nThomas, Arthur M., Andrew and Roger, and seven grandchildren.\n  Today, I would like to recognize my friend and an Ohio icon and \ncommend him for the many contributions he has made to our community and \nto the legal profession.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/31/senate-section/article/S7719-2", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7719-S7720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   CONGRATULATING CSU-GLOBAL CAMPASS\n\n Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, in an increasingly global economy, \nwe must find ways to promote innovation, increase college access, and \nmake college affordable so that our students can remain competitive. In \nlight of today's Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee hearing which focused on these important topics, I want to \nrecognize Colorado's own Colorado State University-Global Campus for \ntheir impressive work in this area. This year marks CSU-Global Campus' \n5-year anniversary, and I would also like to congratulate them on \nreaching that milestone.\n  CSU-Global Campus, and its president, Dr. Becky Takeda-Tinker, have \ndemonstrated a remarkable commitment to ensuring a quality education at \nan affordable price. As the first and only 100 percent online, fully \naccredited public, non-profit institution in America, students \nenrolling at CSU-Global today will not see any tuition increases as \nlong as they take at least one class per year, even if tuition rates \nincrease five years down the road. CSU-Global does this because it \nwants students entering today to be able to plan their education and \nanticipate the full cost of graduation.\n  CSU-Global Campus has been at the forefront of new innovative \napproaches to learning, including offering competency-based courses. \nStudents have access to CSU-Global's full course content online for \nfree and can receive\n\n[[Page S7720]]\n\nacademic credit for passing an exam with a score of 70 percent or \nbetter. A 3-credit exam costs $250 and a 1-credit costs $150; the fee \ncovers 2 exam attempts in 12 months. There is no additional fee for \nstudents to access the materials, faculty, and resources during their \nstudy period leading up to the exam. Many of these resources are \ninnovations themselves and include a 24-7 online tutoring service, 24-7 \ntech support, and a virtual library.\n  Its students' progress are carefully tracked electronically and \nstudent support is a priority. Students partner with faculty or receive \nother student support if it seems they have struggled in a certain \nclass. Students at CSU-Global are given the flexibility needed to \naccommodate the many demands on their time, but are still counseled \nthrough to completion.\n  Thirty-four percent of CSU-Global's students are first-generation \ncollege students and 23 percent are from the underserved population. \nFinally, at a time when our country continues to recover financially, \n95 percent of CSU-Global graduates are working for pay as of February \n2013.\n  As the cost of college continues to rise, CSU-Global Campus is an \ninnovative alternative. After repaying its $12 million start-up loan a \nyear ahead of schedule in 2012, it now operates a sustainable model \nwithout future appropriations from the State of Colorado.\n  Mr. President, in April 2013, CSU-Global ranked seventh in U.S. News \n& World Report's ranking of the Best Online Bachelor's Programs. On the \noccasion of its fifth anniversary, I congratulate CSU-Global on its \ntremendous achievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/31/senate-section/article/S7720-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JAMES BUCK\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am delighted to honor the \ncontributions of a loyal and dedicated public servant, Mayor James \nBuck. In November, Mayor Buck will retire after 4\\1/2\\ decades of \npublic service, 29 years of which he served as Mayor of Grandville, MI. \nThrough his vision and tireless advocacy, Mayor Buck has helped to make \nsure this fine city continues to be a wonderful place to raise a family \nand for businesses to thrive.\n  Jim Buck began his career in public service as an appointed member of \nthe Grandville Park & Recreation Board in 1968. Three years later, in \n1971, he was elected to the Grandville City Council. After a successful \nstint on the city council, Jim was elected mayor of Grandville in 1984 \nand has gone on to serve eight consecutive terms.\n  Although the position of mayor of Grandville is part-time, Mayor Buck \nhas always approached it as a full-time responsibility. He has devoted \nhimself to his work as mayor and is visible at community events \nthroughout the year. He is committed to economic and residential \ndevelopment, and has made decisions that have brought businesses and \nresidents to Grandville. He has been a pillar of integrity and a \nconsensus builder. Under Mayor Buck's stewardship, the City of \nGrandville has maintained sound financial footing despite immense \neconomic challenges.\n  Mayor Buck is a firm believer that a strong sense of community is \nvital and improves the quality of life of its residents. Throughout his \n45 years on the Grandville Park & Recreation Board, which he has \nchaired for decades, the city has created new trails and parks and \nrevitalized existing ones. During his tenure, the Park & Recreation \nBoard has turned Grandville's 4th of July Celebration into a major \nregional event and a beloved community tradition.\n  An avid tennis player, Jim Buck has enjoyed many successful years of \ncompetition, including at the Senior Olympics in recent years. He has \nbeen assistant coach to the Grandville High School tennis team for the \nlast 17 years. This year, the team won the OK Red Conference and \nRegional Championships. It is no coincidence that Grandville has some \nof the best tennis courts of any city its size in Michigan.\n  A dedicated and visionary leader, Mayor Buck has not only been \nGrandville's strongest advocate but also an active civic leader on \nregional and State levels. He is an honorary life member of the \nMichigan Municipal League (MML), chair of the MML Foundation Board, \nmember of the West Michigan Strategic Alliance and the long-time \nchairman of the Grand Valley Metropolitan Council.\n  But more than the list of boards and commissions to his credit, Jim \nBuck is a man of his community. He works long hours attending events, \nmeeting with residents, visiting schools, and listening to and \nappreciating the people of Grandville. He has created a standard of \ncommunity engagement that will be an inspiration to his successors. \nIndeed, Mayor Buck has made a tremendous contribution to the lives of \nresidents of the City of Grandville now and for generations to come.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the dedicated public \nservice of one of the finest locally elected officials in Michigan, Jim \nBuck. He has dedicated himself to the betterment of his community. On \nbehalf of the people of Michigan, I wish Jim and his wonderful wife, \nKathryn (Kitty) Buck the very best for a well-deserved \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/31/senate-section/article/S7720-2", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill and joint resolution, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 992.

My bill, the American Renewable Energy and Efficiency Act, \nwill allow every single American to have access to clean energy and \nmoney-saving efficiency.\n  In our slow economic recovery, there has been one very bright spot in \nMassachusetts and the national economy, the incredible growth of clean \nenergy, energy efficiency, and the jobs that come with these \nindustries.\n  According to the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, our State alone \nhas gained 20,000 jobs in these sectors since 2010, with another 10,000 \nnew jobs expected in the next year alone. Massachusetts has become the \nNation's most energy-efficient State. Boston is ranked as the Nation's \nmost energy-efficient city. Our shores will host the first offshore \nwind farm, with a new construction terminal built in New Bedford, \nallowing our fishermen to work alongside our wind energy workers. \nMassachusetts is No. 7 in the Nation in deploying solar energy, even \nthough we are more well known for the ``Perfect Storm'' than perfectly \nsunny days.\n  These advances, these jobs, these technologies have flourished in \nMassachusetts because we have set the right policies and encouraged our \ncompanies to lead.\n  Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick set high goals for clean energy \ndeployment in our State, and we have already surpassed them. Boston \nMayor Tom Menino wanted Boston to be known as green for just more than \nthe Green Monster in Fenway Park, and he has delivered. Boston is now \nthe greenest city in the United States. That is why I am introducing my \nfirst bill as a Senator to take our Massachusetts leadership and make \nit national.\n  My bill would require that electricity sold to American consumers \nincreasingly be generated using renewable sources such as wind, solar, \nhydro, geothermal, and biomass. By 2025, the bill would require 25 \npercent of our electricity to come from the free fuel of the Sun, the \nwind, and the Earth.\n  Since the cheapest and the cleanest powerplant is the one we never \nhave to build, my bill would also require utilities to put people to \nwork on large-scale energy efficiency programs.\n  My bill would build on the efforts of Massachusetts and the 30 other \nStates that already require utilities to provide customers with minimal \namounts of renewable electricity and ensure that America joins the 118 \nother nations that have already established renewable energy goals.\n  My bill would quadruple renewable energy production in the United \nStates. It would create more than 400,000 new jobs. We can put \nsteelworkers and ironworkers and electricians back to work building the \nnew energy backbone for America, from Massachusetts to Montana.\n  The energy efficiency measures in my bill would save the average \nhousehold $39 per year on utility bills, and it would reduce carbon \ndioxide pollution by the equivalent output of 120 coal-fired \npowerplants, helping our efforts to battle the advancing tide of \ndangerous climate change.\n  A renewable electricity standard passed the House of Representatives \ntwice while I was a Member of the body--as recently as 2009--and it has \npassed the Senate three times since 2002. Before it was held hostage \nover the Affordable Care Act, the Shaheen-Portman energy efficiency \nbill showed there is real bipartisan support for energy efficiency in \nthe Senate. These are policies that should be embraced and not blocked.\n  If we do not take these steps, we will lose the international race to \ndominate the multitrillion-dollar clean energy sector. Right now, China \nhas already overtaken the United States as the No. 1 most attractive \nplace to invest in renewable energy. Sixty percent of all new companies \ngoing public in the clean energy sector are doing so in China. More \nthan 100,000 clean energy jobs are being created there annually. China \nnow has more wind capacity installed than any other country, and they \nproduce two-thirds of the world's solar panels.\n  It is time for our country to scale up our clean energy deployment \nand innovation. It is also time to take a look at revolutionary \napproaches to driving that innovation. All too often we are unable to \nmove clean energy-related discoveries and breakthroughs out of the labs \nand into the marketplace.\n  That is the problem my clean tech consortia legislation addresses. I \nhave included this bill as part of the Manufacturing Jobs for America \nInitiative, launched this week by Senator Coons and some of my \nDemocratic colleagues. My bill would fertilize America's innovation \necosystems so that scientific breakthroughs can more effectively \nnavigate the so-called valley of death between the lab and the factory \nand reach their commercial potential.\n  America's universities and research institutions are truly national \ntreasures, and our venture capitalists and entrepreneurs are the \nsharpest in the world. When we sprinkle the right mix of scientific \nbrainpower and capitalist drive, we get something uniquely American and \nextremely potent in terms of its economic impact.\n  My clean tech consortia bill, which I will soon be introducing, will \nlink inventors with investors, professors with producers and get clean \nenergy out of the laboratories and into the factories. That is the type \nof partnership we need with the private sector right now in our \ncountry.\n  The other bill I have included in this package, the Manufacturing \nJobs for America Initiative, and which I will also be introducing soon, \nis called the Build America Bonds Initiative. Here is how it works and \nhere is what it does.\n  When a State or local government wants to build and renovate schools, \nbridges, roads, and hospitals, they need financing, and they issue a \nbond. Investors buy those bonds, giving the State capital to hire \nworkers and update infrastructure, and investors get a return in the \nform of interest. Build America Bonds say to State and local \ngovernments: We will help with the interest payments and help put more \nAmericans back to work.\n  From the inception of this program in April 2009 to when it expired \nat the end of 2010, there were 2,275 separate\n\n[[Page S7731]]\n\nbonds issued nationwide, which supported more than $181 billion of \nfinancing for new public capital infrastructure projects, such as \nbridges, schools, and hospitals.\n  Build America Bonds were a huge success in Massachusetts. My State \nissued close to $5 billion in bonds. Build America Bonds helped finance \nMassachusetts' Accelerated Bridge Program, which repaired and rebuilt \nhundreds of structurally deficient bridges.\n  Other examples of projects include a new laboratory at UMass Amherst, \na new courthouse in Salem, and a new building at the Worcester State \nHospital--improving energy efficiency and reducing costs.\n  I plan to work with my good friends Senator Wyden and Congressman \nNeal--both leaders on this issue--to ensure we continue to invest in \nboth our infrastructure and our future.\n  These are the kinds of programs that will put America back to work. I \nwant American workers to build and export wind turbines and solar \npanels that say ``Made in America,'' instead of the American economy \nimporting millions of barrels of oil a day that say ``Made by OPEC.''\n  I want American inventors dreaming up the newest energy technologies \nthat convert patent applications for a prototype into job applications \non the factory floor. I want American workers repairing our crumbling \nbridges, roads, and schools.\n  We are in a terrestrial technology and manufacturing race as \nimportant as the celestial race President Kennedy began 50 years ago. \nThese are three of the programs that will put America into a new \neconomic orbit, looking down on our competitors. We should pass all \nthree and put America back to work.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 1636. A bill to redesignate certain facilities of the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto commemorate one of our nation's greatest heroes, Neil Armstrong, by \nre-designating the Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force \nBase as the Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center.\n  The legislation will also rename the Western Aeronautical Test Range \nat Edwards Air Force Base as the Hugh L. Dryden Aeronautical Test \nRange, as a tribute to Dr. Dryden's enduring legacy.\n  There are few men in history who have made such substantial \ncontributions to our understanding of aeronautics and our solar system.\n  Neil Armstrong took the most important steps in the history of \nmankind when he stepped off Apollo 11.\n  Dr. Dryden shaped the principles and policies that led to the \ndevelopment of the nation's first high speed aircraft.\n  Their work in the Antelope Valley, outside Los Angeles, helped create \none of our nation's most productive high-skilled manufacturing hubs. \nTheir legacy remains today, and it is fitting that their names are \nattached to these outstanding facilities.\n  Dr. Hugh Dryden was one of our Nation's first and most prominent \nscholars in the fields of high speed aeronautics and aerodynamics.\n  Dr. Dryden began his distinguished career at the Bureau of Standards \nand quickly rose to become the Associate Director by 1934.\n  During World War II, Dr. Dryden dedicated his considerable talents to \nserving armed forces as a scientific advisor, working on aeronautical \nmatters and guided missiles. For his work on these issues, Dr. Dryden \nreceived the Medal of Freedom from the Army in 1946 and Presidential \nCertificate of Merit in 1948--two of our nation's highest honors for \ncivilian service.\n  Following the war, Hugh Dryden became the Director of the National \nAdvisory Committee on Aeronautics, NACA. Eventually, when the advisory \ncommittee was formalized in 1958 and became the National Aeronautics \nand Space Administration, NASA, Dr. Dryden served as its first Deputy \nDirector.\n  Neil Armstrong is another man that inspired Americans to look to the \nskies. He may have been born in Ohio, but his life's work was done in \nCalifornia.\n  In his early years he was stationed in San Diego as a Naval Aviator. \nAlthough he left the state to pursue an undergraduate degree, he \nreturned shortly thereafter to become a test pilot at Edwards Air Force \nBase.\n  As a NASA test pilot, Armstrong flew more than 200 different models \nof aircraft. His experience included work with jets, helicopters, \nrockets and gliders, and he became one of the best known pilots of the \nX-15 test plane.\n  Even before he became an astronaut, Armstrong reached unbelievable \nheights and speeds. While working with the X-15 from November 1960 to \nJuly 1962, he reached a top altitude of 207,500 feet and a top speed of \n3,989 mph.\n  Neil Armstrong logged an incredible 2,400 flight hours as a test \npilot at Dryden Flight Research Center before setting his sights even \nhigher.\n  In 1962, Neil Armstrong became an Astronaut.\n  His career as an Astronaut began with Gemini 8 in 1966. The mission \nbegan with a landmark success--Neil Armstrong and his partner David \nScott successfully docked their Gemini capsule with the Agena satellite \nin orbit. It was the first time two spacecraft linked up in space.\n  However, shortly after the docking, the spacecraft began to spin out \nof control. After the spacecraft separated, Gemini and its astronauts \nwere rolling at a revolution per second. The violent revolutions \nthreatened the vision and consciousness of Armstrong and Scott, and so \nArmstrong made the controversial decision to abort the mission. Gemini \n8 splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean safely, but only part of its \nmission had been accomplished.\n  As a veteran astronaut, Armstrong was an obvious choice for the \nApollo missions.\n  His first assignment was Apollo 11; it was the fifth manned Apollo \nmission and the first manned landing on the lunar surface. Accompanying \nArmstrong on the mission were Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins--both \naccomplished astronauts in their own right.\n  The Apollo 11 crew launched atop a Saturn V rocket from Cape \nCanaveral on July 16, 1969. It took more than four days for the crew to \nreach the lunar surface. Armstrong and Aldrin approached the lunar \nsurface while Collins manned the command vehicle in orbit.\n  The goal was to find a safe landing zone, which proved more difficult \nthan expected. With only 25 seconds of fuel remaining, the ``Eagle'' \nlanded on July 20, 1969, at the Sea of Tranquility.\n  As he stepped off Apollo 11, Armstrong uttered his famous words, \n``That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.''\n  Armstrong and Aldrin spent two and a half hours on the lunar surface. \nThey took photographs, inspected the condition of the lander, and \nplanted the American Flag to commemorate their incredible achievement.\n  It was the first and last time Armstrong would visit the moon. \nShortly after Apollo 11's safe return to Earth, Armstrong announced \nthat he did not intend to fly in space again.\n  But his time in public life was not quite finished. Armstrong toured \nthe world as a celebrity on the ``Giant Leap'' tour. He visited the \nSoviet Union to meet with the Premier and joined Bob Hope on a USO tour \nin Vietnam.\n  Upon his return, Armstrong completed his Master of Science in \nAerospace Engineering at the University of Southern California.\n  He worked briefly for the Advanced Research Projects Agency, or ARPA, \nand served as Deputy Associate Administrator for Aeronautics at NASA.\n  In 1971, he returned to Ohio to teach the next generation of \nengineers at the University of Cincinnati. By the end of his career, \nArmstrong had been decorated by 17 countries and received many notable \nhonors, including: the Presidential Medal of Freedom; the Congressional \nGold Medal; the Congressional Space Medal of Honor; the Explorers Club \nMedal; the Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy; the NASA Distinguished \nService Medal; the Harmon International Aviation Trophy; the Royal \nGeographic Society's Gold Medal; the Federation Aeronautique \nInternationale's Gold Space Medal; the American Astronautical Society \nFlight Achievement Award; the Robert J. Collier Trophy; the AIAA \nAstronautics Award; the Octave Chanute Award; and the John J. \nMontgomery Award.\n\n[[Page S7732]]\n\n  His long list of accolades demonstrates just how incredible and \ninspirational Armstrong was, not only for California and our nation, \nbut around the world as well.\n  Tragically, we lost Neil A. Armstrong on August 25 last year. But his \nlegacy will live on and continue to inspire the next generation of \nengineers, scientists, and astronauts.\n  In a fitting tribute, NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden said that: \n``As long as there are history books, Neil Armstrong will be included \nin them, remembered for taking humankind's first small step on a world \nbeyond our own.''\n  Neil Armstrong's work, career, and legacy have inspired many \naccomplishments and discoveries beyond his own personal achievements. \nIt is only fitting that the Dryden Flight Research Center, which is \nlocated at the base where his career quite literally took off, be \nrenamed in his honor.\n  This is a simple bill that will help to appropriately pay tribute to \ntwo individuals who have helped shape and define the space and \naeronautical industries. I urge my colleagues to support this bill to \nre-designate the Dryden Flight Research Center as the Neil A. Armstrong \nFlight Research Center and the Western Aeronautical Test Range as the \nHugh L. Dryden Aeronautical Test Range.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1636\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 282\n\n       Whereas the Corporation for National and Community Service \n     (in this preamble referred to as the ``CNCS'') was \n     established under section 191 of the National and Community \n     Service Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12651), as added by section \n     202 of the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 \n     (Public Law 103-82; 107 Stat. 873);\n       Whereas, since 1993, the CNCS has operated as an \n     independent Federal agency, overseeing all national and \n     community service programs authorized by the National and \n     Community Service Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12501 et seq.) and \n     the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C. 4950 et \n     seq.);\n       Whereas the CNCS connects people of all ages and \n     backgrounds with opportunities to give back to their \n     communities and the United States;\n       Whereas programs conducted by the CNCS strive to address \n     national and local needs, while renewing an ethic of civic \n     responsibility and community spirit in the United States by \n     encouraging citizens to participate in service;\n       Whereas, since 1993, millions of people in the United \n     States have served in AmeriCorps, Senior Corps, Learn and \n     Serve America, and other CNCS programs, addressing the most \n     pressing challenges facing the United States, from helping \n     students graduate and supporting veterans and military \n     families to preserving the environment and helping \n     communities recover from natural disasters;\n       Whereas participants serve in tens of thousands of \n     locations across the country, bolstering the civic, \n     neighborhood, and faith-based organizations that are so vital \n     to the economic and social well-being of the people of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas national service expands economic opportunity by \n     creating more sustainable, resilient communities and \n     providing education, career skills, and leadership abilities \n     for those who serve;\n       Whereas national service represents a partnership between \n     public and private organizations, invests in community \n     solutions, and leverages State and local resources to \n     strengthen community impact;\n       Whereas, in 2009, Congress passed the Serve America Act \n     (Public Law 111-13; 123 Stat. 1460), authorizing the \n     expansion of national service, expanding opportunities to \n     serve, increasing efficiency and accountability, and \n     strengthening the capacity of organizations and communities \n     to solve problems through the Social Innovation Fund, the \n     Volunteer Generation Fund, and other initiatives;\n       Whereas AmeriCorps and Senior Corps support the military \n     community by engaging veterans in service, helping veterans \n     readjust to civilian life, and providing support to military \n     families;\n       Whereas more than 17,000 veterans have served as AmeriCorps \n     members and have helped veterans and military families access \n     benefits and services, conduct job searches, and provide safe \n     and affordable housing;\n       Whereas the CNCS is working to increase the number of \n     veterans and military families served by and engaged in \n     programs supported by the CNCS;\n       Whereas, since 1994, CNCS programs and members have \n     provided critical services to millions of people in the \n     United States who have been affected by floods, fires, \n     hurricanes, tornadoes, and other disasters and emergencies, \n     helping families and communities rebuild their lives;\n       Whereas the CNCS has partnered with the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency to launch FEMA Corps, which strives to \n     strengthen the disaster response capacity of the United \n     States, increase the reliability and diversity of the \n     disaster response workforce, promote an ethic of service, and \n     prepare young people for careers in emergency management; and\n       Whereas the Task Force on Expanding National Service \n     established in July 2013 is working to expand national \n     service opportunities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the 20th anniversary of the establishment \n     of the Corporation for National and Community Service;\n       (2) recognizes that, for 20 years, the Corporation for \n     National and Community Service has worked to improve lives, \n     strengthen communities, expand economic opportunity, foster \n     innovation and civic engagement, and engage millions of \n     people in the United States in solving critical problems \n     through national service;\n       (3) recognizes that, since the inception of AmeriCorps in \n     1994, more than 820,000 people have served as AmeriCorps \n     members, serving approximately 1,000,000,000 hours, \n     mobilizing millions of volunteers, and improving the lives of \n     countless people in the United States;\n       (4) welcomes the efforts of the Corporation for National \n     and Community Service to increase the involvement of veterans \n     and military families in national service and to expand \n     services to the military community;\n       (5) recognizes the goal of the Serve America Act (Public \n     Law 111-13; 123 Stat. 1460) to increase the number of \n     approved national service positions to 250,000 by 2017; and\n       (6) recognizes and thanks all those who have served in \n     AmeriCorps, Senior Corps, and other programs conducted by the \n     Corporation for National and Community Service for \n     demonstrating commitment, dedication, and patriotism through \n     their service to the people of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/31/senate-section/article/S7733-3", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7733-S7734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 283--TO CONSTITUTE THE MAJORITY PARTY'S MEMBERSHIP ON \n CERTAIN COMMITTEES FOR THE ONE HUNDRED THIRTEENTH CONGRESS, OR UNTIL \n                      THEIR SUCCESSORS ARE CHOSEN\n\n  Mr. REID on Nevada submitted the following resolution;

Res. 284\n\n       Whereas, in September 2012, Saeed Abedini, a resident of \n     the State of Idaho and a minority Christian with dual \n     Iranian-United States citizenship, was arbitrarily detained \n     in the Islamic Republic of Iran, held in solitary \n     confinement, physically beaten, denied access to necessary \n     medical treatment as a result of that abuse, and denied \n     access to his lawyer until just before his trial;\n       Whereas, in January 2013, an Iranian court accused Saeed \n     Abedini of attempting to undermine the national security of \n     Iran by gathering with fellow Christians in private homes;\n       Whereas Saeed Abedini was tried in a non-public trial \n     before a judge who had been sanctioned by the European Union \n     for repeated violations of human rights, including issuing \n     long prison sentences to peaceful protestors following the \n     2009 election;\n       Whereas, during the trial, Saeed Abedini and his Iranian \n     attorney were barred from attending portions of the trial in \n     which the prosecution provided and the judge received \n     evidence through witness testimony;\n       Whereas the Iranian court sentenced Saeed Abedini to 8 \n     years in prison;\n       Whereas, in August 2013, the 36th branch of the Tehran \n     appeals court denied Saeed Abedini's appeal and affirmed his \n     8-year sentence;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran continues to indefinitely \n     imprison Saeed Abedini for peacefully exercising his faith;\n       Whereas the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human \n     Rights declares that every individual has ``the right to \n     freedom of thought, conscience and religion'', which includes \n     the ``freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, \n     either alone or in community with others and in public or \n     private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, \n     practice, worship and observance'', and the International \n     Covenant on Civil and Political Rights echoes that \n     declaration;\n       Whereas the International Covenant on Civil and Political \n     Rights holds that every individual shall be free from \n     arbitrary arrest and detention, and that every individual \n     bears the right to have adequate time and facilities for the \n     preparation of his defense and to be present during the \n     duration of his trial;\n       Whereas the International Covenant on Civil and Political \n     Rights further guarantees every individual the right to a \n     fair and public hearing by a competent, independent, and \n     impartial tribunal;\n       Whereas Iran is a member of the United Nations and a \n     signatory to both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \n     and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \n     without reservation;\n       Whereas articles 13 and 23 through 27 of the Constitution \n     of the Islamic Republic of Iran provide for freedom of \n     expression, assembly, and association, as well as the freedom \n     to practice one's religion;\n       Whereas Iran is a religiously diverse society and the \n     United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human \n     Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran reports that religious \n     minorities, including Nematullahi Sufi Muslims, Sunnis, \n     Baha'is, and Christians, face human rights violations in \n     Iran;\n       Whereas, in recent years, there has been an increase in the \n     number of incidents of Iranian authorities raiding religious \n     services, detaining worshipers and religious leaders, and \n     harassing and threatening minority religious members;\n       Whereas the United Nations Special Rapporteur reports that \n     Iranian intelligence officials are known to threaten \n     Christian converts with arrest and apostasy charges if they \n     do not return to Islam; and\n       Whereas President Barack Obama has called on President \n     Hassan Rouhani to demonstrate the commitment of Iran to \n     individual human rights through the release of all prisoners \n     of conscience: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that freedom of religious belief and \n     practice is a universal human right and a fundamental freedom \n     of every individual, regardless of race, sex, country, creed, \n     or nationality, and should never be arbitrarily abridged by \n     any government;\n       (2) recognizes that governments have a responsibility to \n     protect the fundamental rights of their citizens;

WATER SUPPLY.\n\n       Section 301 of the Water Supply Act of 1958 (43 U.S.C. \n     390b) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e) The Committees of jurisdiction are very concerned \n     about the operation of projects in the Apalachicola-\n     Chattahoochee-Flint River System and the Alabama-Coosa-\n     Tallapoosa River System, and further, the Committees of \n     jurisdiction recognize that this ongoing water resources \n     dispute raises serious concerns related to the authority of \n     the Secretary of the Army to allocate substantial storage at \n     projects to provide local water supply pursuant to the Water \n     Supply Act of 1958 absent congressional approval. Interstate \n     water disputes of this nature are more properly addressed \n     through interstate water agreements that take into \n     consideration the concerns of all affected States including \n     impacts to other authorized uses of the projects, water \n     supply for communities and major cities in the region, water \n     quality, freshwater flows to communities, rivers, lakes, \n     estuaries, and bays located downstream of projects, \n     agricultural uses, economic development, and other \n     appropriate concerns. To that end, the Committees of \n     jurisdiction strongly urge the Governors of the affected \n     States to reach agreement on an interstate water compact as \n     soon as possible, and we pledge our commitment to work with \n     the affected States to ensure prompt consideration and \n     approval of any such agreement. Absent such action, the \n     Committees of jurisdiction should consider appropriate \n     legislation to address these matters including any necessary \n     clarifications to the Water Supply Act of 1958 or other law. \n     This subsection does not alter existing rights or obligations \n     under law.''.\n\n     SEC. 2016.
