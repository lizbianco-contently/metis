Mr. President, I am optimistic that today the Senate will \ncomplete work on an important bipartisan measure that has been directed \nby the President pro tempore of the Senate; that is, the \nreauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.\n  But Senate passage means little if our counterparts in the House fail \nto act on this crucial legislation. They failed once before. Let's hope \nthis year they will get it past the finish line.\n  The Republican-controlled House, I repeat, failed to act last year, \nand the women of America do not want them to fail again. I was \nreassured to hear House Majority Leader Cantor say yesterday that he \n``cares very deeply about women.'' He went on to say the House would \nact to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act.\n  But Americans heard the some promise last year. Despite overwhelming \nevidence that this legislation saves lives, House Republican leaders \nused procedural gimmicks and stalling tactics to block its \nreauthorization. I would remind Leader Cantor and his Republican \ncolleagues of the seriousness of the delay.\n  Every minute House Republicans wait to act, another 24 Americans will \nbecome victims of domestic violence. Every day House Republicans stall, \nanother three women will die at the hands of their abusers. Every year \nHouse Republicans put off action in order to please extremists within \ntheir own party, during that period of time more than 200,000 women \nwill be sexually assaulted, more than 2 million will be stalked, and \nmore than 1.3 million women will be abused by their partners.\n  It has been almost 300 days since the Senate passed a bipartisan bill \nto help law enforcement officials protect women and their families \nacross this\n\n[[Page S480]]\n\ncountry. But despite strong bipartisan support in the Senate, \nRepublicans in the House refused to join the efforts to end domestic \nabuse.\n  Those partisan delays put women's lives at risk. Thousands have \nwritten letters and e-mailed and called to support this legislation. \nOne Nevada woman shared her story of how her partner held a gun to her \nhead and threatened to pull the trigger. She escaped with her life, but \nmany women are not so fortunate. Every year more than 1,000 women are \nkilled by domestic abusers. Since the Violence Against Women Act \nexpired, more than 16 million women have been victimized.\n  The law is effective. In the two decades since it was enacted, the \nlaw has helped millions of women escape their attackers and seek \njustice. There is obviously much more work to do. I say to my friend \nLeader Cantor: It is time for the Republican leaders to stop talking \nabout how much they care about women and start acting to protect women. \nMore than one-third of the women in this country have been the victim \nof violent sexual assault or stalking. Congress must do everything in \nits power to help law enforcement officials prevent these terrible \ncrimes and prosecute the perpetrators. Reauthorizing this legislation \nwould help law enforcement improve strategies to prosecute crimes \nagainst women. It would provide legal assistance to the victims of \nviolence and funding for shelters to allow women to escape their \nabusers. It would safeguard youth who are experiencing dating violence \nand stalking.\n  Until we fully reauthorize this law, authorities will not have all \nthe tools they need to fight domestic violence. Today--we hope it does \nnot go over until tomorrow--we do not need another day's delay. For the \nsecond time in 2 years to protect American women and their children, we \nhope to take bipartisan action. I hope the House will act quickly to \nfollow suit, as they did not do last year. I trust Leader Cantor's \nwords that this legislation is a priority. I will not be the only one \nholding him to his promise he made yesterday, to swiftly reauthorize \nthe Violence Against Women Act. In fact, there will be 160 million \nAmerican women who are watching and waiting to see if he turns his \nwords into action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/07/senate-section/article/S480-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 47, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 47) to reauthorize the Violence Against Women \n     Act of 1994.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, first, I wish to applaud the distinguished \nleader Senator Reid for his statement. He has helped us over and over \nagain to get this bill to the floor. The reason it is here is because \nof the action of the distinguished majority leader in getting it up \nhere. I was pleased to hear his comments about hopefully finishing this \ntoday or tomorrow. Anyway, it should be done soon. This is a landmark \nlaw.\n  The Senate has before it a bill to reauthorize the Violence Against \nWomen Act, a landmark law we enacted that has made a difference in \nwomen's lives. By providing new tools and resources to communities all \naround the country, we have helped bring the crimes of rape and \ndomestic violence out of the shadows. The Federal Government stood with \nthe women of this country and sent the message that we would no longer \ntolerate their treatment as second-class citizens. Our bill renews and \nreinforces that commitment.\n  Ending violence against women is not an easy problem to solve but \nthere is a simple and significant step we can take, right now and \nwithout delay. I, again, thank Majority Leader Reid for making this \nunfinished business from the last Congress a priority for the Senate \nearly this year.\n  Senator Crapo and I have worked hard to make this bill bipartisan and \nI am proud that it has more than 60 Senate cosponsors. It also has the \nsupport of more than 1,300 local, State and National organizations from \naround the country that work with victims every day and know just how \ncritical this law has been. I included their most recent letter of \nsupport with my remarks on Monday. I, again, thank them for their \ntireless efforts.\n  On Monday the Senate voted to proceed to consideration of the \nViolence Against Women Reauthorization Act. I was disappointed to see \nthat 13 Republican Senators did not vote to proceed to the bill. I do \nnot know why. They did not say.\n  I worry that there are Senators who do not appreciate the role of the \nFederal Government in helping improve the lives of Americans. That is \nwhat the Violence Against Women Act is intended to do and it is what \nthis law has successfully accomplished for nearly 20 years. This is an \nexample of how the Federal Government can help solve problems in \ncooperation with State and local communities. The fact is, women are \nsafer today because of this law and there is no excuse not to improve \nupon it and reauthorize it without delay.\n  We are working to protect victims--all victims--of domestic and \nsexual violence. I hope that those who previously opposed our efforts \nto improve the Violence Against Women Act will join with us and help \nthe Senate send our strong bill to the House of Representatives so that \nwe can get it enacted. Let us not undercut the provisions to help \nprotect Indian women from the serious problems they face.\n  If anyone needs a reminder of how important government help can be, \njust think about the way that Federal and local law enforcement worked \ntogether earlier this week to rescue Ethan, a 5-year-old kidnapped boy, \nfrom an underground bunker in Alabama, where he had been held hostage \nfor almost a week. Ask the family and local law enforcement if they \nappreciated the help of the FBI, the Defense Department and so many who \ncontributed to the safe return of that innocent victim.\n  I spent years in local law enforcement and have great respect for the \nmen and women who protect us every day. When I hear Senators say that \nwe should not provide Federal assistance, we should not help officers \nget the protection they need with bulletproof vests, or that we should \nnot help the families of fallen public safety officers, I strongly \ndisagree. In our Federal system, we can help and when we can, we should \nhelp. And that is exactly the opportunity that is before us today. We \nhave the power to help improve the lives of millions of people in this \ncountry by renewing and expanding our commitment to end domestic and \nsexual violence. A recent study from the Centers for Disease Control, \nCDC, found that more than 24 people per minute are the victims of rape, \ndomestic violence and stalking in this country. We can take action to \nchange that and we must.\n  I am proud that our bill seeks to support all victims, regardless of \ntheir immigration status, their sexual orientation or their membership \nin an Indian tribe. As I have said countless times on the floor of this \nchamber, ``a victim is a victim is a victim.''\n  I appreciate the administration's support for this legislation and \nour goal in reaching all victims. In particular, I note the support of \nthe administration in its Statement of Administration Policy for our \nbipartisan proposal, first developed by the Senate Committee on Indian \nAffairs, to ``bring justice to Native American victims.'' Three out of \nfive Native women have been assaulted by their spouses or intimate \npartners. We can no longer idly stand by while this epidemic of abuse \ncontinues.\n  The language in the bill is that which the Senate adopted last April. \nThe best legal views of which I am aware believe these provisions are \nboth constructive and constitutional. We are building on the Tribal Law \nand Order Act and recognizing tribal authorities with respect to \ndomestic violence in Indian country. No one should be able to get away \nwith domestic violence and rape, not in any community, and not because \nthe victim is a Native American victim in Indian country. I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of the Statement of Administration Policy \nexpressing the administration's strong support for this provision and \nthe bill as a whole, be made\n\n[[Page S481]]\n\npart of the Record at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1).\n  Mr. LEAHY. The bottom line is this: While we have made great strides \nin reducing domestic and sexual violence, there is more to be done and \nit is incumbent upon us to act now. The Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act has been carefully considered and debated for more \nthan 2 years. It is time we vote and send this bill to the House of \nRepresentatives so that it can be enacted. Let us not undermine the \nprovisions to help protect Indian women and other particularly \nvulnerable victims from the serious problems they face.\n  I hope the Senate will come together to reauthorize this needed \nlegislation in a bipartisan manner that represents the finest \ntraditions of the Senate. Domestic and sexual violence knows no \npolitical party. Its victims are Republican and Democrat, rich and \npoor, young and old, gay and straight, male and female. Let us come \ntogether now--today--to pass this strong reauthorization of the \nViolence Against Women Act. Let us show the American people what we can \naccomplish when we work together.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n       S. 47--Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013\n\n          (Sen. Leahy, D-VT, and 59 cosponsors, Feb. 4, 2013)\n\n       The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. \n     47 to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), a \n     landmark piece of bipartisan legislation that first passed \n     the Congress in 1994 and has twice been reauthorized. VAWA \n     transformed the Nation's response to violence against women \n     and brought critically needed resources to States and local \n     communities to address these crimes.\n       The Administration is pleased that S. 47 continues that \n     bipartisan progress and targets resources to address today's \n     most pressing issues. Sexual assault remains one of the most \n     underreported violent crimes in the country. The bill \n     provides funding through State grants to improve the criminal \n     justice response to sexual assault and to better connect \n     victims with services. Further, the bill seeks to reduce \n     domestic violence homicides and address the high rates of \n     violence experienced by teens and young adults. Reaching \n     young people through early intervention can break the cycle \n     of violence.\n       The Administration strongly supports measures in S. 47 that \n     will bring justice to Native American victims. Rates of \n     domestic violence against Native American women are now among \n     the highest in the United States. The bill builds on the \n     Tribal Law and Order Act--which President Obama signed on \n     July 29, 2010--to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of \n     tribal justice systems and also recognize tribal authorities \n     with respect to domestic violence in Indian country. The \n     Administration is pleased that S. 47 recognizes the need to \n     provide protection and services to all victims of abuse and \n     includes proposals to strengthen existing policies that were \n     supported by both Democrats and Republicans last year.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am going to proceed on my leader \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                       Finding Economic Solutions\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, a report this week from Harvard's \nInstitute of Politics reveals just how devastating the President's \npolicies have been for Americans under 30. Despite the fact that most \nmillennials have attended college, only about 60 percent of them have \nbeen able to find a job, and half of them are only working part time.\n  For many young Americans, this suggests the American dream is already \ndrifting out of reach. It should not be this way.\n  Previous generations of Americans faced great challenges, but until \nnow younger Americans could always expect they would eventually achieve \ngreater prosperity than their parents, and that their children would do \neven better. Now the opposite appears to be the case. This should be \nshocking to all of us, especially considering that this generation of \nyoung people came into its own in an era of relative peace and \nprosperity. For many of us, just going to college was a pretty big \ndeal. For today's younger generation, it was the obvious next step.\n  Many of us watched our parents save diligently for the simplest of \nluxuries. A lot of today's young people couldn't relate to those \nstories until now. They grew up in an age of dot-com booms and easy \ncredit.\n  As college degrees no longer translate into fulfilling careers and as \nthe Obama economy continues its year-long stagnation, much has changed \nfor a generation that once seemed to have everything going for it. \nRecent figures from the Congressional Budget Office help tell the \nstory. According to CBO, in 2014 the United States will see a sixth \nconsecutive year of 7.5 percent-plus unemployment. The last time the \nUnited States jobs picture was that bad, Americans were still huddling \naround the family radio.\n  For 2 years, the President has been saying that raising taxes on the \nrich would solve our problems. Yet CBO notes that while taxes are set \nto jump above their historic level, the added revenues from taxes that \nrose due to operation of law last month will mean almost nothing when \nit comes to dealing with America's long-term fiscal challenges. This is \nbecause CBO has also warned that spending, which already exceeds the \nhistoric average, will continue its unsustainable climb in the years \nahead.\n  In fact, over the next decade, red ink will spike by trillions to \nlevels unseen in peacetime America. If interest rates go up, as most \nexpect, it will be even harder for young Americans to purchase a home. \nThe CBO warns that if interest payments on our debt skyrocket, it will \nbe even more difficult to guarantee the eventual availability of Social \nSecurity and Medicare for today's graduates. If wages fall as a result \nof the smaller economy that comes from the government's increased debt \npayments, then we can be quite certain that today's generation will \nknow less prosperity than their parents do.\n  These are some of the negative consequences of failing to get \nspending under control. Things are set to get much worse unless we act \nquickly.\n  Has the White House reached out to Republicans to solve these \npressing economic and fiscal challenges? I wish. Instead, it has turned \nonce again to gimmicks and tax hikes that only serve to delay \nsolutions. Earlier this week the President even proposed more tax hikes \nto offset a sequester that he himself proposed and he already signed \ninto law. If he agrees with us there is a smarter way to make these \ncuts, he should propose it, not just call on others to act.\n  I will tell you this right now: My constituents in Kentucky and the \nAmerican people will not accept another tax increase to put off a \nspending cut that the two parties have already agreed to. We have \nalready agreed to cut this much spending. It is the definition of \ndysfunction that it might not happen.\n  This morning I am again calling on the President and his \ncongressional allies to put politics aside at least for once. The \nelection is over. The time to govern is right now, to make divided \ngovernment work for the American people who chose it. We owe Americans \naction, not rhetoric. We owe it to the millions of college graduates \nout of work. We owe it to the strivers who find themselves still living \nin their parents' basement. They are all counting on us to enact real \nbipartisan solutions, solutions that can get our economy moving again \ntoday and can ensure greater prosperity tomorrow.\n  Is Washington up to the task? Republicans are, and we are still here \nready to work for the President as soon as he is prepared to get down \nto business.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For the information of the Senate, the time \nuntil 12 noon will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders and their designees.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak about \nthe legislation we are about to discuss here, the Violence Against \nWomen Act.\n  Before I do, I want to respond to a comment I heard by the Republican \nleader on the floor right now talking about the impact of \nsequestration, which is to go into effect March 1 unless Congress acts \nto replace it with something that is more balanced. Sequestration was \nnever written into law to go into effect. Sequestration was put into \nlaw in order for us, Congress, to come together in a bipartisan way to \nfind a balanced solution. That is still the case. I feel very strongly \nthat if Members of Congress, Republicans and\n\n[[Page S482]]\n\nDemocrats, can come together with a balanced package that takes into \naccount sequestration causing severe impact to our national defense, to \nour nondefense programs such as Head Start and education at a time when \nour economy is very fragile--the impact of the job cuts on that would \nbe very severe. Democrats believe, just as we did throughout this \nprocess, if we put forward a balanced replacement that includes \nrevenue, making sure that those wealthy Americans who have done very \nwell and have not had to sacrifice are part of a replacement package \nthat we can move through this Congress, this will ensure, as we put \nforward a balanced budget approach for the future and work for a long-\nterm deficit stabilization process, we can get past this hurdle.\n  There is no reason we need to manage crisis by crisis if we can come \ntogether on a balanced approach that does include revenue. This is what \nAmericans expect--everybody participates in making sure that our \neconomy gets back on track, we don't just protect the wealthiest, but \nwe ask them to do their part.\n  I look forward to working with anybody in this body to do this so we \ndon't face the impacts of sequestration that would happen if we don't \nhave that balanced plan.\n  Speaking about the Violence Against Women Act, which is the order of \nbusiness today, I come to the floor this morning to continue the \nefforts that we did start here 9 months ago, efforts that were, in \nfact, overwhelmingly bipartisan--68 Senators--to finally renew our \nnational commitment to ending domestic violence and reauthorize the \nViolence Against Women Act. It is a bill that has successfully helped \nprovide life-saving assistance to hundreds of thousands of women and \nfamilies, and it is a bill that consistently extends protections to new \ncommunities of vulnerable Americans each and every time it has been \nauthorized.\n  I wish to thank Senator Leahy and Senator Crapo for making the \nViolence Against Women Act a priority for reintroduction in the 113th \nCongress, because there is no reason this critical bill, which has such \nbroad support, should be put on the back burner and delayed further \nwhile there are millions of Americans across our country who are \nexcluded from the current law. In fact, for Native, immigrant women, \nand LGBT individuals, every moment our inclusive legislation to \nreauthorize VAWA is delayed is another moment they are left without the \nresources and protection they deserve.\n  For women on tribal lands, the challenges are particularly immense. \nOften in our very rural areas, on tribal lands, these women live hours \nand hours away from the nearest Federal prosecutors.\n  For nontribal members on these lands who perpetrate these violent \ncrimes against the women who are living there, it equates to nothing \nshort of a safe haven for them. It is a place where they are free from \ntribal jurisdiction and repeatedly commit horrific acts without being \nafraid of being brought to justice.\n  This is an injustice that Deborah Parker, the vice chairwoman of the \nTulalip tribes in my home State, spoke to just outside this Chamber \nlast year in an effort to get House Republicans to listen. Through her \ntears she told a deeply personal story about how not only was she \nabused as a young girl, but how she then watched family members and \nfriends suffer similar fates. She spoke about how time and again the \nabusers went unprosecuted, only to repeat the crime over and over. She \ncalled herself ``a Native American statistic.'' Even more sadly, she \nwas right.\n  In fact, the numbers are staggering. One in three Native women will \nbe raped in her lifetime. One in three. Two in five of them are victims \nof domestic violence, and they are killed at 10 times the rate of the \nnational average. These shocking statistics aren't isolated to one \ngroup of women, as 25 to 35 percent of women in the LGBT community \nexperience domestic violence in relationships. Three in four abused \nimmigrant women never entered the process to obtain legal status, even \nthough they were eligible, because their abuser husbands never filed \nthe paperwork.\n  It does not need to be this way. I was very proud to be here serving \nthe Senate back in 1994 when we first passed the Violence Against Women \nAct. Since we took that historic step, VAWA has been a great success in \ncoordinating victims' advocates, social service providers, and law \nenforcement officials to meet the immediate challenges of combating \ndomestic violence. Along with bipartisan support, this has received \npraise from law enforcement officers, prosecutors, judges, victim \nservice providers, faith leaders, health care professionals, advocates, \nand survivors.\n  VAWA has attained such broad support because it worked. It provides \nshelter and justice to battered women who need both, and it is the \ncornerstone of our efforts to combat domestic violence. We can't pick \nwinners and losers on who gets these critical protections, and we \ncannot afford any further delay, not on this bill.\n  Just like the last Congress, we all know what it would take to move \nthis bill forward--leadership from Speaker Boehner and Leader Cantor. \nThe fate of the Violence Against Women Act lies squarely on their \nshoulders. To date they have refused to listen to countless law \nenforcement and women's groups, as well as moderate voices in their own \nparty who have called on them to pass the Senate's bipartisan and \ninclusive bill.\n  In this new Congress, on this newly introduced bipartisan bill, the \nHouse Republican leadership faces the same choice and a second chance. \nThey can either appease those on the far right of their caucus, who \nwould turn battered women away from care, or they can stand with \nDemocrats, moderate Republicans, and the many millions of Americans who \nbelieve that who a person loves, where they live, or their immigration \nstatus, should not determine whether they are protected from violence \nin this country.\n  In fact, in a recent editorial the Seattle Times echoed this same \nsentiment:\n\n       House Republican leaders refused to bring the original \n     Senate bill forward for a vote. They must not squander a \n     second chance to save lives.\n\n  I couldn't agree more. Too many women have been left vulnerable while \nHouse Republican leaders have played politics. It is time for moderate \nRepublican voices in the House to call upon them to pass this \nbipartisan Senate bill immediately, because women's lives across the \ncountry literally depend on it.\n  The Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, has led the charge on this bill. \nI wish to thank him publicly, as he is on the floor right now, for his \nwork, for the first bill he has put forward for this body to consider. \nIt is time to move on it, and I want him to know how much I truly \nappreciate all of his efforts in getting this done. This is for all \nwomen in this country, for Native American women, whom I have talked \nabout, in particular, who have suffered at the hands of their abusers \nfor so long, and for all of our women in this country, whoever they \nare, wherever they come from, to know that this Senate in a bipartisan \nway stands behind them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for her words. The \nSenator from Washington State has been a consistent and clear supporter \nof the Violence Against Women Act. I especially applaud what she said: \nIt should apply to all victims. I have said so many times on this \nfloor, and I sometimes wonder if people hear, but certainly in my \nexperience in law enforcement the police never asked and said, well, we \ncan't help this victim unless they fall into a particular category. \nThey said a victim is a victim is a victim, and a crime is a crime is a \ncrime.\n  We didn't have the Violence Against Women Act when I and my \ncolleagues around the country were in law enforcement. I cannot help \nbut think of all the deaths that would have been prevented had we had \nsomething like this, all the violence that would have been prevented if \nthere had been organizations like some of the actual ones we have in \nVermont and other States supported by the Violence Against Women Act \nthat have prevented violence.\n  I cannot imagine any Member of this body would oppose this law if it \naffected them or their families. We, as Americans, are all family, so \nit affects every one of us.\n  I again thank the Senator from Washington State for her comments.\n\n[[Page S483]]\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the letters from \nadvocates and faith-based organizations in support of S. 47, the \nViolence Against Women Act, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              National Alliance to\n\n\n                                          End Sexual Violence,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 28, 2013.\n     Hon.

Michael Crapo,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Crapo: On behalf of 56 \n     state and territorial sexual assault coalitions and 1300 rape \n     crisis centers, I want to express our sincere gratitude for \n     the introduction of S. 47. The Violence Against Women Act \n     (VAWA) with the SAFER Act included represents the essential \n     and comprehensive legislative package that is necessary to \n     advance this nation's response to the crime of rape and \n     protect and support victims. S. 47 includes critical \n     enhancements to address sexual assault including criminal \n     justice improvements, housing protections, vital direct \n     service and prevention programs, and SAFER's policies to \n     address the rape kit backlog.\n       We are urging all Senators to stand with sexual assault \n     survivors and support the swift passage of this far-reaching \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Monika Johnson Hostler,\n     Board President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 February 4, 2013.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Michael Crapo,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy and Senator Crapo: We, the undersigned \n     sentencing and criminal justice reform organizations, are \n     writing to express our opposition to the inclusion of any \n     mandatory minimum sentencing provisions in S. 47, the \n     Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (VAWA).\n       We acknowledge that reducing the level of sexual, domestic, \n     and dating violence and stalking directed at victims of \n     violence is a worthwhile objective and an issue of national \n     concern. We recognize and appreciate that many of the \n     proposals contained in S. 47 enjoy broad bipartisan support, \n     as well as the support of the American public. In its current \n     form, S. 47 does not include any mandatory minimum sentences. \n     We think it should remain that way through passage.\n       We do not believe that including mandatory minimum \n     sentencing provisions for the domestic violence, sexual \n     assault, and stalking offenses in S. 47 would be necessary, \n     appropriate, or cost-effective. In fact, such provisions \n     could be counterproductive in combatting violence. According \n     to the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic \n     Violence Against Women, the threat of a lengthy, mandatory \n     prison sentence for an intimate partner abuser could deter a \n     victim from reporting a crime. Because the victim and \n     offender are often related or in an intimate relationship, \n     many of the crimes included in VAWA will involve complex \n     facts and unique circumstances. Such complicated crimes \n     demand that courts have flexibility to ensure that the \n     sentence fits the crime and the offender, protects victims, \n     and best meets the needs of the family or couple impacted.\n       Finally, more mandatory minimum sentences would only \n     increase the burdens on and high costs of our already \n     overcrowded federal prison system. A recent Congressional \n     Research Service report shows that mandatory minimums are the \n     primary driver of high prison populations and increasing \n     prison costs. Mandatory minimum sentences are unfair, \n     ineffective, and result in extraordinary costs to American \n     taxpayers.\n       Accordingly, as the Senate considers S. 47, we strongly \n     urge you to oppose the adoption of any mandatory minimums. \n     Thank you for your leadership on this important issue and for \n     considering our views. Please do not hesitate to contact any \n     of us if you should have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Civil Liberties Union, Church of Scientology \n           National Affairs Office, Drug Policy Alliance, Families \n           Against Mandatory Minimums, Human Rights Watch, Justice \n           Fellowship, Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under \n           Law, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, \n           National Legal Aid & Defender Association, The \n           Sentencing Project, United Methodist Church, General \n           Board of Church and Society.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Lutheran Immigration\n\n\n                                          and Refugee Service,\n\n                                  Baltimore, MD, February 1, 2013.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mike Crapo,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy and Senator Crapo: On behalf of Lutheran \n     Immigration and Refugee Service (LIRS), the national \n     organization established by Lutheran churches in the United \n     States to welcome immigrants and refugees, thank you for \n     reintroducing the bipartisan Violence Against Women \n     Reauthorization Act (VAWA) (S. 47).\n       As you are aware, there are many cases in which immigration \n     status is used as a tool for abuse, leading victims to remain \n     in abusive relationships and contributing to the \n     underreporting of serious crimes to local enforcement \n     officials. The creation of the U visa in 2000 by Congress to \n     encourage migrant victims to report criminal offenses to \n     officials has been extremely helpful in advancing community \n     safety. The need for U visas is significant. In 2012, U.S. \n     Citizenship and Immigration Services ran out of available U \n     visas over a month prior to the end of the fiscal year. \n     Therefore, the lack of a vital increase in the number of \n     available U visas in S. 47 is extremely disappointing. \n     However, I am encouraged by your commitment to increase the \n     cap on U visas as part of immigration reform legislation.\n       While I applaud efforts to swiftly move VAWA through both \n     chambers of Congress, I caution against any use of VAWA as a \n     means to expand immigration enforcement provisions of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act. These changes would be \n     detrimental to the central purpose of VAWA--to address the \n     critical issues of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating \n     violence, and human trafficking--and should remain outside of \n     the VAWA debate.\n       LIRS commends your leadership in advancing this bill and we \n     are excited to continue to work with you to ensure the \n     inclusion of provisions to protect vulnerable migrant victims \n     in upcoming legislation. Please contact Brittney Nystrom, \n     LIRS Director for Advocacy with any questions.\n           Yours in faith,\n\n                                              Linda J. Hartke,\n\n                                                President and CEO,\n     Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service.\n                                  ____\n\n         Office of Public Witness, Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), \n           Compassion, Peace and Justice Ministry,\n                                 Washington, DC, February 1, 2013.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: In the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), we \n     believe that ``domestic violence is always a violation of the \n     power God intended for good.'' We believe that ``God the \n     Creator is preeminently a covenant-maker, the One who \n     creates, sustains, and transforms the people of God. Domestic \n     violence and abuse destroys covenants in which people have \n     promised to treat each other with respect and dignity.''\n       Because of these convictions, we strongly support a robust \n     reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act and we \n     thank you for your leadership in sponsoring S. 47. Further, \n     we wish you to know that we have written to all of your \n     Senate colleagues, asking them to support final passage of \n     this bill, and urging them to oppose any amendments that you \n     have not endorsed.\n       As you know, VAWA's programs support state, tribal, and \n     local efforts to address the pervasive and insidious crimes \n     of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and \n     stalking. These programs have made great progress towards \n     reducing the violence, helping victims to be healthy and feel \n     safe and holding perpetrators accountable. This critical \n     legislation must be reauthorized to ensure a continued \n     response to these crimes.\n       Again, we thank you for your leadership on this important \n     issue and look forward to the bill's passage, so that we can \n     build upon VAWA's successes and continue to enhance our \n     nation's ability to promote an end to this violence, to hold \n     perpetrators accountable, and to keep victims and their \n     families safe from future harm. For our part, we commit to \n     continued ministry with victims and survivors of violence and \n     to do all we can, through our ministries and our advocacy, to \n     end this desperate cycle of violence and brokenness.\n       We give thanks for your service to our nation and for your \n     leadership on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                The Reverend J. Herbert Nelson II,\n                                      Director for Public Witness.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wonder if the distinguished Senator from \nNew\n\n[[Page S484]]\n\nHampshire would yield to me for a moment.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Always, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know the senior Senator from New \nHampshire is about to speak regarding the Violence Against Women Act. I \nwould like to take a moment to thank her for all the work she has done \nin her State and in the Senate to help advance this legislation.\n  Senator Shaheen and I are from rural States. We border each other. \nThe Connecticut River runs down the border between our two States. We \nhave so much in common. We face some of the same difficulties of \nweather and rural nature, and, of course, in a rural State there is the \nquestion of access to transportation. Senator Shaheen was the one who \nbrought up, based on her experience in New Hampshire, that women were \nhaving trouble getting to crisis centers and courts. Of course, we have \na similar challenge in a rural State such as mine. But Senator Shaheen \nworked with the Department of Justice to address this problem. As a \nresult, the Office on Violence Against Women is now allowing rural \ncommunities to obtain VAWA grant funding for transportation needs.\n  A number of the women who are going to be getting this transportation \nand desperately need it may not know how that came about, but I wish to \ncongratulate Senator Shaheen on her successful efforts on behalf of not \njust women in New Hampshire or Vermont but throughout the country--\nagain, another example of what we are doing with this bill and the \nnecessity to finish this bill. I hope we can finish it today.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding to me.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont, Mr. \nLeahy, both for his kind words and the tremendous leadership he has \nshown over the years in first passing this legislation and for getting \nit reauthorized time and again and now, after the bill died in the last \nCongress because of the unwillingness of the House to act, for his \nwillingness to bring it forward so early in the session so that \nhopefully we can make sure all of those people who are victims of \ndomestic violence and all of those advocates, the law enforcement \ncommunity that is working so hard, can have the support they need as a \nresult of this legislation. So I thank Senator Leahy very much.\n  One of the reasons I am proud to support this bill is because it \ntakes a truly comprehensive approach to the problem. It supports crisis \ncenters for women and families to provide for immediate needs, such as \nshelter and counseling.\n  Last year the New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual \nViolence reported that they were able to provide shelter for 630 people \nwho needed a place to sleep. Unfortunately, although they helped those \n630, they had to turn away 721 because they didn't have room. So even \nwith the help that is in the Violence Against Women Act, they had to \nturn away more people than they could help.\n  In the face of this need, sometimes it is easy to feel discouraged, \nto wonder whether we can really help at all. But when I speak to the \nbrave women who are survivors who reached out for help to the advocates \nwho have helped them rebuild their shattered lives, I know that we can \nand we must continue to make a difference.\n  The Violence Against Women Act helps us do this by providing funding \nfor police officers and prosecutors so abusers are held responsible. \nTime and again, we have heard from law enforcement that the Violence \nAgainst Women Act helps them keep our communities safe and helps stop \nthe cycle of abuse--law enforcement officers such as a detective \nsergeant in New Hampshire's largest city of Manchester, who is an \ninvestigator and a domestic violence advocate.\n  I brought with me today a chart that gives us a real picture of just \nhow pervasive the problem of domestic violence is.\n  As we can see in the chart, one in four women in the United States is \na victim of domestic violence. Three women are murdered every day by \ntheir partners. This has been a very big problem in New Hampshire where \nhalf of all murders are domestic violence related.\n\n  Maybe the worst statistic on this chart shows that 15 million \nchildren are exposed to domestic violence every year. I call this maybe \nthe worst because, in fact, the cycle of domestic violence continues \nbecause so many children are exposed every year. They are not able to \nget out of this cycle. Let's recommit to shielding our children from \nsenseless violence.\n  Another reason I am proud to support this bill is because it treats \nall victims equally, and it recognizes that members of the LGBT \ncommunity are just as deserving of our support as any other survivor of \ndomestic violence. A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control \nshows us that those in LGBT relationships actually experience higher \nrates of violence than heterosexual couples. Let's recommit to helping \nall Americans regardless of whom they love or who has abused them.\n  Finally, I want to end with a quote from a woman in New Hampshire who \nsought help at a crisis center that receives funds from VAWA, the \nMonadnock Center for Violence Prevention. Before she left that \nshelter--as she was putting her life back together--she told the case \nmanagers there:\n\n       You all have really made my life worth holding onto and not \n     giving up. Please don't ever give up doing what you do \n     because you truly saved my life.\n\n  I think that represents what we hear from so many survivors of \ndomestic violence. Just as we are not going to give up on those \nsurvivors, we must not give up until this legislation is on President \nObama's desk and signed into law. There are too many victims who are \ncounting on us.\n  I certainly urge all of my colleagues in the Senate--as we did in the \nlast session of Congress--to join me in supporting the Violence Against \nWomen Act. I also hope our colleagues in the House will recognize how \nsignificant this challenge is and be willing to take up this \nlegislation and get it done so survivors across this country will get \nthe help they need.\n  Thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, Indiana has a lot in common with Kansas, so \nI don't mind that label. I have been in the chair and made similar \nmistakes, so that doesn't bother me. We have a lot of similarities \nbetween Indiana and Kansas. We each hope to have a Final Four team in \nthe basketball tournament coming up in the Final Four. We have some \ncompetitive teams, so it is a nice blend.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  I would like to speak about the sequestration issue that is facing us \nas a Congress in the next few weeks. But, first, let me just say, I \nreturned from the National Prayer Breakfast. Several of our colleagues \nwere there: Senator Sessions, a Republican, and Senator Pryor, a \nDemocrat, representing Alabama and Arkansas, but more importantly they \nare cochairs of the Senate Prayer Breakfast. They led the effort today. \nBoth the House Prayer Breakfast group, which meets weekly, and the \nSenate Prayer Breakfast group, which meets weekly, supports and puts \ntogether the annual Prayer Breakfast. People from more than 160 \ncountries and all 50 States attended. It is quite a remarkable event.\n  Beyond the socialization and bringing people together around the \nissue of faith and prayer, we find in our weekly Prayer Breakfast \nmeetings in the Senate and the House that it is the one time when \nRepublicans and Democrats, Liberals and Conservatives, people of no \nparticular ideology, get together and talk about the common interest on \nthe basis of their faith. It is always very refreshing to do that, and \nit was a pretty remarkable session this morning.\n  Senator Schumer from New York read from the Old Testament, and our \nformer colleague, Senator Dole from North Carolina, read from the New \nTestament. Dr. Ben Carson, head of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns \nHopkins University--recognized as one of the world's leading pediatric \nneurosurgeons--spoke to us. I heard him 16 years ago. What a remarkable \nlife story. What a remarkable impact he had on the crowd that was \nthere.\n  He talked about political correctness and how it is detrimental to \nthe kind of honest, straightforward debate we\n\n[[Page S485]]\n\nneed in this country over any range of issues, from our religious \nbeliefs to our political beliefs. He talked about how we need to be \nwilling to be transparent and honest with the people we represent, to \nspeak out about what we believe in and how healthy the debate is even \nif we come to different positions on separate issues.\n  That is one of the reasons I have been coming down here virtually \nevery day since the Senate came back into session for the 113th \nCongress. I come here to talk about what I think is one of the \nchallenges--if not the leading challenge--facing us in this 2-year \nterm. Without question, our fiscal crisis and debt has an impact on our \npeople and on the economy, but more importantly, on our people. This \nhas an effect on the average family in America and the young people \ncoming out of high school and college who are looking for a job. The \nimpact of this more than 4-year economic malaise started with a deep \nrecession. It is now getting to the point where our growth is far below \nwhat we need to get everybody back to work and get the economy moving \nagain on a good upward path. We are looking for solutions to the root \nof our problem. This body, along with the House and the administration, \nhas been dealing with this for well over 2 years. We have been trying \nto find a solution to get us on the right path to fiscal health. We \nhave taken several steps in that regard, but each step has come up \nshort. There have been several one-step-forward and half-a-step-back \nefforts, but most of it has simply been pushing it down the road and \nsaving the big debate for another day.\n  In August 2011 we ended up passing the Budget Control Act, which \naddressed the debt ceiling at that time. Through that the \nadministration first proposed--President Obama proposed--a measure \nknown as sequestration, which was designed to force the Congress to \nstep up to the plate and deal with the real problem. The real problem \nis continued deficit spending at a record level that has accumulated \nyear after year.\n  We are now at the point where the clock is ticking. We have a $16.5 \ntrillion debt which is up from nearly $5.5 trillion in just the last 4 \nyears. The math proves and history clearly shows that this is \nunsustainable. This is the great challenge before this Congress. We \nneed to do what is necessary to get on the right path to fiscal health \nbefore it all comes down.\n  We had a warning shot fired across our bow in 2009 as to the \ndistortions in our economy, and the consequences were grave. We have \nwarning shots being fired every day from virtually across the Atlantic \nas to what the European Union and the European nations are trying to \ndeal with because they allowed their deficit spending, their debt, and \noverpromises by politicians to constituents to continue, which simply \ncannot be fulfilled. Now the bank is running out of money. We simply \ndon't have the resources to continue to pay the debt, and the interest \non the debt gets worse every day that goes by.\n  So we had this Budget Control Act in 2011 that included an \nenforcement mechanism called the sequester, which is simply an across-\nthe-board cut. However, the sequester was not an across-the-board cut. \nIt was heavily weighted in cuts to defense. There were exemptions to \nthe major drivers of our debt and deficit, which are the mandatory \nspending programs.\n  Let me be straight and say the things we are not supposed to say \nbecause it is political suicide: If we don't reform Medicare, Medicaid, \nand Social Security, it doesn't matter what else we do, we cannot solve \nthis problem. That is the conclusion of just about everyone in this \nbody. More importantly, it is the conclusion of everyone who doesn't \nhave a political stake in mind.\n  Analysts and economists who look at our fiscal plight and the history \nof economic performance and nonperformance all come to the same point: \nWe need to address and reform mandatory spending programs. We don't \nwant to impose sacrifice and pain on people; we want to save them from \nmuch greater pain down the road. We need to reform programs so they are \nviable and so that people who are contributing to Social Security and \nMedicare on every paycheck will be able to receive those benefits when \nthey need them in retirement.\n  To save those programs and to keep from denying people their hard-\nearned benefits, we need to take steps and we need to take them sooner \nrather than later. The Medicare and Social Security trustees keep \ngiving us additional warnings to do it now. It will be less painful \nthan doing it later. It will help keep us from making Draconian cuts to \nbenefits or Draconian increases in taxes that will break the back of \nthe American taxpayer.\n  Unfortunately, the supercommittee that was formed--six Republicans \nand six Democrats from each body--was unable to come up with a \nsolution. As a result of that, we have this sequester--across-the-board \ncuts with certain exceptions--that is to occur soon. It has been \ndelayed once before and now. March 1 is the new date.\n  We need to step up and put together the big plan that will get us on \nthe path to fiscal health. Republicans in the House of Representatives \nhave been proposing and putting forth their plans, but we have had \nnothing come out of this body. Unless there is support from both \nHouses, nothing can be accomplished, and this will fail.\n  Frankly, we have had a lot of rhetoric coming out of the White House \nabout what we need to do, but we have had no serious attempt to address \nthe part of the equation that needs to be addressed, and that is the \nexcessive spending over the years that we have put into law. As \npoliticians, we have made promises to our constituents over the years \nwhich we know cannot be fulfilled.\n  It is time we stand up and be honest with the American people. We \nneed to be transparent and basically say: Folks, we have a problem. It \nis simple math. We cannot continue to borrow $1 trillion or more a year \nand be in a sound fiscal position. We have to take some steps to \naddress that problem and that challenge before us.\n  If we don't begin that process now, we are going to see devastating \nacross-the-board cuts. It will have very detrimental effects on our \nnational defense and national security because it is so heavily \nweighted to slash those areas.\n  The major three contributors and drivers of the debt are the \nentitlement programs: Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. If those \nare not addressed--no matter what else we do here--we cannot solve the \nproblem. Yet the political tendency is to simply pass it along, push it \ndown the road, and get past the next election. It apparently is too \npolitically dangerous to stand up and say these things and be honest \nwith the American people. Well, I think the American people know better \nand are telling: We are ahead of you. We understand the problem, and we \nwant results. We want you to work together, find a solution to this \nproblem, and put it before us. It is our responsibility to go out and \npresent the plan. But without the President's support, despite his \nrhetoric--all we hear from the White House is that more taxes will \nsolve the problem. They just got $630 billion worth of taxes from the \nfiscal cliff deal. The President's commitment and obsession with taxing \nthe rich and the job creators was fulfilled, and the top percent--the \npeople he described in his campaign and afterward in the negotiations--\nare now paying higher taxes, but that does not begin to even come close \nto solving the problem. So what we need to do is be straightforward \nwith what it is we must do and not be afraid of being honest with the \nAmerican people.\n\n  There is now talk about delaying, once again, the sequester. So \nwhether it is the debt limit, whether it is the spending bills, or \nwhether it is the budget, we keep hearing: Push it down the road. Do it \nsome other time. It is too painful to do now. I would suggest the time \nto do it is now. Even though the sequester is imperfect, even though it \nimposes more pain and more detriment to one of the essential functions \nof government; that is, providing for our national security, which is \npart of the reason I opposed the Budget Control Act, these cuts are \ngoing to take place and need to take place if we don't come up with a \nbetter solution because it now is the law.\n  I am pleading with my colleagues: Let's not do this in a way that is \nnot the soundest way to reduce spending and achieve what we need to \nachieve. By the way, while the sequester, once again, will be an \nimportant step forward, it doesn't begin to deal with the\n\n[[Page S486]]\n\nreal problem. The real problem is finding the political will and \ncourage to be honest with the American people and pass a fiscal package \nthat will reassure investors, consumers and the world that the United \nStates of America has finally taken the steps necessary to address the \ncause of our debt and put us on a path to return to fiscal soundness.\n  I think, given our position in relation to where we are with other \nnations, this type of package would result in an amazing increase in \nour economy, get people back to work, and send the message that America \ncan return to its place of leadership in the world because it has \ngotten their economic house in order. Without that, we will continue to \ndecline, which will have consequences not only for our generation but \nfor generations to come. This also would have potentially dangerous \nconsequences for security around the world because of our inability to \nlead. It would have serious consequences for young people and for \nmiddle-aged people and others who simply want to get back to work. They \nsimply want to get back to a place where they get a paycheck at the end \nof the week so they can cover the mortgage and save money to send the \nkids to school and so they can make those necessary payment commitments \nto lead the kind of life they are aspiring to lead. Without Congress \ntaking action, they are going to continue to live under this cloud of \nuncertainty about our future and people are going to continue to \nstruggle to find meaningful work.\n  It all comes down to the individual and to families. It doesn't come \ndown to some accountant's balance sheet. It comes down to the pain and \nsuffering so many people have gone through over the past 4 years and \nare continuing to encounter because of our lack of responsibility to \ntake the necessary steps to go act.\n  I am going to keep talking about this. I am going to come to the \nfloor and talk about how we can potentially achieve a much leaner, more \neffective, and efficient government. I am going to use as a model not \njust my State but many States with Governors who have had the courage \nto step forward and do what is necessary to put their State in fiscal \nbalance, in contrast to other States that are doing what we are doing; \nthat is, pushing the tough decisions down the road and trying to deal \nwith it at another time.\n  As we go through the Federal budget, there are literally hundreds of \nbillions of dollars simply being spent in the wrong place, simply going \nto programs that are no longer effective and efficient if they ever \nwere in the first place. We are not making priorities in terms of how \nwe spend our money. Senator Coburn and others have been down to this \nfloor talking about egregious examples of overspending, of bloated \nbureaucracy, talking about programs that perhaps had a value at one \npoint in time but are simply not doing the job anymore and are not \nnecessary. We have been talking about the kinds of things that ought to \nbe done at the State and local level rather than the Federal level. We \nhave been talking about how Congress needs to stop making promises to \npeople that everything we spend is for a vital, national purpose if \nthat isn't the case.\n  We need to do some serious triage and take a serious look at how we \nspend taxpayer dollars. We can come up with money to offset necessary \nprograms. We can come up with money to lower the demands so we don't \nhave to continue to go to the American people and say we have to raise \nyour taxes one more time. We have said that too much.\n  The burden is not tax revenues; the burden is dealing with our \nspending issue, and part of that has to be dealing with the mandatory \nspending that is ever driving this deficit and debt.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I request the time to make my statement as \nrequired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak on the \nViolence Against Women Act, but before I do that, I wish to say I \nappreciate the comments of my friend from Indiana. We all want to get \nthis budget under control. We all recognize we have to get it under \ncontrol not only for today's generation but for multiple generations to \ncome.\n  During the last few years we have been able to cut almost $2 trillion \nof our budgetary costs over the next 10 years, cuts we have been able \nto accomplish in a bipartisan way but led a lot by this side. Let me \nremind folks where we are. Four years ago this economy was flat on its \nback--an economy that didn't have any air in it. It was in a grave \nsituation. But where are we today? We have a 5-year housing start, \nincredible activity within the automobile industry, with record-high \nsales going on there. The stock market has doubled in the last 4\\1/2\\ \nyears. Most recently, the CBO--the Congressional Budget Office, a \nbipartisan office which doesn't show any favoritism to any side--\nverifies that in 4 years we have cut the annual deficit by 40 percent. \nI know that is not where it should be yet because we want to balance \nit, but a 40-percent reduction in the annual deficit is significant.\n\n  So we are on the road. Is it a slower road than we would like? Sure, \nbut it is on the road to recovery. It is having a positive impact. As a \nmatter of fact, now the deficit, as the amount compared to our GDP, is \ncut in half. So we are making some inroads.\n  Democrats are not afraid at all to cut the budget where it is \nnecessary, but we need to solve this problem with three types of moves. \nWe have to cut the budget, deal with revenues, and invest in this \neconomy for education, energy, and infrastructure. It is a three-\npronged approach. Even if we think we can do one of these and somehow, \nmagically, a $16 trillion debt will just vanish overnight is in another \nworld that doesn't exist on this planet.\n  I appreciate the debate that goes on, but we need to be honest, \nrealistic, and practical in dealing with these budgetary issues, and \nthey will be tough. People will not like all of it. I can see it now at \nmy townhall meetings when I go to them. They will say cut the budget, \nwhich we will do--don't get me wrong, we will do that--but then when I \ngo back to my hometown they will say, I didn't actually mean that \nprogram. That will be the story.\n  The fact is we have serious issues with which to deal. So this is not \na Democratic issue or a Republican issue. When people come to the \nfloor, we should think about this as an American issue and that we have \nto resolve this for the right reasons. We have done some exceptional \nwork over the last 4 years, despite the hurdles, the political slogans, \nand all the other stuff that goes along with it in getting results. A \n40-percent reduction in the annual deficit in 4 years is significant. \nIs it zero? Is it balanced? No; because there have been 40-plus years \nof not paying attention to the budget.\n  A lot of us are new around here. As a matter of fact, 60 percent of \nthe Senate is made up of people who haven't been here more than 6 \nyears. I am looking at three Senators on the floor right now. We are \nhere to solve this problem. However, do not be mistaken. We have made \nprogress. The American people should be proud of what we have done. But \nis it perfect? No. Do we have more work to do? Yes. That is why we are \nhere and that is why we are going to do this with a bipartisan \napproach.\n  So I digress from the issue I came to discuss. I like the debates \nthat happen on the floor, and I wish more would happen, but when a \nMember speaks, I want to make sure all the information is on the table.\n  I came to speak on an important piece of legislation, the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. We debate issues that are important around here, but \nnot too often can we stand on the floor of this Chamber and say our \nvotes are a matter of life and death. In this case, it is absolutely \ntrue. This bill saves lives. It is our job to pass it now--today.\n  The Senate, as we did last year, needs to send a simple and important \nmessage that America will not tolerate violence against its women, \nchildren, and families. We must do our part to reduce domestic violence \nand sexual assault. Even though the House has refused to act for over \n300 days since we sent the bill over there, we are now in a new session \nand there is bipartisan support in this Chamber. The VAWA bill passed \nthe Senate with 60 votes last spring and there are at least 60 of us \nalready signed up and cosponsoring this legislation.\n  We know the reality. The fight to protect women and families from \nviolence is far from over. VAWA was first\n\n[[Page S487]]\n\npassed just 20 years ago and it has not been reauthorized since 2006. \nThe law has made a difference. We know a great deal more about domestic \nviolence than when VAWA was first written. Services for victims have \nimproved. Communities offer safer shelter. Local, State, and Federal \nlaws are stronger. Yet there are still too many awful stories and \ninexcusable numbers, especially in my home State.\n  Alaska continues to have some of the worst statistics in the country. \nThree out of every four Alaskans have experienced domestic or sexual \nviolence or known someone who has. The rate of rape in Alaska is nearly \n2\\1/2\\ times the national average, even worse for Alaskan Native women. \nChild sexual assault in Alaska is almost six times the national \naverage. Out of every 100 adult women in Alaska, nearly 60 have \nexperienced physical or sexual violence or both.\n  So my colleagues can see why I am standing here today. We need to do \nsomething about this not someday, not next year but today.\n  In one typical day in my State, victim services agencies throughout \nAlaska serve an average of 464 victims, 114 hotline calls are answered, \nand 308 people across Alaska attend training sessions offered by local \ndomestic violence and sexual assault programs. Yet people are still \nturned away because of a lack of funding, a lack of service. On an \naverage day in Alaska, 52 requests for services are not met--basic \nneeds such as transportation, childcare, language translation, \ncounseling and legal representation. The bill before us is critical in \nensuring all victims receive the services they need.\n  I wish to spend just a few more minutes discussing the safety of \nwomen and children in Alaska Native and American Indian families. For \nthe sake of our Nation's first peoples, the tribal provisions in this \nbill need to become law. Yet some of my colleagues on the other side of \nthis Chamber are trying to strip out our expanded authority over \ndomestic violence in Indian Country. Why are we debating this? One out \nof every three Native American women has suffered rape, physical \nviolence or stalking. Yet some Members want to debate the rights of \ntheir abusers. I fully support the tribal provisions in this bill. Yet \nI must point out that none of the expanded criminal jurisdiction \napplies to Alaska Native tribes except for one true reservation at the \nvery southern tip of Alaska. Today is not the day to fight that fight, \nbut I will take it up again soon from my seat on the Indian Affairs \nCommittee in the Senate.\n  Study after study has concluded that the lack of effective local law \nenforcement in Alaska Native villages contributes to so many problems: \nincreased crime, alcohol and drug abuse, domestic violence, and poor \neducational achievement. When it comes to protecting those most at \nrisk, Congress must recognize the need for local control, local \nresponsibility, and local accountability. This bill will take a big \nstep forward today on Indian reservations in the lower 48.\n  At a later time, we will get to my bill, which I have introduced in \nthe past as the Alaska Safe Families and Villages Act.\n  My bill would establish small demonstration projects so a handful of \nfederally recognized tribes in Alaska's villages can take action. They \nwould be allowed to address domestic violence and alcohol-related cases \nwithin their villages and village boundaries.\n  Our Native villages are vibrant, resilient communities, and we must \nanswer their calls for help. That includes an ``all of the above'' \napproach to combating domestic violence and abuse. The one thing we \nknow for sure is the status quo is not working. It is not just about \nslogans or feel-good statements. We need to act.\n  But for now--for today--let's vote on VAWA and get this bill passed. \nLet's protect women and children and families all over this country. \nAnd let's send a strong message to our colleagues in the House, that \nthis time there is no hiding. It is time to get the job done. It is \ntime to put politics aside. Pass this bill and truly save lives.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Iowa, \nMr. Grassley, is he in the queue to speak?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. For 7 or 8 minutes.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Excuse me?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If I could have 7 or 8 minutes now.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Yes. The Senator is in the queue because \nSenator Begich just spoke. That would be great. I thank the Senator \nvery much. I appreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there has long been bipartisan support \nfor the Violence Against Women Act. Too many women are victims of \ndomestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, and dating violence. \nFederal support for services to these women, and sometimes even men, \nhas been beneficial to our country.\n  I support many of the provisions in the majority bill. There are \nconsolidations of grants, cyber stalking, rural programs, assistance \nfor individuals with disabilities, older victims, housing protections, \nand numerous other provisions I wholeheartedly support. There is \noverwhelming bipartisan support for 98 percent of what is contained in \nS. 47.\n  The process on the Violence Against Women Act in the 112th Congress \nwas very disappointing, and I expressed that last year during debate on \nthis issue.\n  Previously, the Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized \nunanimously--I mean prior to the debate last year and this year.\n  When new provisions were added in the past, prior to last year, they \nwere consensus items. The law then was reauthorized by consensus. \nSomething similar could have happened again last year, but it did not. \nNew provisions were forced into the bill. Some of these provisions were \ncontroversial. Some raised serious constitutional concerns. But those \non the other side of the aisle insisted on these provisions without \nchange and refused any sort of middle ground. It appeared that the \ndebate was more about blame and politics than it was about providing \nhelp to women in need.\n  Last Congress, both the Republican leader and this Senator offered \nthat the Senate consent to striking a provision that violated the \nConstitution's Origination clause and then we would proceed to \nconference. Everybody knows that the Constitution's Origination clause \nsays that issues involving raising revenue must start in the other \nbody. Well, this bill raised revenue and, consequently, violated that \nconstitutional provision.\n  Yet today, S. 47 has removed that provision that raised this blue \nslip problem in the other body. It does this only a few months after \nthe majority refused to drop it and proceed to conference. What I just \nsaid tells you, if it had been done as they are doing it right now, we \ncould have gotten this bill to conference and had something to the \nPresident in the last Congress. The willingness of the majority today \nto eliminate that unconstitutional provision demonstrates that we could \nhave had a bill last year, and that is what I want to express to my \ncolleagues as a terribly disappointing proposition for this Senator.\n  It is not true that unless S. 47 is passed exactly as is, various \ngroups will be excluded from protection under the law. Current law \nprotects all victims. Vice President Biden wrote the current law. Every \nMember of the Senate who was a Member of this body when the Violence \nAgainst Women Act last was reauthorized voted for that bill, which \nbacks up what I have been saying several times during my remarks, that \nthis could have passed last year as a consensus piece of legislation \nand has passed in other reauthorizations as a consensus piece of \nlegislation.\n  Neither Vice President Biden nor any other Senator passed a \ndiscriminatory bill in the past. It is not the case that unless the \ncontroversial provisions are accepted exactly as the majority insists, \nwithout any compromise whatsoever, that any groups will be excluded.\n  The key stumbling block to enacting a bill at this time is the \nprovision concerning Indian tribal courts. That provision raises \nserious constitutional\n\n[[Page S488]]\n\nquestions concerning both the sovereignty of tribal courts and the \nconstitutional rights of defendants who would be tried in those tribal \ncourts.\n  We should focus on providing needed services for Native American \nwomen. But S. 47 makes political statements and expounds needlessly on \nNative American sovereignty. It raises such significant constitutional \nproblems that its passage might actually not accomplish anything at all \nfor Native American women, while at the same time failing to protect \nthe constitutional rights of other American citizens.\n  Even the respected organization, the Congressional Research Service, \nhas raised constitutional questions about the tribal provisions in this \nbill. I hope that whatever the Senate might do today, negotiations on \nthese questions will continue. I am confident that if we can reach \nagreement on these questions, compromises on the other few remaining \nissues can also be secured, allowing the bill to pass with overwhelming \nbipartisan support.\n  So following up on some of the concerns I have raised this morning, I \nwill yet today, if possible, offer a substitute that is much more \nlikely to be accepted by the other body and then get to the President \nfor signature.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \nsupport for the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act. It is \nimportant that we are doing this early in the 113th Congress and \nunfortunate that we have to have this debate again. The Senate passed a \nnearly identical bill last April--a bill with strong bipartisan \nsupport--but the House failed to bring it up for a vote, allowing the \nlaw to expire at the end of last year.\n  Many House Republicans opposed the Senate bill because it expanded \nVAWA protections to three groups: gays and lesbians, Native Americans, \nand undocumented immigrants. I support all three of these expansions.\n  Today I want to again stress how crucial this measure is to Native \nAmerican women. For the past 19 years, the Violence Against Women Act \nhelped protect Native women from domestic violence, from sexual \nassault, and from stalking. This historic legislation has strengthened \nthe prosecution of these crimes, and it has provided critical support \nto the victims.\n  VAWA has long been bipartisan, with broad support. Democrats, \nRepublicans, law enforcement officers, prosecutors, judges, health \nprofessionals, all have supported this legislation. Why? Because it has \nworked. Since VAWA's passage in 1994, domestic violence has decreased \nby over 50 percent, and the victims of these crimes have been more \nwilling to come forward, knowing they are not alone, knowing they will \nget the support they need, knowing that crimes against women will not \nbe tolerated.\n  Unfortunately, not all women have received the full benefits of the \nViolence Against Women Act. That is why the tribal provisions now are \nso important. Native American Women are 2\\1/2\\ times more likely than \nother U.S. women to be victims of rape. One in three will be sexually \nassaulted in their lifetimes. And it is estimated that three out of \nevery five Native women will experience domestic violence.\n  Those numbers are tragic. Those numbers tell a story of great human \nsuffering, of women in desperate situations, desperate for support, and \ntoo often we have failed to provide that support. The frequency of \nviolence against Native women is only part of the tragedy. Too often \nthese crimes go unprosecuted and unpunished. Not only is violence \ninflicted but justice is denied.\n  Here is the problem: Tribal governments are unable to prosecute non-\nIndians for domestic violence crimes. They have no authority over these \ncrimes against Native American spouses or partners within their own \ntribal lands.\n  Instead, under existing law, these crimes fall exclusively under \nFederal jurisdiction. But Federal prosecutors have limited resources. \nThey may be located hours away from tribal communities. Non-Indian \nperpetrators often go unpunished. Yet over 50 percent of Native women \nare married to non-Indians, and 76 percent of the overall population \nliving on tribal lands is non-Indian.\n  The result is an escalating cycle of violence. On some tribal lands, \nthe homicide rate for Native women is up to 10 times the national \naverage--10 times the national average. But this starts with small \ncrimes, small acts of violence that may not rise to the attention of a \nFederal prosecutor.\n  In 2006 and 2007, U.S. attorneys prosecuted only 45 misdemeanor \ncrimes on tribal lands. For perspective, the Salt River Reservation in \nArizona--which is relatively small--reported more than 450 domestic \nviolence cases in 2006 alone. Those numbers are appalling.\n  Native women should not be abandoned to a jurisdictional loophole. In \neffect, these women are living in a prosecution-free zone. The tribal \nprovisions in VAWA will provide a remedy.\n  The bill allows tribal courts to prosecute non-Indians in a narrow \nset of cases that meet the following specific conditions: The crime \nmust have occurred in Indian country; the crime must be either a \ndomestic violence or dating violence offense or a violation of a \nprotective order; and the non-Indian defendant must reside in Indian \ncountry, be employed in Indian country, or be the spouse or intimate \npartner of a member of the prosecuting tribe.\n  This bill does not extend tribal jurisdiction to general crimes of \nviolence by non-Indians. It does not apply to crimes between two non-\nIndians, crimes between persons with no ties to the tribe. If they do \nnot have any ties to the tribe, it does not apply. Nothing in this \nprovision diminishes or alters the jurisdiction of any Federal or State \ncourt.\n  I know some of my colleagues question whether a tribal court can \nprovide the same protections to defendants that are guaranteed in a \nFederal or State court. The bill addresses this concern. It provides \ncomprehensive protections to all criminal defendants who are prosecuted \nin tribal courts, whether or not the defendant is a Native American. \nDefendants would essentially have the same rights in tribal court as \nthey do in State court. These include, among many others, the right to \ncounsel, the right to a speedy trial, the right to due process, the \nrights against unreasonable search and seizure, double jeopardy, and \nself-incrimination. A tribe that does not provide these protections \ncannot prosecute non-Indians under this provision.\n  Some have also questioned whether Congress has the authority to \nexpand tribal criminal jurisdiction to cover non-Indians. This issue \nwas carefully considered in drafting the tribal jurisdiction \nprovisions. The Indian Affairs and Judiciary Committees worked closely \nwith the Department of Justice to ensure that the legislation is \nconstitutional.\n  As a former Federal prosecutor and attorney general of a State with a \nlarge Native American population, I know how difficult the legal maze \ncan be for tribal communities. One result of this maze is unchecked \ncrime. In situations where personnel and funding run thin and distances \nare long, violence often goes unpunished. This legislation will create \na local solution for a local problem. Tribes have proven their \neffectiveness in combating domestic violence committed by Native \nAmericans.\n  But let me reiterate this very important point: Without an act of \nCongress, tribes cannot prosecute a non-Indian, even if he lives on the \nreservation, even if he is married to a tribal member. Without this act \nof Congress, tribes will continue to lack authority.\n  This legislation will create a local solution for a local problem. \nTribes have proven their effectiveness in combating domestic violence \ncommitted by Native Americans. But let me reiterate this very important \npoint--without an act of Congress, tribes cannot prosecute a non-\nIndian. Even if he lives on the reservation. Even if he is married to a \ntribal member. Without this act of Congress, tribes will continue to \nlack authority.\n  This bill will also promote other important efforts to protect Native \nwomen from an epidemic of domestic violence, with increasing grants for \ntribal programs to address violence, with support for research on \nviolence against Native women, and also by allowing Federal prosecutors \nto seek tougher sentences for perpetrators who\n\n[[Page S489]]\n\nstrangle or suffocate their spouses or partners.\n  All of these provisions are about justice. Right now, Native women do \nnot get the justice they deserve. But these are strong women. They, \nrightly, demand to be heard. They have identified a desperate need and \nlogical solutions. That is why Native women and tribal leaders across \nthe Nation support the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act and \nthe proposed tribal provisions.\n  There are many--far too many--stories of violence against Native \nwomen, and of the failure to protect them. Stories that should outrage \nus all. And that could end through local intervention. Local authority \nthat will only be made possible through an act of Congress. We have the \nopportunity to support such an act in the tribal provisions of VAWA. \nWith this bill we can close a dark and desperate loophole in criminal \njurisdiction. Native women have waited too long already for justice. \nThey should not have to wait any longer.\n  Senator Leahy had asked that I put tribal statements in the Record. I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record these letters from \ntribal and other organizations in support of the tribal provision in S. \n47, the Violence Against Women Act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Office of the Governor,\n\n\n                                            Pueblo of Tesuque,\n\n                                   Santa Fe, NM, February 5, 2012.\n     Re Support for S. 47, VAWA Reauthorization\n\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Senate Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: I write on behalf of the Pueblo of \n     Tesuque to voice our strong support for S. 47, the Violence \n     Against Women Reauthorization Act (VAWA) of 2013. This bill \n     will provide local tribal governments with the long-needed \n     control to combat acts of domestic violence against Native \n     women and children on Indian lands regardless of the status \n     of the offender.\n       The current justice system in place on Indian lands \n     handcuffs the local tribal justice system. Non-Native men who \n     abuse Native women hide behind these federal laws and court \n     decisions, walking the streets of Indian country free of \n     consequences, while denying justice to Native women and their \n     families.\n       Nationally, Native women are raped and assaulted at 2.5 \n     times the national average. More than 1 in 3 Native women \n     will be raped in their lifetimes, and more than 3 in 5 will \n     suffer domestic assault. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) \n     has found that the current system of justice, ``inadequate to \n     stop the pattern of escalating violence against Native \n     women.'' Tribal leaders, police officers, and prosecutors \n     have testified to the fact that when misdemeanor acts of \n     domestic and dating violence go unaddressed, offenders become \n     emboldened and feel untouchable, and the beatings escalate, \n     often leading to death or severe physical injury. A National \n     Institute of Justice-funded analysis of death certificates \n     found that, on some reservations, Native women are murdered \n     at a rate more than ten times the national average. S. 47 \n     will crack down on reservation based domestic violence by all \n     offenders at the early stages before violence escalates.\n       While the problem of violence against Native women is \n     longstanding and broad, the jurisdictional provisions \n     proposed in S. 47, Section 904, are well-reasoned and limited \n     in scope. They extend only to misdemeanor level crimes of \n     domestic and dating violence. They are limited to enforcement \n     of reservation-based crimes involving individuals that work \n     or live on an Indian reservation and who are in a serious \n     relationship with a tribal citizen from that reservation. S. \n     47 also provides the full range of constitutional protections \n     to abuse suspects who would be subject to the authority of \n     tribal courts.\n       In June of 2010, the United States Senate, by unanimous \n     consent, passed the Tribal Law and Order Act (TLOA). On July \n     27, 2010, the House of Representatives passed the measure \n     under suspension of the rules. The tribal provisions in S. 47 \n     are subject to a more narrow set of crimes, are limited to \n     misdemeanor level punishments, and would provide a broader \n     range of protections to suspects of abuse than those required \n     under TLOA. With such broad support for TLOA, it is troubling \n     that some Members of Congress now claim that the narrowly \n     tailored proposal in S. 47 raises constitutional concerns. \n     Such concerns are unfounded.\n       In 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed a similar \n     restoration of tribal government authority through an \n     amendment to the Indian Civil Rights Act. Congress has this \n     authority, and Native women throughout the United States \n     desperately need us to act so that they can be afforded \n     similar access to justice that many others take for granted.\n       In 1978, the U.S. Supreme Court, in deciding to divest \n     Indian tribes of authority over local reservation-based \n     crimes, made the following statement:\n       ``We recognize that some Indian tribal court systems have \n     become increasingly sophisticated and resemble in many \n     respects their state counterparts. . . . We are not unaware \n     of the prevalence of non-Indian crime on today's reservations \n     which the tribes forcefully argue requires the ability to try \n     non-Indians. But these are considerations for Congress to \n     weigh.'' Oliphant v.

S. 47 takes reasonable well-tailored \n     measures to fill the gap in local authority, and will go far \n     in helping to prevent future acts of violence against Native \n     women nationwide.

Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       To the Members of the U.S. Senate: On behalf of the \n     National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges (NCJFCJ) \n     and its 2,000 members who represent the nation's 30,000 state \n     family and juvenile court judges, I am writing in support of \n     Title IX of S. 47, the bill to reauthorize the Violence \n     Against Women Act. In particular, I am writing to apprise you \n     of the NCJFCJ's strong support for the recognition of tribes' \n     need for and sovereign authority to establish tribal courts \n     to address the epidemic of domestic violence on tribal lands.\n       On January 21, 2011, the NCJFCJ adopted an organizational \n     policy that states that we recognize tribal courts as equal \n     and parallel systems of justice to the state court systems. \n     We did so because our state court judge members have a strong \n     history of working with tribal courts and are aware of their \n     capacity to adjudicate local cases of domestic violence. Our \n     organization has long supported the efforts of tribal courts \n     to address these crimes, whether these crimes are committed \n     by Indian or non-Indian persons, in order to protect the \n     safety of the victims of these crimes, their family members, \n     and the local community.\n       In our role as state court judges working alongside tribal \n     lands, we are in a unique position to see the shortcomings of \n     the current system of justice afforded to the tribes through \n     the federal district courts. Currently, only the U.S. \n     Attorneys can prosecute these cases--but they seldom do, \n     because there are not enough U.S. Attorneys to handle these \n     cases and because in many cases the nearest office of the \n     U.S. Attorney is several hundred miles away. The remote \n     locations of many tribal communities create serious obstacles \n     to access for victims of these crimes. They have no way to \n     get to federal court and the federal court has no capacity to \n     reach out to these geographically distant communities. Yet we \n     know how dangerous domestic violence cases can be, and cannot \n     stand by and let these crimes go unaddressed. Too many lives \n     are at risk; too many victims and children are left to suffer \n     because the only system of justice afforded to them is \n     utterly out of reach.\n       We believe that the provisions contained in S. 47 create an \n     excellent path for supporting a system of tribal courts that \n     can quickly, appropriately, and fairly respond to the \n     epidemic of domestic violence on tribal lands. We base this \n     belief on the long history NCJFCJ has had in providing \n     training and technical assistance to tribal courts. There is \n     a dedication and willingness on the part of both tribal and \n     state courts to build the best possible system of justice for \n     Native victims of domestic violence. We ask the Senate to \n     recognize the appropriateness of tribal courts' providing \n     protection to their most vulnerable community members. In the \n     interests of justice for all, we ask you to vote for S. 47 so \n     that its tribal provisions can become law.\n       If you have any questions, we stand ready to answer with \n     whatever information you may need.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Michael Nash,\n\n                                    President, National Council of\n     Juvenile and Family Court Judges.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Susanville Indian Rancheria,\n\n                                 Susanville, CA, February 4, 2013.\n     Re Support for S. 47, VAWA Reauthorization\n\n     Hon.

I know my colleague, the Senator from \nMinnesota, Ms. Klobuchar, is here today--another prosecutor, another \nSenator who knows the importance of this law. I very much appreciate \nher hard work in terms of bringing justice to tribal communities and \nbringing justice to women across this Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I wish to first thank the Senator from \nNew Mexico for his great leadership on this issue. This is a national \nissue. It is a bipartisan issue. It crosses geographic lines. Those of \nus who have significant tribal communities know how important these \nprovisions are to this bill.\n  We tried very hard on the Judiciary Committee to make sure this bill \nis consistent with the bipartisan work we have done in the past, but we \nalso saw it as an opportunity to consolidate some of the programs to \nsave money and then to look at areas where we needed to be more \nsophisticated, where we needed to respond to changing issues in the \nlaw. Certainly, the tribal jurisdiction issue was one of those major \nissues.\n  I rise today to talk about the importance of this bill. It is a law \nthat has changed the way we think about violence against women in the \nUnited States of America. The Violence Against Women Act is one of the \ngreat legislative success stories in the criminal area in the last few \ndecades. Since it was first passed in 1994, annual domestic violence \nrates have fallen by 50 percent. Now, you usually cannot say that about \ncriminal prosecution efforts. I usually do not have that kind of \nnumber. But that is what we have--since 1994, a 50-percent difference \nin domestic violence rates.\n  People have stopped looking at the issue of domestic violence as a \nfamily issue, and they have started treating domestic violence and \nsexual assault as the serious crimes they are. Last year Minnesota \nrecorded the lowest number of domestic-related deaths since 1991--down \nfrom 34 in 2011 to 18. This is in no small part due to the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. Women have more access to intervention programs, and \nthey feel more empowered to come forward.\n  I know in my own county, where I was chief prosecutor for 8 years, \nthanks to the good work of Paul and Sheila Wellstone, and my \npredecessor Mike Freeman, we set up one of the most unique domestic \nviolence service centers in the country. It has been a model for the \nrest of the country. Under my leadership, we also made changes to it to \nadvance it to even higher levels. But the point is that it is a one-\nstop shop for the victims of domestic violence, so they can come in, \nsee a prosecutor, see a cop, have a place for their kids to play, be \nable to find a shelter and a place to live, all under one roof instead \nof walking through the maze of the bureaucracy in the Government \nCenter.\n  Both prevention and prosecution of domestic violence work were among \nmy top priorities as a prosecutor. I know we have done good work, but \nthere is still a lot of work that needs to be done.\n  According to a recent survey conducted by the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, 24 people per minute are victims of rape, \nphysical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner in this country. \nApproximately one in four women has experienced severe physical \nviolence by an intimate partner at some point in her lifetime, and 45 \npercent of the women killed in the United States are killed by their \npartner. Every year close to 17,000 people still lose their lives to \ndomestic violence. These statistics mean that sexual assault, domestic \nviolence, and stalking are still problems in America. That is why it is \nso important that we move quickly to take up this bill.\n  Just like the two prior authorizations in 2000 and 2006, this bill \nstrengthens current law and provides solutions to problems that we have \nlearned more about since VAWA first passed in 1994.\n  The Senate bill continues a tradition of bipartisan sponsorship, with \n60 cosponsors, including 7 Republicans. As we know, last April the \nSenate approved this bill by a 68-to-31 vote. All 17 women Senators--I \nsee my colleague Senator Murkowski here from Alaska. We thank her for \nher support and vote for that bill. This truly brought the women of the \nSenate together to stand up against domestic violence.\n  What does this bill do that is different from the last bill? Well, it \nconsolidates duplicative programs and streamlines others. It provides \ngreater flexibility for the use of grant money. It has new training \nrequirements for people providing legal assistance to victims. As I \nmentioned, it takes important steps to address the disproportionately \nhigh domestic violence rates in Native American communities.\n  I am disappointed that we were unable to include the modest increase \nin U visas for immigrant victims of domestic violence. There were \ntechnical objections to including that provision. It was removed in \norder to improve our chances of getting this bill done once and for \nall. U visas are an important tool for encouraging victims to come \nforward. I will press to increase the number of U visas available to \nvictims when we work on the comprehensive immigration reform bill in \nthe spring.\n  One thing I wish to note about this bill is that it closes many gaps \nin the current system, ways to improve the current system. There was a \nbill I introduced with Senator Hutchison to address high-tech stalking, \ncases where stalkers use technology such as the Internet, video \nsurveillance, and bugging to stalk victims. This is not something we \nprobably would be talking about if I were standing here in 1994, but \nhere in 2013, we know it is an issue. We have seen cases across the \nNation of this kind of video surveillance and Internet bugging. In \nfact, we had a very high profile case involving a high profile \nnewscaster who was willing to come forward and work with House and \nSenate authors on this bill. We are very pleased to have had the \nsupport from the Fraternal Order of Police, Federal Law Enforcement \nOfficers Association, National Sheriffs' Association, and the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police. They have all endorsed \nthis bill.\n  This provision, the high-tech stalking provision, is included in the \nViolence Against Women Act, so we are very happy about that. Again, I \nbelieve our laws have to be as sophisticated as those who are breaking \nthem. If they are using the Internet, if they are spying with video \ncameras through peepholes, we have to be able to respond to that.\n  I wanted to end by telling a story I told when we first started to \nconsider this bill over a year ago. A year ago,\n\n[[Page S492]]\n\nover the holidays, I went to one of the saddest funerals I ever \nattended. It was the funeral for Shawn Schneider. He was a Lake City \npolice officer in Minneapolis. I have since gotten to know his widow. \nHe died responding to a domestic violence case. He went up to the door. \nHe had received a call from the 17-year-old victim--the department had. \nHe went up there to that door, and he got shot in the head. His \nbulletproof vest did not protect him. Nothing protected him. When I was \nsitting in that church and saw his three little children, including \nthat little girl in her little blue dress covered in stars, I thought \nto myself at that moment, the victims of domestic abuse are not just \none victim. It is an entire family. It is an entire community. So in \ntheir honor today, in the honor of those children, I would like us to \nhave strong bipartisan support for the Violence Against Women Act. I \nbelieve we can do it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record these letters \nfrom law enforcement and criminal justice organizations in support of \nS. 47, the Violence Against Women Act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         AEquitas, the Prosecutors' Resource on Violence Against \n           Women,\n                                 Washington, DC, February 4, 2013.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Bob Goodlatte,\n     Chairman, House Committee on Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Judiciary, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. John Conyers,\n     Ranking Member, House Committee on Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy, Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member \n     Grassley and Ranking Member Conyers: On behalf of AEquitas: \n     The Prosecutors' Resource on Violence Against Women, in \n     support for the Violence Against Women Act's (VAWA) \n     reauthorization. AEquitas' mission is to improve the quality \n     of justice in sexual violence, intimate partner violence, \n     stalking, and human trafficking cases by developing, \n     evaluating and refining prosecution practices that increase \n     victim safety and offender accountability.\n       VAWA has unquestionably improved the nation's justice \n     system response to the devastating crimes of sexual violence, \n     intimate partner violence, and stalking. This critical \n     legislation must be reauthorized to ensure a continued \n     response to these crimes.\n       Since its original passage in 1994, VAWA has improved the \n     criminal justice system's ability to keep victims safe and \n     hold perpetrators accountable. As a result of this historic \n     legislation, every state has enacted laws making stalking a \n     crime and strengthened criminal rape and sexual assault \n     statutes.\n       VAWA has undoubtedly had a positive impact on the efforts \n     of prosecutors to hold offenders accountable while supporting \n     victim safety. We urge Congress to reauthorize VAWA to build \n     upon its successes and to expand its ability to improve our \n     response to these crimes, hold perpetrators accountable, and \n     keep victims and their children safe from future harm.\n       Thank you for your leadership and steadfast commitment to \n     supporting victims of sexual violence, intimate partner \n     violence, and stalking. We look forward to hearing of VAWA's \n     swift reauthorization. If you have any questions, please feel \n     free to contact me.\n     Sincerely,\n                                           Jennifer G. Long, J.D.,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            American Probation and\n\n\n                                           Parole Association,\n\n                                  Lexington, KY, February 1, 2013.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Mike Crapo,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Crapo: The American Probation and \n     Parole Association (APPA) represents over 35,000 pretrial, \n     probation, parole and community corrections professionals \n     working in the criminal and juvenile justice systems \n     nationally and come from federal, state, local and tribal \n     jurisdictions. On behalf of our membership and constituents \n     we whole-heartedly support your efforts to have the Violence \n     Against Women Act (VAWA) reauthorized.\n       The VAWA initiatives have supported state, local and tribal \n     efforts to effectively address the crimes of domestic \n     violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking. These \n     efforts have shown great progress and promise towards keeping \n     victims safe and holding perpetrators accountable. The \n     reauthorization of VAWA is critical to maintaining the \n     progress of current initiatives and ensuring comprehensive \n     and effective responses to these crimes in the future for the \n     protection of all victims without consideration of race, \n     ethnicity or sexual orientation.\n       Domestic violence perpetrators represent a significant \n     proportion of the total population on community supervision. \n     In 200 8 there were nearly 86,000 adults on probation for a \n     domestic violence offense in United States, and data from the \n     California Department of Justice indicates that in 2000 \n     approximately 90 % of adults convicted of felony domestic \n     violence offenses in that state were sentenced to a period of \n     probation, either alone or coupled with incarceration. \n     Domestic violence offenders are among the most dangerous \n     offenders on community supervision caseloads, and in order to \n     supervise domestic violence offenders effectively, community \n     corrections professionals must receive adequate training.\n       Since its original passage in 1994, VAWA has been \n     instrumental in increasing our constituents' attention to and \n     understanding of these crimes as well as provided significant \n     assistance in humanizing their responsiveness to victims and \n     improving their practices related to accountability and \n     intervention with perpetrators of these crimes. VAWA has \n     without question been instrumental in developing community \n     supervision practices that keep victims and their families \n     safe from future harm and improved compliance and behavioral \n     change for perpetrators.\n       We stand ready to assist you throughout the reauthorization \n     process. If you have any questions or require further \n     information or assistance, please feel free to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Carl Wicklund,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Association of\n\n\n                                        Prosecuting Attorneys,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 4, 2013.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: On behalf of the Association of \n     Prosecuting Attorneys, which represents and supports all \n     prosecutors, I am writing today regarding the Violence \n     Against Women Act's (VAWA) reauthorization. VAWA has improved \n     the criminal justice system's response to the devastating \n     crimes of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault \n     and stalking. The reauthorization of this critical \n     legislation ensures a continued response to these crimes.\n       Since its original passage in 1994, VAWA has dramatically \n     enhanced our nation's response to violence against women. \n     More victims report domestic violence to the police, the rate \n     of non-fatal intimate partner violence against women has \n     decreased by 63%, and VAWA saved nearly $14.8 billion in net \n     averted social costs in just the first six years.\n       The reauthorization of VAWA builds upon existing efforts to \n     more effectively combat violence against all victims. The \n     reauthorization of VAWA renews a range of important programs \n     and initiatives for law enforcement to address the various \n     causes and far-reaching consequences of domestic violence, \n     sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking. VAWA \n     Reauthorization will further build upon the successes of \n     these programs by including measures to ensure an increased \n     focus on sexual assault prevention, enforcement, and \n     services; and providing assistance to law enforcement to take \n     key steps to reduce backlogs of rape kits under their \n     control.\n       VAWA has undoubtedly had a positive impact on the efforts \n     of law enforcement agencies nationwide to keep victims and \n     their children safe and hold perpetrators accountable. Thank \n     you for your leadership and steadfast commitment to \n     supporting victims of domestic violence, dating violence, \n     sexual assault, and stalking. We look forward to hearing of \n     VAWA's swift reauthorization. If you have any questions, feel \n     free to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Steven Jansen,\n     Vice President/COO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Board of Supervisors,\n\n\n                                      County of Santa Barbara,\n\n                              Santa Barbara, CA, January 31, 2013.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing on behalf of the Santa \n     Barbara County Board of Supervisors to urge you to take \n     action on legislation to reauthorize the Violence Against \n     Women Act (VAWA).\n       Thank you for introducing S. 47, the Violence Against Women \n     Reauthorization Act. Programs authorized by VAWA have saved \n     lives as well as providing resources and training needed in \n     communities like Santa Barbara County to address these \n     reprehensible crimes, and the Board recognizes the importance \n     of reauthorizing and enhancing the resources provided by this \n     important public safety program.\n       The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act would expand \n     the law's focus on sexual assault and help ensure access to \n     services for all victims of domestic and sexual violence. It \n     also responds to these difficult economic times by \n     consolidating programs, focusing on the most effective \n     approaches, and adding accountability measures to ensure that \n     Federal funds are used efficiently and effectively.\n       The Violence Against Women Act has been successful because \n     it has consistently had\n\n[[Page S493]]\n\n     strong bipartisan support for nearly two decades. Please work \n     with the members of your committee to expedite action on S. \n     47 or similar legislation to reauthorize VAWA.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                Thomas P. Walters,\n     Washington Representative.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     American Bar Association,\n\n                                    Chicago, IL, January 30, 2013.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Michael D. Crapo,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Crapo: On behalf of the American \n     Bar Association (ABA), with nearly 400,000 members across the \n     country, I write to commend your continued bipartisan \n     leadership in the cause of justice and equal rights with the \n     introduction of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization \n     Act of 2013. The ABA strongly supports your effort to renew \n     proven and effective programs that support victims of \n     domestic, sexual, stalking and dating violence and their \n     families.\n       The ABA has long supported efforts to address domestic, \n     sexual and stalking violence, and we recognize that the legal \n     profession fulfills an important role in addressing these \n     crimes. Since 1994, the ABA's Commission on Domestic & Sexual \n     Violence has also worked to increase access to justice for \n     victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking by \n     mobilizing the legal profession.\n       In recent years, the ABA has adopted policies that \n     specifically address VAWA reauthorization, including some of \n     the more challenging issues that ultimately proved to be \n     barriers to reauthorization during the last Congress:\n       February 2010: urging reauthorization and highlighting the \n     need for legislation that ``provides services, protection, \n     and justice for underserved and vulnerable victims of \n     violence, including children and youth who are victims or are \n     witnesses to family violence, and victims who are disabled, \n     elderly, immigrant, trafficked, LGBT and/or Indian.''\n       August 2012: urging Congress ``to strengthen tribal \n     jurisdiction to address crimes of gender-based violence on \n     tribal lands that are committed by non-Indian perpetrators.''\n       VAWA reauthorization was a legislative priority for the \n     association during the 112th Congress and a focus of our \n     annual grassroots lobbying event, ABA Day 2012, when ABA, \n     state, local, and specialty bar leaders from al l 50 states \n     met with members of Congress of both parties on this issue.\n       VAWA reauthorization remains a priority for the American \n     Bar Association during the 113th Congress. We appreciate your \n     leadership and look forward to working with you to ensure \n     passage of this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Laurel G. Bellows.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Attorney General of Missouri,\n\n                             Jefferson City, MO, February 6, 2013.\n       Dear Members of Congress: In 1994, this nation's leaders \n     enacted the Violence Against Women Act (``VAWA''). This \n     landmark piece of legislation put in place a legal framework \n     that better enabled states like Missouri to effectively \n     investigate violent crimes against women, prosecute and \n     punish offenders, and protect victims from further harm. In \n     the decades since VAWA's enactment, Congress has twice voted \n     to reauthorize the law. With each reauthorization, Congress \n     not only strengthened the provisions of the law, it also \n     reaffirmed this country's commitment to support survivors of \n     personal violence and sexual assault. It is time to do so \n     again.\n       Missouri women and their families rely on the programs and \n     services that VAWA makes possible. For example, non-profit, \n     community, and faith-based organizations use federal funds \n     directed through VAWA's Sexual Assault Services Program to \n     provide vital support to victims of sexual assault. And \n     Missouri prosecutors, police officers, and court personnel \n     participate in training funded through the STOP (Services \n     Training Officers Prosecutors) program, equipping them to \n     better address violent crime against women.\n       But the work is just beginning. In 2011, over 40,000 \n     incidents of domestic violence were reported in Missouri. \n     Thirty women were killed by their husbands or boyfriends. \n     Missouri women reported more than 1,400 forcible rapes or \n     attempted forcible rapes. And although over 10,000 women in \n     need were able to find a place at a shelter, nearly 20,000 \n     more were turned away.\n       By reauthorizing VAWA, this Congress will continue the \n     effort undertaken nearly twenty years ago--the effort to \n     eliminate violent crime perpetrated against our mothers, our \n     sisters, our daughters, our neighbors, and our friends. I \n     urge each of you to support this important legislation.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                     Chris Koster,\n                              Attorney General, State of Missouri.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, first I would like to follow my \ncolleague from Minnesota in voicing my support for passage of the \nViolence Against Women Act. As she noted, I have been a cosponsor of \nthis very important legislation not only this Congress but last. I have \nurged on multiple occasions that we move forward with reauthorization \nof this very significant legislation, have urged the House to do the \nsame last year. They failed to do that.\n  You do not give up when the cause is right. This is far too important \nto too many around the country. My colleague has cited some of the \nstatistics and the issues and the initiatives she worked on when she \nwas back home in her home State of Minnesota. It is something I think \nwe all share--a concern for the levels of domestic violence within our \nrespective States. In a State such as Alaska where we have so much to \nbe proud of, unfortunately our statistics as they relate to domestic \nviolence are appalling. Appalling.\n  So anything that we can do, whether it is here in Washington, DC, at \nthe local level, the State level, we must do. We need to act here. So I \njoin not only my colleague from Minnesota but so many who have led the \ncharge here to do right as we work to reauthorize the Violence Against \nWomen Act. I will have an opportunity to speak more on the VAWA \nreauthorization later.\n\n\n               Decision by the Department of the Interior\n\n  I wanted to take some time this morning to come to the floor to speak \nabout an issue that has absolutely inflamed me this week. This week I \nlearned that the Fish and Wildlife Service in the Department of the \nInterior has made a decision to deny the construction of a single-lane \ngravel emergency access road through a very, very tiny portion of a \nnational wildlife refuge located on the Alaska Peninsula in southwest \nAlaska.\n  You might think, well, why is this such a big deal? You have heard me \nhere on the floor or others here in this body have certainly heard me \nmany times advocate on behalf of Alaska and the development of our \nresources to benefit the people of Alaska, to benefit the country as a \nwhole. This is not a development project I am talking about here today. \nWhat I am addressing today is the health and the safety--the safety of \nthe residents of a small Aleut community located in the Aleutian \nIslands. These are 748 people who really do not have the audiences so \nmany constituents in Alaska or in other parts of the country enjoy.\n  They are kind of out of sight, out of mind, if you will. They are not \nout of sight, out of mind, out of my heart.\n  One of the most important responsibilities we have as U.S. Senators, \nas Members of Congress, is to protect the safety of those people we \nrepresent.\n  I wish to tell the story of King Cove, AK, and what is going on. You \nhave seen the picture of the map of Alaska, the big beautiful State. I \ndon't have it superimposed over the rest of the lower 48, because my \npoint today is not to talk about how big we are in comparison to the \nrest of the Nation as a whole but to put in context what we are talking \nabout here when we talk about the community of King Cove, AK.\n  You have the Aleutian peninsula here that stretches out approximately \n1,000 miles. You might not appreciate the length and scope we are \ntalking about here, but the Aleutian chain is just exactly that.\n  King Cove is right on the end of this peninsula area in this diagram. \nIt is kind of out there. When I say ``kind of out there,'' there is \nnothing else around there. There are no roads that connect you to get \nanywhere when you want to go to ``town.'' Town is Anchorage, AK, \nprobably about 600 miles away, maybe even a little bit longer. It is \nmost likely a $1,000 airplane ticket to get there. That puts it in \ncontext here. This is King Cove, AK.\n  To put it in a little better context as to what we are speaking \nabout, this is the community of King Cove right on the end of this \nlagoon, this bay. All the way around the other side of the bay is an \narea called Cold Bay. Cold Bay was designated during World War II as an \nair base this country relied on. During the war, they constructed a \n10,000-foot runway. It is the second longest runway in the State of \nAlaska right now, and it is in pretty good shape. It is used as a \ndivert runway. NASA uses it as one of its divert places. It is a pretty \ngood solid airport.\n  Keep in mind, Cold Bay has about 100, maybe 110 people on a good day \nwho live there. Around here, King Cove is an Aleut community. It has \nbeen\n\n[[Page S494]]\n\naround for maybe 1,000 years, maybe a couple of thousand years. It has \nbeen around a long time. The Aleut people have lived in this part of \nthe country for thousands of years. This community now is host to about \n748 people, give or take. During the fishing season you might get it up \nas high as possibly 1,000 people. It is not a booming metropolis by any \nstretch of the imagination.\n  King Cove, as you can see, is kind of isolated. There is water all \naround it. That is fair, that is good. This is a situation where this \ncommunity is ringed by mountains.\n  I have a picture here of King Cove. When you look at the location of \nthe water, you see where the mountains are. These are pretty fjord-\nlike. These are not timid and tame mountains. These are the types of \nmountains that get your attention when you are flying in.\n  The air strip here for King Cove sits right back up in this area. You \nneed to come through these high mountains on all sides. When the cloud \nlayer is low, as it usually is in this area, there are some issues as \nto whether you have a safe fly-out range.\n  There are clouds, not only cross currents that hit as you are coming \ninto the airport, but you also have the downdraft coming off these very \nstrong, very prominent mountains. This type of downdraft causes \nturbulence that particularly impacts helicopters which might be coming \ninto this community for a rescue.\n  Again, as you look at the options of getting in and out of King Cove, \nyour airport sits about here. You are rimmed with mountains. You may \neither fly in up this way or you may fly in and out that way. Either \nway you cut it, you are moving through very high mountainous terrain \nwith winds on all sides coming from above, clouds coming from below. It \nis as tricky and as difficult a navigational issue as about anywhere in \nthe State.\n  Going back to where King Cove sits in the ocean here, weather comes \nin off the Bering Sea up here and there is weather that comes up from \nthe Gulf of Alaska here. It all kind of comes together right around the \nAleutians. The Aleutians are known to be one of the areas, at least in \nthis country, of--excuse the expression, but we call it snotty weather. \nIt is foul weather too many times of the year, not just in the winter.\n  We saw last month the incident with Shell's vessel trying to move \nfrom Unalaska across the Gulf of Alaska during January and encountering \nseas of up to 40 feet. This is the weather we deal with in Alaska. \nThere are difficult seas, and there are difficult flying situations. \nYet there are people who call King Cove home and have for thousands of \nyears.\n  You might ask why I am spending so much time talking about the \nweather. It sets the stage for this action the Department of Interior \nhas taken and why I feel this decision is so wrongheaded, so \nshortsighted, and so wrong to the people who call this area home.\n  Talking again about the weather and what it means, when you are in a \nsmall community that doesn't have a hospital--you don't have a hospital \nif there are 748 people. We have an IHS clinic, an Indian Health \nService clinic. To provide for health needs is a community health aid, \nand we might have a PA every now and again, but not always reliably. We \nactually did have a doctor out in King Cove some years ago. He was \nthere in 2006, and he left after 6 months. We don't have the medical \nassistance we need. When somebody suffers a heart attack, when a woman \nhas a complication with a pregnancy, it is not as if you can stay there \nin King Cove and seek medical help.\n  What happens? They have to get out. Well, how do they get out? They \ncan get out by boat. They can move around by boat from King Cove over \nto Cold Bay, where we have the second largest runway in the State of \nAlaska. It seems like a pretty simple situation. The problem is that a \nboat is about as dangerous oftentimes as flying. What happens is if you \nhave weather this stinky, it raises the waves, making getting a fishing \nvessel across with a sick person, trying to get them to the dock on \nCold Bay side and out of that vessel, a harrowing event.\n  This is a picture we took from a video which had been taken by the \nresidents of King Cove. It might be difficult to see this, but what you \nare looking at here is a steel ladder, a ladder going up the side of \nthe dock. It is about a 20-foot area there. Way down at the bottom here \nyou see the base of a fishing vessel. What they are trying to do is to \nhaul a sick, elderly gentleman up this metal ladder in the rain, sleet, \nand snow that is coming. You have a boat that is pitching and heaving \nhere, with somebody up at the top of the dock ready to pick up this \nindividual underneath their arms and haul them up onto the dock. This \nis not a condition you want if you are feeling at all poorly. The \nfishing vessel isn't helping, so maybe we could do something else. \nCongress back in 2005 said maybe we could put a hovercraft there so it \ncan fly the waters between this point here and Cold Bay over here, \nbecause there is a road that can take you right along here and take you \nacross to the water.\n  The problem was not only the seas wouldn't accommodate, but also the \noperational costs were through the roof. It made no sense, and the \npeople in King Cove and Cold Bay had acknowledged it was not going to \nmake any sense. They tried it, they were game, but it hasn't worked.\n  What happened was action needed to be taken because we were seeing \ntoo many people whose lives were at risk. We were seeing too many \npeople who were killed trying to get out in an effort to seek the \nmedical help they needed.\n  At some point in time you say this doesn't work. When you have a way \nout, and it could be a simple road, why wouldn't we do that to address \nthe life safety of the people who live here?\n  Back in 1979 and 1980, there were a number of airplane crashes that \nhappened as they were trying to take off and land in King Cove. In 1981 \nwe had a medevac plane go down. We lost a nurse, her helper, the \npatient, and the medevac's pilot--all killed. They were trying to \nairlift an individual who had suffered a heart attack. Everybody was \nkilled.\n  In 2010, there was an airplane crash that occurred well on landing \ninto King Cove. Della Trumble, who has long been an advocate for a \nsolution to help the people of King Cove, was watching that plane land \nbecause her daughter was coming home. To be sitting there at the air \nstrip, watching the plane come in to deliver your daughter, knowing the \nweather is foul, knowing the conditions are sketchy, and then seeing \nthat airplane crash in front of your eyes--fortunately for Della and \nher daughter, she walked away. Think about that trauma.\n  In February of 2011, the Coast Guard was forced to dispatch a \nhelicopter out of Kodiak, moving a helicopter from Kodiak over to King \nCove. They were trying to transfer a 73-year-old woman who was \nsuffering from chest pains. A few days later the Coast Guard tried and \nfailed to reach King Cove with a helicopter to airlift an 80-year-old \nwoman who was also suffering chest pains. Fortunately, she survived. \nTwo days later, there was another medical airlift that was delayed 6 \nhours from leaving.\n  I just received the statistics from the Coast Guard for last year. \nHow many rescue missions did the Coast Guard take on to go into King \nCove to help those who needed help--not because the medevacs didn't \nwant to go help or because it was going to be too costly--because the \nmedevacs refused to go in because they will not take those risks.\n  What do we do? We call on our fabulous Coast Guard to come in and do \nthe job. It was five times last year. It is scary work. The Coast Guard \ndoes it, and fortunately nobody was killed last year. How many people \nneed to be killed when you have an option for a road to get you to the \nsecond longest runway in the State of Alaska?\n  Let me share with others what it is we actually did to address this \nproblem. We said this is not acceptable. Five years ago this Congress \napproved a land exchange. In that exchange the Aleut people and the \nState of Alaska agreed to give up 56,400 acres of prized waterfowl \nhabitat. They said, okay, we are going to give up 56,000 acres here to \nadd to the Alaska peninsula and Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. We \nare going to trade this and, in return, the government will give back \nabout 1,800 acres.\n  Do the quick math on this. This is a 300-to-1 exchange the people \nagreed to,\n\n[[Page S495]]\n\nand it is even less when we isolate it. We are talking about 206 acres \nthat are at issue--206 acres to allow for construction of a one-lane \ngravel road that will have no commercial use. This is to be used for \nemergency access. If someone needs to get out of King Cove because they \nhave some kind of a condition, all they would need to do is drive 20 \nmiles--20 miles. Think about that. We drive 20 miles to get from here \nto wherever. We drive all the time and we don't think about it. We are \ntalking about 20 miles to save people's lives.\n  But it is even better than that. Because when we are talking about \nwhat we are putting through a refuge, it is about a 10-mile road. I \nhate to even describe it as a road. It is a one-lane gravel area \nthrough this lagoon we are talking about and not for commercial use. We \nhave agreed to this. In exchange for this 10-mile road, we said: We are \ngoing to give the Federal Government 56,400 acres to add to a \nwilderness area. What a deal--what a deal.\n  I hope you can see this, Mr. President, because it is important to \nunderstand what we are talking about. This area in the black is what \nwould be subject to the exchange. This is what is going into the \nwilderness area. All this, plus other acreage that is not shown on this \nmap, in exchange for these red corridors here--about 206 acres.\n  So back in 2009 we figured in the Senate and over in the House it was \nimportant to address the safety needs of the people of King Cove, and \nif we could do that by allowing for 10 miles, 11 miles of new road \nthrough the Izembek Refuge, we could solve a lot of problems. Again, I \nreiterate, this road is specifically not allowed to be used for \neconomic development. In the omnibus bill we passed the language is \nspecific: ``Primarily for health and safety purposes and only for \nnoncommercial purposes.''\n  There were some who were so concerned we were going to see a volume \nof traffic going back and forth between this community of 748 people \nand the 110 people over here and that somehow there was going to be \nthis wild traffic going back and forth that was going to disturb the \nmigratory waterfowl, the birds that come through here, the animals in \nthis refuge area. I think it is important to recognize this is not an \narea that has never been tracked by man; that has never seen a \npresence. Again, I will remind my colleagues, this was an Air Force \nbase in World War II. This is the second largest runway in the State. \nThis is an area that has seen traffic through vehicles, ATVs, over the \nyears because of the war.\n  In this chart, we can see the red tracks here. These are all the \nareas where all-terrain vehicle use is currently in play, and this has \nbeen in play since 2005 to 2008. Then the areas that are kind of red \ndotted are the predicted ATV vehicle travel corridor. We can see this \nis all within the Izembek Refuge area, the wilderness area. So it is \nnot as if this is without any kind of access that is in place.\n  If we look at this next picture, this is an example of what we are \ntalking about with this proposed road. It is out in the middle of some \npretty amazing, sweeping landscape, as we can see. But the road is \npretty much a one-lane gravel road. There is not going to be any stuff \nsuch as street lights. There are not going to be any dividers, \nmeridians, sidewalks. There will not be any overpasses. This is pretty \nmuch what we are talking about here.\n  This next chart shows the existing trails that are currently within \nthe refuge area. Again, it is pretty much a small, narrow, one-track \nroad. It is not like we are going to be able to pass one another moving \nthrough the area.\n  The last picture I wish to show is a view of what the area looks \nlike. It is amazingly flat. It is surrounded by a lagoon area. It is \nbeautiful, absolutely. But these are roads that are currently in \nexistence in the area now. So what we are talking about doing is \nadding--adding--about a 10-mile strip that would allow us to connect \nthe roads that exist in Cold Bay to connect to a community that needs \nto have an emergency way out that is safe. They need to be able to \nconnect to those who are on the other side of this lagoon, and the way \nto do it is this simple road.\n  I have mentioned the concern about the waterfowl, and this is why the \nSecretary of the Interior called me and he said: I listened to the \nbiologists, and the biologists tell me the best way to respect this \nrefuge is to not allow any road, to not allow any road so we can \nrespect the refuge. He listened to the biologists, but the Secretary of \nthe Interior did not listen to the people of Alaska. He did not listen \nto the people of King Cove. He did not even accept a meeting with them \nthe numerous times they have asked to meet with him. They have flown \nacross country to make their case. But he listened to the biologists \nbecause he wants to respect the refuge, and, instead, the lives of \nthese people are not being respected.\n  If this is the attitude of this Department of Interior--that we are \ngoing to respect the animals and we are going to respect the birds, but \nwe are not going to respect the people who live there--then this is the \nwrong way to be going. This is the wrong way to be going, and I will \nnot stand for it.\n  I want to make sure we have refuge areas. I want to make sure we have \nwilderness areas. In this exchange we adopted 5 years ago, we allowed \nfor that. We are putting in place wilderness area--the first new \nwilderness area designated by Congress in a generation, with 45,456 \nacres of prime waterfowl habitat added to wilderness in Alaska. But you \nknow what, that is gone. Those lands will not remain in wilderness \ndesignation unless this road is permitted because the exchange is then \ngoing to be nullified if that road is not going to be built.\n  We have offered a pretty sweet deal--a 300-to-1 exchange--in exchange \nfor the safety of the people who live there. Anyone who thinks we can't \nbuild a one-lane gravel road that will allow for a coexistence between \nthe waterfowl that migrate through there and the people who live there, \nthey have another thing to be thinking about. We will not have a \npractical impact on the waterfowl in the refuge. While the land \nexchange involves 206 acres, far less is actually going to be impacted \nby the construction. It is far less than 1 percent of the refuge. \nAgain, the Federal Government is getting 300 times more land.\n  It is just inconceivable to me we would not be able to have a \nresolution that works for both sides. For the Secretary to move forward \nwith a designation that says no road--no road--it is just stunning to \nme. Some might say it is because it is going to cost us money. There is \nno cost to the Federal Government. The State of Alaska is going to be \nbuilding this.\n\n  Too many people have died for there to be any legitimate excuse for \nfurther delay, and I challenge those officials within the Department of \nthe Interior to come and visit King Cove and don't necessarily come \nduring the good weather--although the people of King Cove would tell us \nthey are not entirely sure when the good weather is--but come and see \nthem. Come and see what we are talking about. I have been there. To \nDeputy Secretary Hayes' credit, he, too, has been there, and I \nappreciate that. I appreciate that others have tried and perhaps have \nnot met with success because the weather didn't allow them in because \nwe weren't about to take a risk with them. But at a minimum, the \nSecretary of the Interior needs to be there. He needs to meet with \npeople--real people, such as Carl Smith, a King Cove elder, an Aleut \nwarrior. He was recognized as one of the amazing veterans. He is an \nEskimo Scout with the Territorial Guard. Look these people in the eye \nand tell them their lives are not worth as much as the lives of the \nbirds, the black brants, that inhabit the area.\n  It is not too late. While this decision of the Department of the \nInterior has been made, the Secretary--or if Secretary Salazar is no \nlonger there, his designee--has a legal obligation under this 2009 act \nto base a decision on the road on what is deemed the ``public \ninterest.'' Right now it seems to me the Department of the Interior has \ndeemed the public is made up solely of birds and sea otters. My \npublic--my public--is the real human beings who live in King Cove.\n  So we need to make sure a decision is not based on an incomplete and \nmisleading EIS that concludes, with lives at stake, no action is \nsomehow acceptable. I repeat: No action is absolutely not acceptable.\n  I am going to end my comments by letting you know what has happened \nin\n\n[[Page S496]]\n\nsome other refuges. It was just a few years ago, we will all remember, \nwhen we were transfixed by what was called ``the miracle on the \nHudson.'' There was a commercial jetliner that hit a flock of Canadian \ngeese, lost power, and landed in the Hudson River. Through the amazing \nskills of that pilot, nobody was harmed. But what was the result of \nthat?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for \n1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. What actually happened a couple years after that \nincident was that USDA's Wildlife Service agents went into the Jamaica \nBay Wildlife Refuge, rounded up and killed 751 Canadian geese. The plan \nwas to kill 1,0000, but they couldn't catch them fast enough.\n  Essentially, we see it is OK to kill birds in New York refuges, but \nwe can't inconvenience the birds in Alaska. Maybe geese are less exotic \nthan black brants or maybe it is because Members of this body and their \nfamilies and friends fly through La Guardia and they worry about that. \nWell, I worry about the lives of Alaskans. I worry about the people of \nKing Cove, and I am not going to rest on this. The decision that came \nout of the Department of the Interior was a travesty. It will not be \nallowed to stand, and I will do everything I can to ensure it does not.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the editorial \nfrom the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner that also opposes the decision of \nthe Department of the Interior, as well as the press accounts I have \nreferred to of the New York geese story.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner]\n\n       Preferred Paths: Agency Recommends Against King Cove Road\n\n       Almost four years ago, the federal administration signed \n     off on a national wilderness act with a provision offering a \n     small, wind-plagued village on the Alaska Peninsula the \n     possibility of future road access to a safer airport. This \n     week, the Obama administration appears poised to snatch that \n     provision back. It should not do so.\n       The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said Tuesday that the \n     federal government should not proceed with a land swap that \n     would allow construction of a road through the Izembek \n     National Wildlife Refuge. That road would allow the community \n     of King Cove access to a 10,000-foot airfield and cross-wind \n     strip at Cold Bay.\n       The environmental impact statement was required by the \n     legislation authorizing the land swap, the Omnibus Public \n     Land Management Act of 2009. That legislation proposed that \n     about 56,000 acres now owned by the state and the King Cove \n     Native corporation would become official federal wilderness \n     in exchange for rights to build a one-lane road through an \n     isthmus separating Cold Bay from Izembek Lagoon. Total road \n     acreage: 206.\n       It was a generous offer from the state and corporation. Yet \n     the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service could not accept the road.\n       Roads and trails have provided decades of access from Cold \n     Bay to other parts of lagoon area for hunters and \n     birdwatchers. However, the agency believes a new road \n     connected to the much larger community of King Cove would \n     greatly increase traffic by off-road vehicles. The agency \n     admits this is just an educated guess, though. ``It is \n     impossible to quantify the amount of human use (i.e., \n     hunting, fishing, etc.) or illegal off-road vehicle use that \n     would occur adjacent to the road if it is built,'' it said in \n     response to public comments that raised the issue. ``The \n     analysis presented in the EIS was based on previous \n     experience of the authors and reviewed by staff familiar with \n     the area and other areas in rural Alaska.''\n       Other educated guessers could point to areas set aside in \n     Alaska, near far larger communities, where wildlife thrives \n     and off-road trespassers are kept to a minimum.\n       The agency discounted the value of the state and Native \n     corporation land it would receive in the exchange. It said \n     those lands weren't such critical wildlife habitat as the \n     isthmus, which is a fair statement. It also said no one was \n     likely to do any development soon on the state and Native \n     lands, which also is fair.\n       Nevertheless, the mere size of the offer, the potential \n     benefits to King Cove and the uncertainty about the real \n     impacts of off-road vehicles should tip the balance in favor \n     of the exchange.\n       Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar, who must issue a \n     record of decision on the swap within 30 days, appears \n     already to have accepted the service's assessment of the \n     swap. ``After extensive dialogue and exhaustive scientific \n     evaluation,'' he said in a news release, ``the agency has \n     identified a preferred path forward that will ensure this \n     extraordinary refuge and its wilderness are conserved and \n     protected for future generations.''\n       Unfortunately, that preferred path excludes King Cove's \n     preferred path.\n                                  ____\n\n\nFederal Agents Kill 750 Geese From Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge Near JFK \n                                Airport\n\n                 (By Carly Baldwin and Daniela Bernal)\n\n       New York.--They're back.\n       Agents with the U.S. Department of Agriculture removed more \n     than 700 Canada geese from Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge Monday \n     morning, at the prodding of U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.\n       In the hours between 7 a.m. and noon, 711 of the birds, \n     including possibly goslings, were rounded up and put into \n     crates, said Carol Bannerman, with the Animal and Plant \n     Health Inspection Service, a division within the USDA.\n       They were then drive to a meat processing plant in upstate \n     New York, where the geese will be killed and their meat will \n     be given to food banks upstate, Bannerman told Metro. In the \n     past carbon dioxide has been used to gas the geese to death.\n       The more than 700 geese rounded up today comes after USDA \n     agents removed 40 geese from a landfill near John F. Kennedy \n     airport two weeks ago, said Bannerman. In total, 751 geese \n     have been removed from area around JFK in the past two weeks.\n       That leaves only about 750 Canada geese remaining in the \n     federally protected preserve. Before the round-up, there were \n     1,500 geese in the park, said Gateway National Recreation \n     area spokesman John Warren.\n       According to Warren, the feds originally called for killing \n     up to 1,000 geese in the park. But molting season ended \n     before that many could be taken, he said.\n       Bannerman told Metro there will be no more further cullings \n     planned for this summer.\n       But today's surprise killing shocked and outraged many New \n     Yorkers.\n       ``I was sick to my stomach,'' said Brooklynite David \n     Karopkin when he heard of the killings yesterday. Karopkin, \n     27, runs GooseWatch NYC, which seeks to monitor and record \n     the controversial cullings of geese in the metro area. ``New \n     Yorkers have been kept in the dark about what's going on. \n     These operations are done with no transparency, no public \n     approval--for the most part we're told after the fact.''\n       ``It's really a disgrace and a shock that New York City's \n     only wildlife and bird sanctuary has been opened up to a \n     wildlife slaughter for no good reason,'' Edita Birnkrant, the \n     New York director of Friends of Animals, said. ``I'm in utter \n     disbelief at the stupidity of some of the people in office.''\n       Gillibrand has been pushing for more than three years to \n     allow agents into the Jamaica Preserve, a 9,000-acre estuary \n     and bird sanctuary that surrounds JFK's runways. The birds \n     are a hazard to planes taking off from JFK and LaGuardia \n     airports, she and others argue.\n       Just this past April, a Delta jet hit geese when it took \n     off from JFK. The cabin filled with smoke, but the plane made \n     a safe emergency landing.\n       Gillibrand specifically wanted the geese culled before the \n     end of their June and July molting phase, when the adult \n     birds and goslings cannot fly and can be easily rounded up.\n\n\n                          Geese-plane strikes\n\n       The USDA first started removing geese from the NYC area in \n     July of 2004. In the five years before that, there were nine \n     bird strikes on planes at LaGuardia, said Carol Bannerman.\n       In the five years after 2004, to July of 2009, there have \n     been three bird strikes.\n       The most famous of which is when geese brought down the \n     ``Miracle on the Hudson'' flight in January of 2009.\n       But according to Karopkin, the geese that brought down that \n     flight were migrating from Canada, and did not nest in the \n     metro area.\n       ``So even if you killed every animal in New York City you \n     would not have prevented that crash,'' he said.\n\n\n                         A history of cullings\n\n       Number of geese removed from around the city:\n       2009  1,276 geese removed and killed\n       2010  1,676 geese removed and killed\n       2011  575 geese removed and killed\n       2012  751 killed so far this year\n       Source: USDA.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues today in \nsupport of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013. I do \nso not just as a Senator but also as the mother of two daughters.\n  This critical legislation has been held up for far too long, and it \nis past time for reauthorization. We have a serious responsibility to \nensure that women and families are protected.\n  The rates of violence and abuse in our country are astounding and \ntotally unacceptable. According to a 2010 CDC study, domestic violence \naffects more than 12 million people each year. Across the United States \n15\\1/2\\ million children live in homes in which domestic violence has \noccurred. In my home State of North Carolina alone, 73 women and \nchildren are killed on average every year because of domestic violence.\n  Let me say that number one more time. Seventy-three women and \nchildren are killed every year due to domestic violence. These are \nalarming statistics, and we must act now to address them.\n  Since 1994, VAWA programs, and in particular the STOP Program that \nprovides grants for services, training, officers, and prosecutors, have \nmade tremendous progress in helping victims of domestic violence and \nsexual assault and have transformed our criminal justice system and \nvictim support services.\n  These grants have assisted law enforcement and prosecutors in \ntracking down perpetrators and bringing them to justice. They have also \nsaved countless lives and provided needed services to victims of these \nviolent acts.\n  In one instance in my State a man was on pretrial release after being \ncharged with stalking his wife. Thanks to this STOP grant funding, he \nwas being monitored electronically, and he was caught violating the \nconditions of his release when he went to his estranged wife's home. \nThe supervising officer was immediately notified of this violation, and \npolice officers found the man with the help of a GPS and arrested him \nin his estranged wife's driveway. Because of this VAWA program, we had \none less victim in my State. This is just one example of how VAWA is \nprotecting women and saving lives.\n  Title V of this bill includes legislation that I sponsored in the \nlast Congress, the Violence Against Women Health Initiative Act, which \nupdates and improves the health care system's response to domestic \nviolence and sexual assault. My provision is simple: It provides \ntraining and education to help the health care professionals respond to \nviolence and abuse. By equipping doctors and nurses to recognize the \nsigns of domestic abuse and make sure they have the training to \nrespond, we can better care for our survivors and prevent future \ncrimes. It also consolidates existing programs to streamline and \nstrengthen the health care system's response to violent crimes.\n  Since my time in the North Carolina State Senate, I have been \ndedicated to reducing the backlog of unanalyzed rape kits. This bill \nincludes the bipartisan SAFER Act, which helps fund audits of untested \nDNA evidence and reduces this backlog of rape kits.\n  Before my efforts in the State senate, what used to happen in North \nCarolina, and continues to happen today in many States, is that a woman \nwould be raped, she would go to the hospital, DNA would be collected \nand then placed in a box. Then that box would go and sit on a shelf in \na police department or in a sheriff's department totally unanalyzed \nunless the woman could identify who attacked her.\n  I ask you: What other victims in America have to identify the \nattacker before authorities will take action? None.\n  When I first brought this issue to the forefront, I was told there \nwas not enough money for all of these rape kits to be tested. We found \nthat funding in North Carolina. Now with the help of the SAFER Act, our \nlaw enforcement agencies will have the ability to track and prioritize \ntheir untested DNA evidence to ensure that victims can find their \nperpetrators and hold them accountable, and we can remove violent \ncriminals from the streets.\n  Unfortunately, until Congress acts to reauthorize the Violence \nAgainst Women Act, the well-being of women across the country hangs in \nthe balance. This bill has never been a partisan football, and there is \nno reason it should be today. I hope we will pass this bill swiftly and \nwithout further disputes. We must ensure this bill's passage for \nvictims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and \nstalking not only in North Carolina but around the country.\n  Finally, I do want to thank the North Carolina Coalition Against \nSexual Assault, the North Carolina Coalition Against Domestic Violence, \nand North Carolina's State and local law enforcement agencies that have \ntruly been leaders in combating this problem. I applaud them for all \nthe work they have done to reduce and address the incidents of domestic \nviolence and sexual assault, and I am grateful for the work they do \nevery day on the front lines of this issue.\n  So I am asking my colleagues to join me in moving the Violence \nAgainst Women Reauthorization Act through the Senate swiftly and \nwithout further delay. Millions of victims across the country are \nwaiting for us to enact this lifesaving legislation, and we simply \ncannot wait any longer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, last spring, just before the Senate \npassed the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, I came to the \nfloor to share some words from my late dear friend Sheila Wellstone \nwhose commitment to ending domestic violence is an everlasting source \nof inspiration to my wife Franni and to me.\n  I shared with my colleagues something Sheila said, which was this:\n\n\n[[Page S498]]\n\n\n       I have chosen to focus on domestic violence because I find \n     it appalling that a woman's home can be the most dangerous, \n     the most violent, and, in fact, the most deadly place for \n     her. And if she is a mother, it is dangerous for her \n     children. . . . It's time that we tell the secret; it's time \n     that we all come together to work toward ending the violence.\n\n  Sheila's words rang true in her time, but they have perhaps never \nrung more true than they do today. It is time that we all come together \nto work toward ending the violence.\n  We passed the VAWA Reauthorization Act in the Senate last April, but \nthe House did not let it go to the President for signature and \nenactment, so we are back here today voting on the bill again because \nthose of us who believe in VAWA will continue to fight for the bill's \npassage until it is signed into law. I encourage my colleagues, both in \nthe Senate and in the House, to come together to work toward ending the \nviolence, to support this bill.\n  The bill's managers, Judiciary Committee chairman Pat Leahy and \nSenator Mike Crapo, have demonstrated remarkable resolve and \nleadership. We all are grateful for that. I also thank them for \ninviting me to author two parts of the VAWA reauthorization bill, which \nI would like to describe briefly.\n  First, the VAWA Reauthorization Act includes provisions from the \nJustice for Survivors of Sexual Assault Act. We just heard Senator \nHagan talk about an aspect of that. This is one of the first bills I \nintroduced after being sworn in to the Senate. When this bill becomes \nlaw, never again will survivors of sexual assault suffer the indignity \nof paying for the forensic medical exam, the rape kit. VAWA provides \nState and local governments with funding to administer these exams, \nwhich are used to collect evidence in sexual assault cases. The problem \nis that under current law, grant recipients can charge the survivor--\nthe victim--for the upfront cost of administering the exam, leaving her \nto seek reimbursement later. Too often survivors get lost in a maze of \npaperwork and they are not reimbursed. Under my bill, grant recipients \nwill be able to charge insurance companies or victims' assistance funds \nor other sources, but they cannot charge the survivor. I believe \nsurvivors of sexual violence have endured enough already. They should \nnot have to pay for rape kits, and they will not have to once this bill \nis passed and signed by the President and becomes law.\n  Second, the VAWA reauthorization bill includes the Housing Rights for \nVictims of Domestic and Sexual Violence Act, legislation I introduced \nwith Senator Collins and Senator Mikulski in the fall of 2011. This \nbill will help women stay in their homes when they are the most \nvulnerable, when they need a roof over their heads the most. The link \nbetween violence and homelessness is undeniable. By one account, nearly \n40 percent of women who experience domestic violence will become \nhomeless at some point in their lives. Once a woman becomes homeless, \nshe becomes even more vulnerable to physical or sexual abuse. In my \nState, nearly one in three homeless women is fleeing domestic violence, \nand half of those women have children with them. That is unacceptable.\n  Franni and I have visited battered women's shelters, and I have to \ntell you it is heartbreaking. They are crowded. They are full. And a \nlot of mothers are there with their kids. On a bitter-cold Minnesota \nnight, these women often have nowhere to go. Transitional housing is \nreally important. If a woman has a choice between going out in the cold \nwinter night in Minnesota or maybe going back to her abuser and \nexposing children to that, that is wrong. This can be heartbreaking.\n  But there is something heartwarming too about seeing people come to \neach other's aid in their time of need. That is what the people who run \nthe shelters do every day--the staff of Advocates for Family Peace in \nItasca County, the Minnesota Coalition for Battered Women, the Casa de \nEsperanza, and the many other advocacy groups across my State. Talk to \nthese folks about VAWA, and they will tell you what it means for women \nin Minnesota. It means nights spent under a roof instead of in a tent \nor in a car or on a street or, even worse, having to go back to live \nwith their abuser and exposing their children to that danger, to \nwitnessing that violence. We need these shelters and transitional \nhousing programs for women who are fleeing danger. The VAWA \nreauthorization bill provides continued support for these programs.\n  My housing rights legislation provides additional support. It is a \npreventive measure that is intended to keep women from becoming \nhomeless in the first place. My bill will make it unlawful to evict a \nwoman from federally subsidized housing just because she is a victim of \ndomestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. A \nwoman may be living away from her abuser in Federal housing and the \nabuser comes and knocks down the door and the landlord will say: Let's \nevict her. Under my bill, that cannot happen in Federally subsidized \nhousing. This bill is for every woman who has hesitated to call the \npolice to enforce a protective order because she is afraid she will be \nevicted from her home if she does so.\n  The VAWA Reauthorization Act is a crucial bill. It is a good bill. It \nis an important bill, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthese letters from professional medical organizations in support of S. \n47, the Violence Against Women Act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 American Medical Association,\n\n                                    Chicago, IL, February 5, 2013.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mike Crapo,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Crapo: On behalf of the physician \n     and medical student members of the American Medical \n     Association (AMA), I am writing to express our support for S. \n     47, the ``Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013. \n     '' This bill, which reauthorizes the landmark Violence \n     Against Women Act (VAWA), would strengthen and improve \n     existing programs that assist victims and survivors of \n     domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and \n     stalking.\n       While violence against adult women has decreased 60 percent \n     since VAWA was first passed in 1994, it remains a critical \n     problem in our country and much more work remains to be done. \n     According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's \n     National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey released \n     in December 2011, one in five women in the United States has \n     been raped in her lifetime and one in four women has been the \n     victim of severe physical violence by a partner. Domestic and \n     sexual violence is a health care problem and one of the most \n     significant social determinants of health for women and \n     girls.\n       We are pleased that S. 47 would address some of the \n     critical gaps in delivery of health care to victims by \n     strengthening the health care system's identification and \n     assessment of, and response to, victims. We also appreciate \n     and support language in Title V of the bill on the \n     development and testing of quality improvement measures for \n     identifying, intervening, and documenting victims of domestic \n     violence that recognizes and aligns with the important work \n     underway by the AMA, the National Quality Forum, and other \n     stakeholders in the quality improvement arena.\n       We commend you for your long-standing support for victims \n     of violence and abuse and for your leadership in introducing \n     the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013. We \n     urge swift passage of your bill in the Senate and look \n     forward to working with you to ensure enactment of this \n     important legislation this year.\n           Sincerely,\n     James L. Madara, MD.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           American Psychological Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 4, 2013.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mike Crapo,\n     Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Crapo: On behalf of the \n     137,000 members and affiliates of the American Psychological \n     Association (APA), I am writing to thank you for your \n     invaluable leadership in introducing the Violence Against \n     Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (S. 47). As the legislative \n     process advances, APA offers its full support of your efforts \n     to ensure a comprehensive and inclusive reauthorization of \n     the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA).\n       As you know, nearly one in four women in the United States \n     reports experiencing domestic violence at some point in her \n     life, and 15 million children live in families in which \n     intimate partner violence has occurred within the past year. \n     Domestic violence can result in significant mental and \n     behavioral health consequences including depression, anxiety, \n     post-traumatic stress disorder, relationship problems, \n     diminished self-esteem,\n\n[[Page S499]]\n\n     social isolation, substance use disorders, and suicidal \n     behavior. VAWA programs can help to mitigate these negative \n     outcomes by providing a vital link to services and supports \n     for survivors and their families.\n       APA applauds your commitment to protect survivors of \n     intimate partner violence with a comprehensive VAWA \n     reauthorization. In particular, we appreciate the inclusion \n     of essential public health provisions to reauthorize and \n     strengthen the health care system's identification, \n     assessment, and response to violence, as well as provisions \n     to protect vulnerable populations, including Native women, \n     immigrants, and LGBT individuals.\n       We welcome the opportunity to work with you to address \n     these important issues. For further information, please \n     contact Nida Corry, Ph.D., in our Public Interest Government \n     Relations Office at (202) 336-5931 or ncorry@apa.org.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                               Gwendolyn Puryear Keita, Ph.D.,\n\n                               Executive Director, Public Interest\n                                                      Directorate.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, in my previous life, I was attorney \ngeneral of the State of Texas. In that capacity, I had the opportunity \nto work with numerous victim rights groups, primarily because part of \nmy responsibility--the office's responsibility--was to administer the \nCrime Victims Compensation Fund, which took a small portion of the fees \npaid by criminal defendants who are convicted of crimes or pled guilty \nto crimes and put it into a fund that could be used then to help \nvictims. As attorney general of Texas, I became a supporter of the \ncrime victims rights community and their interests as well as the VAWA.\n  This is really an important point. Since it was first enacted in \n1994, the VAWA has been reauthorized on two separate occasions, each \ntime by unanimous vote of the Senate. Let me say that again. On the two \nprevious occasions the Senate has voted to reauthorize the VAWA, it has \nbeen unanimous. There were no differences between Democrats and \nRepublicans--we were all together in supporting this legislation. For \nthat reason, I hope Members of both parties will think long and hard \nbefore turning this critical law into just another vehicle for scoring \npolitical points or bowing to special interests instead of the public \ninterest.\n  I am enormously proud and grateful that this bill contains a version \nof the SAFER Act, which I first introduced last year with strong \nbipartisan support. I had the privilege of meeting several \nextraordinary Texas women, including Carol Bart, Lennah Frost, and \nLavinia Masters, all of whom decided to go public with their story in \nhopes of helping other victims of sexual assault. It has been a moving \nexperience.\n  I am delighted that our bill and our effort via the SAFER Act to \naddress the untested rape kit scandal in this country is so close to \nthe finish line. Why is this legislation so important? Right now there \nare as many as 400,000 untested rape kits sitting in police evidence \nlockers or labs across the Nation. Each one of those rape kits--which \nis a sample of DNA that could then be used to match up against an FBI \ndatabase to make an identification of a sexual assailant--right now \n400,000 of them, it is estimated; we really don't know the exact \nnumber--are sitting in evidence lockers and police storage facilities \nall across the Nation. Each one of these kits has the potential to \nsolve a crime, to identify a rapist and deliver justice for a victim.\n  The SAFER Act would help law enforcement officials reduce that \nbacklog of untested rape kits and improve public safety. Indeed, it \nwould help us address what can only be considered a national scandal. \nIt would help bring peace of mind to rape victims. And it would help \nget dangerous criminals off the street before they commit another \ncrime. That is why the SAFER Act has been endorsed by a wide range of \nvictim advocacy groups, such as the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National \nNetwork; the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence; the Fraternal \nOrder of Police; and the National Organization for Women. That is why \nwe are so eager to see this legislation become law.\n  But beyond the SAFER Act, the VAWA provides funding for shelters, \ncounseling programs, and legal services that help ensure that our \njustice system leaves no victim behind.\n  For all these reasons, we can and we must reauthorize the VAWA. As we \nhave done on previous occasions, we should do so with overwhelming \nbipartisan support. We could easily do that.\n  Unfortunately, the underlying bill also contains a separate provision \nthat is blatantly unconstitutional. It would deny U.S. citizens their \nfull constitutional protections under the Bill of Rights in tribal \ncourts. Needless to say, this is a big problem, but it is also a \nsolvable problem. I have drafted an amendment that would allow Native \nAmerican tribes to prosecute U.S. citizens for domestic violence as \nlong as those tribes followed the Constitution and allowed all \nconvictions to be appealed in the Federal court system.\n  This amendment is a sensible compromise, and I have discussed it with \nall of the various organizations that are interested in passage of a \nreauthorization of VAWA. We have negotiated in good faith, but \nunfortunately that good-faith effort to try to find a solution has run \ninto a brick wall of opposition, and the chairman has decided to not \nchange the controversial language that would deny certain Americans \nfull protection of the Bill of Rights. What I cannot understand is why \nanyone would want to pick a political fight and not find a solution if \na solution is at hand and it makes so much sense.\n  Once again, I passionately support the SAFER Act. I am grateful that \nprovision at long last is included in this law, which will allow us to \naddress that national scandal of hundreds of thousands of untested rape \nkits. This is a bill which could do so much good in the battle for \nvictims' rights, but unfortunately it is being held hostage by a single \nprovision that would take away fundamental constitutional rights for \ncertain American citizens.\n  And for what? For what? In order to satisfy the unconstitutional \ndemands of special interests.\n  I remain hopeful that we can eventually come to a compromise that \nupholds the Constitution, if not here in the Senate then in a \nconference committee between the House of Representatives and the \nSenate, so we reconcile the differences between the two bills passed by \neach House.\n  For now I cannot, in good conscience, vote for a bill that violates \nthe U.S. Constitution. I cannot, in good conscience and in fidelity to \nmy oath of office, vote for a provision that I know is \nunconstitutional. I will, however, vote for the alternative bill that \nis offered by Senator Grassley which eliminates this unconstitutional \nprovision. It reauthorizes the Violence Against Women Act and contains \nthe SAFER Act which addresses this backlog of untested rape kits.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Mr. President. By the way, what a pleasure \nit is to see the new Senator presiding.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. President, I rise every week on this Senate floor to talk about \nthe dangers of carbon pollution to our atmosphere and to our oceans. \nThis week I want to preface my remarks by talking about America and her \nrole in the world.\n  I can use some very well-known words to make my point. From John \nWinthrop to Ronald Reagan, we have described our great American \nexperiment as ``a city on a hill.'' Indeed, our hymn ``America the \nBeautiful'' sings about our ``alabaster cities' gleam.'' President \nKennedy's inaugural address said that ``the glow from [our] fire can \ntruly light the world,'' and a generation later, President Obama's \nfirst inaugural noted that our ``ideals still light the world.'' We \nAmericans have described ourselves as a beacon of hope, a light in the \ndarkness, our lamp lifted up in welcome and in example.\n  Daniel Webster years ago said that our Founders ``set the world an \nexample.'' That was what the founding of America meant--our Founders \n``set the world an example.'' President Clinton has pointed out that \nthe power of our example, the power of that example in\n\n[[Page S500]]\n\nthe world, has always been greater than any example of our power. That \nwas the way Bill Clinton described it. And when Daniel Webster said \nthat our Founding Fathers had set before the world an example, he went \non to say this:\n\n       The last hopes of mankind, therefore, rest with us; and if \n     it should be proclaimed, that our example had become an \n     argument against the experiment, the knell of popular liberty \n     would be sounded throughout the earth.\n\n  I have spoken before about this small globe of ours, the light of \ndawn sweeping each morning across its face, lighting cities and \ncottages, barrios and villages, and across the globe's face people \ncoming forth from homes and hovels into that morning Sun, each knowing, \nfrom our American example, that life does not have to be the way it is \nfor them, knowing that an example of liberty and self-government stands \nfree before them, that America stands as an alternative and a rebuke to \nthe tyranny, to the corruption, or to the injustice in which they may \nbe enmired.\n  So like many of my colleagues, I believe America has a special \ndestiny in the world. America's special destiny does not come easy, and \nit does not come alone. America's special destiny confers upon us a \nspecial duty. What is that duty? That duty is to live up to our own \nexample, to see to it that our lamp gleams brightly, to be the promise \nthat each dawn America offers this small globe.\n  So let's look at climate change in that light. What if our carbon \npollution is, in fact, changing the planet? What if, in fact, we know \nthis, we know this to any reasonable degree of responsible certainty? \nAnd what if, knowing this, we do nothing? And what if the reason we do \nnothing is the influence of special interests who profit from that very \npollution or the groundless ideology of a fringe? What sort of example \nis that for America to set? How does that meet our special duty? How \ndoes that advance our special destiny?\n  Look at what other continents and nations will experience, \nparticularly those that have not enjoyed the economic development we \nachieved through our carbon economy.\n  I will start in Africa, where temperatures are expected to increase \nfaster than the rest of the world. Rainfall patterns are also expected \nto change, decreasing in some areas, increasing in others. Floods, \ndroughts, and new crop diseases linked to changes in temperature and \nrainfall will hurt African farmers in a continent where subsistence \nfarming is still so important to so many individuals' way of life. \nResearch shows that production of crops, such as maize--a core staple \nin Africa--will decrease by 30 percent over the next 20 years due to \nclimate change. More frequent and severe extreme weather will have dire \nconsequences there. We saw, just a few weeks ago, the worst flood in a \ndecade, killing at least 38 people in Mozambique and leaving 150,000 \nhomeless.\n  Parts of Russia have warmed between 3.5 and 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit \njust in the last century, leading to the loss of permafrost. Russians, \nlike Alaskans--whom I spoke about before--build homes and roads and \ninfrastructure on the permafrost. When it disappears, communities lose \nthe very foundations on which they are built. NOAA says that the \nRussian heat wave of 2010, which killed tens of thousands of people, \nwas the most severe since records were first kept back in 1880. And \nthis type of heat wave is now more and more likely.\n  Go to the Land Down Under, where warmer and more acidic oceans have \nfueled a widespread coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef. The \nGreat Barrier Reef is a natural wonder. It is one of the great wonders \nof the world. Economically, it is the basis of a $4 billion tourism \nindustry in Australia, and it is dying before our eyes. Scientists say \nthat climate change heightens the devastation from other natural \ndisasters in Australia, such as the 2009 bushfires that claimed 173 \nlives, the 2011 flooding that killed dozens, and the wildfires that \nhave already damaged hundreds of homes and displaced thousands of \nAustralians this year.\n  Europe is getting hotter, with increased risk of summertime droughts \nin Central Europe and in the Mediterranean. Tree lines creep higher in \nEuropean mountain ranges. Glaciers in Central Europe shrink. Alpine ski \nareas have been forced to adapt to higher temperatures and less snow.\n  South America has been warming, and glaciers in the Andes are \nretreating at an increasing rate. I have a symbol of that retreat in my \noffice. Lonnie Thompson of Ohio State University and Clark Weaver of \nNASA loaned me this artifact. It is a piece of a plant that has been \npreserved under the Quelccaya Ice Cap in Peru for at least 5,200 \nyears--more than 3,000 years before Jesus Christ walked the Earth. This \nplant was overcovered by glacier and has stayed that way ever since. \nNow, thanks to glacial retreat, that piece of plant, which was \npreserved by the weight and cold of the glacier, is in my office.\n  Closer to home, in Canada, a tropical fungus that causes lung disease \nand meningitis has been discovered. Scientists think the deadly yeast \nlikely came to Vancouver Island in ballast water from ships, but now--\nnow--it can survive there because of higher temperatures.\n  In the Arctic, we are losing sea ice, permafrost, glaciers, and ice \nsheets. Arctic sea ice is shrinking at about 5 percent per decade. With \nthat shrinkage, there is less ice to reflect sunlight back into space. \nMore heat is captured, and the warming accelerates. At this rate, \nArctic summers will be ice free within decades. For the United States, \nthat means new Arctic waterways to defend, an expanded theater of \noperations in the Arctic, and increased competition for Arctic \nresources.\n  Wherever you look around the globe, climate change changes habitats, \nchanges where plants can grow, and loads the dice for more frequent and \nmore severe extreme weather. Heat waves, droughts, floods, and storms \ncreate victims and refugees who require humanitarian relief. The \npoorest nations, those least prepared to weather natural disasters, \nwill suffer the most. Those nations will look to us and to the rest of \nthe developed world for help. They will not look to us for help without \nreason. The United States is responsible for one-quarter of all \nindustrial-age carbon pollution in the world. Today we no longer emit \nthe most carbon dioxide; China has passed us.\n  But we have emitted the most over time. Nations all over the world \nhave implemented carbon reduction plans. Some have implemented carbon \npricing. Many invest far more than we do in renewable energy. The \nUnited States is falling behind rather than leading. Even China, \ntoday's biggest polluter, recently committed to reduce the amount of \ncarbon it emits relative to its economic output.\n  In 2009, China passed the United States of America in renewable \nenergy investment. Looking at all that, it is hard to imagine that \nthose who will suffer, those who will be displaced, those who will lose \ntheir ancient livelihoods all around the world will look benevolently \nupon our Nation.\n  It is hard to believe they will not resent that they are forced to \nbear those burdens at the price of our carbon economy. One can readily \nimagine extremists who wish to rally disenchanted people against us, \neven to violence against us, finding fertile opportunity where that \nresentment festers.\n  Will it not be, as Daniel Webster said, ``an argument against [our] \nexperiment?'' Will it not be an argument against our experiment that \nour democracy, our great American democracy, seized in the grip of \npolluting special interests or fringe political ideology, was unable to \nrespond to the facts around us to protect ourselves and our world?\n  Will there not be ready ears easy to fill with that argument against \nour experiment, among those who have been uprooted from traditional \nhomes and livelihoods or among those whose homes and livelihoods have \nbeen disturbed by climate refugees?\n  Destiny means duty. Destiny means duty, and we are failing in that \nduty. It is time for us to awake in this moment to that duty. We can \nexpect in the long and blessed future of this country to have to face \nunpleasant facts, facts more unpleasant than the facts of carbon \npollution and climate change and ocean acidification.\n  We have done this before. With God's help, we will do it again. But \nif we cannot bring ourselves to our senses now, in this moment, in our \nday and hour to wake and face these facts, what a terrible admission \nthat is by this generation of Americans.\n\n[[Page S501]]\n\n  Stand we a chance of being looked back at as a greatest generation if \nwe fail to address this greatest issue facing our planet? Lord Acton \nnoted ``the undying penalty which history has the power to inflict on \nwrong.'' Truly, that penalty will be inflicted on us, on our \ngeneration, if we do not awaken to these plain facts and to our plain \nduty.\n  I see the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee is nearby \nand may well seek the floor with respect to the Violence Against Women \nAct.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank Senators Murray, Shaheen, Begich, \nUdall of New Mexico, Klobuchar, Murkowski, Hagan and Franken for their \nstatements today in support of the Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act.\n  I also note that the ranking Republican member on the Judiciary \nCommittee made a statement today from which I take some hope. The \nSenator from Iowa indicated that this measure could have been enacted \nlast year. I wish it had been enacted last year after the Senate voted \nwith a strong majority to do so and did everything I could, including \nreaching out to the Republican Speaker of the House, to try to make \nthat happen.\n  I will not respond to all that my friend from Iowa said but I do want \nto correct any notion that I have abandoned my efforts to increase U \nvisas to help law enforcement and immigrant women. As I have said \nrepeatedly, I remain committed to these provisions that I originally \nintroduced and will pursue them in the context of comprehensive \nimmigration reform. I hope that the Senator from Iowa will join me and \nsupport them. We will need them later this year.\n  I am encouraged that our bipartisan bill has 62 cosponsors. I am \ndisappointed that Senators who say it should have passed last year are \nstill opposing it. I hope that after a vote on the Republican \nsubstitute, remaining opponents will join us and support Violence \nAgainst Women Act reauthorization. That is what Senator Hutchison did \nlast year when the Senate rejected her alternative; she joined with us. \nI praised her for it. Let us join together and pass the strong Senate \nbill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I spoke earlier today about the \nimportance of passing the Violence Against Women Act, how this has been \na long-time bipartisan bill back to 1994 when the late Senator Paul \nWellstone was involved in this bill, as well as Vice President Biden. \nPeople came together and said we have to do something about domestic \nviolence. This is no longer a hidden crime behind closed doors.\n  Do you know what we have seen since then? We have seen a 50-percent \nreduction--a 50-percent reduction--in domestic violence in this \ncountry. This is a victory. We do not want to go backward. \nUnfortunately, the bill that has been submitted by Senator Grassley, \nthe substitute amendment, I believe would take us backward. Let me \nexplain why.\n  First of all, we know the VAWA reauthorization bill was months of \nnegotiation between the two lead authors, Senator Leahy, the chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, and Senator Crapo. It has bipartisan \nconsensus and was drafted after months of input from numerous \nstakeholders.\n  Unfortunately, the Grassley substitute doesn't do a lot of the things \nthat are so important to us in this Violence Against Women bill. This \nis not an acceptable substitute.\n  While much of this bill is consistent with past policy in the \nViolence Against Women Act, there were some changes that we felt \nnecessary to match the times. One of them is a growing problem of \ntribal domestic violence. Domestic violence in tribal communities, \nunfortunately, is an epidemic. Four out of five perpetrators of \ndomestic or sexual violence on tribal lands are non-Indian and \ncurrently cannot be prosecuted by tribal governments. The only way is \nto have the U.S. Attorney's Office come in. They do a lot of good work. \nMy United States Attorney's office has done great work historically \nthrough several administrations with our tribal communities, but these \ncases should be able to be prosecuted not only by U.S. attorneys but \nalso by tribal governments. The Leahy-Crapo VAWA reauthorization bill \nbuilds on the protections for Indian women by recognizing tribes' \nauthority to prosecute non-Indians who commit domestic violence against \ntheir Indian spouses or dating partners. Let me say this was narrowly \ntailored for these acts of domestic violence with specific \nrequirements.\n  The Grassley proposal, unfortunately, does not provide the tribes the \nauthority to enforce laws against domestic violence on their own lands. \nIt also takes money away from other Justice Department grant programs \nto install Federal magistrate judges and prosecutors on tribal lands. \nBringing in large numbers of Federal officials goes against the locally \nbased solutions to domestic violence that VAWA has so successfully \npromoted.\n  Federal judges and prosecutors already, as I pointed out, have \nauthority to handle cases on tribal lands. This has not stemmed the \nplague of violence against Indian women. That is what you do with the \nreauthorizations. That is why you don't have bills go on forever and \nforever into eternity. You have reauthorizations to try to address some \nissues which can make things better.\n  Here we have addressed one. While the Violence Against Women Act has \nhelped so much with so many victims of domestic violence in this \ncountry, we still see incredibly tragic numbers when it comes to \ndomestic violence against American Indian women. That is why we have \nmade these changes. It allowed us the reauthorization to adjust.\n  While the Grassley proposal allows a tribe to petition a Federal \ncourt for a protective order to exclude individuals from tribal land, \nthis does not begin to address the problem of non-Indian perpetrators \nwho are not arrested, prosecuted, or convicted for those heinous \ncrimes. This is a false alternative that does almost nothing to solve \nthe epidemic of violence against Native women.\n  Another issue. There was a very careful negotiation that went on with \nwhere the funding went. We had to make cuts to funding this year in \nmany areas, including this one. We negotiated how much of the funds \nwould go to sexual assault and how much would go to domestic violence. \nThe Leahy-Crapo VAWA reauthorization bill includes a 20-percent set-\naside for sexual assault programming in the STOP program, a balance \nthat was achieved after months of discussions with domestic violence \nand sexual assault service providers. The bill increases the focus on \nsexual assault without endangering domestic violence victims. It was a \nbig deal that we were able to get it done. Unfortunately, the Grassley \nproposal makes a change to that and goes against the negotiation we \nalready had in place.\n  Finally, there is the issue with the Grassley proposal on U visas. As \nyou most likely heard, we actually made changes to the original bill on \nU visas already in this negotiated bill. We were going to be able to \nuse U visas that had been issued in prior years but not actually used, \nand be able to use those numbers in the coming years. We ended up \ntaking that out. I didn't agree with that, and I hope it is something \nwe can address and fix in immigration reform. Unfortunately, the \nGrassley proposal goes even farther. It adds more restrictions on U \nvisas.\n  Let me stop for a moment to explain what these U visas are. This is \nwhen you have an immigrant victim of domestic violence. When I was a \nprosecutor for 8 years, we would have a number of cases where an \nimmigrant was a victim. What do you think her perpetrator did to get \nher to be scared to come forward? They said, We are going to deport you \nif you come forward to law enforcement. You will never be able to stay \nin this country.\n\n[[Page S502]]\n\n  What the U visas do is give that victim a status to remain in the \ncountry to make sure this person gets prosecuted and then work on some \nkind of a permanent immigration status. That is what the U visas are. I \nthink they are a necessary component. There have been agreed-upon \nnumbers for years when this bill has been reauthorized.\n  Unfortunately, as I said, the Grassley proposal adds restrictions on \nU visas which are a law enforcement tool to encourage immigrants to \nreport and help prosecute crime. The restrictions are put in there--I \nam sure Senator Grassley, who is so good at fighting fraud, put them in \nthere for good reason--to deter fraud, but no study or report has been \ncited to indicate that there is an issue here. U visas already have \nfraud protections because law enforcement officers must personally \ncertify that the victim is cooperating with the criminal investigation. \nI tend to believe the personal certification from a law enforcement \nofficer, and that is the proof that we have to issue the U visas.\n  No program is perfect. I am sure we can work with Senator Grassley in \nthe future if there are some fraud issues here. At this point, after a \nyear of negotiation in trying to get the bill through here, we have \nsignificant bipartisan support. It is not the time to put a substitute \nin.\n  I want to thank you for giving me this opportunity. I urge my \ncolleagues to reject the substitute Grassley amendment, embrace this \nbill, and vote for it. It is a good bill.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pending before the Senate is the Violence \nAgainst Women Reauthorization Act. We considered it over a year ago. \nThe bipartisan reauthorization passed the Senate with 68 votes more \nthan 9 months ago. To someone who has suffered domestic violence abuse \nand is in need of help, it is amazing to think that what used to be an \neasy bipartisan issue has been tied up in the obstruction between the \nHouse and the Senate since then. There is absolutely no excuse for \nfailing to enact this legislation. Now is the time to do it. We have a \nstrong sensible bill before us.\n  Senator Leahy, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is \nguiding it on the Senate floor. This is an interesting issue. It is an \nemotional issue. If you haven't had domestic violence in your family, \nyou can be grateful. Many people have seen it firsthand, and I don't \nthink it is something they will easily forget.\n  I was invited a few years back to go to Champaign, IL, to a domestic \nviolence shelter to meet with one of the victims. It was an important \nmeeting for me. Sitting across the table from a woman with two black \neyes, her eyes red from crying, she could barely choke out a few words \nabout what life had been like as a victim of domestic violence. She was \nhumiliated by the scars her face and body showed and ashamed she had \nreached that point in her life. She had nowhere to turn. She didn't \ntrust anybody. She was afraid of her spouse and so she came to this \ndomestic violence shelter with her child. She didn't know where to \nturn. The shelter was trying to protect her, No. 1, and give her a \nchance for a better life.\n  That is what this bill is about. It is also about a group of people I \nhave come to know personally and really respect in Chicago. There is a \ngroup called Mujeres Latinas En Accion. What a dynamic group. I met \nthem 14 or 15 years ago. They were operating out of an old house in \nPilsen, one of the Hispanic neighborhoods in Chicago. It was one of \nthese beat-up, old places that a lot of charities take on and hope to \ncall home and use for their purposes--in this case a domestic violence \nshelter primarily for the Hispanic neighborhood. The rooms were all \npacked. There were cots and diapers and food and all the things you beg \nfor from friends to sustain a family in need of help.\n  I remember going there with Amalia Rioja Castro, and she explained to \nme what they were doing in receiving people from the community. These \nwere women most often with children who came in and had been \nvictimized. It was tougher for them than for most. Many of them \nstruggled with English. Many of them struggled with a culture that many \ntimes is too patriarchal in these circumstances, and many of them \nstruggled with the same embarrassment as the woman I met in Champaign, \nIL. But they finally realized they had no choice; they had to ask for \nhelp. So they came to that shelter. And, thank goodness, those \nvolunteers and people were there offering them a safe place and willing \nto take on the issues of protecting this mother and her children from \nfurther abuse. They saved a lot of lives in the process.\n  That is what this bill is about, and it is one of the reasons this \nbill hasn't passed. You see, the difference between the Senate approach \nand the approach in the House of Representatives comes down to two or \nthree things, but they are all three important things. One of them \nrelates to the undocumented.\n  If an undocumented woman--mother--walks into a domestic violence \nshelter in this country, beaten up, running from an abusive husband, \nholding her baby, will we help her? That is the question. Ordinarily, \none would say: Of course. But some say: No, she is undocumented. We \ndon't help those people.\n  Really? We don't? Is that who we are in America? It isn't. Of course, \nwe help her. Of course, we help her child. Our bill said we did; the \nHouse disagreed.\n  Native American communities are much more complicated. In Illinois I \ndon't live with these tribal communities and know all of the issues \nassociated with them, but it turns out that many times in cases of \ndomestic violence, the tribal courts are unable, unwilling to deal with \nthe prosecutions in a timely and effective way. We tried, in the Senate \nversion of the bill, to make sure when it came to Native American \npopulations, tribal populations, the same protections would be there. \nThe House disagreed.\n  Then, of course, came the question about sexual orientation. What if \nthe abuse is not man to woman, heterosexual abuse, but something else. \nWill that type of abuse also be protected? The answer is yes. In the \nSenate version of the bill, it was clearly yes. The House disagreed.\n  Because of those three basic disagreements, nothing is happening. I \nshouldn't say nothing is happening. Thank goodness, Barbara Mikulski, \nnow chairman of the Appropriations Committee, chaired the subcommittee \nthat kept funding the bill. So we kept our commitment to these violence \nshelters around America, but we didn't reauthorize them. We didn't put \nin new language. We didn't do our job. We just stopped for a year on a \nbill that shouldn't even be debated, to a great extent. It certainly \nshouldn't be partisan.\n  According to a recent survey, in the United States, 24 people every \nminute become victims of rape, physical violence, or stalking. That \nmeans in the time it takes me to finish this statement dozens will have \nbeen victimized. Since its passage, the Violence Against Women Act, \nknown as VAWA, has provided valuable and even lifesaving assistance to \nhundreds of thousands of people in America. The impact is profound.\n  The Bureau of Justice statistics tell us the rate of domestic \nviolence against women has dropped by more than 50 percent since we \nfirst enacted this bill. There aren't many pieces of legislation we can \npoint to with that track record, but there are so many more who need \nhelp. That is evident from the statistics.\n  The Centers for Disease Control tells us approximately one in four \nwomen has experienced severe physical violence by an intimate partner, \nand nearly one in five women has been raped. One in five? In a study of \nundergraduate women, 19 percent have experienced an attempted or actual \nsexual assault while in college. All together more than one in three \nwomen have experienced rape, stalking, or physical violence by an \nintimate partner in their lifetime. That is a fact.\n  The consequences are ongoing. For example, 81 percent of women who \nhave experienced this report significant short- or long-term impacts, \nand the consequences can be severe. By one report, in 2007, 45 percent \nof the women killed in the United States died at the hands of an \nintimate partner.\n\n[[Page S503]]\n\n  This reauthorization ensures that funding will continue to go to the \norganizations and individuals who need help the most. It places \nincreased emphasis on responding to sexual assault, in addition to \ndomestic violence. It does things such as encourage jurisdictions to \nevaluate rape kit inventories and reduce backlogs. It incorporates \nimportant accountability mechanisms, consolidates programs, and \nactually reduces spending.\n  It also includes vital provisions to help Native American women and \nprotect immigrant communities. A provision helping to ensure the \navailability of U visas for victims of crime was taken out. I am sorry \nit was. It is a budget item; a constitutional item. But we want to make \nsure other critical provisions in the bill remain--provisions that \nprotect immigrant communities that are strongly supported by those who \nwork with them.\n  The reauthorization also ensures that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and \ntransgender communities are not discriminated against when it comes to \nthese services. I say this to my colleagues on both sides of the \nChamber. Now is the time to pass the Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act. Our country has to come together to make sure all \nof the victims are protected.\n  Take the Native American communities, for example. According to a \nsurvey by the Centers for Disease Control, 4 out of every 10 American \nIndian or Alaska Native women--4 out of 10--have been victims of rape, \nphysical violence, or stalking in their lifetime. That is unacceptable \nin America, a country that prides itself on its commitment to human \nrights.\n  This bipartisan bill is supported by victims, experts, and advocates. \nIt is supported by service providers, faith leaders, and health care \nprofessionals, prosecutors, judges, law enforcement officials, and it \nought to be supported by both Chambers of Congress.\n  The last two VAWA reauthorization bills have carefully expanded the \nscope of the law and improved it. This reauthorization is no exception. \nIt implies lessons learned from those working in the field and renews \nour commitment to reducing domestic and sexual violence. We ought to \nlisten to the people on the front lines protecting those vulnerable \npopulations. We should be able to pass a strong reauthorization that \naddresses the needs of all women.\n  I thank Senator Leahy and many others in this Chamber for their \nleadership. I want to take a moment to discuss a provision which I \nmentioned earlier in the bill.\n  A troubling episode of ``Frontline,'' the PBS program many of us \nwatch and respect, detailed one woman's story in great detail, but that \nwasn't an isolated incident. The National Prison Rape Elimination \nCommission, created by Congress, said:\n\n       As a group, immigration detainees are especially vulnerable \n     to sexual abuse and its effects while detained.\n\n  The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003, known as PREA, was designed \nto eliminate sexual abuse of those in custody. It was bipartisan and \nchampioned by the late Senator Ted Kennedy and Senator Sessions of \nAlabama, and I cosponsored it. PREA required the promulgation of \nnational standards to prevent, detect, and respond to prison rape in \nAmerica. There had been questions raised about whether those standards \nwould apply to immigration detainees, and as I have said before, when \nwe drafted and passed PREA it was our intent it would apply to all in \nFederal detention, including immigration detainees.\n  I was pleased when President Obama issued a memo clarifying that PREA \napplies to all Federal confinement facilities and directing agencies to \nact accordingly. I was also pleased with the Department of Homeland \nSecurity drafting standards to comport with PREA. Secretary Napolitano \nand I have discussed this problem of sexual assault in detention, and I \napplaud the Secretary for her strong commitment to this issue.\n  It was critical to me to have a provision in this VAWA \nreauthorization that clarifies that standards to prevent custodial rape \nmust apply to immigration detainees--all immigration detainees--a \nprovision that codifies the good work DHS is now doing and ensures \nstrong regulations pertaining to immigration will remain in place in \nthe future.\n  Mr. President, I have visited some of these immigration detainee \nfacilities. They are not quite prisons but almost. Those who are being \ndetained before being deported have little access to the outside. In my \ncase, I went down to deep southern Illinois, 300-plus miles from \nChicago--more than 300 miles from Chicago. It was hard for them to get \na telephone they could use for access to family or attorneys. It was a \npretty isolated situation. They are clearly in a remote place. Many are \ntreated well but many are not.\n  Custodial sexual assault is just one of the many issues addressed by \nthis VAWA bill. I urge my colleagues to work together and reauthorize \nthis bill. If this is truly a new day after this last election, if we \nare truly determined to do things on a bipartisan basis, why isn't this \nthe first thing we do? It used to be bipartisan. It didn't even take \nthat much time to pass it because we were all together on it.\n  Everybody understands domestic violence--if not from their family, \ncertainly from their life experience and watching what happens in these \ndomestic violence shelters. We have had broad bipartisan support for \nthis in the past. This last year, despite Chairman Leahy's \nextraordinary efforts, it fell apart in the House of Representatives. \nWe want to give them another chance--a chance to get it right, a chance \nto join us in passing a bipartisan bill that we are likely to pass from \nthis Chamber.\n  The dozens of individuals who have been victimized since I stood up \nto begin this speech need help now. This is our opportunity. Let's show \nthem that when it comes to protecting America's most vulnerable \npopulations, we will be there.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I take this time because I think it is \nimportant people recognize that what we do has such an important impact \non local law enforcement and on local agencies.\n  Last year I hosted a roundtable discussion in Prince George's County, \nMD, to discuss the importance of reauthorizing the Violence Against \nWomen Act, known as VAWA. This roundtable brought together victims, \nsocial service agencies, law enforcement, clergy, and others on the \nfrontline of providing support and protection to victims of domestic \nviolence.\n  VAWA has a proven track record of protecting women from domestic \nviolence, and it is hard to understand opposition to legislation with \nthe goal of curbing domestic violence. Saving women's lives should not \nbe a partisan issue. The statistics of domestic violence are alarming. \nYet domestic violence remains one of the most underreported crimes in \nthe country. These victims need to know they have our support, \nincluding access to justice, help with housing, medical care, and \neconomic opportunity.\n  In 2010, there were 10,574 protective orders in my State, and peace \norder filings in Prince George's County was one-fifth of the total \n50,363 filings in the State of Maryland--so 10,000 in Prince George's \nCounty, 50,000 in Maryland.\n  At the roundtable I held in Prince George's County, I heard a number \nof examples of the importance of VAWA from those on the frontline of \ncombating domestic violence.\n  Prince George's County sheriff Melvin High told me the oath he took \nobligates him to protect all people without political consideration. He \nstrongly stated that VAWA should be reauthorized; that it is an \nextremely important tool that he uses to help protect the people of \nPrince George's County.\n  State attorney Angela Alsobrooks told me that for more than a decade, \nher office has received funding from VAWA that has allowed her domestic \nviolence unit to provide greater services to the victims of abuse. \nWithout this funding, she told me she would lose a domestic violence \nadvocate and a prosecutor who is assigned specifically to domestic \nviolence cases, reducing their ability to help victims. She\n\n[[Page S504]]\n\nurged the House at that time--because we had passed the bill in the \nSenate--to pass the Senate version of VAWA in order to ensure they \ncontinue to receive this critical funding.\n  Malinda Miles is the executive director of the Family Crisis Center \nin Prince George's County, which is the premier domestic violence \nprogram in the county, serving women and children for more than 30 \nyears. She stated she believes the House bill, if passed, would set \nback women 50 years--the bill they were considering last year--and \nwould be a travesty for the women and children of this Nation now and \nfor years to come, urging at that time that the bill we passed last \nyear--the bill we are considering on the floor now--needs to pass as \nquickly as possible.\n  Prince George's County police chief Mark Magaw told me that combating \ndomestic violence remains a primary focus of his department, and he is \nthankful for support provided by the VAWA grant program.\n  The Violence Against Women Act was passed by Congress and signed into \nlaw in 1994 by President Clinton. This law has a proud and bipartisan \nhistory. Congress passed this legislation in 1994 after growing \nawareness of crimes associated with domestic violence, including sexual \nassault and stalking cases. Congress needed to address the prevailing \nattitude at the time that domestic violence was a private so-called \nfamily matter, which in many cases police were hesitant to arrest \nabusers and prosecutors were reluctant to send abusers to jail. We have \nchanged that, and VAWA helped us change that. The passage of VAWA will \nhelp our local agencies protect women and hold those abusers \naccountable for their actions.\n  VAWA enhanced investigators and prosecutors of sex offenses and \ncreated a number of new grant programs that included law enforcement, \npublic and private entities, services providers, and victims of crime. \nCongress approved reauthorizations of VAWA that expanded its \nprotections by bipartisan votes in 2000 and 2005. In 2000, Congress \nenhanced Federal domestic violence and stalking penalties, added \nprotections for battered immigrants, and added new programs for elderly \nand disabled women. In 2005, Congress enhanced penalties for repeat \nstalking offenders, added protection for battered and trafficked \nimmigrants, and added programs for sexual assault victims and American \nIndian victims, as well as programs designed to improve the public \nhealth response to domestic violence.\n  Now, in 2013, the Senate is trying to approve VAWA once again, since \nits original passage nearly 20 years ago. The Senate-passed version of \nthe law includes measures to ensure that victims are not denied \nservices because they are gay or transgender. It protects Native \nAmerican women from domestic violence and sexual assault and includes \nnondiscrimination provisions for all victims, regardless of their race, \ncolor, religion or gender.\n  VAWA encourages collaboration among law enforcement, judicial \npersonnel, and public and private service providers to victims of \ndomestic and sexual violence. It also works to increase public \nawareness.\n  One in four women will experience domestic violence in their \nlifetime. An estimated 1.3 million women are victims of physical \nassault by an intimate partner every year. In Maryland, in 2009, there \nwere more than 18,000 reported cases of domestic abuse and 38 \nfatalities. That period of time has been the lowest number of domestic \nviolence-related deaths on record for the State, but these numbers are \nstill very much unacceptable.\n  I am disappointed that last year the House refused to take up this \nlegislation we approved and also refused to allow us to go to \nconference to work out the differences between the two bills. I urge my \ncolleagues in the Senate to pass this legislation, and I urge my \ncolleagues in the House to quickly take up the Senate bill and enact it \ninto law.\n Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I am in support of S. 47, the \nViolence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013. I am a cosponsor of \nthis bill and look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  The grants created by this act have helped ensure services to \ndomestic violence victims since 1994. VAWA has helped raise public \nawareness on an issue that too often went unreported and ignored under \nthe guise of politeness and privacy by family, friends, and neighbors.\n  Yet, while VAWA has raised awareness, increased reporting, and \nprovided victims of domestic violence and similar crimes with better \nservices and protection against perpetrators, there is still much work \nto be done to eliminate these crimes. Specifically, I am concerned \nabout the high instances of domestic violence in Indian Country. I am \npleased that S. 47 includes language to provide tribal governments the \nforce they need to prosecute non-Indian perpetrators who commit these \ncrimes on tribal land. There is no reason a non-Indian perpetrator \nshould go unpunished because a tribe lacked jurisdiction over him or \nher, and it is especially egregious that in such cases, the perpetrator \nmay go unpunished for crimes committed on tribal land. Every citizen of \nthis Nation deserves the safety and security that comes with a peaceful \nhome and safe relationship.\n  Indeed, I believe noncitizen immigrants who have moved to this \ncountry and found themselves trapped in an unsafe relationship or \nfamily setting also deserve the protections provided by VAWA. S. 47 \nprovides the types of protections necessary to assist law enforcement \nin prosecuting crimes that might otherwise have gone unreported by \nimmigrants fearful of losing their status.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting S. 47 and will work \nto make the bill and the services and protections it provides as strong \nas possible.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today to express support for \nthe reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA.\n  For the last 18 years, VAWA has been the centerpiece of the Federal \nGovernment's efforts to combat domestic violence, dating violence, \nstalking and sexual assault, and it has transformed the response to \nthese crimes at the local, State, and Federal levels.\n  VAWA was first signed into law in 1994. This body reauthorized it in \n2000 and again in 2005 on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis.\n  Unfortunately, final approval of the VAWA reauthorization bill came \nto an abrupt halt in Congress last year, when some Republicans insisted \non removing provisions that would provide expanded protections for gay \nand lesbian individuals and undocumented immigrants who are the victims \nof domestic abuse.\n  In my view, these expanded protections are improvements. Domestic \nviolence is domestic violence, regardless of the victim's immigration \nstatus or sexual orientation.\n  Domestic violence and crimes against American women have never been \npartisan issues in the past. This is why, candidly, I'm surprised that \nI find myself on this floor urging a vote a vote on a historically \nbipartisan bill.\n  Today, as a result of VAWA, more victims report incidents of domestic \nviolence to the police, and the rate of non-fatal partner violence \nagainst women has decreased by 53 percent since 1994, according to the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  Because of VAWA, States have the funding to implement ``evidence-\nbased'' anti-domestic violence programs, including lethality screens, \nwhich help law enforcement predict when a person is at risk of becoming \nthe victim of deadly abuse.\n  In my home State of California, with the help of VAWA funds, we \nreduced the number of domestic violence homicides committed annually by \n30% between 1994--the year of VAWA's enactment--and 2010.\n  In my days as the mayor of San Francisco, many of the most difficult \ncalls for the city's law enforcement officers were those of domestic \nabuse. It was a big problem then, and it remains a big problem today.\n  In California in 2010, there were 166,361 domestic violence calls, \nincluding more than 65,000 that involved a weapon.\n  Fortunately, over 5,000 victims receive assistance each day from \nlocal domestic violence service providers in the State. These providers \noffer services that are essential to ending the cycle of abuse that is \nfaced by so many domestic violence victims.\n  Let me share a success story about a woman from Lake County, CA who \nreceived vital assistance from a local domestic violence center that \nreceives Federal VAWA funding.\n\n[[Page S505]]\n\n  Mary--her name has been changed to protect her confidentiality--\ncontacted the Lake Family Resource Center after leaving her abusive \nhusband. Mary was assigned to a domestic violence family advocate who \noffered her one-on-one counseling and legal assistance.\n  The family advocate helped Mary file and obtain a temporary \nrestraining order against her husband. This order kept him away from \nMary and gave her temporary custody of their children.\n  The family advocate also accompanied Mary to several court hearings \nand was able to connect her with other local service providers. This \nsupport allowed Mary to remain independent and keep her children safe.\n  After several months of counseling and assistance, Mary obtained full \ncustody of her children and their lives have improved significantly. \nFor the first time ever, the children are now able to invite friends to \ntheir home and participate in normal social activities. In addition, \ntheir grades have improved dramatically, with one child receiving the \nStudent of the Month Award from his school.\n  The positive impact of VAWA funding is undeniable. Yet many \nCalifornia service providers report a critical shortage of funds and \nstaff to assist victims in need.\n  Reauthorizing VAWA would address these shortages through grant \nprograms administered by the Department of Justice that provide funding \nfor emergency shelters, counseling, and legal services for victims of \ndomestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking.\n  The bill would also continue support for State agencies, rape crisis \ncenters, and other organizations that provide services to vulnerable \nwomen.\n  The bill we are considering today gives increased attention to \nvictims of sexual violence. This form of violence is particularly \ndestructive because, for many years, our society viewed sexual violence \nas the fault of the victim, not the perpetrator.\n  Although VAWA has always addressed the crime of sexual assault, a \nsmaller percentage of grant funding has been allocated to sexual \nassault victims than is proportional to their rates of victimization. \nThis reauthorization bill does three things to address this imbalance:\n  1. It provides an increased focus on training for law enforcement and \nprosecutors to address the ongoing needs of sexual assault victims.\n  2. The bill extends VAWA's housing protections to these victims.\n  3. And the bill ensures that those who are living with, but not \nmarried to, an abuser qualify for housing assistance available under \nVAWA.\n  The bill also updates the Federal criminal code to clarify that \ncyberstalking is a crime. With increasing frequency, victims are being \nstalked over the Internet through e-mail, blogs, and Facebook. When \nstalking is done online, the message sent by the perpetrator is \nmemorialized forever, making it more difficult for victims to put the \npainful experience in the past and move forward in their lives.\n  Simply put, VAWA saves lives. It protects American women. And it is a \nlifeline for women and children who are in distress. To me, this bill \nis a no-brainer. We must continue our ongoing commitment to ending \ndomestic and sexual violence. This commitment has always been \nbipartisan, and it should be again. Let's not further victimize at-risk \nAmerican women because of partisan politics.\n  Let's do our job and reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act with \nstrong bipartisan support, as we always have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, today the Senate should have been able \noverwhelmingly to support reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, \nbut the majority made that impossible. In fact, S. 47 is not really a \nreauthorization bill but a bill to use the Violence Against Women Act \nto venture into new ideological territory. For that reason, I cannot \nsupport S. 47 but am a cosponsor of the true VAWA reauthorization bill \nintroduced by my colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley.\n  Two decades ago during the 103rd Congress, as ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, I worked with Chairman Joe Biden to develop \nlegislation to combat domestic violence and sexual assault against \nwomen. That first passage of the Violence Against Women Act had \nbipartisan support, although it was by no means without controversy. I \ntook more than my share of criticism from the right, but it was the \nright thing to do, and I worked to promote a genuine bipartisan \nconsensus behind this legislation.\n  In 2000, I again cosponsored the Violence Against Women Act which was \nincluded in the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act, and \nthe Senate voted 95-to-0 for the conference report. I cosponsored the \nVAWA reauthorization bill again in 2005, and this time the Senate \npassed it by unanimous consent without even a roll call vote. Clearly, \nthe trend has been toward broader support.\n  Unfortunately, the majority today has deliberately stopped that \ntrend. The majority has insisted on injecting into this legislation \nhighly controversial and divisive provisions that were guaranteed to \nfracture the growing support that VAWA has enjoyed in the past. Many of \nus asked them not to do it this way but to address these issues \nseparately so that there could be hearings and proper debate. Instead, \nthe majority chose to use VAWA as cover for sidestepping the \nlegislative process on these issues.\n  Let me give just one example. One of those divisive issues concerns \nthe jurisdiction of courts on Native American reservations. Section 904 \nof S. 47 would give tribal courts jurisdiction over nontribal \nindividuals in domestic violence cases. This presents numerous \nconstitutional problems. Native American reservations are sovereign \nnations, and key provisions of the U.S. Constitution's Bill of Rights \nhave been interpreted not to apply there. This legislation lists \ncertain rights to be afforded nontribal defendants but not only stops \nshort of guaranteeing all constitutional rights but also does not \nprovide for direct review of convictions in U.S. courts. I simply \ncannot support depriving American citizens of constitutional rights and \njudicial protection.\n  I want to applaud my colleague from Texas, Senator Cornyn, who has \nbeen trying mightily to correct this grave constitutional defect in S. \n47. He has negotiated in good faith in a principled and fair way. Like \nme, he wants to support reauthorization of the Violence Against Women \nAct. But like him, I will do so only on the appropriate constitutional \nand policy grounds.\n  I have cosponsored the Violence Against Women Act three times. I \nvoted last year to reauthorize it and will do so again today. But while \nI support reauthorizing VAWA, I cannot support using VAWA as a vehicle \nto enact divisive and controversial new measures that have not been \nproperly evaluated on their own terms. Had the majority taken the same \napproach as we did in 2000 and 2005, this legislation would have been \npassed and signed into law months ago. Instead, the majority has \ndestroyed the bipartisan consensus in favor of unconstitutional and \ndivisive efforts to favor special interests.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I thank the leader, Senator Leahy, for \nhis leadership in trying to get the Violence Against Women Act passed \nand for being down here and working on an agreement with the other side \nof the aisle so we can vote either today or in the near future. \nHopefully, we will bring this issue to an end and get along with \nprotecting the rights of women throughout the United States of America.\n  I am very anxious to help and further that debate. I come to the \nfloor as the chair of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee and as \nsomebody who has spent a lot of time dealing with tribal leadership in \nthe State of Washington and throughout the Pacific Northwest. I know \nthe Presiding Officer has a very large tribal population within her \nState too. I am sure she has had had many experiences with those \ntribes. Like me, she wants to make sure all victims of domestic \nviolence are protected in America.\n\n[[Page S506]]\n\n  In Washington State, we receive over 30,000 domestic violence calls a \nyear. That is more than 500 incidents per week. Our domestic violence \nprograms serve about 1,800 people each day, and that is why we need to \nmove past this debate, get this legislation reauthorized, so we make \nsure we help protect victims.\n  A woman named Carissa Daniels came to one of our events recently. She \nfled from a very abusive domestic violence situation with her 3-year-\nold daughter. She said she is alive because of the Violence Against \nWomen Act. Those safeguards and protections protected her and her \ndaughter.\n  I come to the floor, and I am a little frustrated this debate has \nbeen bogged down over a few issues, particularly this issue as it \nrelates to Native Americans and the rights of Native Americans.\n  I think we had the Department of Justice come to the Congress with a \nvery good solution because their point was we have an epidemic of \nviolence against women in Indian country, and we don't have a ready \nsolution as it relates to the necessary law enforcement there to \nprotect them.\n  I don't mean to be elementary, but going back through our country's \nhistory and our relationship with tribal governments, it is a Federal \nrelationship. To secure that Federal relationship, we have basically \nsaid these are rights for the Federal Government and not the States. In \nmany ways, we have eliminated what States can do as it relates to \ntribal land. The challenge we have is that on these tribal reservations \nwe need to make sure the law is enforced--a Federal law--and that there \nare individuals to carry out that Federal law.\n  By voting for the underlying amendment, maybe my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle have an appropriations authorization that says \nthis is how we are going to deal with it: We are going to give you a \nFederal prosecutor and a Federal agent on every tribal reservation or \nin every jurisdiction. I don't know how many that would be in my State. \nWe have vast and huge amounts of land. I guess, if they thought that \nwas going to be effective, there would have to be a prosecutor and a \nFederal agent in probably 39 different parts of my State. If we \nmultiply that in the West--or even just in the Presiding Officer's \nState--we are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars the Federal \nGovernment would have to dole out to properly police and enforce \nFederal law as it relates to crimes against these women.\n  Why isn't anybody recommending that? Because I think the Department \nof Justice has adequately seen that the best way to do this is to build \na partnership with those tribal jurisdictions to get that done.\n  In looking over the history of this, I am always amazed at what \nprevious administrations--Republican administrations--said about this \ntribal relationship. Even George H.W. Bush's Solicitor General Kenneth \nStarr stated in a filing in the Supreme Court that ``it remains true \ntoday that the State has no jurisdiction over on-reservation offenses \ninvolving Indians. . . . ''\n  George W. Bush's Solicitor General said that ``the policy of leaving \nIndians free from State jurisdiction and control'' is one that ``is \ndeeply rooted in the Nation's history.''\n  So here are Republican administrations that have basically said the \nway to deal with this is a Federal relationship. I am saying to my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle that unless they are willing \nto put a Federal prosecutor and a Federal agent on all tribal \nreservations, who do they think is going to prosecute these crimes? \nWho? Who is going to prosecute them? That is why the Department of \nJustice came to us and said: We have an idea on how we might do it. \nLet's try to get a partnership with tribal jurisdictions to make sure \njustice is being brought on tribal land but do so by protecting the \ncivil liberties of American citizens as we go through this process.\n  That is the legislation that is before us. It passed out of the \nJudiciary Committee and is now on the Senate floor. My colleagues \nacross the aisle are trying to strip those very rights that Native \nAmerican women would have.\n  The way this would work is obviously tribal jurisdictions would \nprosecute these individuals. If there is anyone who doesn't think this \nis a problem--it is amazing to me to think this concept that one of our \nother colleagues might be proposing, that somehow we would say: OK. A \nsolution would be to say it is a lesser crime if an Indian woman is \nassaulted on a tribal reservation, and it would be a misdemeanor. \nSomehow aggressive abuse and violent attacks against women would be a \nmisdemeanor. I am not going to treat Native American women as second-\nclass citizens in the United States of America.\n  I get that might have been the cultural norm of the 1700s and 1800s, \nbut it has no place in our history in 2013. This is about legislation \nthat will protect tribal women on Indian reservations and make sure \nthese cases of abuse--whether they are done by a Native American or \nnon-Native American--are protected.\n  Consider the case of Diane Millich. Her ex-husband was never arrested \nany of the more than 100 times he had beaten her or attacked her. \nFinally, he showed up at her workplace with a gun to kill her. She is \nalive because an individual from her workplace pushed her out of the \nway. Her husband is being treated as a first-time offender because all \nthose other times he beat her or domestically assaulted her, he was \nnever prosecuted because it took place on a reservation.\n  This epidemic is so great that now these people who are involved in \nsex and drug trafficking are targeting reservations and Indian women \nbecause they know they will not get prosecuted. They know this.\n  We are allowing an intolerable situation to grow in great extremes \nsimply because we are missing a vital tool. I get that many of my \ncolleagues may not understand the history of tribal law and the history \nof our country and securing a relationship with tribes and the treaties \nwe signed.\n  Again, as I said before, this is a relationship we have preserved for \nthe Federal Government, and the Federal Government is saying this is \nhow we can best solve these crimes by getting the help and support of \ntribal jurisdictions.\n\n  I wish to say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \nbecause I have heard some of them say that somehow this violates the \ncivil liberties of non-Native Americans if these crimes happen in \nIndian Country, that nothing could be further from the truth.\n  First of all, all tribal courts also adhere to the Indian Civil \nRights Act, which is basically our 14th amendment. So the security of \nthe 14th amendment is right there in the law and will protect any non-\nNative American who is charged with this crime on a reservation.\n  Secondly, this law has specifically broad language, making sure the \ndefendant would be protected with all rights required by the United \nStates in order for this jurisdiction to have oversight. It is almost \nlike a double protection--saying it twice--that the habeas corpus \nrights of individuals will be protected under this statute.\n  The notion that this is somehow abrogating individual rights just \nbecause the crime takes place on a tribal reservation is incorrect. So \nI ask my colleagues: Do we want to continue to have this unbelievable \ngrowth and petri dish of crime evolving--when criminals know there is a \nporous border, that is where they are going to go--or do we want to \npartner with a recommendation that has been determined by the \nDepartment of Justice, which has the authority to carry out this \nFederal law on tribal reservations and is asking for this partnership \nbut with due protection so we can root out this evil in our \ncommunities.\n  I would say to my colleagues, it is time to pass this legislation and \nprotect these rights for all individuals. We cannot vote for an \namendment on the other side of the aisle that basically strips the \nrights of Native American women and treats them like second-class \ncitizens, nor can we just go silent on what is an epidemic problem in \nour country. What we have to do is stand and realize that the \nrelationship between the Federal Government and Indian Country is a \nvery mature relationship with a lot of Federal case law behind it. A \nlot of Republican administrations recognize it is a Federal \nrelationship and that we can--asking Indian Country to help us--solve \nthis problem and prosecute these individuals under the rights we have \nas constitutional citizens of the United States.\n\n[[Page S507]]\n\n  I am confident we can get to an answer and resolve this issue. I say \nto my colleagues: We need to do so with urgency. We cannot allow \nanother 1,800 calls to go unanswered or not supported because we have \nnot authorized this legislation. Let's get our job done and protect all \nwomen throughout the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I would like to speak on the amendment, \nif I could.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Earlier this week, my colleague Senator Blumenthal spoke \nabout an amendment we are offering to the Violence Against Women Act, \nand it is an amendment that has to do with child sex trafficking. I am \npleased to join him in offering this important amendment and talking \nabout it today.\n  This is really a technical correction to the underlying legislation \nto enhance the safety of our youth and our children in the area of sex \ntrafficking.\n  Last November, Senator Blumenthal and I started the Senate Caucus to \nEnd Human Trafficking. We have been working with our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle and have been making bipartisan progress on this \nissue. In general, we are working to raise awareness of human \ntrafficking, and with regard to the underlying bill, the issue of child \nsex trafficking.\n  This issue cuts across all party and philosophical lines. It is \nsomething that is more fundamental. It is about who we are as a people, \nand how we respect and protect basic human dignity. It is important to \nacknowledge that human trafficking is not something we hear about that \nhappens overseas; it happens right here in America. Unfortunately, \nhuman trafficking is an issue present in communities in Ohio and \nConnecticut--where Senator Blumenthal is from--and in all of our \nStates.\n  Children and youth are among the most vulnerable individuals and are \nat the greatest risk. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, \nthere are now nearly 300,000 young Americans who are at risk of \ncommercial sexual exploitation and trafficking.\n  The Department of Justice reports that between 2008 and 2010, 83 \npercent of sex trafficking victims found within the United States were \nU.S. citizens. By the way, 40 percent of those cases involve sexual \nexploitation of children. Human trafficking has a devastating impact on \nso many Americans across this country.\n  One of the reasons we lack data on the definitive number of victims \nis that there are limited programs and resources available to serve \nthese children nationwide, and this problem is not limited to large \ncities or metropolitan areas.\n  In Ohio, the 2012 Human Trafficking Commission Report surveyed more \nthan 300 Ohio youth victims of sex trafficking. The report found that \n40 percent were also victims of sexual abuse; 47 percent of the victims \nsurveyed confirmed they had been raped 1 year before being trafficked.\n  Dr. Celia Williamson, from Toledo, OH, is one of the key individuals \nresponsible for this report and continues to work to strengthen the \nresponse to sex trafficking in Ohio. Dr. Williamson developed the \nprogram, RESCUE CHILD, which educates first responders and everyday \ncitizens on how to recognize the signs of child sex trafficking.\n  This is an important issue for Ohio. Toledo, OH, is among the highest \nin the country in terms of prosecution and investigations of sex \ntrafficking. Dr. Williamson has helped to educate folks to identify \nsigns of sex trafficking and high vulnerability. Some of the key signs \nof high vulnerability to sex trafficking are youth who have run away \nfrom home and children who are victims of sexual assault, emotional \nabuse, child abuse, or neglect. In order to fight human trafficking, we \nhave to prioritize services to these vulnerable youth and connect \nvictims of sex trafficking with appropriate resources.\n\n  So this amendment is really just a technical amendment to ensure that \nwe protect these child victims of sex trafficking and provide them with \nwhat is necessary to fully recover from this devastating trauma.\n  Section 302 of the reauthorization of VAWA is appropriating titled \n``Creating Hope Through Outreach, Options, Services, and Education for \nChildren and Youth.'' The intent of this section is to ``develop, \nexpand, and strengthen victim-centered interventions and services that \ntarget victim-centered youth who are victims of domestic violence, \ndating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.''\n  Section 302 omits the term ``sex trafficking'' except in the context \nof a ``co-occurrence'' with one of these other factors I mentioned. So \nin order to be covered under this section, victims would have to be \nvictims of sexual assault or another violation as well as victims of \nsex trafficking.\n  The omission of ``sex trafficking'' seems to be inadvertent because \nit is inconsistent with the similar sections of the reauthorization. \nOne example of this is found in Section 902, which provides grants to \nIndian tribunal governments for the safety of women and youth. This \nsection provides for ``services to address the needs of youth who are \nvictims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, sex \ntrafficking, and stalking.'' So sex trafficking is in one section but \nnot in another. We want to clarify that being a victim of sex \ntrafficking alone should be sufficient to be covered under this act.\n  I thank Senator Blumenthal for his commitment to this issue, and I \nthank my colleagues, including the ranking member and the chairman who \nare here on the floor today. I hope to offer this amendment at the \nappropriate point in the process, but I wanted to speak a little bit \nabout it and explain why Senator Blumenthal and I would like to offer \nthis. Again, we hope it will be a noncontroversial, technical \ncorrection to ensure that sex trafficking is included among those \nprovisions that are listed in Section 302.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I hope to offer an amendment that \nwould be a Republican substitute, so whenever that happens--I don't \nknow exactly when, but I wish to discuss my amendment at this point.\n  My amendment does more to protect the rights of victims of domestic \nviolence and sex crimes than does the underlying piece of legislation. \nThere are many ways in which this is so. Under the substitute amendment \nI will offer, more money goes to the victims and less to bureaucrats. \nIt requires that 10 percent of the grantees be audited every year to \nensure that taxpayer funds are actually used to combat domestic \nviolence. It seems to me that when dollars are short, that is a very \nimportant point that people ought to take cognizance of.\n  The Justice Department inspector general conducted a review of 22 \nVAWA grantees between the years 1998 and 2010. Of these 22, 21 were \nfound to have some form of violation of grant requirements, ranging \nfrom unauthorized and unallowable expenditures to sloppy record keeping \nand failure to report in a timely manner. In 2010 one grantee was found \nby the inspector general to have questionable costs for 93 percent of \nthe nearly $900,000 they received from the Department of Justice. A \n2009 audit found that nearly $500,000 of a $680,000 grant was \nquestionable.\n  These fiscal irregularities continue. An inspector general audit from \nlast year found that the Violence Against Women Act grant recipient in \nthe Virgin Islands engaged in almost $850,000 of questionable spending. \nAlso, a grant to an Indian tribe in Idaho had about $250,000 in \nimproperly spent funds, including $171,000 in salary for an unapproved \nposition. In Michigan last year, a woman at a VAWA grant recipient used \nsome of those funds to purchase goods and services for her personal \nuse.\n  After all of those examples, the point is this: We should make sure \nViolence Against Women Act money goes to victims. That hasn't been the \ncase under the current situation, and the substitute works toward \nimproving that situation.\n  The substitute also prevents grantees from using taxpayer funds to \nlobby for more taxpayer funds. That seems to be pretty common sense.\n  My amendment will ensure that more money is available for victim \nservices. That is where the money is supposed to go. Money that goes to \ngrantees and is squandered helps no woman or other victims.\n\n[[Page S508]]\n\n  In addition, the Republican alternative limits the amount of VAWA \nfunds that can go to administrative fees and salaries to just 7.5 \npercent. The present underlying bill, S. 47, contains no such limit. If \nwe want the money to go to victims and not to bureaucrats, then those \noverhead expenses should be capped.\n  The Republican substitute amendment requires that 30 percent of the \nSTOP grants and grants for arrest policies and protection orders are \ntargeted on sexual assault. The underlying bill sets aside only 20 \npercent for sexual assault.\n  The substitute requires that training materials be approved by an \noutside accredited organization to ensure that those who address \ndomestic violence help victims based on knowledge and not on ideology. \nThat will result in more effective assistance to the victims. The \nunderlying bill contains no such requirement.\n  The substitute protects due process rights the majority bill \nthreatens. Now, I am sure the majority writers don't feel their bill \nthreatens due process rights, so let me explain. The majority bill says \nthat college campuses must provide for ``prompt and equitable \ninvestigation and resolution'' of charges of violence or stalking. This \nessentially does nothing but codify a proposed rule of the Department \nof Education that would have required the imposition of a civil \nstandard or preponderance of the evidence for what is essentially a \ncriminal charge--one that, if proved, rightfully should harm \nreputation. But if established on a barely-more-probable-than-not \nstandard, reputations can then be ruined unfairly. The substitute \neliminates this provision as well as another provision that allowed the \nvictim who could not prove such a charge even under this reduced \nstandard to appeal if she lost, creating a kind of double jeopardy.\n  The majority bill also would give Indian tribal courts the ability to \nissue protective orders and full civil jurisdiction over non-Indians \nbased on actions allegedly taken in Indian Country. Noting that the due \nprocess clause requires that courts exercise jurisdiction over only \nthose persons who have ``minimum contacts'' with the forum, the \nCongressional Research Service has raised constitutional concerns with \nthis provision. The substitute contains provisions that would benefit \ntribal women and would not run afoul of the Constitution.\n  Tribes could seek protective orders in Federal court. The substitute \nestablishes up to $25 million for Federal prosecutors and magistrates \nto be placed near tribes for criminal domestic violence and sexual \nassault cases as well as to hear tribal motions for protective orders.\n  The grant funds are paid for by reducing the overhead of other \nJustice Department grant funds. However, there will be no reduction in \navailable grants for law enforcement or victims. These programs are not \ncurrently funded to their authorized levels, so the reductions will not \nreduce services provided.\n  Combating violence against women also means tougher penalties for \nthose who commit these terrible crimes. The substitute I am referring \nto creates a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence for Federal convictions \nfor forcible rape. The majority bill even eliminates the 5-year \nmandatory minimum sentence for this crime that was in the bill last \nyear and supported last year by the Judiciary Committee.\n  Child pornography is an actual record of a crime scene of violence \nagainst women. Our alternative amendment establishes a 1-year mandatory \nminimum sentence for possession of child pornography where the victim \ndepicted is under 12 years of age. I believe the mandatory minimum for \nthis crime should be higher and that in light of the systematically \nlenient sentences that too many Federal judges hand out, there should \nbe a mandatory minimum sentence for all child pornography possession \nconvictions. But the substitute at least is a start. This is especially \ntrue because the majority bill takes no action against child \npornography.\n  Our alternative also imposes a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence for \nthe crime of aggravated sexual assault. This crime involves sexual \nassault through the use of drugs and by otherwise rendering the victim \nunconscious. The underlying bill does nothing about aggravated sexual \nassault. The status quo appears to be fine for the other side.\n  The Republican substitute establishes a 10-year mandatory minimum \nsentence for the crime of interstate domestic violence that results in \nthe death of a victim. It increases from 20 to 25 years the statutory \nmaximum sentence for the crime where it results in life-threatening \nbodily injury to or the permanent disfigurement of the victim. It \nincreases from 10 to 15 years the mandatory maximum sentence for this \ncrime when serious bodily injury to the victim is the result. The \nunderlying bill contains none of these important protections for \ndomestic violence victims.\n  Also included in my substitute are commonsense immigration reforms \nthat put integrity back into the Violence Against Women Act self-\npetitioning process and the U visa program.\n  This last Congress, the Judiciary Committee heard the powerful \ntestimony of Julie Poner. She described her personal experience as a \nvictim of immigration marriage fraud and with the fraudulent use of \nViolence Against Women Act self-petitions. Ms. Poner told us she \nmarried her husband in the Czech Republic and moved her husband and \nkids back to the United States. Within days of receiving notice of an \ninterview with the immigration service to finalize her husband's \nimmigration status, he told her he was divorcing her. He instructed her \nto file for the divorce and continue to sponsor him for his green card. \nHe then became abusive toward her children. Her husband was a hockey \nplayer--6 feet 2 inches tall. However, he knew he risked deportation if \nthe truth came out, so he turned the tables on his wife and claimed he \nwas the one abused--actually being abused by Ms. Poner. Ms. Poner never \nwas allowed to share her side of the story. The immigration service \nbelieved his claims and allowed him to remain in the United States.\n  Our committee also received written statements from more than 20 \nindividuals who maintained they were victims of marriage fraud or were \nfalsely accused as part of the Violence Against Women Act self-\npetitions. These witnesses told of their firsthand experiences and how \nforeign nationals prey on U.S. citizens simply to get a green card. The \nU.S. citizens thought it was all for love, but after saying ``I do,'' \nthe foreign national lodged false allegations, sometimes of physical \nabuse, in order to get out of the marriage, collect alimony, and secure \na green card.\n  Witnesses have said their side of the story was never--never--heard \nbecause under the process used by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \nServices, the citizen's side of the story is not considered. The U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services handles all of these green card \napplications in one service center that relies exclusively on paper, \nwithout interviewing either the alleged abused foreign national or the \naccused citizen.\n  To this day, I am disappointed that antifraud measures have not been \nincluded in the Violence Against Women Act. We cannot allow a law \nintended to prevent abuse to be manipulated as a pathway to U.S. \ncitizenship for foreign con artists and criminals. If we are truly \nconcerned about helping and protecting the victims of domestic \nviolence, then we should include a provision that allows our \nimmigration agents to hear both sides of the story when a foreign \nnational applies for a green card after alleging domestic violence by a \nU.S. citizen.\n  So my amendment, obviously, addresses this fraud. It would require an \ninterview of the applicant and allow the government to gather other \nevidence and interview other witnesses, including the accused U.S. \ncitizen or legal permanent resident.\n  Before adjudicating the self-petition, the government would have to \ndetermine whether other investigations or prosecutions are underway for \nthe petitioning alien. If there are other allegations or investigations \npending, the immigration adjudication would have to consider all facts.\n  The second immigration-related section of my amendment would \nstrengthen the requirements of a U visa. Under current law, the \nrequirements for receiving a U visa are generous. My\n\n[[Page S509]]\n\namendment implements some commonsense requirements to guide law \nenforcement who help sponsor these individuals.\n  In addition to confirming that the alien has been helpful, each law \nenforcement certification will also have to confirm that, one, the \nalien reported the criminal activity to a law enforcement agency within \n120 days of its occurrence; two, the statute of limitations for \nprosecuting an offense based on the criminal activity has not lapsed; \nthree, the criminal activity is actively under investigation or a \nprosecution has been commenced; and, four, and last, the alien has \ninformation that will assist in identifying the perpetrator of the \ncriminal activity and/or the perpetrator's identity is known.\n  With these changes, U visas will become a true law enforcement tool. \nThe additional requirements will ensure that the help given is real and \nsignificantly advances an actual investigation and prosecution.\n  Another immigration-related section of my amendment includes a \nGovernment Accountability Office report to assess the efficiency and \nreliability of the process for reviewing applications for U visas and \nself-petitions under the Violence Against Women Act, including whether \nthe process includes adequate safeguards against fraud and abuse.\n  It will also identify possible improvements in order to reduce fraud \nand abuse.\n  The final immigration provision I want to highlight in my substitute \nwould allow the U.S. Government to deport repeat drunk drivers. Section \n1005 would add habitual drunk driving to the list of aggravated \nfelonies for which an alien may be deported.\n  Every day--every day--an innocent life is taken because someone \ndecides to drink and drive. An individual who gets behind the wheel \nafter drinking is not exercising sound judgment.\n  Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, foreign nationals are \nrequired to be of ``good moral character'' before they are able to \nadjust status or become citizens of the United States. Unfortunately, \nhabitual drunk driving does not stand in one's way from gaining these \nbenefits. In other words, it is not a deportable offense.\n  There are numerous stories about individuals who have taken innocent \nlives because they were driving under the influence of alcohol. In \n2011, an undocumented alien in Cook County, IL, killed a man in a drunk \ndriving accident. Unfortunately, he was released by the county, \nabsconded, and remains in the United States. There was also a Virginia \nman who killed a Catholic nun in Prince William County in 2010. He was \nan illegal immigrant and repeat offender and never should have been \nallowed to remain in the country.\n  There are many more cases, and, unfortunately, the law will allow \ndrunk driving to continue without repercussions for foreign nationals \nwho are on a path to citizenship. It is time that these offenses were \nclassified as an aggravated felony. It is time to get these people off \nthe streets. Residing in the United States is a privilege, not a right.\n  The Congress has every prerogative to dictate which behavior is \nacceptable, especially for noncitizens who should be of ``good moral \ncharacter.'' Last Congress, the Judiciary Committee adopted an \namendment to this bill that would have classified habitual drunk \ndriving offenses as aggravated felonies. But in the bill before us now, \nthe majority has dropped that provision. I cannot understand why we \nwould be so lenient with respect to habitual drunk drivers.\n  When we get to amendments--the substitute I just talked about--I \nintend to offer that substitute, and I would urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the Republican substitute bill being \noffered by the Senator from Iowa does not meet the needs of victims of \ndomestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. \nRespectfully, I must say it is a poor substitute for the bipartisan \nViolence Against Women Reauthorization Act we developed over the last 2 \nyears that has 62 bipartisan Senate cosponsors. I urge Senators to vote \nagainst it.\n\n  The Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act already \nreflects many efforts we have undertaken to address the concerns of \nSenator Grassley and to meet Republican members halfway, and to \naccommodate them where we could. Our bill includes significant new \naccountability provisions modeled on language Senator Grassley had us \ninclude in the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.\n  Our bill significantly reduces authorization levels to all programs. \nThis is the first time a reauthorization reduced authorization levels, \nand we do so by almost 20 percent. Our bill consolidates and \nstreamlines 13 programs. Our bill limits the percentage of grants that \norganizations can use for planning purposes. In drafting our bill, we \neliminated several provisions that Senator Grassley indicated were \nproblematic. We took these steps in an effort to work together to pass \na bipartisan bill.\n  The proposed substitute bill would remove fundamental points of \nfairness that are at the core of this legislation. We need to cover \neveryone who experiences domestic and sexual violence in this country. \nNo exceptions.\n  About 3\\1/2\\ years ago, the Congress finally adopted the Matthew \nShepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act which protected \nthose targeted with violence in a similar way to what we are \nconsidering today. We should not retreat from that position when we are \naddressing domestic and sexual violence.\n  The Republican substitute abandons VAWA's historic emphasis on abuse \nof women. Women are still more often the victims of domestic and sexual \nviolence with more catastrophic results. The Republican substitute not \nonly fails women, it also fails to guarantee that services will \nactually reach those victims who have in the past been unable to access \nthem because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n  We should listen to those on the front lines of these tragedies who \nhave told us about underserved communities needing protection. We \nshould respond to law enforcement when they tell us about the \nimportance of the U visa program, which enables them to take dangerous \npeople off the street. We should not adopt the measures included in the \nRepublican substitute that would make it more difficult for victims to \napply for U visas. The Republican substitute would abandon our \nprovisions that address domestic and sexual violence in tribal areas, \nwhich has reached epidemic proportions with rates of victimization far \nexceeding those in the general population. Taking money from other \nJustice Department programs to impose Federal judges and prosecutors on \nIndian lands is costly, unworkable and a non-solution to the problem. \nThe bipartisan reauthorization bill, by contrast, takes the approach \nrecommended by our Committee on Indian Affairs. We include local, \ncommunity-based approaches to domestic violence that have worked so \nwell in so many VAWA programs. Federal prosecutors already have \nauthority to prosecute on these lands and have not solved the problem. \nFederal judges have plenty to do and our Federal courts are stretched \nthin with 83 current vacancies. Giving tribes the authority to \nprosecute those who commit violence against Indian victims on Indian \nland is a better and less costly solution than bringing in large \nnumbers of Federal officials to Indian country.\n  All these differences are in the wrong direction and would result in \nleaving victims out. The Grassley substitute also includes costly and \ninefficient bureaucratic provisions that could cripple the delivery of \nneeded services to victims and tie up the work of the Justice \nDepartment's Office of Inspector General.\n  In contrast to the Republican substitute, the bipartisan VAWA \nreauthorization bill responds to the needs we have heard from the \nprofessionals, including law enforcement, who work every day to help \nvictims of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and \nstalking. No one I have worked with has identified Federal sentencing \nas an area requiring changes. The sentencing provisions in this \nsubstitute, which include mandatory minimum sentences, are unnecessary \nand counterproductive. In fact, leading sexual assault advocacy groups \nlike the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence oppose mandatory \nminimum sentences because they have a chilling effect on reporting and \nprosecution of\n\n[[Page S510]]\n\nsexual assaults. The sentencing provisions in the substitute make \nvictims and, by extension, our communities less safe.\n  We should not include extraneous provisions, as this substitute does, \nthat have nothing to do with domestic violence or sexual assault. \nComprehensive immigration reform is coming before us. The Judiciary \nCommittee is hard at work on that. Proposals to change deportations may \nbe appropriate in the context of comprehensive immigration reform. They \nhave nothing to do with VAWA. Yet they are included in the Republican \nsubstitute. And when a provision of that type was included in the \nmeasure last year, its author nonetheless opposed VAWA reauthorization. \nIt can be considered with comprehensive immigration reform, not here.\n  Every previous reauthorization of VAWA has contained new protections \nfor immigrants and underserved communities. Our bill builds on that \nfoundation with changes that are modest and widely supported.\n  The Republican substitute would gut core provisions of our bipartisan \nlegislation that we all know we need and that professionals in the \nfield tell us are needed. I thank Senator Cantwell, Senator Klobuchar, \nand Senator Durbin for their excellent statements in opposition and \nurge all Senators to oppose the substitute and support the bipartisan \nViolence Against Women Reauthorization Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I listened to everything the chairman \nsaid. I am not going to rebut point by point. I wish to take a little \nbit of time to emphasize the key points I have tried to make. In a \nsense, I might be asking the chairman to think in terms of what we are \ntrying to accomplish just on a couple of points.\n  First of all, I think this is pointed out with the underlying bill \nthat somehow all victims are not protected. The point is, that for \nhowever many years now--I suppose it is 25 years that this legislation \nhas been on the books--all victims are protected under the substitute \nand, I want to emphasize, under current law.\n  It was then-Senator Biden, now Vice President Biden, writing the \ncurrent law. His law did not discriminate. As Senator Leahy says, those \nwho provide domestic violence services believe a victim is a victim. \nThey do not discriminate.\n  On another point about the tribal courts, I made reference to the \nCongressional Research Service when I gave my longer remarks on this \npoint of questionable constitutional issues. As for the tribal court \nprovisions, the Congressional Research Service has raised serious \nconstitutional problems both with respect to the authority of tribal \ncourts to prosecute non-Indians and the constitutional rights of non-\nIndians. What is very cruel is to provide tribal women the illusion of \na solution that courts may well strike down on constitutional grounds \nin the future.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing amendments be the only first-degree amendments in order to \nthe bill: Grassley substitute amendment No. 14, Leahy amendment No. 21, \nPortman amendment No. 10, Murkowski amendment No. 11, Coburn amendment \nNo. 13, Coburn amendment No. 15, and Coburn amendment No. 16; that the \ntime until 4 p.m. be for debate on the Grassley substitute; that the \ndebate be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees; \nthat at 4 p.m. the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Grassley \nsubstitute amendment; that there be no amendments in order to any of \nthe amendments on this list prior to votes in relation to the \namendments; that when the Senate resumes consideration of the bill \nfollowing any leader remarks on Monday, February 11, the time until \n5:30 p.m. be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees \nprior to votes in relation to the remaining amendments and passage of \nthe underlying bill as amended, if amended; further, that Senator \nCornyn have 45 minutes under his control on the Republican side; and \nthere be 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that the time during the quorum be equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I have spoken on this earlier, but I \nwould just tell my colleagues why I will oppose this substitute which \nwill be voted on in a few minutes. The substitute does not meet the \nneeds of victims of domestic violence or dating violence or sexual \nassault or stalking. I think it is a poor substitute for the bipartisan \nViolence Against Women Reauthorization Act that we have developed over \nthe last 2 years, and which has 62 bipartisan Senate cosponsors. That \nis why I will urge Senators to vote against it.\n  The proposed substitute bill would remove fundamental points of \nfairness that are at the core of this legislation. We need to cover \neveryone who experiences domestic and sexual violence in this country, \nwith no exceptions. Again, I have said 100 times on this floor, a \nvictim is a victim is a victim; violence is violence is violence. You \ncan't say this victim will get protection, but this victim won't get \nprotection. The police never do that; we shouldn't do it.\n  Also, this substitute abandons VAWA's historic emphasis on abuse of \nwomen. Women are still more often the victims of domestic and sexual \nviolence, with more catastrophic results. The substitute not only fails \nwomen, it fails to guarantee that services will actually reach those \nvictims who in the past have been unable to access them.\n  Every previous reauthorization of VAWA has contained new protections \nfor immigrants and underserved communities. Our bill builds on that \nfoundation with changes that are modest and are widely supported by \nfaith-based organizations, the law enforcement community, and those who \nwork against domestic violence.\n  We have gone all over this country to find the best way to do this. \nThis is what we have done in this bill. And what bothers me the most \nabout the substitute is that it guts the core provisions of our \nbipartisan legislation. We know we need these services, and \nprofessionals in the field tell us they are needed. Look at what we \nhave in our bipartisan reauthorization bill. It responds to the needs \nwe have heard of from the professionals, including law enforcement. \nThese are the people who work every day to help victims of domestic \nviolence and sexual assault and dating violence and stalking.\n  No one I have worked with has identified Federal sentencing as an \narea that requires changes, so the sentencing provisions in the \nsubstitute are unnecessary and counterproductive.\n  Earlier I went through this I think point by point. I won't repeat \nthat, but I would say to all the Members of this body, Republicans and \nDemocrats alike, who have worked to craft this bipartisan piece of \nlegislation: Please vote against this substitute amendment, because it \nis nothing, nothing at all like what we have worked on.\n  Madam President, what is the amendment before us now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has not yet been offered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, under the unanimous consent request \nagreement, am I correct the Grassley substitute is to be voted on in \nabout 30 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, normally I would call it up, but I \nunderstand Senator Grassley is almost here. As a matter of courtesy, I \nwill not call it up; but if there is going to be a delay, because \npeople are expecting this 4 o'clock vote--\n  Mrs. BOXER. Parliamentary inquiry, Madam President: What is the order \nright now?\n\n[[Page S511]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The order is for the Grassley substitute to be \noffered and voted upon.\n  Mrs. BOXER. At 4 o'clock?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 4 o'clock.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Due to what is happening here, I would say that if he \ndoesn't make his presentation in 5 minutes that we could vote.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 14\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Grassley, and \nprobably to his dismay, I call up the Grassley amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for Mr. Grassley, \n     for himself, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Johanns proposes an amendment \n     numbered 14.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that further reading be dispensed \nwith.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma (Mr. Coburn).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 34, nays 65, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 13 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--34\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Enzi\n     Fischer\n     Flake\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Hoeven\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (WI)\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Portman\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Scott\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--65\n\n     Ayotte\n     Baldwin\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Blumenthal\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Collins\n     Coons\n     Cowan\n     Crapo\n     Cruz\n     Donnelly\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Heinrich\n     Heitkamp\n     Hirono\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kaine\n     King\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Lee\n     Levin\n     Manchin\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Murphy\n     Murray\n     Nelson\n     Paul\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Rubio\n     Sanders\n     Schatz\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Warren\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n     Coburn\n      \n      \n  The amendment (No. 14) was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                       Carl Levin's 12,000th Vote\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, a few minutes ago Senator Carl Levin cast \nhis 12,000th vote. It is my honor to say a few words about Carl Levin. \nHe has served the State of Michigan for 35 years and is the longest \nserving Senator in the history of that State. During his 35 years in \nthe Senate, he has been known as a workhorse. If there is a problem \nthat needs to be looked over by someone who understands the issue, go \nto Senator Levin. He is a person who dots all the I's and crosses all \nthe T's. I depend--and have depended--on him so much for issues that \nare difficult.\n  He is a native of Detroit and attended Swathmore College. He \ngraduated--as I always remind him--from Harvard Law School. I called \nthem several times, but obviously my application was lost. I never \nheard back from them.\n  He served as general counsel to the Michigan Civil Rights Commission \nand as assistant attorney general for the State of Michigan. He ran for \nthe Detroit City Council and served two terms there. He was elected in \n1978 to the U.S. Senate where he has served six terms and is an \neffective champion for the people of Michigan.\n  Public service runs in his family. Sander Levin is his older brother, \nwho came to the House of Representatives in 1982 with me, Durbin, \nCarper, Boxer, to name just a few.\n  Senator Levin has heard me say this several times, and I will \ncontinue to say it because it is one of the most impressive, memorable \nstatements I have ever had in a very personal setting. I was in the \nHouse of Representatives, and I was thinking about running for the \nSenate. I went over to meet with Carl Levin to get his ideas. As I was \ntrying to establish some rapport with him, I said: I am serving with \nyour brother. He and I came here together. Without hesitation and so \nsincerely, he looked up at me and said: Yes, he is my brother, but he \nis also my best friend.\n  I have never, ever forgotten that. That speaks so well of the Levin \nfamily. Sandy has been the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee \nand is now the ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee. \nCarl is very proud of his brother's service, as Sandy is proud of the \nservice of his brother.\n  Carl Levin has been the chair of the Armed Services Committee, which \nof course is one of the most important and powerful committees in the \nentire Congress. He is a respected voice on issues dealing with \nnational security. He has done so much to improve the status of men and \nwomen in the military for our great country.\n  The very first bill he introduced as a Senator speaks to the kind of \nperson he is and the issues he cares about. He introduced a bill to end \ndiscrimination by credit card companies. Two Congresses ago we did some \nreal good reforms during the credit card debate. Senator Levin was \ninvolved in that, as well he should have been, because he was the first \nto bring to the attention of the American people what needed to be \ndone.\n  He is also the chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, which for decades has done great work for this country. \nUnder his guidance and leadership, it has done some remarkably good \nwork. He was the one who delved deeply into the Enron collapse. Again, \nthat committee has done a lot of work on abusive credit card practices. \nIt is one of the main reasons we were able to get the credit card \nreform done.\n  He led investigations in the 2008 financial crisis. He has looked \nvery closely and did a wonderful report on what I refer to as tax \nloopholes, and I think that is how he refers to it also. He has been \none of the country's leading experts--and certainly one of the leading \nexperts in this body--of American manufacturers. We know that \nmanufacturing has had such strong forces in Michigan in years past and \nthey are coming back as a result of the work the Michigan delegation \nhas done, led by Senator Levin.\n  He is someone who understands that we have a new world, we have \nglobal markets, and we have to continue working hard to make sure we \nare a part of that, and we are.\n  He has fought to protect the Great Lakes--Michigan's signature \nnatural resource.\n  He is married to Barbara, a wonderful woman, who has been so \nthoughtful and kind to me, but especially my wife, during her recent \nillness. They have been married since 1961. They have three daughters \nand six grandchildren.\n  Carl Levin is somebody whom I so admire. He has a lot of service left \nin him. There are so many things he is capable of doing as a result of \nthe positions he now holds in the Senate. The one thing I admire so \nmuch about Carl Levin--as I have already indicated--is how strongly he \nfeels about his family. He and his brother have a piece of property in \nMichigan. They call it the tree farm. In Searchlight I still have my \nhat they gave me that says ``Tree Farm.'' He has talked to me on many \noccasions--we haven't talked lately--about how he and his brother like \nto walk on their tree farm. There is nothing there but trees, but it is \nan occasion for them to be together as brothers.\n  Congratulations to Carl Levin on reaching this impressive milestone \nof 12,000 votes. Not only has he left that mark--he left that mark in \nmy mind and anyone who has served with him--but he has left his mark as \nbeing an extraordinary man.\n\n[[Page S512]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it has been my honor to have served \nwith the senior Senator from Michigan for almost three decades now, and \nI too want to rise and congratulate him on achieving this milestone. \nThere is no Member of the Senate who is brighter or more hard working. \nWe have had a good example of that here in the last couple of months of \nSenator Levin's respect for the institution and his desire to protect \nthe traditions of this institution. I want him to know that he is \nwidely respected all throughout the Senate, and particularly on this \nside of the aisle.\n  I congratulate him for this important achievement and look forward to \nworking with him in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate my friend and \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Michigan. This is the day he has \ncast his 12,000th vote. What is most significant is not the quantity of \nhis votes, but the quality of his votes. Each one of those has had \nMichigan's face on it when he cast those votes.\n  As our majority leader indicated, Senator Levin has been a champion \nfor the automotive industry, manufacturing, his beloved Detroit, our \nbeautiful and wonderful Great Lakes, the Department of Defense and, \nmore particularly, the men and women who serve us every day.\n  I rise on behalf of everyone in Michigan to say how proud we are of \nSenator Levin. We have great confidence in his judgment, integrity, and \nhard work. In my book, there is nobody better.\n  Of course, I am very thrilled with the wonderful family he and \nBarbara have. He is ahead of me on grandchildren, but I am working on \nit. He is not only someone with the right ethics, integrity, and love \nfor his family, nobody fights harder and does the right thing for \nMichigan more than Carl Levin.\n  I join in congratulating him. Once again I want to say it is not \nabout the number of votes but the quality of votes. Every one of those \n12,000 votes has had Michigan's name on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first I want to thank my dear colleague \nfrom Michigan, Senator Stabenow. We have worked so closely together on \nMichigan issues. She is one great partner, and I am proud to represent \nMichigan with her at my side and her as a partner.\n  Talking about partners, my wife Barbara has been married to me for 51 \nyears, and she is my lifelong--excuse me. I have to straighten this \nout. My brother is my lifelong best buddy. He was there when I was \nborn. I have to modify what Senator Reid said. For the last 51 years, \nmy wife has been my best buddy, and my brother has been my second-best \nbuddy, but I am blessed with family. I would like to thank everyone for \nmentioning my family.\n  I am blessed with a staff that is led by David Lyles. I have great \nfriendships here in this body and there is no substitute for the kind \nof friendships and relationships which make this body work. Even when \nit doesn't appear to be working, it is working. I know the public gets \nfrustrated with us at times, but this is an extraordinarily resilient \nbody.\n  Many times during the 34 years I have been here there have been \nperiods when we have been frustrated in terms of getting our work done, \nbut we pull through in this wonderful, noble institution. This \nvenerable institution is being protected here by people who love it, \nand I cherish those relationships with the people who do cherish this \nbody and what it uniquely stands for in the world. There is no other \nbody like it in the world. I only wish that people such as Robert Byrd \nand Danny Inouye could live forever to help protect this body, but that \nis not the case.\n  I want to mention one other thing. I am very grateful to Senator Reid \nand Senator McConnell for their comments. I wanted to speak about \nsomething Senator McConnell referenced.\n  A few weeks ago this body did something which was very bipartisan and \nvery essential to its health and its survival, and that was to make \nsure we continue to protect the minority but not to overprotect the few \nMembers if those Members take excessive advantage of our rules.\n  Eight of us got together. Senator McCain and I pulled together three \nDemocrats and three Republicans. For many weeks we worked together, \nwithout staff, and came up with an alternative which the leaders used \nto work through this complicated situation we found ourselves in \nrelative to the rules.\n  On the Democratic side, we had Senator Schumer, Senator Cardin, and \nSenator Pryor, and on the Republican side we had Senator Alexander, \nSenator Kyl, and Senator Barrasso join Senator McCain and me. I believe \nit was one of the most important things we have done in recent years \nhere, which was to change the procedures. They were not working. They \nwere being used to frustrate efforts to get legislation to the floor.\n  We had to do that. We had to do something to change the rules which \nwere being misused in terms of postcloture hours. There were judges who \nwere going to be approved by votes of 95 to 1 or 2, and those \npostcloture hours were being used to stall the Senate. We took care of \nthat situation. We acted on a bipartisan basis, and hopefully that \nspirit of bipartisanship, which is so essential to making this place \nwork, will continue and be given a boost not just by what the leaders \nessentially did in accepting our recommendations on these procedural \nchanges but will now apply and work with other efforts that will be \nunderway in this Congress.\n  I want to mention that because eight of us, on a bipartisan basis, \ndid something which we believe very deeply about as a way of avoiding \nwhat was called the nuclear option. If that were used, it would have \nled to a change in a way which was not provided for in the rules. Under \nthe rules, this is a continuing body. If that were used, it could have \ngone around the rules and essentially put the Presiding Officer in the \nposition of ignoring the advice of our Parliamentarian and saying that \nwe could, by majority vote, do something which our rules say could only \nbe done by two-thirds of us. That would have done severe, long-lasting \ndamage to this institution. We were able to avoid that, Democrats and \nRepublicans--well beyond the eight of us--including the Presiding \nOfficer, who was so helpful to me in working through this idea and \ngiving me suggestions. I am very grateful to him for the kind of \nsuggestions and conversations we had. We were able to work through an \nissue on a bipartisan basis and then the body came together and about \n80 or more voted for these procedural changes. I thought it was a great \nday, personally. I know that. I know the eight of us feel very strongly \nabout the important contribution we made to this body, working \ntogether. So we feel very good about it. I hope over time some of the \npeople who were critical of it will see it as being a significant \nadvance in making this body work better, allowing us to work our will. \nI wanted to mention that because it was mentioned by one of our \nleaders--Senator McConnell--and I know Senator Reid worked so closely \nwith him and his staff, and they helped us through a very difficult \nsituation which would have, if not resolved on a bipartisan basis, \ncreated some real problems for the ongoing operations of this body.\n\n  So I thank our leaders. I thank Senator Reid, of course, who is such \na dear friend, and I thank him for not just mentioning my beloved wife \nBarbara but also my brother Sandy.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Keystone XL Pipeline\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Keystone XL \nPipeline project.\n  Gas prices are now about $3.50--actually, $3.53--a gallon, which is \nup over 90 percent since President Obama took office. Economic activity \nfor the fourth quarter of 2012 declined by one-tenth of 1 percent. It \nwas projected to go up by about 1 to 1.2 percent, and actually it \ndeclined by one-tenth of 1 percent.\n\n[[Page S513]]\n\nStill, the President refuses to approve a multibillion-dollar project--\nthe Keystone XL Pipeline--that will provide energy, create jobs, \ngenerate tax revenue, and help reduce our dependence on oil from the \nMiddle East. He is still delaying even though every State on the \npipeline route has consented to the project. So every single State on \nthe route has approved the project and will have better environmental \nstewardship with the project than without it. Let me repeat that. Every \nState on the route has approved the project and will have better \nenvironmental stewardship with the project than without it, and yet the \nPresident continues to delay.\n  Let me elaborate. Recently, a group of 53 Senators, both Republicans \nand Democrats, signed a letter that I helped organize to President \nObama asking him to approve without delay the Keystone XL Pipeline \nproject. The letter was signed by a majority of the Senate within just \n1 day--1 day--of Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman's approval of a new \nroute through his State of Nebraska. The new path addressed Nebraska's \nconcerns about the route, as well as the President's, by circumventing \nthe environmentally sensitive Sandhills region, effectively removing \nthe last obstacle to approval.\n  Prior to sending this letter, in November Senator Max Baucus and \nmyself organized a similar letter--that was in November--signed by nine \nRepublican Senators and nine Democratic Senators asking to meet with \nthe President to discuss the many benefits that accrue to our Nation by \nbuilding the Keystone XL Pipeline. Now, let me read that letter. It is \nvery short.\n\n       With the elections of 2012 behind us, we write to remind \n     you of the continuing importance of the Keystone XL Pipeline. \n     We want to work together to keep creating jobs, and Keystone \n     XL is one vital piece of the puzzle. We would like to meet \n     with you in the near future to discuss this important \n     project.\n       Setting politics aside, nothing has changed about the \n     thousands of jobs that Keystone XL will create. Nothing has \n     changed about the energy security to be gained through an \n     important addition to the existing pipeline network built \n     with sound environmental stewardship and the best modern \n     technology. Nothing has changed about the security to be \n     gained from using more fuel produced at home and by a close \n     and stable ally. And nothing has changed about the need for \n     America to remain a place where businesses still build \n     things.\n       We hope that you will follow through on your directive of \n     March 22, 2012, to Federal agencies to move forward vital \n     energy infrastructure like Keystone XL. The state of Nebraska \n     is nearing completion of the new pipeline route within \n     Nebraska. With that process near completion, we look forward \n     to an affirmative determination of national interest soon.\n\n  We sent that letter to the President in November--a bipartisan \nletter, nine Republican Senators, nine Democratic Senators. To date, we \nhave received no direct response from the White House despite the fact \nthat there is clearly strong bipartisan support for the project.\n  The only response we received was not from the White House but, \nrather, from the State Department. Let me read that letter. It is very \nshort too. It is from David S. Adams, Assistant Secretary of \nLegislative Affairs at the U.S. Department of State. Basically, it \nsays:\n\n       Thank you for your November 16 letter to President Obama \n     concerning the status of the administration's review of \n     TransCanada's new application for a Presidential Permit for \n     the proposed Keystone XL pipeline project. We have been asked \n     to respond on behalf of the President.\n\n  The letter then kind of goes: Yes, we recognize it is an important \nproject. We are looking at it. We are doing some more draft \nsupplemental reviews, and we hope this information is helpful to you. \nPlease do not hesitate to contact us if we can be of further \nassistance.\n  That is the extent of the response.\n  So it has now been more than 4\\1/2\\ years since the permit \napplications were submitted to the State Department for this vital \nenergy project. Yet, even with an exhaustive review process, the \nconsent now of every State along the route, the backing of a majority \nof Congress, and the support of the American people, the Keystone XL \nPipeline project is still languishing at the hands of the President of \nthe United States--after 4\\1/2\\ years.\n  Let me expand on the point about all of the States on the route \napproving the project. After Governor Heineman, on behalf of the State \nof Nebraska, sent a letter to the President approving the project, \nwhich happened just several weeks ago, after I worked with Senator \nBaucus and others to get 53 Senators in 1 day on a letter saying to the \nPresident, let's get this approved, the Governors along the route also \nsent a letter to the President saying, hey, let's approve the project.\n  So now you have every single State saying--every single State on the \nroute saying: Hey, fine, let's do the project--every single one.\n  Here is the letter. It also includes the Honorable Brad Wall, the \nPremier of Saskatchewan. The pipeline passes through Saskatchewan as \nwell. I am not going to read the whole letter but just a few excerpts.\n\n       Dear Mr. President:\n       As you begin your second term, we are writing to \n     respectfully urge you to move forward on the Keystone XL \n     Pipeline project.\n       The energy relationship between the United States and \n     Canada is vital to the future of both our countries. It is an \n     interest we share, transcending political lines and \n     geographic boundaries.\n\n  The letter goes on and talks about how the project is crucial to U.S. \nenergy security, working with Canada for our energy rather than getting \nit from the Middle East.\n  The letter talks about ``thousands of jobs'' the project creates not \nonly building this $7 billion pipeline but then all the jobs that go to \nthe refineries and the other activities that go with it. And it talks \nabout safety, efficiency, and reliability.\n  The letter concludes:\n\n       Mr. President, we consider the Keystone XL Pipeline \n     fundamentally important to the future economic prosperity of \n     both the United States and Canada.\n       We strongly urge you to issue a Presidential Permit and act \n     swiftly to approve the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\n  It is signed by Governors--now, remember, Senator Baucus and I have \nbeen working on this on behalf of Montana. You have Nebraska here. \nGovernor Heineman just sent in a letter. Here are some of the other \nGovernors on this letter: Gov. Sam Brownback from Kansas, Gov. Jack \nDalrymple from North Dakota, Gov. Dennis Daugaard from South Dakota, \nGov. Mary Fallin from Oklahoma, Gov. Rick Perry from Texas, in addition \nto other Governors who are not on the route, such as Gov. Butch Otter \nof Idaho, Gov. Brian Sandoval of Nevada, Gov. Matt Mead of Wyoming, \nGov. Jan Brewer of Arizona--Republicans and Democrats.\n  But the point is that on the whole route, all the Governors have \nwritten and said: Hey, let's do this. Let's do it.\n  So what is going on here? Why does the President continue to delay \nthe project?\n  The long wait for approval is dismaying enough, but it represents a \nlarger issue for our Nation and begs a bigger question for \npolicyholders: How will America ever build an ``all of the above'' \nenergy policy if the President takes nearly 5 years to approve one \npiece of an inclusive plan, particularly, as I say, after everybody on \nthe route has said: Hey, can we do this after 5 years, please. Can we \nmove forward, Mr. President?\n  To account briefly, this $7 billion, 1,700-mile, high-tech pipeline \nwill carry oil not only from Alberta, Canada, to refineries in Oklahoma \nand the Texas gulf coast, but it will also carry growing quantities of \nU.S. sweet crude from the Bakken oilfields in North Dakota and Montana. \nEven by modest estimates, it will create tens of thousands of jobs, \nboost the American economy, and raise much needed revenues for State \nand Federal governments. We have a deficit. Here is a project to get \nsubstantial tax revenue without raising taxes, through economic \nactivity, through job creation.\n  Further, and perhaps most importantly, it will help put our country \nwithin striking range of a long-sought goal: true energy security. For \nthe first time in generations, the United States, with its friend and \nally Canada, will have the capacity to produce more energy than we use, \nreducing or eliminating our reliance on the Middle East and other \nvolatile parts of the world.\n  The argument has been advanced that the oil sands will increase \ncarbon emissions and that failing to build the Keystone XL will somehow \nreduce emissions. But let's look at that claim. That is the other \npiece. Let's look at the environmental aspects of this project.\n  Today, more than 80 percent of all new recovery in the oil sands is \nbeing accomplished ``in situ,'' a technology\n\n[[Page S514]]\n\nthat makes the oil sands' carbon footprint comparable to conventional \ndrilling. In fact, the oil sands industry has reduced greenhouse gas \nemissions per barrel of oil produced by an average of 26 percent since \n1990, with some facilities achieving reductions as high as 50 percent. \nToday, heavy crude oil from the Middle East and even from California \nproduces more carbon emissions over its life cycle than the Canadian \noil sands. Let me repeat that. Today, heavy crude that we import from \nthe Middle East and even some of the California heavy crude produce \nmore carbon emissions over their life cycle than Canadian oil sands.\n  We also need to factor in that if the pipeline is not built from \nAlberta to the United States, a similar pipeline will be built to \nCanada's Pacific coast. That is what I show right here on this chart. \nFrom there, the oil will be shipped across the Pacific Ocean, a much \nlarger, sensitive ecosystem than the Sandhills--which we are not even \ngoing through now--to be refined at facilities in China with weaker \nenvironmental standards and more emissions than facilities in the \nUnited States. The United States, moreover, will continue to import oil \nfrom the Middle East, again, on tankers. Factor in the cost of trucking \nand railing the product to market overland, and the result, contrary to \nthe claims of opponents, will be more emissions and a less secure \ndistribution system without the Keystone XL Pipeline project.\n  Think about it. So we say: OK, we are not going to have this \npipeline, even though we have built other pipelines already. We are not \ngoing to get oil from Canada. What happens? That oil goes to China, \nwith higher emissions. You are going to take it across the ocean, which \nis a greater risk than putting it in a pipeline. You are going to have \nit refined in refineries in China, which have much worse emissions \nstandards than our own. And guess what we get to do. Let's see, we do \nnot get the jobs. We do not get the tax revenues. Do you know what we \ndo get to do? We get to continue to import our oil from the Middle \nEast. How does that sound? Is that a good idea with what is going on in \nIran and with what is going on in Egypt and with what is going on in \nSyria--the risk that the Strait of Hormuz could be blockaded or that \nyou could have further conflict over there that could cut off oil \nsupplies? Is that what the American people want? They want to continue \nto get oil from the Middle East rather than our closest friend and \nally, Canada? The American people would rather that oil go to China? Of \ncourse not. And that is what we are talking about with this project.\n\n  Well, that raises another important point. The administration's own \nState Department completed its 3-year National Environmental Protection \nAct--NEPA--review of the Keystone XL project back in 2011 and \ndetermined that ``there would be no significant impacts'' on the \nenvironment. That is what the administration determined in their own \nNEPA process.\n  And that raises another point. The White House says: Well, we do not \nwant to get ahead of the process. But the President effectively \nabandoned the process more than a year ago when he halted the project \nby Executive action. Had he not, the State Department, in keeping with \nthe usual process, would have issued a decision on the permit--after 4 \nyears--by December 2011, according to a letter Secretary Clinton sent \nto me in August 2011.\n  I have worked toward approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline--first as \nthe Governor of North Dakota and now as a Senator--because I believe it \nis just the kind of project that will grow our economy and create the \njobs our country so desperately needs, and it will do so with good \nenvironmental stewardship. At the same time, it will reduce our \ndependence on the Middle East for oil, which is what the American \npeople have desired for decades. The Keystone XL Pipeline project is \nlong overdue. For the benefit of our economy, our environment, and our \nlong-term energy security, President Obama needs to approve it now, \nwithout further delay.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for several minutes on another \ntopic in regard to a recipient of the Medal of Honor from my State of \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n             Tribute to Army Staff Sergeant Clinton Romesha\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of our Nation's \ntrue heroes--Army SSG Clinton Romesha.\n  On Monday the President will present Sergeant Romesha with our \ncountry's highest military award--the Medal of Honor--for ``acts of \ngallantry . . . above and beyond the call of duty.''\n  Clint comes from a long line of military heroes. His father is a \nveteran of the Vietnam war. His grandfather fought in the U.S. Army \nduring World War II. Romesha often cites his grandfather as his \ngreatest hero, so it was not surprising that Clint followed his example \nand joined the Army in 1999.\n  Staff Sergeant Romesha showed courage every day that he donned his \nArmy uniform but especially on October 3, 2009, one of the deadliest \ndays of the war in Afghanistan. On that day hundreds of Taliban \nfighters ambushed American Combat Outpost Keating from all sides with \ngrenades, machine guns, mortars, and rifles. Heavily outnumbered, Clint \nRomesha and his fellow soldiers quickly fought back in what would turn \nout to be a deadly daylong battle.\n  Sergeant Romesha fought valiantly. He darted into danger to draw out \nthe enemy many times. He himself took out a machine gun team. Staff \nSergeant Romesha was working to take out a second when he was wounded \nby shrapnel from an exploding grenade.\n  His Medal of Honor citation reads:\n\n       Undeterred by his injuries, Staff Sergeant Romesha \n     continued to fight and upon the arrival of another soldier to \n     aid him and the assistant gunner, he again rushed through the \n     exposed avenue to assemble additional soldiers.\n       With complete disregard for his own safety, he continually \n     exposed himself to heavy enemy fire as he moved confidently \n     about the battlefield engaging and destroying multiple enemy \n     targets.\n\n  Staff Sergeant Romesha exemplified the valor that President Theodore \nRoosevelt--also a Medal of Honor recipient--spoke of when he said: \n``Courage is not having the strength to go on; it is going on when you \ndon't have the strength.''\n  Despite his wounds, Sergeant Romesha never stopped fighting. He \nstayed in the battle--leading his team, directing air support, \nprotecting wounded soldiers, and helping to recover the bodies of his \nfallen friends.\n  The battle lasted for 12 hours. Eight soldiers lost their lives, and \n22 were wounded--a fact that Romesha humbly reminds us of whenever his \nbravery is touted.\n  In fact, Sergeant Romesha said:\n\n       What I got injured with was nothing. I have buddies who \n     lost their eyesight, who lost limbs. For that, I would rather \n     give them all the credit they deserve for the sacrifices they \n     made. For me, it was nothing.\n\n  To Sergeant Romesha, it was just doing his job. To the rest of us, he \nis a true example of courage and selfless sacrifice. He went above and \nbeyond the call of duty, repeatedly risking his life to defend his post \nand, more importantly, to help his fellow soldiers. We are grateful for \nhis service and for his example to us all.\n  Today, Clint resides in Minot, ND, where he and his wife Tamara are \nraising their three children. I am certain he is every much the hero \nand inspiration to them that his own grandfather was to him.\n  My wife Mikey and I join our fellow North Dakotans and Americans in \nhonoring Sergeant Romesha for his heroic and selfless service. We thank \nhim for his exemplary actions on that dangerous day in Afghanistan and \nevery day he served our great country.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/07/senate-section/article/S514-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S514-S515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, there was a lot of attention recently on \nthe French military's operation to repel Islamic extremists and Tuareg \nnationalist rebels who had terrorized the local population of northern \nMali, including in the ancient city of Timbuktu. That operation was \nwidely welcomed by local Malian citizens and the international \ncommunity. Many of the rebels are believed to be hiding out among the \nlocal population until the French soldiers leave, so whether they are \nultimately vanquished remains to be seen. It will depend in large \nmeasure on the longer term capability of a multinational force of \nAfrican troops supported by the United States and others.\n  Besides terrorizing, torturing, mutilating, and slaughtering innocent \npeople, the rebels destroyed ancient tombs, shrines, and manuscripts \ndating to a period many centuries ago when Timbuktu was a crossroads \nfor commerce and a center of intellectual pursuits in northern Africa. \nI mention this not only to inform those who may be unaware of Mali's \nongoing cultural importance, but also to call attention to the fact \nthat Irina Bokova, Director General of the United Nations Educational, \nScientific, and Cultural Organization, commonly known as UNESCO, has \nalready pledged to reconstruct the damaged mausoleums. As she was \nquoted in the New York Times on February 4, 2013, ``This is the record \nof the golden ages of the Malian empire. If you let this disappear, it \nwould be a crime against humanity.''\n  There are also little known heroes in this otherwise humanitarian and \ncultural disaster. Malian residents, particularly Ali Iman Ben \nEssayouti, who knew the importance of priceless manuscripts preserved \nin a library funded by international donors, including the Library of \nCongress and Department of State, managed to carefully move some of \nthem to another location where the rebels did not find them. As a \nresult, although the rebels burned the library, only a small portion of \nthe manuscripts were destroyed.\n  The other point of this is that, as many Senators are aware, the \nUnited States, once the largest contributor to UNESCO, including under \nPresident George W. Bush, was forced to sever its support last year due \nto a 1990s law that prohibits U.S. funding to any United Nations-\naffiliated agency in which the Palestinian Liberation Organization, \nPLO, obtains the same standing as a member state. After UNESCO's \nmembers voted, against the advice of Ms. Bokova, to grant the PLO that \nstanding, the law was triggered and U.S. funding abruptly ended.\n  This is illogical and self-defeating. First, although the PLO was a \nterrorist organization in the 1990s, it is no longer. Second, by \ncutting off our contribution to UNESCO we not only empower its other \nmembers, including Russia, Iran, and Syria, we also make it impossible \nto assist the organization in the kind of cultural preservation \nactivities it is now undertaking in Mali, which are clearly in the \nnational interest of the United States. There are many other examples, \nincluding World Heritage Sites like the Great Barrier Reef, which \nUNESCO designates and protects today without the support of the United \nStates. Finally, if U.S. funding is not restored before the end of this \nfiscal year, we will lose our vote in the organization.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mark \nSullivan, who is retiring from his position as Director of the United \nStates Secret Service on February 22, 2013.\n  Serving as Director for nearly 7 years, and working for five \nPresidents, Mark Sullivan leaves his mark on the agency by achieving \nsuch benchmarks as the Secret Service Uniformed Division Modernization \nAct, and the Former Presidents Protection Act. He also oversaw the \ncomplete overhaul of the Secret Service IT Modernization and Operation \nMission Support, which enhanced White House security. He led the effort \nto create the National Computer Forensic Institute in Hoover, AL, and \nestablished numerous overseas field offices to build partnerships \nbetween all levels of law enforcement.\n  Mark Sullivan began his distinguished 30-year career with the Secret \nService as a special agent assigned to the Detroit Field Office in \n1983. In 1990, Mr. Sullivan was transferred to the Fraud Division in \nWashington, DC, where he coordinated and monitored multi-jurisdictional \ncriminal investigations involving credit card fraud, bank fraud, and \nother criminal activity. In 1991, Mr. Sullivan received his first \nassignment to the Presidential Protective Division, where he served 4 \nyears.\n  In 1996, Mr. Sullivan was selected as Assistant Special Agent in \nCharge of the Office of Protective Operations. He returned to the field \nin 1997 as the Resident Agent in Charge of the Columbus Resident \nOffice, which oversaw all Secret Service activities in Central Ohio. \nTwenty months later, Mr. Sullivan was promoted back to Washington, DC \nas Deputy Special Agent in Charge of the Counterfeit Division, where he \nmanaged the agency's investigative activities related to the criminal \nproduction and distribution of counterfeit currency and other financial \ninstruments. In July of 1999, he returned to the Presidential \nProtective Division as an Assistant Special Agent in Charge.\n  Mr. Sullivan was promoted into the Federal Senior Executive Service \nin July, 2000, when he was selected as a Deputy Assistant Director in \nthe Office of Protective Operations. In 2002, he was reassigned to the \nposition of Deputy Special Agent in Charge of the Vice Presidential \nProtective Division. A year later, he was reassigned to the position of \nDeputy Assistant Director of the Office of Human Resources and \nTraining. He next served as Assistant Director for the Office of \nProtective Operations, where he oversaw all protective activities for \nthe agency, encompassing 12 divisions and 2,300 employees.\n  Mr. Sullivan was named Deputy Director in January, 2006 and on May \n31, 2006, he was sworn in as the 22nd Director of the U.S. Secret \nService.\n  Prior to joining the Secret Service, Mr. Sullivan spent 3 years as a \nspecial agent in the Office of the Inspector General for the Department \nof Housing and Urban Development.\n  Mark Sullivan has received numerous awards for superior performance \nthroughout his 34-year career in Federal law enforcement. In 2010 he \nwas recognized by President Obama as the recipient of the Distinguished \nPresidential Rank Award, which he also received in 2005 from then \nPresident George W. Bush. Mr. Sullivan is to be honored for his \ndedication and commitment to public service, devoting his life to the \nsafety of our first families, our Nation's leaders, and the general \npublic. He has been a steadfast partner to the legislative branch, \nassisting with State of the Union addresses, Inaugurals and other joint \npartnerships. He will be greatly missed here in the Capitol and we wish \nhim well in his future endeavors.\n  A native of Arlington, MA, Mr. Sullivan, who is from a large Irish \nCatholic family, received his bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice \nfrom Saint Anselm College in Manchester, NH. He and his wife of 26 \nyears, Laurie have three daughters, one of which, Lauren, has followed \nin her father's footsteps by entering public service after graduating \nfrom college. She has worked for the Senate Sergeant Arms for over 3 \nyears. A former boss once said of Sullivan, ``If you were casting \nsomeone for the role of director of the Secret Service, he looks the \npart. He's a tall, handsome Irishman, with grey hair and the demeanor \nof a born leader.'' I join with my colleagues from both sides of the\n\n[[Page S516]]\n\naisle in thanking Director Sullivan for his outstanding service to our \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/07/senate-section/article/S516-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING CARDISS COLLINS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, I want to pay tribute to an \nexceptional, Illinoisan who passed away this weekend.\n  Congresswoman Cardiss Collins served my State and the city of Chicago \nwith distinction for more than two decades, and I was honored to have \nserved with her in the House.\n  Representative Collins did not plan for a political life. She was an \naccountant and a mother. But when her husband, Congressman George \nCollins, died in a place crash, Cardiss was convinced to run in a \nspecial election to succeed him. And she won, becoming the first \nAfrican American woman elected to Congress from Illinois.\n  When she arrived in Washington, she learned the job quickly and \nbecame a leader on a variety of issues--from women's rights, to \nchildren's rights, to healthcare. Her colleagues quickly recognized her \nleadership qualities. After just a few terms, they elected her \nchairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus. She also soon became the \nfirst African American woman to be elected Democratic Majority Whip At-\nLarge.\n  I am glad that I had the chance to get to know Cardiss Collins. I--\nand countless Illinoisans--will remember her fighting spirit, her \nconviction in what was right and, of course, her sense of humor.\n  In 1993, a newly elected Illinois Senator by the name of Carol \nMoseley-Braun had decided--along with Senator Barbara Mikulski--to do \nsomething no woman had ever done on the Senate floor: wear pants, \ninstead of a dress or skirt. At the time, women were actually \nprohibited by the Senate rules from wearing trousers. And these \nSenators' decision ruffled a few feathers around here.\n  Well, this didn't sit right with Congresswoman Collins, and she had \nsomething to say about it. What she said was, ``They shouldn't be \nconcerned about the dress code, unless the men Senators start wearing \ndresses.''\n  Soon after, the Senate amended its rules.\n  Congresswoman Collins played a part in tearing down that barrier, \njust as she did for so many other barriers and inequalities for women \nand minorities across the country. That is the kind of person she was: \na fighter.\n  I will close by simply acknowledging for all the good she did, both \nhere in Congress and back home in Chicago, fighting the good fight. \nCongresswoman Cardiss Collins will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/07/senate-section/article/S516-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JIM MOLINARI\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the service \nof one of the Senate's most dedicated, loyal and capable employees, \nJames J. Molinari.\n  Jim has served as my State director for more than a decade, but his \npublic service began many years ago.\n  In 1967, Jim began his 45-year career in public service when he \nbecame a patrol officer with the San Francisco Police Department.\n  For 27 years he rose through the ranks of the police department, and \nhe did it all. From street patrol to investigations, undercover \nassignment to a Federal liaison, Jim was given the responsibilities.\n  From 1977 through 1986, during my tenure as mayor of San Francisco, \nJim was a senior staff member in the mayor's office. He was responsible \nfor security for both the mayor and visiting dignitaries, and he served \nas my advisor on law enforcement matters.\n  Jim was at my side for many of the most significant moments of my \nservice as mayor.\n  We hosted two Super Bowl parades in 1982 and 1985, the 1984 \nDemocratic National Convention, and even visits by the Pope and the \nQueen of England.\n  I still remember those days, and I am happy that Jim was there to \nshare them with me.\n  In 1992 he became a captain and commanding officer of the Planning \nand Research Division.\n  I have no doubt that Jim would have kept climbing the ladder in the \nPolice Department, but in 1994 I helped convince him that his talents \nwere suitable for a larger stage and that he would make a fine U.S. \nMarshal.\n  On February 11, 1994, President Clinton appointed Jim the United \nStates Marshal for the Northern District of California.\n  Jim served as a Marshal for 7 years, during which time he was \nresponsible for the administration of Federal law enforcement for 15 \nnorthern California counties, or about 12 million people.\n  He oversaw a $35 million budget and had a staff of about 130.\n  In 2001, Jim decided to focus his experience on counternarcotics and \nbecame director of the San Francisco Bay Area High Intensity Drug \nTrafficking Area. As executive director, he oversaw coordination and \nimplementation of the agency's programs and initiatives.\n  In 2002, I convinced Jim to return to my office as State director.\n  As State director, Jim advises around 30 employees and oversees \noperations in my four State offices, in San Francisco, Los Angeles, San \nDiego and Fresno.\n  It is an understatement for me to call Jim one of my most trusted \npublic policy and legislative advisors.\n  I don't know if it's his roots as a police officer or his Italian \nsensibilities, but Jim is practical, he cuts through the red tape and \nhe calls it how he sees it.\n  Jim is a real 10.\n  Mr. President, I ask that you and all of our colleagues join in \nthanking Jim Molinari for his years of service, not only to the Senate \nbut to the State of California and the Nation.\n  We wish him a wonderful retirement and want him to know we all \nappreciate his service and friendship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/07/senate-section/article/S516-3", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S516-S517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CELEBRATING BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, for more than 150 years, \nleaders from President Abraham Lincoln to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. \nhave challenged us to keep faith with the true spirit of our \nConstitution. Today we continue the work of these two dynamic men who \ncourageously led the charge--during times of national division and \ncivil strife--in pursuing a more perfect union where all Americans are \ntruly free and have equal access to opportunity.\n  As we celebrate Black History Month this year, I am honored to \nreflect on the historical and everyday contributions of African-\nAmericans to the State of Colorado and to our country. Their efforts to \nensure equality for all Americans are tightly woven into the fabric of \nour ever-evolving Nation.\n  Last month, millions of Americans and I watched as President Barack \nObama took the oath for his second Presidential term. And for the first \ntime in our Nation's history, there are two African-American U.S. \nSenators serving at the same time--Senators Tim Scott of South Carolina \nand Mo Cowan of Massachusetts. Following the 2012 elections, Colorado \ncelebrated a record number of African-American lawmakers in the \nColorado House of Representatives, known as the ``historic five'' who \nare paving the way for more diversity. I also am proud of how our State \nset the precedent for the country 4 years ago, when two African-\nAmerican lawmakers, Rep. Terrance Carroll and Senator Peter Groff, held \nthe top leadership roles in the Colorado General Assembly. These public \nservants were role models and leaders on so many important issues--one \nof which was pushing hard to create educational opportunities for all \nColoradans.\n  Creating opportunity through education is critical, and as we work to \nclose achievement and economic opportunity gaps throughout our State \nand country, I would like to pay homage to two of Colorado's African-\nAmerican pioneers who have worked tirelessly to guarantee equal access \nto quality education for all Coloradans.\n  Omar D. Blair, a member of the Tuskegee Airmen in the 1940s, served \nas the first African-American president of the Denver Board of \nEducation and went on to become the first African-American president of \nthe Colorado Association of School Boards. During his tenure as \npresident of the Denver Board of Education, Blair championed quality \neducation and led the city through the controversial desegregation of \nits public schools.\n  Rachel B. Noel, known as the lion of the African-American civil \nrights movement in Denver, became the first African-American elected to \nthe Denver Board of Education and was also\n\n[[Page S517]]\n\nthe first African-American woman elected to office in Colorado. On \nApril 25, 1968, Noel spearheaded a resolution to integrate Denver's \npublic schools. Despite the school board's decision to overturn the \nresolution in 1969, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed Noel's historic \nresolution in its 1973 decision, Keyes v. Denver Public Schools No. 1.\n  These exceptional Coloradans changed the way we educate our youth and \nsupported access to opportunity for all. But while we have seen \nprogress, there is still much work to do.\n  In this rapidly changing world where we increasingly rely on \ntechnology, we must provide our youth with the math and science skills \nthey need to become leaders and keep our Nation on the cutting edge of \ninnovation and ingenuity. That is why I stand with President Obama and \nGov. Hickenlooper in supporting science, technology, engineering and \nmathematics, STEM, education programs to provide our youth with viable \npathways to academic and professional success. With a strong investment \nin STEM programs, and by ensuring Colorado's students continue to have \naccess to language and arts education, we will give our students the \ntools they need to be successful in the 21st century.\n  From Colorado's earliest days as a western territory to the present, \nAfrican-American community leaders and public servants have been a \ndriving force in transforming the works and vision of our Founding \nFathers into reality. I am humbled and inspired by their commitment to \npushing our country to reach its fullest potential. I will continue to \ndo my part to honor African-Americans' legacy of triumph over \nchallenge. I hope you will join me in doing the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/07/senate-section/article/S517-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN.

Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the 20th \nAnniversary of the enactment of The Family and Medical Leave Act, FMLA. \nFor 20 years, this historic law has helped individuals balance their \nfamily and work obligations. As a husband, and the father of three \ndaughters, the flexibility to care for your family and children without \nthe fear of losing your job is invaluable.\n  The passage of the FMLA represented a broad, bipartisan Congressional \neffort to improve working conditions for American families. Since the \nFMLA was signed into law by President Clinton in 1993, workers have \nused it more than 100 million times to take job-protected leave. Under \nthe FMLA, an employee may take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for the \nbirth or adoption of a child or placement of a foster child. An \nemployee can also use the FMLA to care for a spouse, child or parent \nsuffering from a serious health condition.\n  At the core of the FMLA is the concept of flexibility. And that \nidea--not just flexibility in taking leave, but flexibility across the \nboard, in all facets of the workplace experience--is something we must \nstrive for in today's office environment. We must allow our workers to \nbe productive and commit themselves to their jobs, while also allowing \nthem to be great parents.\n  In my home State of Colorado, we have expanded the benefits under the \nFMLA by adopting two additional State leave policies--Domestic Abuse \nLeave and Colorado Small Necessities Leave. Under Domestic Abuse Leave, \nemployees who are victims of domestic violence and sexual assault may \ntake leave in order to seek various medical and legal services. \nColorado Small Necessities Leave allows workers to take 18 hours of \nunpaid annual leave each school year in order to participate in their \nchildren's school activities, including attending parent/teacher \nconferences.\n  Despite the vast improvements in practices since the enactment of the \nFMLA, our country still has a ways to go. Most part-time workers and \nnearly half of full-time workers are not eligible for leave under FMLA. \nAnd millions of employees who are eligible cannot afford to take unpaid \nleave. With this is mind, this law must not be considered an end, but \ninstead a first step in the right direction--there is room for \nimprovement. For example, we should consider expanding the definition \nof a family to include members of the LGBT community.\n  But it is a worthwhile start, and so again, I would like to take this \nopportunity to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the FMLA. I hope we \ncan use the upcoming session of Congress to look for ways to strengthen \nthis important law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/07/senate-section/article/S517-3", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO VINNIE BAIOCCHETTI\n\n Ms. AYOTTE.

He helped build houses for \nhomeless Rhode Islanders, and he helped preserve Rhode Island's \nhistoric buildings. He volunteered at and helped lead the State's \nlargest soup kitchen, and he emceed concerts for and helped lead the \nStone Soup Folks Arts Foundation. He served in the Navy, and he \nprotested against war.\n  Richard worked to improve our country, promoting third-party \npolitics. He was the Citizens Party candidate for Vice President in \n1984, and was a central figure in the founding of the Green Party. \nRichard worked to improve our world, documenting movements for \nindependence in Africa and heading up educational and medical \ninitiatives in Central America.\n  Richard was known for his hospitality. Every year he welcomed \nhundreds of friends and strangers to his home on Pawtuxet Cove in \nWarwick for a combination birthday party/folk music jam. And he was \nknown for his generosity. He asked his guests to donate to one of his \nfavorite causes instead of bringing gifts.\n  One of the many social welfare organizations that benefitted from \nRichard's passion and brilliance was the George Wiley Center, a \ngrassroots antipoverty nonprofit. In 2008, the Center asked Richard to \ncompose its statement of philosophy. It begins like this:\n\n       The George Wiley Center is, in the short term, ``a voice \n     for the voiceless,'' but our enduring task is to help them \n     find their own voice, to speak out for their own legitimate \n     basic needs and not let those in power treat them as \n     powerless, for they are not powerless once they recognize \n     that their numbers count, that their voices count, that their \n     moral worth as human beings, as residents of the United \n     States, counts.\n\n  Richard's allies would attest that this was indeed his own \nphilosophy, lived out each day of his life. Richard will be missed by \nmany, including his children, Cathy and Richard. But his legacy of \njustice, compassion, and empowerment will be felt by many, for years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/07/senate-section/article/S518-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/07/senate-section/article/S518-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the presiding officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/07/senate-section/article/S518-3", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:34 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 225.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to permit \ncertain retired members of the uniformed services who have a service-\nconnected disability to receive both disability compensation from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs for their disability and either retired \npay by reason of their years of military service or Combat-Related \nSpecial Compensation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of our Nation's \ndisabled veterans to once again discuss an end to an unjust and \noutdated policy known as ``concurrent receipt.'' For the past 122 \nyears, this practice has prevented veterans from receiving the full \nbenefits earned through years of service and personal injury in defense \nof our Nation. The law requires that a retired disabled veteran reduce \ntheir retirement pay dollar-for-dollar by the amount of any disability \ncompensation received, in many cases wiping out retirement pay \naltogether. This is simply wrong.\n  I have worked over the past decade to fight to change this outdated \npolicy and commend the progress Congress has made on behalf of our \nNation's veterans. In 2002, I was pleased that Congress passed a \nmeasure known as combat-related special compensation, or CSRC, allowing \nfor disabled retired veterans to receive payments that are the \nfinancial equivalent of concurrent receipt. In 2003 I was pleased that \nCongress enacted a 10-year phase-in of concurrent receipt for military \nretirees whose disability is 50 percent or greater, and in 2004, \nCongress eliminated the 10-year waiting period for those veterans with \n100 percent service-related disability. Moreover, in 2008, concurrent \nreceipt eligibility was expanded to include those who are 100 percent \ndisabled due to un-employability and extended equivalent financial \npayments to those who are medically retired or have retired prematurely \ndue to force reduction programs. Most recently, in 2012, I was pleased \nto offer an amendment to the fiscal year 2013 National Defense \nAuthorization Act ensuring that our combat-disabled military retirees \nreceive proper combat-related disability and retirement benefits by \neliminating the ``glitch'' in the CRSC formula that can actually cause \na reduction in their compensation amount when the VA increases their \ndisability rating. While I am proud that the 10-year phase-in period \nfor veterans who are rated 50-90 percent will finally come to fruition \nthis year, I still believe that Congress has fallen short of meeting \nthe commitment of providing full concurrent receipt to all of our \nNation's heroes. This is unacceptable and that is why we have to take \ncare of the hundreds of thousands of disabled veterans who still need \nour help.\n  For me, this is a simple matter of fairness. No other Federal retiree \nis forced to forfeit their retirement--only our disabled military \nretirees. Veterans' disability compensation is recompense for pain, \nsuffering, and lost future earning power caused by a service-connected \nillness or injury. Few retirees can afford to live on their retired pay \nalone, and a severe disability only makes the problem worse by limiting \nor denying any post-service working life. There is no reason to deny \nveterans who have served their country honorably the right to the full \nvalue of their retirement pay simply because their service also led to \ndisability.\n  Today I reintroduce the Retired Pay Restoration Act of 2013 in order \nto eliminate all restrictions to concurrent receipt. I hope my Senate \ncolleagues will join me in supporting this bill. We must take action \nnow and support the veterans who have given so much to our grateful \nNation. This is the right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 234\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the Harriet Tubman National Historical \nPark in Auburn, New York, and the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad \nNational Historical Park in Caroline, Dorchester, and Talbot Counties, \nMaryland, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, as we start Black History Month, I rise \ntoday to discuss a national hero that I have spoken about many times on \nthe Senate floor. 2013 is a particularly remarkable year for Harriet \nRoss Tubman in that March 13, 2013 will mark the 100th anniversary of \nher death. This noteworthy anniversary makes it all the more \nappropriate for me to talk about Maryland's Harriet Ross Tubman and her \ndedication to justice, equality and service to this country. It is also \nwhy it is important for Congress to take action this year on The \nHarriet Tubman National Historical Park and The Harriet Tubman \nUnderground Railroad National Historical Park Act that I am \nreintroducing today.\n  In my career, I have spoken on the Senate Floor, at events in \nMaryland, in meetings with constituents and with my colleagues about \nHarriet Tubman's legacy. While I hope each opportunity I have taken to \ndiscuss the life of this remarkable woman helps raise awareness about \nher importance to the history of our great Nation, my ultimate goal is \nto properly commemorate her life and her work by establishing the \nHarriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park on the \nEastern Shore of Maryland and, in working with my colleagues from New \nYork, also establish the Harriet Tubman National Historical Park in \nAuburn, NY.\n  For the last 5 years I have championed the legislation I am \nreintroducing today. I appreciate the active support and work my \ncosponsors of this bill, Senators Mikulski, Schumer and Gillibrand have \nput into advancing this bill through the Senate. We all share a deep \nappreciation for how important establishing these parks is to \npreserving the legacy of this remarkable historical figure in American \nHistory but also to how important these parks will be to the \ncommunities where they will be located.\n  I also greatly appreciate the support this legislation has received \nin the Senate Energy and Natural Resource Committee. In the last \nCongress, the bill was reported out of committee with bi-partisan \nsupport including the support of Chairman Bingaman and Ranking Member \nMurkowski. I look forward to working with the Committee's new Chairman, \nthe Senior Senator from Oregon in reporting this bill quickly for the \nfull Senate's consideration.\n  The establishment of the Harriet Tubman Historical Parks has been \nyears in the making and is long overdue. The mission of the National \nPark Service has evolved over time from not only preserving natural \nwonders across the U.S. for recreational purposes but also \ncommemorating unique places of significance to historical events and \nextraordinary Americans that have shaped our nation.\n  The woman, who is known to us as Harriet Tubman, was born in \napproximately 1822 in Dorchester County, MD and given the name \nAraminta, Minty, Ross. She spent nearly 30 years of her life in slavery \non Maryland's Eastern Shore. She worked on a number of different \nplantations on Maryland's Eastern Shore and as a teenager was trained \nto be a seamstress. As an adult she took the first name Harriet, and \nwhen she was 25 years-old married John Tubman.\n  In her late twenties, Harriet Tubman escaped from slavery in 1849. \nShe fled in the dead of night, navigating the maze of tidal streams and \nwetlands that, to this day, comprise the Eastern Shore's landscape. She \ndid so alone, demonstrating courage, strength and fortitude that became \nher hallmarks. Not satisfied with attaining her own freedom, she \nreturned repeatedly for more than 10 years to the places of her \nenslavement in Dorchester and Caroline counties where, under the most \nadverse conditions, she led away many family members and other slaves \nto freedom in the Northeastern United States. She helped develop a \ncomplex network of safe houses and recruited abolitionist sympathizers \nresiding along secret routes connecting the Southern slave states and \nNorthern Free States. No one knows exactly how many people she led to \nfreedom or the number of trips between the North and South she led, but \nthe legend of her work was an inspiration to the multitude of slaves \nseeking freedom and to abolitionists fighting to end slavery. Tubman \nbecame known as ``the Moses of her people'' by African-Americans and \nwhite abolitionists alike. Tubman once proudly told Frederick Douglass \nthat in all of her journeys she ``never lost a single passenger.'' She \nwas so effective that in 1856 there was a $40,000 reward offered for \nher capture in the South. She is the most famous and most important \nconductor of the network of resistance known as the Underground \nRailroad.\n  During the Civil War, Tubman served the Union forces as a spy, a \nscout and a nurse. She served in Virginia, Florida and South Carolina. \nShe is credited with leading slaves from those slave states to freedom \nduring those years as well.\n  Following the Civil War, and the emancipation of all black slaves, \nTubman settled in Auburn, NY. There she was active in the women's \nsuffrage movement, and she also established one of the first \nincorporated African-American homes for aged to care for the elderly. \nIn 1903 she bequeathed the Tubman Home to the African Methodist \nEpiscopal Zion Church in Auburn where it stands to this day. Harriet \nTubman died in Auburn in 1913 and she is buried in the Fort Hill \nCemetery. Fortunately many of the structures and landmarks in New York \nremain intact and in relatively good condition.\n  Only recently has the Park Service begun establishing units dedicated \nto the lives of African-Americans. Places like Booker T. Washington \nNational\n\n[[Page S523]]\n\nMonument on the campus the Tuskegee University in Alabama, the George \nWashington Carver National Monument in Missouri, The Buffalo Soldiers \nat Guadalupe Mountains National Park, the National Historical Trail \ncommemorating the March for Voting Rights from Selma to Montgomery \nAlabama, and most recently the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial on the \nNational Mall are all important monuments and places of historical \nsignificance that help tell the story of the African-American \nexperience.\n  As the National Park Service continues its important work to \nrecognize and preserve African-American history by providing greater \npublic access and information about the places and people that have \nshaped the African-American experience, there are very few units \ndedicated to the lives of African-American women, and there are no \nNational Historical Parks commemorating African-American women.\n  I cannot think of a more fitting hero than Harriet Tubman to be the \nfirst African-American woman to be memorialized with National \nHistorical Parks that tell both her personal story and her lifelong \nfight for justice and freedom starting with her fight against the cruel \ninstitution of slavery and work of the Underground Railroad she led to \nher work in the women's suffrage movement.\n  I hope that my colleagues will support my effort to honor Harriet \nTubman and support passage of my bill to authorize the creation of the \nTubman National Historical Parks in New York and Maryland. These parks \nwill hopefully pave the way for the Park Service to develop more \nNational Historical Park commemorating the lives of many other \nimportant African-American women in our history.\n  The vision for the Tubman National Historical Parks is to preserve \nthe places significant to the life of Harriet Tubman and tell her story \nthrough interpretative activities and continue to discover aspects of \nher life and the experience of passage along the Underground Railroad \nthrough archaeological research and discovery.\n  The buildings and structures in Maryland have mostly disappeared. \nSlaves were forced to live in primitive buildings even though many \nslaves were skilled tradesmen who constructed the substantial homes of \ntheir owners. Not surprisingly, few of the structures associated with \nthe early years of Tubman's life remain standing today. The landscape \nof the Eastern Shore of Maryland, however, is still evocative of the \ntime that Tubman lived there. Farm fields and loblolly pine forests dot \nthe lowland landscape, which is also notable for its extensive network \nof tidal rivers and wetlands that Tubman, and the people she guided to \nfreedom, under the cover of night. In particular, a number of \nproperties including the homestead of Ben Ross, her father, Stewart's \nCanal, where he worked, the Brodess Farm, where she worked as a slave, \nand others are within the master plan boundaries of the Blackwater \nNational Wildlife Refuge.\n  Similarly, Poplar Neck, the plantation from which she escaped to \nfreedom, is still largely intact in Caroline County. The properties in \nTalbot County, immediately across the Choptank River from the \nplantation, are currently protected by various conservation easements. \nWere she alive today, Tubman would recognize much of the landscape that \nshe knew intimately as she secretly led black men, women and children \nto freedom.\n  There has never been any doubt that Tubman led an extraordinary life. \nHer contributions to American history are surpassed by few. Determining \nthe most appropriate way to recognize that life and her contributions, \nhowever, has been exceedingly difficult. The National Park Service \ndetermined that designating a Historical Park that would include two \ngeographically separate units would be an appropriate tribute to the \nlife of this extraordinary American. The New York unit would include \nthe tightly clustered Tubman buildings in the town of Auburn. The \nMaryland portion would include large sections of landscapes that are \nevocative of Tubman's time and are historically relevant.\n  Harriet Tubman was a true American patriot. She was someone for whom \nliberty and freedom were not just concepts but values she fought \ntirelessly for. She lived those principles and so selflessly helped \nhundreds of other people attain freedom. In doing so, she has earned a \nnation's respect and honor.\n  Harriet Tubman is one of many great Americans that we honor and \ncelebrate every February during Black History Month. In schools across \nthe country, American History curriculums teach our children about \nTubman's courage, conviction, her fight for freedom and her \ncontributions to the greatness of our Nation during a contentious time \nin U.S. history. Now it is time to add to Tubman's legacy by preserving \nand commemorating the places evocative of Harriet Tubman's \nextraordinary life.\n  Every year, millions of school children, as well as millions of \nadults, visit our National Historical Parks gain experiences and \nknowledge about our Nation's history that simply cannot be found in \nhistory books or on the Internet. Our Nation's strength and character \ncomes from the actions of the Americans who came before us and the \nsignificant events that shaped our Nation. The National Park Service is \nengaged in the important work of preserving the places where American \nhistory was made and providing a tangible experience for current and \nfuture generations to experience and understand. It is one thing to \nlearn about Harriet Tubman from a book, and it is yet a completely \ndifferent and fulfilling experience to explore, see, listen to and feel \nthe places where she worked as a slave, where she escaped from and \nwhere she lived out her life as a free American.\n  The National Park Service is uniquely suited to honor and preserve \nthese places of historical significance and I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in preserving and growing the legacy of Harriet Tubman by \nestablishing the Harriet Tubman National Historical Parks in her honor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 247\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend Public Law 93-435 with respect to the \nNorthern Mariana Islands, providing parity with Guam, the Virgin \nIslands, and American Samoa; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce, with my \ncolleague Lisa Murkowski, the Ranking Member on the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources, and at the request of the Delegate from the \nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Island, CNMI, Gregorio ``Kilili'' \nSablan, legislation to amend Public Law 93-435, the Territorial \nSubmerged Lands Act. This legislation would convey to the CNMI the same \nrights to offshore waters and submerged lands that were conveyed to the \nterritories of Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa nearly \n40 years ago.\n  This bill is non-controversial. In 2005, it was first introduced by \nthen-Chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Pete \nDomenici. A companion measure was introduced in\n\n[[Page S525]]\n\nthe House of Representatives by then-Congressman Jeff Flake. In the \n111th Congress, this bill passed the House as H.R. 934 on a 416-0 vote, \nand it was reported by the Senate Committee. In the 112th Congress, it \nagain passed the House unanimously, on a 297-0 vote, and a hearing was \nheld in the Senate on its companion measure, S. 590. I sincerely hope \nthat this will be the year this bill is signed into law and the people \nof the CNMI will begin to enjoy the economic benefits that will result \nfrom gaining ownership of the waters and submerged lands adjacent to \ntheir shores, just as those benefits are enjoyed by every other State \nand territory of the Nation.\n  The CNMI faces huge economic challenges that began with the phase-out \nof World Trade Organization garment quotas in 2005 and resulted in the \ndeparture of garment manufacturing. Gaining ownership of the waters and \nsubmerged lands adjacent to the 14 islands of the CNMI would help to \nstimulate the CNMI's struggling economy by allowing the use and \nmanagement of these areas for near-shore infrastructure development, \nthe extraction of minerals, energy development, aquaculture and other \nactivities. Currently, under Federal ownership, there are no such \nactivities in these areas because the Federal Government has no history \nof such near-shore jurisdiction and there is no Federal agency with \nresponsibility for their management.\n  Congress granted the States ownership of the waters and submerged \nlands out to three miles under the Submerged Lands Act of 1953. In \n1974, Congress granted ownership of these areas to the territories. \nHowever, the Covenant which established the political union between the \nU.S. and the CNMI in 1976 was ambiguous on this matter of seaward \nownership. Eventually, in 2005, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \nruled that the submerged lands and waters off the CNMI's coasts fell \nunder Federal ownership. Importantly, the Court also recognized that \nCongress had the power to convey these waters and lands to the CNMI. \nThat is what this legislation would do.\n  The CNMI is the only territory or State that does not have ownership \nof its adjacent waters and lands out to at least 39les. I urge my \ncolleagues to support prompt passage of this bill to correct this \ndisparity and to assist the CNMI in meeting its economic challenges. \nI'm not aware of any policy objections to this bill's enactment.\n  I refer those interested in additional information to Senate Report \n111-197. Included in that report is a CBO estimate stating that \nenactment of H.R. 934, the bill on which the legislation being \nintroduced today is based, would not affect direct spending or \nrevenues.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 256\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AMENDMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The first section and section 2 of Public \n     Law 93-435 (48 U.S.C. 1705, 1706) are amended by inserting \n     ``the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands,'' after \n     ``Guam,'' each place it appears.\n       (b) References to Date of Enactment.--For the purposes of \n     the amendment made by subsection (a), each reference in \n     Public Law 93-435 to the ``date of enactment'' shall be \n     considered to be a reference to the date of the enactment of \n     this section.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 8, 2013.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, 304 \n         Dirksen Senate Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Wyden: One of the legislative issues for this \n     Congress that we discussed at our recent meeting was the \n     conveyance of submerged lands to the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands. I would like to follow up on our \n     discussion by asking you to consider sponsoring the necessary \n     legislation.\n       The Energy and Natural Resources Committee did report out a \n     conveyance bill in the last Congress, H.R. 670 as amended, \n     but time expired before the Senate could act on the measure. \n     With this groundwork in place it would seem that this \n     particular issue could be moved quickly as the 113th Congress \n     gets to work.\n       I am enclosing a draft bill, which reflects the Energy and \n     Natural Resources Committee amendments. I have reached out to \n     Senator Murkowski, as well, asking her to co-sponsor the \n     legislation, as she did with Chairman Bingaman two years ago; \n     and I am hopeful that this bipartisanship can prevail again.\n       In the House I will also be introducing the language \n     recommended by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \n     though the Senate may well be able to act first.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this request. Thank \n     you, too, for having taken the time to meet with me to \n     discuss issues of importance to the Northern Mariana Islands \n     that may come before your Committee in the 113th Congress. I \n     look forward to working with you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                   Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,\n                                               Member of Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of New Mexico:\n  S. 259. A bill to assure equity in contracting between the Federal \nGovernment and small business concerns, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I have reintroduced the \nAssuring Contracting Equity, or ACE Act, with a correction to a \ndrafting error in order to ensure increases in contracting goals for \nservice-disabled veteran owned small businesses and qualified HUBZone \nsmall businesses. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \naddress the issues facing entrepreneurs who do business with the \nFederal Government and hope that we can ensure that more Federal \ndollars are getting out to main street.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Whitehouse, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Menendez, and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 261. A bill to establish and clarify that Congress does not \nauthorize persons convicted of dangerous crimes in foreign courts to \nfreely possess firearms in the United States; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the No \nFirearms for Foreign Felons Act of 2013. This bill would close a \nloophole in current law, by ensuring that people convicted of foreign \nfelonies and crimes involving domestic violence cannot possess \nfirearms. We must close this gap in our laws before it is exploited by \nterrorists, drug gangs, and other dangerous criminals who threaten our \ncommunities.\n  Under current Federal law, people who are convicted in the United \nSates of violent felonies like rape, murder, and terrorism are \nprohibited from possessing firearms. But, shockingly, Federal law does \nnot bar criminals convicted of these same violent crimes in foreign \ncourts from possessing guns. This outrageous loophole for foreign \nconvicts is the result of a 2005 U.S. Supreme Court decision in the \ncase of Small v. United States.\n  In that case, the Court analyzed the 1968 Gun Control Act, which \nstates that anyone who has been convicted of a felony ``in any court'' \ncannot possess firearms. The Court concluded that the phrase only \napplied to American courts, despite the fact that the Gun Control Act \nhad been applied to foreign felonies since 1968, the year it took \neffect.\n  At the time, the Supreme Court was very much aware that its ruling \ncould have serious consequences. As Justice Clarence Thomas noted in \nhis dissent, ``the majority's interpretation permits those convicted \noverseas of murder, rape, assault, kidnapping, terrorism, and other \ndangerous crimes to possess firearms freely in the United States.'' But \nwhatever one may think of the Court's ruling, it is now the law of the \nland.\n  We must make every effort to close this dangerous loophole and the \nbill I am introducing today would do just that.\n  Under this bill, section 921 of Title 18 would be amended to state \nthat ``[the term `any court' includes any Federal, State, or foreign \ncourt.'' Similar changes would be made in other sections of the Gun \nControl Act. Where there are references to ``state offenses'' or \n``offenses under state law,'' the bill would expand these terms to \ninclude convictions of offenses under foreign law.\n  In other words, the bill would make it clear that if someone was \nconvicted in a foreign court of an offense that would have disqualified \nhim from possessing a gun in the U.S., then they will be disqualified \nfrom gun possession under U.S. law. The only exception will be if there \nis reason to think the conviction entered by the foreign jurisdiction \nis somehow invalid.\n\n[[Page S526]]\n\n  Under the bill, a foreign conviction will not constitute a \n``conviction'' under the Gun Control Act, if either: the foreign \nconviction resulted from a denial of fundamental fairness that would \nviolate due process if committed in the United States, or the conduct \non which the foreign conviction was based would be legal if committed \nin the United States.\n  I expect that these circumstances will be fairly rare, but the bill \ndoes take them into account and will provide a complete defense to \nanyone with an invalid foreign conviction. In any event, it is clear \nthat we should not keep in place a dangerous policy which essentially \ntreats every foreign conviction as invalid.\n  Ensuring that foreign convictions count as convictions under U.S. law \nis important for a second reason. When someone with a felony conviction \nis arrested for another crime, the government may charge that person \nwith being a felon in possession of a firearm or may seek a sentence \nenhancement. However, if a foreign conviction is not treated as a \nconviction under our law, then the defendant may receive a \nsignificantly lower sentence than is appropriate given the number of \nconvictions on his record.\n  Particularly in these times, America cannot continue to give foreign-\nconvicted murderers, rapists, and even terrorists the right to buy \nfirearms in the United States.\n  With each passing day, we run a risk that foreign felons are \nexploiting this loophole in our law. This is unacceptable.\n  Criminals convicted in foreign courts should not be able to have guns \nwhen U.S. law forbids those convicted of the same crimes on U.S. soil \nfrom possessing guns. We should not wait for lives to be lost before we \nact to close this loophole.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 262. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide \nequity for tuition and fees for individuals entitled to educational \nassistance under the Post-9/11 Educational Assistance Program of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs who are pursuing programs of education \nat institutions of higher learning, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The original GI Bill proved to be a landmark initiative \nfor our troops and an outstanding investment in the future of our \nnation. The Post 9/11 GI bill, signed into law in 2008, built on the \nsuccess of the original program by providing helpful and hard-earned \neducational and economic benefits for our newest generation of \nveterans.\n  Just as the veterans of WWII were the engine of economic recovery and \nexpansion in the postwar period, the most recent generation of veterans \nwill continue their service to America by reaching their full \neducational and economic potential through the Post 9/11 GI Bill.\n  In January 2011, Congress made further changes to the Post 9/11 GI \nBill which caps the amount of education benefits for veterans enrolled \nin private colleges at $17,500 and limits the education benefit for \nveterans enrolled in public colleges to the amount charged for in-state \ntuition and fees. That seemed reasonable, but what we have learned is \nthat many veterans are not eligible for in-state tuition. And the cost \ndifference between in-state and out-of-state tuition for public \nuniversities can be substantial.\n  Current law unintentionally burdens a significant number of veterans, \nrequiring them to pay thousands of dollars in out of pocket costs for \nnon-resident tuition and fee rates. These costs add up over the course \nof a college career--so much so that veterans often drop out of college \nor transfer to another school, with a significant amount of debt and \nwithout an actual degree. But veterans at private schools have their \ntuition covered up to $18,077.\n  I am introducing the Veterans Equity Act of 2013 to remedy the \ninequality between benefits for those at a private institution and \nthose at a public school charging out-of-state fees. This bill would \nallow veterans who are considered non-residents of the state school \nthey attend to receive up to $18,077 in tuition benefits, the same \nbenefit that would be available to that veteran if attending a private \ninstitution.\n  This legislation is supported by American Council on Education, \nAssociation of State Colleges and Universities, Association of Public \nand Land-Grant Universities, Association of American Universities and \nthe American Association of Community Colleges.\n  I am deeply concerned that some for-profit institutions may be \nabusing G.I. tuition payments by aggressively targeting veterans for \nacademic programs that may not provide value to students, such as \npreparation for future employment. The Veterans Equity Act will help \nmore veterans attend public institutions without significant out of \npocket costs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 262\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Education Equity \n     Act of 2013''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROTECTING EQUITY FOR TUITION AND FEES FOR \n                   INDIVIDUALS ENTITLED TO ASSISTANCE UNDER THE \n                   POST-9/11 EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WHO \n                   ARE PURSUING PROGRAMS OF EDUCATION AT \n                   INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING.\n\n       (a) In General.--Clause (i) of subparagraph (A) of \n     paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of section 3313 of title 38, \n     United States Code, is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(i) In the case of a program of education pursued at a \n     public institution of higher learning, the lesser of--\n\n       ``(I) the actual net cost for tuition and fees assessed by \n     the institution for the program of education after the \n     application of--\n\n       ``(aa) any waiver of, or reduction in, tuition and fees; \n     and\n       ``(bb) any scholarship, or other Federal, State, \n     institutional, or employer-based aid or assistance (other \n     than loans and any funds provided under section 401(b) of the \n     Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a)) that is \n     provided directly to the institution and specifically \n     designated for the sole purpose of defraying tuition and \n     fees; or\n\n       ``(II) the greater of--\n\n       ``(aa) the actual net cost for in-State tuition and fees \n     assessed by the institution for the program of education \n     after the application of--\n       ``(AA) any waiver of, or reduction in, tuition and fees; \n     and\n       ``(BB) any scholarship, or other Federal, State, \n     institutional, or employer-based aid or assistance (other \n     than loans and any funds provided under section 401(b) of the \n     Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a)) that is \n     provided directly to the institution and specifically \n     designated for the sole purpose of defraying tuition and \n     fees; or\n       ``(bb) the amount equal to--\n       ``(AA) for the academic year beginning on August 1, 2011, \n     $17,500; or\n       ``(BB) for any subsequent academic year, the amount in \n     effect for the previous academic year under this subclause, \n     as increased by the percentage increase equal to the most \n     recent percentage increase determined under section 3015(h) \n     of this title.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply with respect to the payment of educational \n     assistance for an academic year beginning on or after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 265. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \ngrants for community-based mental health infrastructure improvement; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce, along with my colleague, \nSenator Stabenow, the Community Based Mental Health Infrastructure \nImprovements Act.\n  According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, a survey \nconducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration in 2011, Rhode Island has the highest rate of serious \nmental illness among adults in the country. According to this survey, \napproximately 7.2 percent of adults aged 18 or older in my state have a \nserious mental illness, above the 4.6 percent national average.\n  While too often the stigma of mental illness prevents individuals \nfrom seeking diagnosis and treatment, thankfully, states like Rhode \nIsland have made strides in meeting this challenge. In Rhode Island, \nmental health parity laws have been on the books since 2001. Similarly, \nRhode Island's Medicaid program, RIteCare, covers mental and behavioral \nhealth care for low-income children and families.\n\n[[Page S527]]\n\n  Those who need this treatment must have access to it. Community \nMental Health Centers play a vital role in helping individuals get the \nmental and behavioral health care that they need to lead healthier, \nmore productive lives. In 2012, Community Mental Health Centers in \nRhode Island treated approximately 45,000 individuals at over 1 million \ndistinct encounters. Next year, the number of individuals treated by \nCommunity Mental Health Centers will likely increase, as over 50,000 \nRhode Islanders gain access to health insurance.\n  As more Americans across the country gain access to health insurance, \nthese centers and other providers will see an increased caseload. Yet, \nmany Community Mental Health Centers are in outdated and outmoded \nfacilities that make if difficult to provide the optimal level of care.\n  The Community Based Mental Health Infrastructure Improvements Act we \nare introducing today would support the necessary updates and \nexpansions of some facilities, and the construction of entirely new \nfacilities in other instances in order to meet the growing demand.\n  I am pleased that this legislation has also been included in a \nbroader bill, the Excellence in Mental Health Act, which I joined \nSenators Stabenow, Blunt, Boxer, Collins, Leahy and Rubio in \nintroducing today, to make other updates to the way Community Mental \nHealth Centers are reimbursed for services. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to address the critical needs of our mental and \nbehavioral health care delivery system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/07/senate-section/article/S527-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 26--RECOGNIZING THAT ACCESS TO HOSPITALS AND OTHER \nHEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FOR PATIENTS IN RURAL AREAS OF THE UNITED STATES \n IS ESSENTIAL TO THE SURVIVAL AND SUCCESS OF COMMUNITIES IN THE UNITED \n                                 STATES\n\n  Mr. MORAN (for himself and Ms. Klobuchar) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions:\n\n                               S. Res. 26\n\n       Whereas access to quality health care services determines \n     whether individuals in the United States can remain in the \n     communities they call home and whether their children will \n     return to those communities to raise families of their own;\n       Whereas more than 60,000,000 individuals in rural areas of \n     the United States rely on rural hospitals and other providers \n     as critical access points to health care;\n       Whereas rural areas of the United States need quality \n     health care services to attract and retain business and \n     industry;\n       Whereas, to ensure that communities in the United States \n     survive and flourish, Congress must address the unique health \n     care needs of individuals in rural areas of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas individuals in rural areas of the United States \n     are, per capita, older, poorer, and sicker than individuals \n     in urban areas of the United States;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, ``rural areas have higher rates of poverty, chronic \n     disease, and uninsurance, and millions of rural Americans \n     have limited access to a primary care provider'';\n       Whereas, according to the Department of Agriculture, \n     individuals in rural areas of the United States have higher \n     rates of age-adjusted mortality, disability, and chronic \n     disease than individuals in urban areas of the United States;\n       Whereas the 20 percent of the population of the United \n     States that lives in rural areas is scattered over 90 percent \n     of the landmass of the United States;\n       Whereas the geography and weather of rural areas of the \n     United States can make accessing health care difficult, and \n     cultural, social, and language barriers compound rural health \n     challenges;\n       Whereas individuals in rural areas of the United States are \n     more likely to be uninsured and more likely to receive \n     coverage through public sources than individuals in urban \n     areas of the United States;\n       Whereas the proportion of uninsured and underinsured \n     individuals is rising faster in rural areas of the United \n     States than in urban areas of the United States;\n       Whereas access to health care continues to be a major \n     challenge in rural areas of the United States, as--\n       (1) 77 percent of the 2,050 rural counties in the United \n     States are designated as primary care Health Professional \n     Shortage Areas (commonly referred to as ``HPSAs'');\n       (2) rural areas of the United States have fewer than half \n     as many primary care physicians per 100,000 people as urban \n     areas of the United States; and\n       (3) more than 50 percent of patients in rural areas of the \n     United States travel at least 20 miles to receive specialty \n     medical care, compared to only 6 percent of patients in urban \n     areas of the United States;\n\n       Whereas, because rural hospitals and other providers face \n     unique challenges in administering care to patients, Congress \n     has traditionally supported those providers by implementing--\n       (1) specific programs to address rural hospital closures \n     that occurred in the 1980s by providing financial support to \n     hospitals that are geographically isolated and in which \n     Medicare patients make up a significant percentage of \n     hospital inpatient days or discharges; and\n       (2) a program established in 1997 to support limited-\n     service hospitals that, being located in rural areas of the \n     United States that cannot support a full-service hospital, \n     are critical access points to health care for rural patients;\n\n       Whereas hospitals in rural areas of the United States \n     achieve high levels of performance, according to standards \n     for quality, patient satisfaction, and operational \n     efficiency, for the types of care most relevant to rural \n     communities;\n       Whereas, in addition to the vital care that rural health \n     care providers provide to patients, rural health care \n     providers are critical to the local economies of their \n     communities and are one of the largest types of employers in \n     rural areas of the United States where, on average, 14 \n     percent of total employment is attributed to the health \n     sector;\n       Whereas a hospital in a rural area of the United States is \n     typically one of the top 2 largest employers in that area;\n       Whereas 1 primary care physician in a rural community \n     annually generates approximately $1,500,000 in total revenue, \n     and 1 general surgeon in a rural community annually generates \n     approximately $2,700,000 in total revenue;\n       Whereas the average Critical Access Hospital, a limited-\n     service rural health care facility, creates 107 jobs and \n     generates $4,800,000 in annual payroll, and the wages, \n     salaries, and benefits provided by a Critical Access Hospital \n     can amount to 20 percent of the output of a rural community's \n     economy;\n       Whereas hospitals in rural communities play a vital role in \n     caring for the residents of those communities and preserving \n     the special way of life that communities in the United States \n     foster; and\n       Whereas the closure of a hospital in a rural community \n     often results in severe economic decline in the community and \n     the departure of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other \n     health providers from the community, and forces patients to \n     travel long distances for care or to delay receiving care, \n     leading to decreased health outcomes, higher costs, and added \n     burden to patients: Now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that access to hospitals and other health \n     care providers for patients in rural areas of the United \n     States is essential to the survival and success of \n     communities in the United States;\n       (2) recognizes that preserving and strengthening access to \n     quality health care in rural areas of the United States is \n     crucial to the success and prosperity of the United States;\n       (3) recognizes that strengthening access to hospitals and \n     other health care providers for patients in rural areas of \n     the United States makes Medicare more cost-effective and \n     improves health outcomes for patients;\n       (4) recognizes that, in addition to the vital care that \n     rural health care providers provide to patients, rural health \n     care providers are integral to the local economies and are \n     one of the largest types of employers in rural areas of the \n     United States;
